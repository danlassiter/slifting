"159224"	"he"	"brags"	" There was Tony Yayo, also toting guns on one cut that starts, Aww, N-, do you know what this is? One shot, one kill. In another cut, he brags, I got N-s in Queens that kill for Pamper money. There was Jermaine Dupri, whose respect for women can be summed up in one cut where the chorus shouts that rap stars have to keep these MF H-s on they knees, and, Hoes love me cause I keep it comin' strong and yo; I'm a pimp with mine every time, I don't give a F who she is. B- you can go. Get another cause they love us N-s in the fast life. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
