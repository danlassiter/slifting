Sadecki was a promising young pitcher the Giants got in 1966 for Orlando Cepeda. As Cepeda led the St. Louis Cardinals to a World Championship in 1967, Sadecki became the focal point of the ire of Giants fans; in five-plus seasons, he was 37-47. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"

DAVID-LETTERMAN LATE SHOW TOP TEN  Signs Something Is Very, Very Wrong at Pepperidge Farm  10. That old guy from the commercials? He licks all of the cookies before packaging them.  9. Only thing they've produced in the last three months is a two-mile-long mint milano.  8. The cookies actually smell like a farm.  7. Whenever you open a bag of cookies, you find an empty fifth of tequila.  6. Openly admit it's not a ``farm'' but an armed compound full of sugar-crazed fanatics.  5. The goldfish crackers taste like goldfish.  4. Keebler elves being held hostage in an abandoned silo at north end of farm.  3. You turn on the Simpson trial and see the Pepperidge Farm guy testifying about DNA.  2. Anatomically correct gingerbread men.  1. Two words: hairy cookies.  BILL'S WORLD  _(Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star)  The Moscow Summit was a ``win-win meeting,'' says Mr. Clinton. Or, perhaps more accurately, ``wind-wind.''  Mr. Clinton says his Moscow summit was ``a success from a security point of view.'' For instance, no airplanes tried to land on his hotel.  The FBI has opened an office in Moscow. The FBI _ you know, the Far-away Bureau of Investigation.  ``The people of the United States, the people of Russia and the people of the world,'' Mr. Clinton says, ``are safer today than they were two years ago.'' To say nothing of older.  Russia has agreed to have formal ties to NATO. Seems odd for a country in which kids ask, ``What did you do in the Warsaw Pact, Daddy?''  ``We addressed key issues of international life,'' Boris Yeltsin said after the Moscow summit. Such as how to understand instruction booklets badly translated from Japanese?  The war in Chechnya ``is an internal matter for Russia,'' says Yeltsin. Which is a pretty good tip-off it isn't.  The GOP budget balancing plans in Congress call for wiping out some departments and agencies. Though so far they're keeping the presidency.  Congress is struggling over how to define a wetland. After weeks and weeks of rain where we live, we're pretty sure our basement would qualify.  Imelda Marcos has been elected to a seat in the House in the Philippines. Bet she was a shoe-in.  One lane of Pennsylvania Avenue closest to the White House now has been closed to traffic. Our guess is this won't hold down on the number of candidates going by drooling.

"25858"	"they"	"fear"	" The Mosawis believe they were targeted by vigilantes _ possibly the husband's coworkers from the construction site, based on the type of bricks that came crashing through the window. Whoever they were, they were as reckless in their rush to judgment as the experts on television. The police, which are still investigating, have made no arrests. But the couple and their 2-year-old daughter have made plans to move out of Oklahoma City. They cannot, however, ``go home,'' as some sneered for Muslims to do in the immediate aftermath of the bombing. They are refugees who suffered persecution in Iraq and fled to the United States in 1992, just after the Gulf War. To return, they fear, would mean death. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

Remember, justice these days is not about evidence or truth or even guilt. It's all about doubt and smoke screens and giving a jury more than it can digest. The more money and celebrity involved, then the easier the doubt. Plus, in Los Angeles, for reasons that have nothing to do with the late Ron Goldman, it seems to be about race rather than murder. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"

LEWIS-COLUMN _ By Anthony Lewis.  SAFIRE-COLUMN _ By William Safire.  INTERNATIONAL (Stories will move with an ``i' category code, unless otherwise indicated.)  NAFTA (Los Angeles) _ From one side of the border, a look at the North American Free Trade Agreement 21 months later and whether it has lived up to its promises. From the experience of one company, where jobs were moved to Mexico but business picked up because costs were reduced, it is clear that free trade involves a push-and-pull dynamic that restructures the economies of the countries involved. By James Sterngold.  YUGOSLAVIA-BOSNIA (Dateline TK) _ An attack by Serbs on a refugee center in Bosnia, near Tuzla, killing 6. But the Bosnian Army also is continuing its attack in northwestern Bosnia as the cease-fire date approaches. By Chris Hedges.  YUGOSLAVIA-CROAT-MUSLIM (Paris) _ The Croat-Muslim alliance has never been very sound, and now the rift is widening. By Roger Cohen.  NATO-CLAES (Brussels) _ Willy Claes, the secretary general of NATO, may go on trial for corruption when he was in the Belgian Government, which is sure to mean his resignation from his NATO post and which is likely to have a major impact on the alliance's plans for working with the former Soviet bloc. By Nathaniel Nash.  NATURAL-SECURITY (Washington) _ With the cold war over, the definition of national security has changed. The State Department now is looking at what used to be considered natural disasters as national security threats. The chief example so far is the water hyacinths choking Lake Victoria which, they fear, would destabilize a number of African nations. Also included are intelligence-gathering on explosions in population growth, rapidly depleted water tables and more. By Stephen Greenhouse.  ISRAEL-PRISONERS (Jerusalem) _ Snags over releasing women prisoners under the Israeli-Palestinian agreement. By Serge Schmemann.  BRITAIN-POLITICS (London) _ A Conservative member of Parliament defects to Labor, a blow to the prime minister and his program. By John Darnton.  RUSSIA-YELTSIN (Moscow) _ Yeltsin has fired his prosecutor-general, who has been an embarrassment by cracking down too hard on the President's critics. By Alessandra Stanley.  WASHINGTON (Will move under `w' category.)  REPUB-CONTENDERS (WAshington) _ An unusual inside look at how the Presidential contenders are conducting focus groups and running phone banks with one goal in mind: looking for ways to topple Dole and fine tune their own messages. Even Dole has concocted a test commercial attacking Dole to see how people in New Hampshire react. Story will be heavy scenes from focus groups; and include our visit a Lugar phone bank in Indianapolis. Also will mention what Clinton camp is doing. By Richard Berke.  FAA-SAFETY (Washington) _ Everyone agrees that the Federal Aviation Administration is in trouble and needs help. There has been a rash of recent failures in the air traffic control system. By Matthew Wald.  REPUB-FINANCE (Washington) _ Just after Republicans won control of the Senate a year ago, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas felt assured that his 16 years in Washington would give him the nod for a seat on the Finance Committee and a solid stage to promote his tax policies and his Presidential ambitions. What he did not count on was his major rival for the Republican Presidential nomination _ Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader _ undermining that plan by persuading more senior members to lock up seats on the committee.  NATIONAL NEWS  (Will move under `a' category.)  POPE-BALTIMORE (Baltimore) _ Pope says goodbye to America after his fourth mass in five days and a stop at a soup kitchen that brings him face to face with the poor he has talked about so often on this trip. By John Kifner.  POPE-SCENE (Baltimore) _ Scene from the only big motorcade of the trip. 900 words  POPE-POLES (Baltimore) _ Poles say goodbye to their pope, probably for last time. By Michael Janofsky.  L.A.-CEMETERIES (Los Angeles) _ Cemeteries here have been digging up and reusing graves. Officials are now investigating, and distraught relatives are wandering grounds looking for bones and headstones. By Seth Mydans.  FLA-MEDICARE (St. Petersburg) _ At the Bond Hotel here, Lewis Osterman, 98, and Blanche M. Connor, 95, live their last years in placid frugality. They share all expenses 50-50, including the monthly $500 rent. They eat in for breakfast, skip lunch and have dinner at a nearby senior citizens center for $1.40 each. At the rate, Mr. Osterman figures, he can make savings last and complement his Social Security check until he is 110. (''I came from a long-life family,'' he noted.) But he said the Republican plan to curb Medicare costs would eventually cost him $600 more a year in higher premiums, forcing him to depend solely on Social Security sooner.  S.C.-NUKE-WASTE (Snelling, S.C.) _ Last month, South Carolina decided to reopen a nuclear waste dump here in Barnwell County, which had been closed for a year. With the decision, utilities, industries and hospitals in 37 states once again have a place to bury their low-level radioactive wastes.

Also included are intelligence-gathering on explosions in population growth, rapidly depleted water tables and more. By Stephen Greenhouse.  WASHINGTON (Will move under 'w' category)  REPUB-CONTENDERS (Washington) _ An unusual inside look at how the Presidential contenders are conducting focus groups and running phone banks with one goal in mind: looking for ways to topple Dole and fine tune their own messages. Even Dole has concocted a test commercial attacking Dole to see how people in New Hampshire react. Story will be heavy scenes from focus groups; and include our visit a Lugar phone bank in Indianapolis. Also will mention what Clinton camp is doing. By Richard Berke.  NATIONAL (These stories will move in ``a'' category code).  POPE-BALTIMORE (Baltimore) _ Pope says goodbye to America after his fourth mass in five days and a stop at a soup kitchen that brings him face to face with the poor he has talked about so often on this trip. By John Kifner.  FLA-MEDICARE (St. Petersburg) _ At the Bond Hotel here, Lewis Osterman, 98, and Blanche M. Connor, 95, live their last years in placid frugality. They share all expenses 50-50, including the monthly $500 rent. They eat in for breakfast, skip lunch and have dinner at a nearby senior citizens center for $1.40 each. At the rate, Mr. Osterman figures, he can make savings last and complement his Social Security check until he is 110. (''I came from a long-life family,'' he noted.) But he said the Republican plan to curb Medicare costs would eventually cost him $600 more a year in higher premiums, forcing him to depend solely on Social Security sooner.  FINANCIAL (Will move under `f' category.)  CELLULOID-RIGHTS (Undated) _ One of the attractive facets of Turner Broadcasting was its claim on the rights to a large section of the MGM library. But plenty of other businesses have been built on acquiring rights to old celluloid images _ and never more so than now, when television, with its 500-channel future, and the new multimedia market both seem to have a voracious appetite for images, any images. A look at this phenomenon, through the market for documentary film.  ITALY-RAID (Rome) _ Investigators raid offices of Italy's largest holding company, Gemina. By John Tagliabue.

CLERKS (Phoenix) To politicians from President Clinton to Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the current, highly publicized crackdown on tobacco sales to kids is the noblest of crusades. But to Phoenix-area minimum-wage clerks who labor on the front lines, it seems more like a witchunt. And when the smoke clears, they fear, they're the ones who'll get burned. By RICHARD CASEY. Story will move in the ``A'' category.  KILLBOOK (Phoenix) You won't find Robert Smith's novel, The Pleasure of the Knife, in your local bookstore, although he's an expert in his field. The Arizona multiple killer's book, which he calls a crime tale ``told by a mad-dog killer,'' is available only in a bizarre catalog of items from some of the nation's most-notorious criminals. By RICHARD RUELAS. Story will move in the ``A'' category.  HOPI (Phoenix) As scientists watch in awe as Comet Hale-Bopp races toward a close encounter with Earth, Robert Morning Sky charts the streaking ball of ice and dust in fear. To Morning Sky, who is both Hopi and Apache, Hale-Bopp may be the legendary ``Yellow Star,'' an ancient sign of the ``end of time.'' Hopi elders have been expecting it for centuries. By BILL DONOVAN. Story will move in the ``A'' category.  GOODY-COL (Undated) _ I've been wondering whether I'd like to be cloned. Sure, there are moral quandries associated with it, but there are some practical uses, as well. By BILL GOODYKOONTZ. Story will move in the ``L'' category.  READINGROOM (undated) - William Boyd has a theory about Hollywood. Actually, he has several. You can find them in the title short story of his new book, The Destiny of Nathalie X. For example: Hollywood operates best when people go beyond the bounds of acceptable behavior. When they ignore moral twinges and betray friendships. The successful people are the ones who find themselves in a moral gray area and move right on into the black. By ANNE STEPHENSON. Story will move in the ``L'' category. (For use by N.Y.

The change in view began with his decision to withdraw from the 1972 Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty, but since Russia seemed to react mildly, so did Europe.

"126914"	"they"	"fear"	" Many UN diplomats believe Bush to be dangerously focused on launching an attack. Even the administration's new draft UN resolution, they fear, is so tough that Iraq was bound to reject it, paving the war toward war. And they worry that the United States has no concern about how that will affect the region or Iraq's future. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"

But when the blood mother all but Dr. Lecters Astrid's next foster mom -- an insecure but well-off and loving actress played by Zellweger -- into desperate acts, the girl finally realizes that Ingrid is more toxic than that flower she so gorgeously resembles.

EU-EXPANSION (Paris) _ Moving one step closer to a sweeping enlargement of the European Union, foreign ministers of the 15-nation union meeting on Monday in Brussels tentatively agreed to May 1, 2004, as the date on which 10 new member states would be admitted. By John Tagliabue.  SCOTLAND-HAGGIS (Edinburgh, Scotland) _ Don't go making any sausage factory jokes around the makers of haggis, the misunderstood delicacy. ``We only hire people who can convince me that they have a real passion for it,'' said Jo Macsween, 34, co-director with her brother James, 30, of the family business, Macsween of Edinburgh, that turns out more than 500 tons of the stuff a year. As emblematic of this dark and rugged land as shortbread, tartan and foul weather, haggis is today more popular than ever. An Edinburgh Journal by Warren Hoge.  FINANCIAL  (Will move in ``f'' news file.)  BRAZIL-PRICES (Sao Paulo, Brazil) _ Prices are a very touchy subject in Brazil. The country was plagued by hyperinflation in the 1980s, then enjoyed eight years of relative stability after adopting a new currency, the real, in 1994. Now, Brazilians are watching nervously as the annual inflation rate creeps back up toward double digits again, in large part because the real has fallen sharply against the dollar this year. Despite repeated public promises from newly elected President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and his aides that the government will honor Brazil's debts and keep a lid on the budget deficit, some economists say they expect his government to emphasize economic growth over fighting inflation. In fact, they fear, the government may be tempted to allow inflation to accelerate as a way of easing the country's fiscal constraints, at least cosmetically. By Tony Smith.  Story has moved.  CULTURE  (Will move in ``e'' news file.)  POETRY-GIFT (Chicago) _ An ailing heiress who tried but failed to have her poems published in a small literary journal has given that journal an astonishing bequest that is likely to be worth more than $100 million. Ruth Lilly, an heir to the Eli Lilly pharmaceutical fortune, submitted several poems to Poetry magazine during the 1970's and was rewarded only with handwritten rejection notes from the editor, Joseph Parisi. Evidently she did not take the rejections personally. Parisi announced her gift at the magazine's 90th-anniversary dinner on Friday. By Steven Kinzer.  Story has moved.

SCI-WILDLIFE-BOTULISM (Undated) _ This fall is turning out to be the deadliest yet for loons, ducks and other birds that encounter a natural outbreak of a rare form of the nerve toxin botulism in Lake Erie. Ward Stone, director of the New York Department of Environmental Conservation Pathology Laboratory in Delmar, N.Y., which studies the dead birds, said that over the last two weeks his staff had picked up more than 5,500 birds along the shores of Lake Erie in western New York.

SCI-STICKY-MITTENS (Undated) _ Ever-determined _ and ignoring a lack of solid evidence in these areas _ you cranked up the Baby Mozart CD while the kid was still in utero, and you've even dangled alphabet flash cards in front of the baby's face, when no one was looking. Hello, Ivy League. It's all over but the waiting. But aren't we forgetting something? You know, the sticky mittens. Psychologists at Duke University say they have discovered that if you slip a pair of Velcro-covered mittens on an infant's hands, and then put some more Velcro on toys, the child can pick up the toys, instead of just batting at them. After a while, the psychologists say, the child begins to explore objects in a more sophisticated manner than do babies who are sticky-mittenless. By Eric Nagourney.

The disappointments and increasing violence of the past year have raised the stakes. Local leaders who joined US troops at the ribbon-cutting several weeks ago have bet their reputations -- and, they fear, their lives -- that this time, the Americans will deliver. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"

"145018"	"they"	"fear"	" The action/horror movie can be exciting, but it's not usually very frightening. Ridley Scott's Alien (1979) gave people nightmares; James Cameron's action-packed sequel, Aliens (1986), did not. Horror is essentially a passive genre: Terrible things happen, and you're powerless to prevent them. And for the audience, the experience of watching the movie is, at its purest, a yielding of rational control, the kind of total surrender that takes will and conscious agency out of the equation. Sober, practical-minded adults on the whole do not enjoy that feeling: It undermines their sense of power over their own lives -- without which, they fear, everything they've built could fall apart, everything they value could be lost. Kids, who have less to lose and fewer illusions about their power in the world, give up control a lot more willingly, even eagerly, and therefore rate going to horror movies only a little below getting drunk and having sex in their hierarchy of desirable activities. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"

"168670"	"I"	"fear"	" Nothing like that good ol' authentic hillbilly sound, even if its makers come from the hills of Bohemia. Druha Trava is a lively gaggle of Czech bluegrass enthusiasts, and the Central European ears they bring to this most American musical genre makes for vigorous and refreshing picking. Though the band has penned a few fine breakdowns of its own, the main approach here is to banjo-up tunes by Western roots superstars as diverse as Johnny Cash and Mark Knopfler, Dylan and Tom Waits. Lead vocalist Robert Krestan -- singing, I fear, phonetically -- often brings a robust, craggy literalness to lyrics of even the tenderest spirituality, and the band tends to wander off the Appalachian Trail into odd Celtic glens. But even if they sound a little odd at times, and some of these covers are just flat wrongheaded from the start (of all the Creedence songs to go bluegrass with, Bad Moon Rising should probably be the last one chosen), the commitment is never less than full-on and the results often exhilarating. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"
