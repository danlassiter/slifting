"140072"	"they"	"engage"	" What matters is how they respond; how they drop out of a system they no longer believe in. By so dropping out, they engage, like Eric Rutterman, indigenous rights activist, does when he leaves the Brazilian jungle. What Rutterman says of the artist's need to be intuitive and decisive stands as a metaphor of engagement -- and protest: The 'object' to be drawn is not an object, in the sense that an artist is able to impose his scrutiny on it. The only way this will work -- the quick study that seems so exactly right, a rendering inexplicably beyond the artist's technical skill -- is if the artist is in conversation with the 'object.' Drawing by dialogue, you might call it. The artist engages the subject of the drawing as his equal and, through some shared faculty, it contributes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
