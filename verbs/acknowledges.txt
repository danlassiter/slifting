"3571"	"she"	"acknowledges"	" But, she acknowledges, the neglect couldn't have occurred without the help of critics and historians who were justifiably eager to celebrate the laudable achievements of the company that was founded during the civil-rights movement. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199408.gz"
"4536"	"she"	"acknowledges"	" The creative process is what she relishes in her work. She is not fond of press interviews, appearing on television shows, frequent trips and the loss of her privacy as a celebrity. She is shy, she acknowledges, and has a phobia about the television camera. ``They tell me to ignore the cameras but I can't ignore them when I have a picture of myself in my face.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199409.gz"
"5574"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" Downey denies that he suffered anything approaching severe depression, saying he was working so hard that if he wasn't on the scene, he was probably somewhere sleeping. Still, he acknowledges, ``I would question the grip on reality of anyone in my position who (italics)wasn't(end italics) depressed at certain points last season.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199409.gz"
"10437"	"she"	"acknowledges"	" It is a hard living, she acknowledges, but it is better than what she left behind. ``I missed it at first,'' Ramirez says of her rural home in the mountains northeast of Mexico City. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"
"11067"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" Gordon has not yet built a prototype of his invention. But in one respect, he acknowledges, the invention would not be as sophisticated as the Jetsons' meal maker or, for that matter, the ``food replicator'' featured in episodes of ``Star Trek: The Next Generation'': an ordinary human would have to measure and add the ingredients before the machine could process them, he said. Nor does the patent cover a conveyor belt or a robot maid. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"

"15663"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" Ramcheran has done well in New York City -- better, he acknowledges, than he might have done in Trinidad. His five children were born and raised there. He has a home in Queens County. And he has worked for the New York City Transit Authority for 12 years. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199502.gz"
"15783"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" In his bully-pulpit column (and now his book), Negroponte hammers away at what he sees as the doltish lack of imagination holding back the digital revolution. His book has, he acknowledges, ``a continual tone of, `Why can't you understand it, dummy? It's so simple and it's staring you in the face and you keep going in the wrong direction.''' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"
"16231"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" Wine makers and their distributors are eager to have their wines included in the Cite promotion, and they are prepared to make whatever price concessions they can to participate. Stillman says that guests who take part in the promotion drink almost a full bottle of wine each and that he only breaks even. But, he acknowledges, the busy, after-8 dining room -- and the publicity -- more than compensate. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"
"17542"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" Overall, he acknowledges, the agency booked $6 million in new business in 1994. Yet that figure has zero to do with royalty income from past contracts, monies from bonus clauses, purchase prices for film properties or many other factors. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"
"18783"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" ``So, it wasn't such a great year,'' says Philip Knight, chief executive of Nike. ``We all know the negatives.'' The company has had its troubles, he acknowledges, and they ``get plenty of ink because they make the most entertaining story.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"

"19848"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" The law student is 26-year-old Brenden P. Leydon, who is in his third year at Rutgers Law School. He says he became interested in public access while working on a New Jersey case for Rutgers' Constitutional Law Clinic. His lawsuit, he acknowledges, is an independent study project. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"21940"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" Meanwhile, these last few weeks make him a little sad, he acknowledges, as he thinks of parting with employees, some of whom have been with him since he opened. He's proud of those he's helped train _ like Paul O'Connell, owner of Providence restaurant, Anthony Ambrose of Ambrosia on Huntington, and Stan Frankenthaler of Salamander _ and of colleagues with whom he's had special relationships. The ``chaos built into restaurants'' is part of a business built on large egos and personalities, something White has been known for. He's always been supportive of others in Boston, although he finds it disappointing that so many young chefs are embracing the Mediterranean juggernaut rather than exploring their native cuisine. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"22769"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" If physical conditions were at first chaotic, so was the teaching. Delgado erred, he acknowledges, by hiring mostly youthful but inexperienced instructors. One of the few veterans, Tim Kaltenecker, who left to become an instructor at a private school, said Delgado made matters worse by attempting to patch together math, science, English and social studies into one interdisciplinary curriculum. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"23836"	"she"	"acknowledges"	" This was no kidnapping, she acknowledges, merely the illusion _ the painful delusion _ of a crime that a voice in her head convinced her she must stop. She realized her error soon enough. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"24515"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" Horace Grant, the man with three NBA championship rings, understands. This seemingly simplest of tasks, he acknowledges, has become the not-so-silent fear of a team that has shown little timidness in making this too-much, too-soon title run. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"25168"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" The interest in the Titanic victims' personal effects is ghoulish, he acknowledges, but they bring the tragedy into fuller focus. There is big magic in this stuff, he says. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"34660"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" ``Northern Exposure'' made Corbin a household name and, he acknowledges, skewed his perspective on the profession. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"36280"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" Shortly after Perl joined the Stanford faculty, he began research that eventually led to the discovery of the tau, a particle that, he acknowledges, has no practical uses but sheds light on the the fundamental nature of matter, energy and the creation of the universe. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"43442"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" On this point Hisey, who will have 24 different accounts after his bonus is invested, agrees. ``I know I've spread my investments over too many funds,'' he said. ``That's one of my New Year resolutions: to consolidate.'' The paperwork, he acknowledges, is becoming a headache. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
"44122"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" Some of those markets, he acknowledges, have burned U.S. investors in recent years. But now, he said, ``virtually every market there presents the opportunity of double-digit earnings growth.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"
"44143"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" Jeffrey Russell, international markets specialist at Smith Barney, is somewhat cool toward Japan but likes the emerging market economies of the Pacific Rim. Some of those markets, he acknowledges, have burned American investors in recent years. But now, he said, ``virtually every market there presents the opportunity of double-digit earnings growth.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"
"48273"	"she"	"acknowledges"	" It was 1991 and by then she had graduated from tiny Concord College in Athens, W.Va, working as a substitute teacher, making short money for long hours. Previously, she was a college basketball star, a shooter, she acknowledges, ``without conscience'' but during those days she also became something more unusual. She became a woman who would punch you in the nose for $300. Not surprisingly, she didn't tell her Mom about it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"
"51251"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" For days Judge Richardson listened to closed-door testimony from Bradley and clinical experts. The judge weighed the 180-degree turn by DMH officials who, he acknowledges, ``obviously stood up and listened when the governor spoke.'' He wondered if this would be the case he always warned his kids might come: the judgment call that backfires and lands you on the evening news. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"
"51819"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" Graves would like to see the house used ultimately as a research and study center for young architects, but, he acknowledges, to endow such a project for the university ``takes a lot of dough.'' He is hoping to generate some through the Michael Graves product empire. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"
"51932"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" But, he acknowledges, there is ``a kind of rhythmic vitality about the music ... that transcends cultural borders.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"
"53486"	"she"	"acknowledges"	" Pignoli's evolution has been a little rocky, she acknowledges, telling of patrons' unwillingness to order three small courses in the Italian way and the misunderstandings about the simplicity of the entrees. The restaurant has begun to establish a core of loyal diners, though, she said, adding, ``I'm really proud of the food at Pignoli.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"
"59475"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" Steve Barclay, executive director of the Arizona Association of Managed Care Plans, says the industry already gets a lot of scrutiny from the insurance and health departments and medical board. Yet, he acknowledges, patients have nowhere to appeal for a ruling medical decisions made by insurers. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"
"63284"	"she"	"acknowledges"	" Her life, she acknowledges, has taken on an unreal tinge. There's way too much going on, way too fast. Not that she would want it any other way. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199606.gz"
"63596"	"she"	"acknowledges"	" ``I feel like if I'm listening to NPR and I'm learning something, I don't feel the day is a total waste,'' says Amy Smith, an on-the-job National Public Radio listener for 10 years. But, she acknowledges, it's not for everyone. ``I've had my co-workers tell me it's incredibly distracting.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"
"69259"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" And if his social life has changed in recent years, so, too, has his approach to politics. He still says he thinks terms like ``New Democrat'' are plain silly. ``Neo, new, old, short,'' he said. ``I find myself getting clammy because I don't know what the hell that means.'' But, he acknowledges, the old ways do not work anymore. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199608.gz"
"70628"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" To Lord each one is an exotic European of serpentine and exquisite sensibility, a condition he seems to find both compelling and something of a liability, except in the case of Giacometti, who is for him (as he was for many other people) a near-saint. Lord writes about Giacometti with unusual sensitivity. His devotion to him, he acknowledges, is barely short of erotic, and even Balthus, who in his personal affairs is otherwise condemned by Lord as a snob, is partly redeemed by the reflected honor of his longtime friendship with the artist. As for Cocteau and Acton, they are viewed with a mix of affection and ruthless insight that is mildly alarming. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"

"73226"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" With all these projects cooking, Pogue is worried less about whether he will succeed than whether he will be able to manage his success. The biggest danger, he acknowledges, is succumbing to the blandishments of Hollywood. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"
"73811"	"she"	"acknowledges"	" Ms. Barrios-Paoli, however, said she has asked her staff to reimagine the entire system, an ambitious goal, she acknowledges, given that most housing commissioners last only two years. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"
"74179"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" That said, drive-by deliveries were rapidly becoming a public relations disaster for HMOs in the Northeast, a mistake that Reinhardt argues was largely driven by their failure to analyze costs and bargain with hospitals for changes in pricing practices. Deliveries themselves are expensive, he acknowledges, but a day for rest in the hospital does not use valuable medical services. ``It's more like a stay in a hotel,'' Reinhardt suggests. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"
"75036"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" His relationship with ``Richard III'' goes back to the first time he played the role, in his 20s. It was, he acknowledges, a more physical performance than the one in the film. ``When I was younger, I was given to contortions of my body. I tried it now, but wound up doing it more like a spider.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"
"75397"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" Moreover, he acknowledges, the loss of deductions and credits would hurt big business more than small business.

"77685"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" Children who do well in school do have slightly higher self-esteem than those who do poorly, he acknowledges, but then they ought to, since doing well in school is rightly something to be proud of. But the difference is so small that artificially boosting self-esteem would have a barely measurable effect on academic achievement _ even assuming ``that self-esteem is the cause, not the effect, contrary to many indications.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"

"112487"	"she"	"acknowledges"	" In light of other, darker, unnamed events in her past, she speculates: ``Maybe it's also an abuse thing. When your boundaries have been violated, you just plain and simple stop seeing the space between people, so people's pain becomes your pain and you have to stop it.''

By Anthony Shadid. 1810 words.  POLAND-CATHOLICS (Krakow, Poland) - In the bad old days, when the Catholic Church in Poland was under constant assault from the Communist regime, the faithful viewed the struggle as a badge of honor and proof of their virtue. Today the Church is finding its honor and virtue challenged as never before. By Brian Whitmore. 1300 words.  ATTACK-PAKISTAN (Lahore, Pakistan) _ Atop a roof in the timeless, throbbing core of this ancient metropolis, Sanaullah Khan surveys a breathtaking panorama that speaks to the history, splendor, chaos, and conflicts of a region long scarred by war and ideology. To the north are the battlements and mosques of mighty Mogul emperors. To the west, a soaring minaret marks the birthplace of Pakistan. To the east, troops crowd the border with archenemy India. And, all around is a jumbled warren of mud and brick whose homes seem closer to the dawn of time than now. By Brian MacQuarrie. 1000 words.  COMMENTARY (k)  JACOBY-COLUMN (Undated) _ How can Colin Powell still imagine that a ``negotiating process'' with Yasser Arafat can ever lead to peace? By Jeff Jacoby.  ENTERTAINMENT/ARTS (e)  MUSIC-OZAWA (Undated) _ The relationship of a music director to an orchestra is like a marriage, Seiji Ozawa has often said. The comparison holds: the partnership of Ozawa and the BSO has weathered honeymoon, quarrels and reconciliation. As the relationship moves into a new key after 29 seasons, Ozawa is a different man and musician because of his association with the BSO, and the BSO is different because of him. By Richard Dyer. 2530 words.  MUSIC-CROW (Undated) - Sheryl Crow had to expel some demons, physical and figurative, in recording ``C'mon, C'mon,'' which hits stores on Tuesday. It was, she acknowledges, a depression from trying to figure out, at age 40, where she fits into today's youth-crazed culture. By Steve Morse. 700 words.  MOVIE-THEBAND (Undated) _ The rerelease of ``Last Waltz,'' once cited as the best concert film of all time, looks like a record of what drove The Band Down. By Geoff Edgers. 1600 words.  STAGE-TOPDOG (New York) - They sit around the living room hurling insults or trying to one-up each other with the perfect bon mot. Those could be the descriptions of any number of sitcoms during the past 50 years. They also apply to three of the most intriguing plays on Broadway _ this year's Pulitzer Prize winner, ``Topdog/Underdog,'' Edward Albee's ``The Goat or Who is Sylvia?,'' and a modern adaptation of Ivan Turgenev's `Fortune's Fool.'' By Ed Siegel. 1620 words.  MOVIE-CANDIDATE (Undated) - It is one of the great performances in American film, a marvel of clenched ferocity and radically impacted love. In ``The Manchurian Candidate,'' Angela Lansbury bestrides the intersection of politics and procreation with authority. But in Robert J. Emery's just-published collection, ``The Directors: Take One,'' an interview with director John Frankenheimer recalls that Frank Sinatra had wanted Lucille Ball for the part. By Mark Feeney. 1410 words.  BOOK-FLANAGAN (Undated) _ Richard Flanagan's ``Gould's Book of Fish'' is a brilliantly conceived, exasperating work, demanding and whimsical and often masquerading, as its chameleon narrator readily admits, as the ``curious product of a particularly deranged mind of long ago.'' By Gail Caldwell. 1090 words.  BOOK-RIGHT (Undated) _ ``Blinded by the Right'' is terrific. It's bitchy. Audacious. Malevolent. An indulging, mesmerizing treat. Is it true? Who knows? By John Aloysius Farrell. 700 words.  BOOK-TIPS (Undated) _ What's hot on the just-published list.  WORKPLACE (f)  WORKING-ROUNDUP (Undated) _ Bits and pieces from the workworld. By Globe staff.  FINANCIAL (f)  LUTZ-GM (New York)_ Robert Lutz, a cigar smoking, martini drinking vegetarian who flies his own fighter jet, has spent a career going his own way. Now, at 70, with a three-year contract and a string of successes at Chrysler behind him, he is facing his most challenging mission yet: reviving the moribund car line at General Motors. By Royal Ford. 1700 words.  OIL-POLITICS (Washington) _ Rising oil prices are pushing wholesale inflation higher and causing consternation at the gas pump. The Bush administration is trying to use the price spike to pressure Senate Democrats to approve drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve. The problem is that there is no quick domestic solution to the oil problem - including ANWR. By Sue Kirchhoff. 1500 words.  ONBUSINESS-COLUMN (Undated) _ As Fleet prepares for its annual meeting, a thought for grumbling shareholders who used to own BankBoston. Consider what would have happened if BankBoston never made the deal with Fleet and remained independent. By Steven Syre.  STEIN-COLUMN (Undated) _ A look back at the 1973 oil embargo. Is history repeating itself? By Charles Stein.  DENISON-COLUMN (Undated) _ On the rising practice of intra-company collaboration. By D.C. Denison.  CONSUMER-COLUMN (Undated) _ Why the Massachusetts high-theft auto list is bogus. By Bruce Mohl.  FINANCE-HOOKER (Undated) _ Financial columnist Kenneth Hooker answers your questions. By Kenneth Hooker.

"112576"	"she"	"acknowledges"	" Crow faced another, more serious obstacle in recording ``C'mon, C'mon,'' which hits stores on Tuesday. It was, she acknowledges, a depression from trying to figure out, at age 40, where she fits into today's youth-crazed culture. Even though she has sold millions of records and been a Grammy darling, she was worried. But her solution is voiced in her new single, ``Soak Up the Sun,'' with its thematic line, ``I'm gonna soak up the sun and I'm gonna tell everyone to lighten up.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"112979"	"he"	"acknowledges"	" ``But one of our complaints to Arab states is that, while restricting films on all kinds of otherwise dubious bases, they have not generally speaking made any objection to films that are racist against Arabs,'' Ibish adds. And that's because, he acknowledges, American films are so gosh-darn entertaining -- but also so resistant to thoughtful consideration that their cultural and racial trespasses simply don't register with besotted viewers anywhere in the world. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
