Now I know that she is a legend, but that does seem strange to me.

Maybe they have a sexy scene and he is going, `I can't remember if there are five condoms in this box or six.

WHAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS IS AN AWARDS SHOW FOR EVERYONE  By BILL TAMMEUS  I flipped on the tube the other night _ having completed all the tasks that required anything of my brain _ and saw several quality seconds of ``The 49th Annual Tony Awards.''  This was a show, I gathered, in which men in tuxedoes and women in formal gowns (or vice versa, depending) gave out awards to guys named Tony, many of whom, apparently, work on Broadway shows I haven't seen.  In fact, the last show I saw on Broadway _ ``Nick and Nora'' _ closed about four days after it opened a few years ago. I didn't think it was all that bad. Oh, it was bad, but not four-day bad. I could have imagined it staying open five or six days. Still, you know how tough the New York crowd can be.  Anyway, as I was watching all these guys named Tony get awards, it occurred to me (I may have led you to believe that I wasn't using my brain while watching, but apparently I lied) that there aren't enough awards shows on TV. Oh, I know you can see an awards show of some kind four out of five nights a week _ or more often if you subscribe to the All Awards Show cable channel.  But too many of these shows feature only celebrities (except for some of the Tony Awards, which, from what I could tell, go to guys named Tony who are Broadway set painters, ticket takers, ushers and such).  There are shows honoring country music singers and daytime soap opera actors and movie actresses and on and on. It used to be just the Academy Awards, but the awards industry has simply boomed in recent years.  And yet I'm forced to ask: Where are the TV awards shows that honor CPAs? Where are the shows that give awards to the best clerks at Wal-Mart? Or to the best church choir singers?  Hey, these are the people who make the world go 'round. But do they ever get ``The 49th Annual Bee Keepers Awards'' show on TV? Do they ever get to rent expensive tuxedoes and fill up the ballroom at the local Motel 6 for taping of ``The 14th Bartenders Awards Extravaganza''?  Well, do they? Not that I ever heard. And I should know. It is, after all, my job to know stupid stuff like this.  Oh, it's not that I know all the extant stupid stuff, but I certainly know a lot of it. For instance, I know that Uriah Phillips Levy once bought Thomas Jefferson's home, Monticello, and willed it to the U.S. Well, wait. That's not stupid, that's just trivial.  Let's see, stupid. Oh, I know. If you spell the name Otto inside out and backwards, it's Toot. I've got a million of them like that.  Anyway, back to the idea of awards show. Isn't that where we were? I hope so. I certainly don't want to have to go all the way back to the top of this column to find out.  I bet there'd be a great audience for awards shows featuring non-celebrities. How can you doubt such an idea in a country that finds an audience for reruns of shows that were putrid the first time around? Why, even a show as mindless and insipid as ``Love Boat'' is on six or eight different cable channels every night of the world.  So I think it's time for shows called ``Cleveland's Top Garbagemen Awards'' and ``Best Potato Growers'' (or, if you're a Republican, ``Best Potatoe Growers''). There's no reason TV can't offer us ``The Second Annual Cabbies Awards Show'' or ``Plumbers Honor Other Plumbers.''  Eventually we'd get what we want _ a show honoring each of us for something. Because, as you know from listening to the experts, the trouble with this country is a lack of self-esteem.  Well, it's either that or too much stupid stuff.  GOOD DAY, WIRE WANDERERS!!!!!

In fact, the last show I saw on Broadway _ ``Nick and Nora'' _ closed about four days after it opened a few years ago. I didn't think it was all that bad. Oh, it was bad, but not four-day bad. I could have imagined it staying open five or six days. Still, you know how tough the New York crowd can be.  Anyway, as I was watching all these guys named Tony get awards, it occurred to me (I may have led you to believe that I wasn't using my brain while watching, but apparently I lied) that there aren't enough awards shows on TV. Oh, I know you can see an awards show of some kind four out of five nights a week _ or more often if you subscribe to the All Awards Show cable channel.  But too many of these shows feature only celebrities (except for some of the Tony Awards, which, from what I could tell, go to guys named Tony who are Broadway set painters, ticket takers, ushers and such).  There are shows honoring country music singers and daytime soap opera actors and movie actresses and on and on. It used to be just the Academy Awards, but the awards industry has simply boomed in recent years.  And yet I'm forced to ask: Where are the TV awards shows that honor CPAs? Where are the shows that give awards to the best clerks at Wal-Mart? Or to the best church choir singers?  Hey, these are the people who make the world go 'round. But do they ever get ``The 49th Annual Bee Keepers Awards'' show on TV? Do they ever get to rent expensive tuxedoes and fill up the ballroom at the local Motel 6 for taping of ``The 14th Bartenders Awards Extravaganza''?  Well, do they? Not that I ever heard. And I should know. It is, after all, my job to know stupid stuff like this.  Oh, it's not that I know all the extant stupid stuff, but I certainly know a lot of it. For instance, I know that Uriah Phillips Levy once bought Thomas Jefferson's home, Monticello, and willed it to the U.S. Well, wait. That's not stupid, that's just trivial.  Let's see, stupid. Oh, I know. If you spell the name Otto inside out and backwards, it's Toot. I've got a million of them like that.  Anyway, back to the idea of awards show. Isn't that where we were? I hope so. I certainly don't want to have to go all the way back to the top of this column to find out.  I bet there'd be a great audience for awards shows featuring non-celebrities. How can you doubt such an idea in a country that finds an audience for reruns of shows that were putrid the first time around? Why, even a show as mindless and insipid as ``Love Boat'' is on six or eight different cable channels every night of the world.  So I think it's time for shows called ``Cleveland's Top Garbagemen Awards'' and ``Best Potato Growers'' (or, if you're a Republican, ``Best Potatoe Growers''). There's no reason TV can't offer us ``The Second Annual Cabbies Awards Show'' or ``Plumbers Honor Other Plumbers.''  Eventually we'd get what we want _ a show honoring each of us for something. Because, as you know from listening to the experts, the trouble with this country is a lack of self-esteem.  Well, it's either that or too much stupid stuff.  GOOD DAY, WIRE WANDERERS!!!!!

WHAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS IS AN AWARDS SHOW FOR EVERYONE  By BILL TAMMEUS  I flipped on the tube the other night _ having completed all the tasks that required anything of my brain _ and saw several quality seconds of ``The 49th Annual Tony Awards.''  This was a show, I gathered, in which men in tuxedoes and women in formal gowns (or vice versa, depending) gave out awards to guys named Tony, many of whom, apparently, work on Broadway shows I haven't seen.

She issued a flier, scoured slides and Polaroids submitted to her, and sent out a few invitations to painters whom, she gathered, once she began to talk to people, she ought to think about including. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
