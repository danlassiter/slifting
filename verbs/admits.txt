Times News Service  GARY HART SENDS UP TRIAL BALLOONS FOR POLITICAL COMEBACK  DENVER (NYT) _ Calculating that voters are suffering from scandal fatigue, Gary Hart Wednesday sent up trial balloons for a political comeback, eight years after allegations of an extra-marital affair plunged him from presidential campaign trail to obscurity.  ``The whole political world has grown up,'' the Colorado Democrat assured The Denver Post of his growing ambitions to run for the United States Senate.  ``Mine was the first, and I think it was probably more reported than any are currently,'' continued Hart, who said he only ``considering'' a bid for the Senate.  After discussing an issues-oriented campaign with Colorado's two state-wide newspapers, the Post and The Rocky Mountain News, Hart declined further interview requests and flew to Europe.  But Colorado Republicans gave no sign Wednesday of giving Hart the high-minded campaign that he yearns for.  MICROSOFT MOGULS ORCHESTRATE BIGGEST LAUNCH OF COMPUTER PRODUCT IN HISTORY  (NYT) With frenzied midnight sales promotions, colored lights on the Empire State Building and $150 million worth of other hype, the moguls of Microsoft orchestrate the biggest launch of a computer product in the industry's history, trying to convince Americans that as of Thursday, they have entered ``The World of Windows 95.''  The scene in many of the nation's computer stores resembles the back-room chaos at the Egghead software store in Manhattan, where the manager clambered down from a 10-foot mountain of Microsoft boxes marked ``Do Not Sell or Display This Product Before Aug. 24 and commented, still breathing hard: ``It is madness. That is the perfect word for it.''  Actually, what it really is, is a new operating system for computers, the software that creates the on-screen look of a computer and the keyboard and mouse steps needed to operate it. But with the vast network of computer users, the introduction of a new system has become a major event, and Microsoft's aggressive marketing has turned it into an extravaganza.  ``There's been nothing like it since New Coke,'' one customer in a Manhattan Staples office supply store says.  GATES ADMITS PIRACY CONCERNS  (NYT) _ Bill Gates, the billionaire chairman of Microsoft, has spent this week on the television talk-show hustings, from ``Larry King Live'' to ``Good Morning America,'' extolling the virtues of his new software product, Windows 95, which goes on sale Thursday.  But last week, beating Gates to market, a software expert of sorts told Dutch television that there was no reason to wait. Interviewed off-camera and dubbed ``Pete the Pirate,'' he claimed he already had 50,000 illicit copies of Windows 95 ready for sale.  Piracy hype, reply executives at the Microsoft Corp., who know something about aggressive marketing themselves. Most likely, Microsoft officials say, the European software pirate has made bootleg copies of a recent test, or beta, version of Windows 95.  Yet David Curtis, a general counsel at Microsoft who heads its worldwide anti-piracy effort, admits that the final version of Windows 95 has already appeared on a couple of computer bulletin boards. And, he admits, it is only a matter of weeks at most before high-quality counterfeit copies of Microsoft's new operating-software software are on the market.  LATEST IN WAVE OF UTILITY TAKEOVERS AND MERGERS  (NYT) _ In the latest of a wave of utility company takeovers and mergers, Public Service Co. of Colorado said Wednesday it will merge with Texas-based Southwestern Public Service Co.  The new company, which will cover one of the biggest geographic areas in the country, will serve about 2.4 million electric and natural gas customers in six states, from Texas to Wyoming. It will have combined annual revenues of about $3 billion and total assets of about $6 billion.  Company spokesmen said the merger, which will result in a reduction of 8 percent of the work force, or as many as 600 jobs, will save approximately $770 million over 10 years.  FEDERAL AGENCY SHUTDOWN ORDERED FOR OCTOBER SHOULD BUDGET TALKS DEADLOCK  WASHINGTON (NYT) _ Raising a warning flag about spending battles when Congress returns next month, the White House said Wednesday that it has ordered Federal agencies to prepare to shut down all but essential operations in October should President Clinton and Republican leaders deadlock over a budget for the next fiscal year.  The White House budget director, Alice M. Rivlin, said in an interview that the prospects for such a deadlock are uncertain, although administration officials ``very much don't want it to happen.'' But she added that Clinton is strongly inclined to veto several of the 13 spending measures now moving through the House and Senate unless Republican leaders make significant changes in them.  Most private experts, and more than a few legislators in both parties, say Congress and the White House will still be bickering over some spending bills when the new fiscal year begins on Oct. 1, and that closings of some federal agencies are quite likely, if not inevitable.  Similar spending fights have forced the shutdown of parts of the government seven times, all in the 1980s and 90s, for periods ranging from a few hours to a weekend. None had any serious effect on federal services.  STILL NO MATCH ON LEG DISCOVERED AT BOMB SITE  OKLAHOMA CITY (NYT) _ The leg clad in a combat boot and found deep in the rubble of the federal building still has not been matched to any victim. The boot is too small to fit a local man who hasn't been seen since the bombing on April 19.  Last weekend, Mrs. Roberta Bennett, 60, said she believed the limb could belong to her son, Sidney McCallum, 29 years old, who fits the general description deduced by the Medical Examiner's office and was dropped off by friends to go the the Social Security office in the Federal building shortly before the explosion that killed 168 people.  But Wednesday, Mrs. Bennett said her son wore a size nine shoe. ``I bought him boots last year,'' she said in an interview at her downtown home. ``They were a size 8. He said he couldn't wear them because they were too small.''  ``The boot we have here is a seven and a half,'' said Ray Blakeney, a spokeksman for the state Medical Examiner's office. ``Certainly someone who wears a size nine would have difficulty wearing a seven and a half.''  The results of DNA tests are still not in, but measurements of the leg bone and mathematical analysis of its proportions, shape, and structural condition, led investigators to say they were 75 percent certain the victim was a male 18 to 30 years old, about five feet, six inches tall, and probably with dark hair. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950823.0469 type=story > <HEADLINE> WEATHER </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-WEATHER-MAP-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"

(Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Let's say you're a single guy at a bar, and you notice a woman sitting by you who just smiled in your direction.  She looks at you again, then lowers her eyes. She smooths her hair, tilts her head slightly, exposing her neck. You're intrigued, but before you find the courage to speak to her, you need to know: Is she flirting with you?  Although it might be easier to identify flirting in, say, a singles' bar, there are consistent and identifiable messages that women send to signal interest in men, according to Dr. Monica Moore, an associate professor in the department of behavioral and social sciences at Webster University in St. Louis.  After spending more than 1,000 hours of observation in singles' bars, shopping malls and libraries, Moore has cataloged 52 behaviors that she defines as flirtatious _ behaviors designed to attract and keep the attention of a potential mate.  Her test? Within 15 seconds of the observed ``signal'' the man responds _ coming closer or touching, for instance _ or the behavior isn't counted.  Although these flirting behaviors are mostly what you might expect _ there's the hair flip, the lip lick, the pout, the coy smile _ Moore's findings seem to contradict some enduring myths about singles and sexual success.  It turns out that attractiveness is not the best predictor for who will be approached _ flirting is.  ``What we found is that a high-signaling but less attractive woman will be far more successful than a low-signaling but very attractive woman,'' Moore says.  And when a man approaches a woman to ask for that first dance, it is not an act of bravery after all, but an action that has been preapproved by the woman.  ``A man rarely approaches a strange woman without receiving some indication beforehand _ almost always a nonverbal cue,'' writes anthropologist David Givens, author of ``Love Signals'' (Crown, 1983) and an upcoming book ``The Nonverbal World of Humans'' due next spring.  In fact, it's estimated that two-thirds of all approaches are initiated by women _ so says independent researcher Tim Perper, author of ``Sex Signals: The Biology of Love'' (ISI Press, 1985).  While Perper's quick to point out that a great many men do not wait for pre-approval (girls, if you're alone in a restaurant or bar, they figure you're fair game), he and Moore concur: Women play a dominant role in courtship.  Since publishing her first study in 1985, then a follow-up predictive study in 1989, Moore has become an unwitting, if circumspect, spokeswoman for flirting strategies.  She gives a reluctant ``Yes'' to hosting singles' seminars and appearing on radio and television programs and fields hundreds of media calls every year. Especially around Valentine's Day.  Moore admits that her basic findings _ that when women primp, parade and smile, men respond _ are not surprising. But if the mechanics of flirting are fairly obvious, why is she swamped every Valentine's Day?  ``There are a lot of things in modern society that make us insecure,'' Moore says. ``It used to be that the boy had to ask the parents' permission to sit on the front porch with the girl. Things were much more regimented. And when we have a lot of options, we feel insecure, even if we know what to do.''  Perper agrees, and he coaches women in singles' groups along these lines.  ``I think that fear blocks this basic pattern of going up and talking to another human being. Women will think `I'm too fat, I'm too old,''' he says.  ``But men are peculiar. They don't think you're too old or fat. They look at you and say, `Oh! Somebody talked to me!' because they're probably just as bored, lonely or scared as you are.  ``The other problem is that men just don't trust these signals. It's starting to be miraculous that people get together at all.''  Trust doesn't seem to be at issue this evening. It's Ladies' Night at Generations nightclub _ a loud, dark bar just outside St. Louis.  Moore, an attractive 40-something blonde, is in her academic element. Sitting unobtrusively at a table away from the bar, she offers further proof of her findings: After spending two or three nights a week in singles' bars for two years, neither she nor her researchers were approached.  ``We weren't signaling,'' she says, ``and we sat in pairs of one man and one woman. Singles don't pay attention to couples.''  To our left, up near the bar, sit two women. Just five minutes ago they sat expressionless, arms crossed, leaning back in their chairs. Now, the redhead is talking to a man, and the transformation is amazing.  ``It's like a light bulb's been switched on,'' Moore says.  The redhead leans forward in her chair, slaps her knee, laughs and tosses her hair, all while keeping her shoulders angled toward the handsome guy standing on the other side of a railing near her table.  If Moore were collecting data tonight, instead of instructing me on the nuances of flirting, she might be speaking into a concealed microphone, recording the movements of this randomly selected woman.  Based on the behaviors of more than 200 such subjects, Moore's catalog documents numerous signals, including hair flips, tosses and nods; smiles, laughs and whispers; ``solitary dances,'' primping and parading.  Not to mention three distinct types of glances (you've probably seen _ or performed _ all of them): the room-encompassing glance, the darting glance and the longer ``gaze fixate'' glance.  Moore and her team of researchers also caught women caressing different portions of their own bodies (leg, arm, torso), pouting, applying lipstick and exhibiting playful behaviors and ``aid solicitations,'' such as holding out a cigarette for a light or waiting for a chair to be pulled out.  ``Are these conscious tricks?'' Perper asks. ``Well, let's just say they're not all planned. A gaze has to be conscious, but there's no simple answer about a lot of these behaviors.''  Spontaneous or preplanned, some of the behaviors in Moore's catalog are not easily recognized as flirting.  Take the ``palming'' gesture the redhead now shows. According to Givens, gestures such as turning one's palm's up and the ``neck presentation'' are the same displays of submission exhibited by other mammals, such as wolves, to demonstrate approachability.  ``If you're at a party, you'll remove your necktie to show the neck dimple,'' Givens says. ``It's a way of making yourself less threatening.''  Submissive displays are so central to our behavior, Givens says, that one of our most common courtship strategies seems to be to regress and behave like children.  ``Think of how a 5-year-old will ask Mom for a piece of candy, with the same head tilt, lifting his shoulders, eyes down,'' Givens says. ``It's a way of showing harmlessness. And (these sorts of displays) are the same with all mammals and primates.''  One surprising aspect of his research, he admits, is that these courting cues appear to be universal for heterosexuals and homosexuals.  ``Even the toughest, most threatening-looking guy in black leather will give very submissive cues to the other guy he's interested in.''  But a neck presentation doesn't necessarily indicate true submission. It's a theatrical display, Moore points out, ``used to control someone else's behavior.''  As for the catalog of flirting behaviors, she cautions against overinterpretation: ``You can never look at one signal and say, `Oh, she's interested in me.' You've got to have a lot of signals across time.''  On the other hand, Perper says, ``I tell men to be more open to the signals women send. When many women do these things, they are not accidental. They express interest!''  For women, knowing about Moore's research could make one terribly self-conscious _ or turn one into a terrific flirt.  Doesn't she think that the universality of these gestures makes women seem predictable?  She glances over at the redhead, who is leaning forward to whisper in the handsome guy's ear.  ``I find flirting very beautiful behavior,'' she says. ``A courting woman laughs more; she smiles more. When a woman (flirts), she throws back her shoulders, puts up her head. All of these behaviors make her look very attractive.''  The redhead eases back into her chair and casually pulls her curly hair above her head, showing her neck. Handsome moves in.  ``If you look at this from an evolutionary perspective,'' Moore says, ``women are going to do what works.''

As the personal-health columnist for The Boston Globe, Betsy Lehman became an expert on how to find top-quality medical care.  So, in the spring of 1994, when she learned she had breast cancer that had started to invade other parts of her body, the 38-year-old mother of two checked out the treatment options at every hospital in Boston, as well as at a few out of town.  Finally, she chose the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, a nationally known center affiliated with Harvard Medical School.  ``Betsy thought (the institute) offered her the best shot at survival,'' recalls Nils Bruzelius, the Globe's health and science editor. Instead, the treatment she received at Dana-Farber killed her.  Lehman was supposed to have been given a high dose of medication over the course of four days, but a doctor apparently miscalculated the dosage for her chemotherapy regimen, mistakenly ordering four times the amount of medication she should have received.  The massive overdose devastated her heart, which failed on Dec. 3, 1994.  That one doctor made such an error is chilling. But what's truly frightening is that about half a dozen doctors and nurses signed off on the drug order without noticing the mistake. HOW COMMON ARE MEDICAL ERRORS?  Lehman's case was not an isolated incident. Although only a few of the most egregious medical mistakes make the news, thousands of errors occur each year.  A 1994 article in the Journal of the American Medical Association estimates that doctor- or hospital-related mistakes could be at least partially responsible for 180,000 deaths annually.  Medical errors are common at all stages of care, from diagnosis to treatment. While some are unavoidable, such as an unexpected allergic reaction to a drug, many errors _ more than two-thirds, according to a 1993 Harvard Medical School study _ are preventable. PROTECTING YOUR HEALTH WHEN YOU'RE IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE  The first step toward reducing your risk is choosing your doctor and hospital wisely. But even if you've found the best caregivers, you can't sit back and assume that your care will be problem-free.  ``Don't be passive,'' cautions Dr. Stephen Brunton, director of family medicine at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center in Long Beach, Calif.  ``No one is more interested in your health than you are.''  For starters, you and your doctor must develop a partnership, Brunton says, and you need to hold up your end of the bargain.  Become familiar with the names of your medications, and be sure your doctor knows all the drugs you're taking _ including any over-the-counter drugs _ whenever she prescribes something new.  ``Ask her if it will interfere with your other medications,'' Brunton advises.  If you think something's really wrong _ for example, if you experience a symptom you've never had before or a pain that doesn't subside or even if you just don't feel like yourself _ demand your doctor's attention.  Too many suffer unnecessary discomfort and sometimes even endanger their health either by not calling their doctor or by ending a phone conversation before their concerns are allayed.  ``Above all else, remember that your best defense against medical errors is your willingness to speak up and ask questions,'' says Jock Hoffman, communications director for the Risk Management Foundation of the Harvard Medical Institutions.  ``Be aggressive about your concerns, but stay reasonable and don't lose your cool.'' TAKING CHARGE IN THE HOSPITAL  While asserting yourself is essential for getting good health care, this can be difficult when you're in the hospital and possibly not thinking as clearly as usual.  Getting involved then is more important than ever, though, because you may be dealing with people _ technicians, rotating staff and temporary help _ who aren't familiar with your case.  Here are the best ways to protect yourself when you're off your feet.  1. Make sure you have a primary-care physician who will coordinate your medical care.  ``If you're not happy with something, he can help change it,'' Brunton says.  2. Prepare a family member or friend to act as your advocate. If no one is available or if you find yourself alone in the emergency room, ask to see the hospital's patient representative, who is there to provide you with support and to facilitate doctor-patient communication.  3. Discuss the details of your medical condition with your advocate ahead of time, so he or she knows which questions to ask and which details to stress _ such as your chronic health problems.  Cerinda Survant, a 37-year-old mother of two in Portland, Ore., credits her husband's knowledge of her medical history with preventing a potentially lethal allergic reaction during the birth of their first child.  Survant, who has a life-threatening allergy to iodine, was in labor when a nurse came in to prepare her for a minor procedure.  ``She was carrying the swab tray,'' Survant recalls. ``David stepped between her and me and asked, `What is on that tray?' The nurse answered `It's a standard iodine swab,' and tried to walk around him.  ``He physically placed himself between us and told her that I was allergic to iodine. The nurse checked the chart and realized the error in time,'' Survant says. PREVENTING MEDICATION MISHAPS _ THE MOST COMMON ERRORS  The most frequent drug error is simply forgetting to give the patient the drugs she needs. Other problems include giving a person the wrong drug or portioning out an incorrect dosage _ which is what happened in Lehman's case.  If you've been getting an injection every four hours, for example, buzz the nurse if your next shot doesn't arrive on schedule. Even more important, keep track of the drugs you're taking, and make sure you're getting the right ones. PREPARING FOR SURGERY _ A STEP-BY-STEP PLAN  If you're scheduling an operation, make it a point to do the following:  1. Meet the surgeon ahead of time and find out how often she's performed the procedure and what the results have been.  Obviously, if you're suffering from a very rare malady, your doctor probably won't have an extensive track record, says Michael Donio, director of projects at the People's Medical Society in Allentown, Pa. But you also don't want to be her first cesarean section ever.  2. Determine what complications can arise and what their symptoms are, Donio says. While you can expect some pain after any type of surgery, you need to know which symptoms may signal a serious postoperative complication.  3. Run through a brief history of your problem with the surgeon before the operation, Donio recommends. Don't assume she's read your entire medical profile.  ``Sometimes doctors just read the top sheet,'' he says.  4. If a staffer brings you food before an operation, don't touch it until you've double-checked with your doctor. Eating could affect your body's reaction to the anesthetic and cause severe problems.  5. To protect yourself from infection, you or your advocate should make sure all your caregivers have washed their hands _ preferably in your room, where you can see them do it _ before touching you, the People's Medical Society says.  And if you're scheduled to be shaved before surgery, think twice: You'll have a 5 to 10 percent higher risk of infection, because bacteria can get into the tiny nicks left in the skin.  Instead, ask about chemical hair removal, which has an infection rate of less than 1 percent.  6. Make sure everyone who's caring for you is clear about the type of surgery you're having.  ``You've got to get the nurses and the surgeon involved to be certain they're all talking about the same thing,'' Donio advises.  In the case of mastectomy, some women will use a felt-tip pen to mark up the breast to be removed and write ``Leave this side alone'' on the other one.  ``There's absolutely nothing wrong with that,'' Donio says. ``After all, it's your body. If a mistake is made, you're the one who's going to pay for it.''  Many people have trouble challenging their physician. But remember, your doctor is providing a service you're paying for. So if you're not satisfied with your care, take your business elsewhere. If you feel your caregivers aren't taking you and your problems seriously, that's when you have to be your own consumer advocate.

By CINDY PEARLMAN World rights except Chicago. (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Tough guys do dance. Just look at Robert Duvall.  It's 3 p.m. on a hot summer day in Chicago's Grant Park, on the set of the upcoming movie ``A Family Thing,'' and during a break in filming Duvall is dancing _ the tango, no less.  It's serious dancing, his thin, muscular body swaying in the overgrown grass despite a brisk 25-mph wind off Lake Michigan. The back that moments ago was hunched over a script is suddenly arrow-straight and infused with a newfound elegance, as Duvall moves to a smoky, exotic Latin beat that no one else can hear.  ``Acting and tango are really the same thing. Both are very personal. Both are quiet and meditative things,'' Duvall says.  He means it. In any hotel in which he stays for any length of time, he has a specially built dance floor installed.  ``I must have a dance floor. I practice two to three hours a day,'' he says. ``Sometimes I bring a girl up and practice a bit. Most of the time I'm by myself.  ``It's a mild obsession,'' he adds with a laugh. ``I never do anything lightly. I nail down everything the way I do my work.''  As for ``A Family Thing,'' which will open April 5, it too qualifies as an obsession.  Duvall plays Earl, an Arkansas man who finds out from his mother on her deathbed that she's not his birth mother. Years ago, his white father had taken advantage of the family's black maid, who later died in childbirth after having Earl.  Earl embarks on a trip to Chicago, where he discovers his half brother, a cop played by James Earl Jones, who is equally shocked by the news.  ``It's a story I've had in my mind for years,'' says Duvall, who is co-producing the film. ``I'm not sure how it happened but this idea just came to me.  ``I come from the South, and the idea came to me that what would happen if a guy who is a bit of a bigoted jerk finds out that he is half black?  ``Here's a guy who believes in separating the races who later finds out his blood represents both groups. His whole concept of blood and family has been turned upside down and he can't deal with it.''  Duvall later adds that he met a man in Washington, D.C., who had a similar experience, learning that he was not only Italian but also half black. The movie is not that man's story, however.  Duvall didn't really research the role of Earl.  ``It really isn't the kind of part where you can hang out with cops or go flying with the astronauts,'' he says. ``This is all about emotion, but emotional scenes have always been very easy for me. I'm not like other actors who get themselves all worked up and walk around like crazy-idiot jerks for weeks on end. I just have a glass of water and say, `Let's go.' The more difficult the task emotionally, the more I feel ready.''  Emotion is Duvall's stock in trade, and it has carried him to memorable roles such as Boo Radley in ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' (1962), a Mafia lawyer in ``The Godfather'' (1972) and ``Godfather Part II'' (1974), a deranged officer in ``Apocalypse Now'' (1979) and a wounded man in ``Tender Mercies (1983), for which he took home an Oscar as Best Actor.  Nor is Duvall slowing down. Recently, he returned from Argentina, where he was filming a biography of Adolf Eichmann called ``Eichmann in My Hands'' for TNT.  ``It's the hardest thing I've ever done,'' Duvall says. ``Playing him was like running a race where you're always thinking that you're not running fast enough. It was as tough as playing Stalin (which he did in the 1992 cable film ``Stalin''). I don't like to just act these guys. I want to touch their souls.''  Still, he says, he'd change only one thing about the ``Eichmann'' project.  ``My one regret is that Madonna was also in Argentina shooting `Evita' and I didn't get to tango with her. I invited her to a party I threw, but she didn't show up,'' Duvall says, frowning.  Dance seems to be a running theme with Duvall. Another upcoming project is ``Phenomenon,'' which stars John Travolta.  ``Naturally John wanted me to show him how to tango and he's a nifty dancer,'' Duvall says.  Did Travolta return the favor?  ``I'm not into that disco stuff,'' Duvall says gruffly.  Soon, the worlds of dance and acting will merge, as Duvall produces a movie about dancing.  ``I'm finally doing my big-screen tango film,'' he says. ``My tango movie connects the New York and Argentina underworld, all seen through the eyes of this dancer. I've been taking private lessons to learn new, very intricate steps.''  It apparently doesn't take two to tango, however.  ``I don't have a female dance partner,'' Duvall says.  His personal life has been a mess since last fall, when the tabloids went into a frenzy reporting that Duvall's wife had left him for the pool man.  Duvall doesn't want to go into the details.  ``I'm not very good with women,'' he says. ``Being a movie star means I can get 'em in there, but I'm not very good at knowing how to make it work with a woman. I've got the lure. I can hook 'em. Then what?  ``I read that one psychiatrist said the female brain is so much different from the male brain. Really, I think it's amazing we can get along. Women are such a mystery to me, but being with them is an interesting journey.  ``I think in my case, because my career is successful, it becomes like another woman. I think there is a resentment factor from women. I'm sorry, but I can't be self-destructive and minimize my career efforts. Now they're coming to fruition more than ever, and I'd be foolish not to capitalize on it.''  Duvall makes no apologies for making his career his first priority. A military brat who grew up all over the country, he remembers his mother as ``an amateur actress. She was very good with accents.''  It was his mother who told him to try acting. ``She would say, `Make a go of it, Son.' So I did. I didn't want to disappoint my mother.''  The young man attended Principia College, a small drama college in Illinois, where he played his first role: ``I was a mime. I played a clown and I sang. I was so nervous I thought I'd pass out.''  Things got better. After graduating and coming to New York, Duvall was spotted onstage by the wife of playwright/screenwriter Horton Foote, who said he would make a perfect Boo Radley in ``To Kill a Mockingbird.''  ``She wanted me and that's why I got it,'' he says of his big film break. ``It was a great part, but afterward Hollywood wanted me to play every nut. See, it never changes. You do something well and you get stuck.''  Since then, he's worked with some of the greatest actors in Hollywood, and had a good time doing it.  ``The first (``Godfather'') was such a good time,'' he recalls. ``Jimmy Caan and fun go hand-in-hand. Brando, Pacino, Jimmy and I had this house in upstate New York where we would hang out on weekends while shooting. We'd invite the movie wives too, but then we'd leave them at the house and disappear. They could never find us.''  Now he's working with Jones, who has made a name for himself on stage and screen alike, as well as providing a resonant voice of authority in television and radio commercials.  ``He's a calming influence on me,'' Duvall says of Jones, who is waiting nearby for the scene to begin. ``And I've never met someone with such dignity and grace.''  But Jones doesn't dance. ``I have two left feet,'' he says.  Duvall's ears prick up.  ``James Earl, c'mere, I'll show you this one little move,'' he says.  Jones sits down, adamant. ``We're not letting a reporter watch this stuff,'' he says with a smile.  Duvall doesn't stop, though, tangoing on in the weeds.  ``It's your own sense of style, your own interpretation,'' he says. ``It's a personal challenge. The tango is like developing a movie.  ``Like a movie, you don't have to be flashy. You just have to be pure and be the best.''  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of a young Princess Diana By MARIAN CHRISTY (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  If there's anyone who knows the real Princess Diana, it's Mary Clarke.  The real Princess of Wales, Clarke says, is the young Diana Spencer as she was before her marriage to Prince Charles catapulted her into the global spotlight. Clarke, Diana's nanny from age 9 to age 11, remains a confidante of the princess.  Her new book, ``Little Girl Lost: The Troubled Childhood of Princess Diana, by the Woman Who Raised Her'' (Birch Lane Press, 1996) is no stab in the back to the princess. In fact, the 46-year-old Clarke wrote it with Diana's permission, agreeing not to say anything that ``diminishes'' the princess.  The result is a book short on scandal but long on insight into the princess' formative years _ some of them intriguing, others routinely domestic.  The Diana the world knows now is not the same one that it first met prior to the ``Wedding of the Century,'' Clarke says during an interview in a Boston hotel suite. Diana has irrevocably changed, almost growing up before the world's fascinated eyes.  The fashion world's favorite cover girl has transformed herself from victim to victor. Despite her disarmingly sweet appearance, Diana has pitted herself against the British monarchy itself, personified by her mother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth.  On the brink of divorce from Prince Charles, Diana has asked for and probably will get an uninterrupted career as a symbol of England, with all expenses paid _ such as the $4,500-a-night Oriental Hotel suite she recently occupied in Hong Kong; a staff to handle her schedule and restrain the ever-intrusive media; continued use of her sumptuous residence in Kensington Palace; a financial settlement hovering grandly between $23 million and $46 million; and a strong hand in the futures of her sons, Prince William and Prince Harry.  In standing up for herself, Diana has emerged as a sort of feminist heroine.  ``Yes,'' Clarke acknowledges in a clipped English accent, ``Di is a feminist. But circumstances have forced Di into the role. In her early years, feminism was the furthest thing from her mind. All Di wanted was to have a devoted husband, a happy family and to do the laundry. But she has come to realize that she has to stand on her own two feet.''  The princess was, she says, ``unwittingly coerced'' into feminism by her marital difficulties. Now she is basking in the glory of her ``liberation.''  ``Di has had to fight to express her own point of view,'' Clarke says. ``I think that she thinks that's what feminism is all about. She is trying to have a voice beyond being a clotheshorse and a figurehead. She is a tigress fighting for her rights. Di wants a defined role in the monarchy.''  Clarke depicts Diana as a woman whose blend of strengths and weaknesses ideally suit her current role.  ``She is not academically clever, '' Clarke says. ``She is an actress who has marketed herself to her subjects. But even as a child she had a warm, caring personality. She always had a dramatic sense. When she came home from school, the rooms lit up with her personality. She was always `Miss Personality.'  ``These characteristics are manifest in Diana, the adult. She has had to use them to hide her private grief and put herself across to the public. She has gotten to the point of being able to get everybody's attention.''  And getting attention is key to the princess's personality, her nanny says.  ``Di once told me that the rate at which her popularity grew amazed her. Now she is addicted to public adulation,'' Clarke says.  Clarke believes that her mania for celebrity serves as a substitute for the attention she was denied as a child, as a wife and now as a woman. It is a way of protecting herself, even from those closest to her.  ``Betrayal is one of Di's primary fears,'' she says. ``She feels she was betrayed by her mother, who abandoned Di's father, the late Earl Spencer, to run off with Peter Shand-Kydd. She felt betrayed by her father when he married Lady Dartmouth _ Barbara Cartland's daughter, Raine, whom she called `Acid Raine.' Di was jealous that some of her father's attention was diverted from her.  ``She was betrayed by Prince Charles, who married her and never gave up his old love. Even James Hewitt, with whom she admitted having an affair, committed treason against her with a tell-all book. Diana has been in a cliffhanger situation and she is finally in a get-even situation.''  Clarke makes no effort to disguise her low regard for Camilla Parker-Bowles, Charles' mistress.  ``At least now Camilla Parker-Bowles is no longer important in Di's life,'' she says. ``In the early years, Camilla eclipsed Di's every thought. This woman gave Di fierce competition.  ``From the onset of the marriage, Charles shared all his thoughts and feelings with Camilla. When Charles discovered that his bride was not an easily manageable girl, he discussed with Camilla the details of his disputes with Diana.  ``Deep down, Di will never get over Camilla. But, ironically, it was Camilla who gave Di the courage to believe that she could succeed on her own.''  This was not exactly an overnight revelation. Diana has revealed that she battled bulimia and cut on her own arms and legs under the stress of her worsening marriage. She reportedly tried colonic irrigation, aromatherapy and forecasts from astrologers. Finally, the princess bonded with therapist Susie Orbach, who helped her put her sense of self-confidence in sharp focus.  According to Clarke, Diana's legendary shyness, typified by her perennial downward glance, may have always been a ploy to mask the fact that she is, by nature, a high-spirited risk-taker.  As a girl, living in Park House, the family residence on the Sandringham estate in the English county of Norfolk, she once locked a nanny _ not Clarke _ in the bathroom, threw another nanny's underwear on the roof in retaliation for being told not to go out in bad weather and, the mischievous piece de resistance, coaxed a Shetland pony not only indoors but up a winding staircase by feeding the animal carrots.  Clarke portrays the princess as a woman who knows what she wants and pursues it even in the face of the looming shadows of Buckingham Palace, the Church of England and Parliament.  ``Di is not revengeful. But she likes to be in charge of her own destiny,'' Clarke says. ``Once she makes up her mind to do something, she doesn't change it. She was always like that. Even as a girl.  ``She makes snap decisions. She is adventuresome. She has never succumbed to rules. When she was pushed on the sidelines of the monarchy, she reacted.  ``Di never wanted a divorce. Di never wanted the separation,'' Clarke continues. ``Charles initiated the separation. Di grieved then. Deep down, she will always grieve. She grieves now.  ``You know, all during the royal marriage, Di's mother, who lives in Scotland, isolated herself. When Di needed help, encouragement and advice, her mother was not there for her. There's never been the closeness that some mothers and daughters have.''  Clarke feels that Diana's rebellion against the dictates of Buckingham Palace is as much a reaction against the intrigues of the palace as against Charles himself.  ``There was a great deal of backstabbing in the palace. It was directed against Diana,'' Clarke says. ``I know, for example, that the last letter I sent her, a letter that said: ``Diana, are you OK?'' never reached her. If it wasn't intercepted, she would have answered.  ``Di doesn't open her letters. There are too many. The letter-openers discard those they think are not worthy of her attention.  ``Di herself felt that she was not getting all her post. This is one of the reasons that there have been enormous changeovers in her staff.''  Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Diana's performance of late has been her ability, at age 34, to make strong demands without coming across as strident or shrewish.  She has always had what observers call the ``common touch,'' the ability to connect with ordinary people everywhere. She has a presence all her own, for which Clarke feels that she herself deserves a modest amount of credit.  ``I spent three years telling Di this: `No one is better than anyone else. Each individual has their own qualities. Even if someone thinks themself better than another, it's only their opinion.'''  If current events are any indication, Diana must have taken the lesson to heart.  (Marian Christy is a Boston-based free-lance writer.)

(Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Let's say you're a single guy at a bar, and you notice a woman sitting by you who just smiled in your direction.  She looks at you again, then lowers her eyes. She smooths her hair, tilts her head slightly, exposing her neck. You're intrigued, but before you find the courage to speak to her, you need to know: Is she flirting with you?  Although it might be easier to identify flirting in, say, a singles' bar, there are consistent and identifiable messages that women send to signal interest in men, according to Dr. Monica Moore, an associate professor in the department of behavioral and social sciences at Webster University in St. Louis.  After spending more than 1,000 hours of observation in singles' bars, shopping malls and libraries, Moore has cataloged 52 behaviors that she defines as flirtatious _ behaviors designed to attract and keep the attention of a potential mate.  Her test? Within 15 seconds of the observed ``signal'' the man responds _ coming closer or touching, for instance _ or the behavior isn't counted.  Although these flirting behaviors are mostly what you might expect _ there's the hair flip, the lip lick, the pout, the coy smile _ Moore's findings seem to contradict some enduring myths about singles and sexual success.  It turns out that attractiveness is not the best predictor for who will be approached _ flirting is.  ``What we found is that a high-signaling but less attractive woman will be far more successful than a low-signaling but very attractive woman,'' Moore says.  And when a man approaches a woman to ask for that first dance, it is not an act of bravery after all, but an action that has been preapproved by the woman.  ``A man rarely approaches a strange woman without receiving some indication beforehand _ almost always a nonverbal cue,'' writes anthropologist David Givens, author of ``Love Signals'' (Crown, 1983) and an upcoming book ``The Nonverbal World of Humans'' due next spring.  In fact, it's estimated that two-thirds of all approaches are initiated by women _ so says independent researcher Tim Perper, author of ``Sex Signals: The Biology of Love'' (ISI Press, 1985).  While Perper's quick to point out that a great many men do not wait for pre-approval (girls, if you're alone in a restaurant or bar, they figure you're fair game), he and Moore concur: Women play a dominant role in courtship.  Since publishing her first study in 1985, then a follow-up predictive study in 1989, Moore has become an unwitting, if circumspect, spokeswoman for flirting strategies.  She gives a reluctant ``Yes'' to hosting singles' seminars and appearing on radio and television programs and fields hundreds of media calls every year. Especially around Valentine's Day.  Moore admits that her basic findings _ that when women primp, parade and smile, men respond _ are not surprising. But if the mechanics of flirting are fairly obvious, why is she swamped every Valentine's Day?  ``There are a lot of things in modern society that make us insecure,'' Moore says. ``It used to be that the boy had to ask the parents' permission to sit on the front porch with the girl. Things were much more regimented. And when we have a lot of options, we feel insecure, even if we know what to do.''  Perper agrees, and he coaches women in singles' groups along these lines.  ``I think that fear blocks this basic pattern of going up and talking to another human being. Women will think `I'm too fat, I'm too old,''' he says.  ``But men are peculiar. They don't think you're too old or fat. They look at you and say, `Oh! Somebody talked to me!' because they're probably just as bored, lonely or scared as you are.  ``The other problem is that men just don't trust these signals. It's starting to be miraculous that people get together at all.''  Trust doesn't seem to be at issue this evening. It's Ladies' Night at Generations nightclub _ a loud, dark bar just outside St. Louis.  Moore, an attractive 40-something blonde, is in her academic element. Sitting unobtrusively at a table away from the bar, she offers further proof of her findings: After spending two or three nights a week in singles' bars for two years, neither she nor her researchers were approached.  ``We weren't signaling,'' she says, ``and we sat in pairs of one man and one woman. Singles don't pay attention to couples.''  To our left, up near the bar, sit two women. Just five minutes ago they sat expressionless, arms crossed, leaning back in their chairs. Now, the redhead is talking to a man, and the transformation is amazing.  ``It's like a light bulb's been switched on,'' Moore says.  The redhead leans forward in her chair, slaps her knee, laughs and tosses her hair, all while keeping her shoulders angled toward the handsome guy standing on the other side of a railing near her table.  If Moore were collecting data tonight, instead of instructing me on the nuances of flirting, she might be speaking into a concealed microphone, recording the movements of this randomly selected woman.  Based on the behaviors of more than 200 such subjects, Moore's catalog documents numerous signals, including hair flips, tosses and nods; smiles, laughs and whispers; ``solitary dances,'' primping and parading.  Not to mention three distinct types of glances (you've probably seen _ or performed _ all of them): the room-encompassing glance, the darting glance and the longer ``gaze fixate'' glance.  Moore and her team of researchers also caught women caressing different portions of their own bodies (leg, arm, torso), pouting, applying lipstick and exhibiting playful behaviors and ``aid solicitations,'' such as holding out a cigarette for a light or waiting for a chair to be pulled out.  ``Are these conscious tricks?'' Perper asks. ``Well, let's just say they're not all planned. A gaze has to be conscious, but there's no simple answer about a lot of these behaviors.''  Spontaneous or preplanned, some of the behaviors in Moore's catalog are not easily recognized as flirting.  Take the ``palming'' gesture the redhead now shows. According to Givens, gestures such as turning one's palm's up and the ``neck presentation'' are the same displays of submission exhibited by other mammals, such as wolves, to demonstrate approachability.  ``If you're at a party, you'll remove your necktie to show the neck dimple,'' Givens says. ``It's a way of making yourself less threatening.''  Submissive displays are so central to our behavior, Givens says, that one of our most common courtship strategies seems to be to regress and behave like children.  ``Think of how a 5-year-old will ask Mom for a piece of candy, with the same head tilt, lifting his shoulders, eyes down,'' Givens says. ``It's a way of showing harmlessness. And (these sorts of displays) are the same with all mammals and primates.''  One surprising aspect of his research, he admits, is that these courting cues appear to be universal for heterosexuals and homosexuals.  ``Even the toughest, most threatening-looking guy in black leather will give very submissive cues to the other guy he's interested in.''  But a neck presentation doesn't necessarily indicate true submission. It's a theatrical display, Moore points out, ``used to control someone else's behavior.''  As for the catalog of flirting behaviors, she cautions against overinterpretation: ``You can never look at one signal and say, `Oh, she's interested in me.' You've got to have a lot of signals across time.''  On the other hand, Perper says, ``I tell men to be more open to the signals women send. When many women do these things, they are not accidental. They express interest!''  For women, knowing about Moore's research could make one terribly self-conscious _ or turn one into a terrific flirt.  Doesn't she think that the universality of these gestures makes women seem predictable?  She glances over at the redhead, who is leaning forward to whisper in the handsome guy's ear.  ``I find flirting very beautiful behavior,'' she says. ``A courting woman laughs more; she smiles more. When a woman (flirts), she throws back her shoulders, puts up her head. All of these behaviors make her look very attractive.''  The redhead eases back into her chair and casually pulls her curly hair above her head, showing her neck. Handsome moves in.  ``If you look at this from an evolutionary perspective,'' Moore says, ``women are going to do what works.''

Times News Service  NEW YORK _ Martin Baron, the research editor and former head of the fact-checking department at The New Yorker, is not perfect at his job, he admits, but 20 of his colleagues and friends tossed him a surprise 60th birthday party Wednesday night anyway.  He almost missed it.  The party, at the Algonquin Hotel, was to start at 6:30. But it became 7:15, then 7:30, and still there was no guest of honor.  Finally, Peter Canby, the head of the fact-checking department, went back to the office, spilled the beans about the surprise party, and pulled Baron away from the office.  What had he been doing?  ``I was fact-checking a piece on the 200th anniversary of the birth of the composer Franz Schubert, which is on Jan. 31,'' he said, inserting facts into the sentences the way most people draw breath.  The party was given by Shirley Hazzard, a novelist, and Anne West, a writer, and guests included Brendan Gill, the writer, and Lee Lorenz, the magazine's cartoon editor.  Baron has been a fact-checker at the magazine for 23 years. ``We have a staff of 16 fact-checkers now,'' he said, ``and when I started, we had seven.''  He concedes that he has made a few mistakes.  One involved a photograph of Maria Callas that accompanied a profile of the soprano. The error was the date of the photo. In the picture, she was a slender, glamorous figure. ``But we dated it to a year when she was not slim,'' Baron said.  Baron said an occupational hazard is that he speaks in fact-jammed sentences. ``I tend to speak to people as if they were readers, and I try to give you as much data as I can,'' he said. If he mentions Bach, he won't just say Bach. ``I'll say J.S. Bach, the 18th-century composer who was born in Germany and was a famous organist.''  Then Baron paused. ``Did I say 18th century? I'd better fact-check it.'' He did. He was right. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19970123.0788 type=story > <HEADLINE> MIR ASTRONAUT RETURNS HOME, FEELS `100 PERCENT BETTER' </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> HOUSTON (BC-ASTRONAUT-HOMECOMING-HNS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

Two of the escapees were serving life sentences for the 1996 murder of a 16-year-old Oklahoma cheerleader. The other two were arrested in November and charged with two counts of capital murder in the deaths of an elderly Montague County couple on whose land they had been living.

Developing. Byline TK.  OFF-BOOKS-ACCOUNTING  UNDATED: The story sounds familiar: A giant Texas corporation keeps billions of dollars from its balance sheet by using off-the-books accounting. But it's not Enron; it's AMR Corp., parent company of American Airlines, the largest employer in North Texas. AMR keeps $7.9 billion in aircraft and building leases off of its books using the accounting technique, according to a Standard &AMP; Poor's credit analyst. American's use of off-balance-sheet accounting is well known in the airline industry and is a far cry from the Enron case, experts say. For decades, hundreds of companies including Electronic Data Systems, Dell Computer and Coca-Cola have used this style of accounting to keep various assets and debts off their balance sheets _ the corporate financial statements used by investors to evaluate companies.

MARKET (New York) _ In the almost two months since Enron made its bankruptcy filing, investors have grown increasingly concerned that some of the same troubling practices that contributed to Enron's failure may have been the norm at many companies across America. Those concerns slammed into the stock market Tuesday, as investors dumped shares of companies with opaque or complex financial statements, those with heavy debt loads or even the whiff of off-balance sheet obligations. The Dow Jones industrial average fell to 9,618.24, a loss of 247.51 points, or 2.5 percent.

But times, it seems, have changed. According to a report in the February issue of Conservation Biology, the cat now faces considerable threats across much of its historic dominion, owing to poaching, habitat loss and competition with humans for prey.  The jaguar once ranged from northern Argentina to the southwestern United States, but since 1900 it has lost more than half of its range. The countries the feline still occupies do not have a coordinated plan for saving it.  ``Biological conservation plans often respect political boundaries more than ecological ones,'' Eric Sanderson and his colleagues at the Wildlife Conservation Society write.  Moreover, they note, ``most countries do not have endangered species legislation of any kind, and if they do, laws are unlikely to be consistent across the 18 nations where the jaguar is currently found.''  Today, the cats are faring best in and around the Amazon Basin. Long-term survival of this wide-ranging species, however, will require that the jaguars receive protection in a variety of habitats.  The authors identified and prioritized 51 jaguar conservation areas in 16 countries, taking into account their size and connectivity, as well as the extent to which jaguar and their prey are hunted.  ``If we are to retain broadly distributed species into the next century,'' the team asserts, ``we need to plan explicitly for their survival across their entire geographic range.''  A NEW WAY TO MAKE BATTERIES LAST LONGER By SARAH GRAHAM  Carbon nanotubes _ tiny tubular structures composed of a single layer of carbon atoms _ could lengthen the life of batteries, according to new research. Findings published in Physical Review Letters suggest that the little tubes can hold twice as much energy as graphite, the form of carbon currently used as an electrode in many rechargeable lithium batteries.  Two reactions that occur at the electrodes of batteries _ reduction and oxidation _ produce a flow of electrons that generate and store energy. To investigate the storage capacity of carbon nanotubes, Otto Zhou and colleagues at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, first created bundles of the single-walled straws. They then shortened the tubes and opened their ends by immersing them in strong acids.  Subsequent tests of their energy-holding potential, conducted using electrochemistry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, revealed an electrical storage capacity approximately double that of graphite.  As with many findings in the nascent field of nanotechnology, commercial devices based on the findings are a long way off.  ``We'll have to work on and overcome other practical issues before we can make real devices,'' Zhou says, ``but we are very optimistic.''  TESTOSTERONE PREVENTS KEY ALZHEIMER'S ABNORMALITY By KATE WONG  New research suggests that testosterone treatment could prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease in aging men and women. According to findings detailed in a report released by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, doses of the hormone, given alone or in combination with estrogen, staved off a key chemical aberration characteristic of the disease in rats.  Women carry a higher risk for Alzheimer's than do men, a difference that scientists have attributed to the decline of estrogen (which is known for its protective effects on the brain) after menopause. As a result, much research has focused on the potential benefits of estrogen in preventing or treating the disease.  Sozos Papasozomenos and Alikunju Shanavas of the University of Texas-Houston decided to study the male hormone testosterone. They focused on a hallmark of the disease in which a brain protein called tau forms snarls of filaments, so-called neurofibrillary tangles, through a chemical reaction known as hyperphosphorylation.  As it turns out, exposing rats to high temperatures triggers this same reaction. But the researchers found that treating the rats with testosterone or a combination of testosterone and estrogen prior to heat exposure prevented the hyperphosphorylation of tau.  Considering that estrogen counteracts some of the effects of testosterone, Papasozomenos and Shanavas note, estrogen alone could prove detrimental rather than protective against Alzheimer's. They assert, however, that their research results indicate that testosterone given alone to aging men or along with estrogen to postmenopausal women would probably aid prevention or treatment of the disease. -0-  For more information on the topics covered in the Scientific American News Service, visit www.sciam.com.

A NEW WAY TO MAKE BATTERIES LAST LONGER By SARAH GRAHAM  Carbon nanotubes _ tiny tubular structures composed of a single layer of carbon atoms _ could lengthen the life of batteries, according to new research. Findings published in Physical Review Letters suggest that the little tubes can hold twice as much energy as graphite, the form of carbon currently used as an electrode in many rechargeable lithium batteries.  Two reactions that occur at the electrodes of batteries _ reduction and oxidation _ produce a flow of electrons that generate and store energy. To investigate the storage capacity of carbon nanotubes, Otto Zhou and colleagues at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, first created bundles of the single-walled straws. They then shortened the tubes and opened their ends by immersing them in strong acids.  Subsequent tests of their energy-holding potential, conducted using electrochemistry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, revealed an electrical storage capacity approximately double that of graphite.  As with many findings in the nascent field of nanotechnology, commercial devices based on the findings are a long way off.  ``We'll have to work on and overcome other practical issues before we can make real devices,'' Zhou says, ``but we are very optimistic.''  TESTOSTERONE PREVENTS KEY ALZHEIMER'S ABNORMALITY By KATE WONG  New research suggests that testosterone treatment could prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease in aging men and women. According to findings detailed in a report released by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, doses of the hormone, given alone or in combination with estrogen, staved off a key chemical aberration characteristic of the disease in rats.  Women carry a higher risk for Alzheimer's than do men, a difference that scientists have attributed to the decline of estrogen (which is known for its protective effects on the brain) after menopause. As a result, much research has focused on the potential benefits of estrogen in preventing or treating the disease.  Sozos Papasozomenos and Alikunju Shanavas of the University of Texas-Houston decided to study the male hormone testosterone. They focused on a hallmark of the disease in which a brain protein called tau forms snarls of filaments, so-called neurofibrillary tangles, through a chemical reaction known as hyperphosphorylation.  As it turns out, exposing rats to high temperatures triggers this same reaction. But the researchers found that treating the rats with testosterone or a combination of testosterone and estrogen prior to heat exposure prevented the hyperphosphorylation of tau.  Considering that estrogen counteracts some of the effects of testosterone, Papasozomenos and Shanavas note, estrogen alone could prove detrimental rather than protective against Alzheimer's. They assert, however, that their research results indicate that testosterone given alone to aging men or along with estrogen to postmenopausal women would probably aid prevention or treatment of the disease. -0-  For more information on the topics covered in the Scientific American News Service, visit www.sciam.com.

Considering Thomas Jefferson, for instance, Ambrose praises his way with the written word but laments the third president's hypocrisy in proclaiming all men equal _ while owning slaves. Ambrose even turns a critical eye on himself; as a college student, he admits, he bought too freely into teachings of professors who ``were not left-wing zealots, but (who) couldn't see much good in the Republican Party.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"

CELEBRITY STORY  EMILY WATSON: STAGE, SCREEN, IN-BETWEEN  EMILY-WATSON-FAIRCHILD _ Emily Watson is no longer playing the victim, and somehow that feels unnatural. In Paul Thomas Anderson's new romantic comedy, ``Punch-Drunk Love,'' Watson is a nice, sensible English girl _ a role that may have been her toughest one yet. This fall, Watson is starring in two plays on the London stage and two big Hollywood films: ``Punch-Drunk Love'' and Brett Rattner's ``Red Dragon,'' a prequel to ``The Silence of the Lambs.'' Both film projects, she admits, are aimed at casting off her screen image as a ``mad, bad European crazy girl who takes her clothes off for the camera.'' By Samantha Conti.

Among this week's headlines: ``UNSEATING RICHARD GEPHARDT,'' ``ARNOLD SCAASI RETROSPECTIVE,'' ``NAOMI CAMPBELL'S REVERSAL OF FORTUNE'' and ``UPSTYLING NURSE'S GARB.''  -----  FASHION/BEAUTY TRENDS  REAL TIME  BC-VH1-AWARDS-FAIRCHILD _ Though guests who packed Radio City Music Hall on Oct. 15 for the VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards had a fine time, for those at home, the live show's high-voltage, high-volume escapades didn't translate. There was too much awkward banter. The fashion shows looked chaotic, and many questions remained. Did Heidi Klum and Tyra Banks really perform a bosom-to-bosom bump? Why couldn't P. Diddy learn to pronounce Ralph's name? (It's LAW-ren, not La-WREN.) What was J.Lo dressed as, a bobby-soxer? And couldn't somebody have booked a cute boy band like The Strokes? WITH PHOTOS.  ON WITH THE SHOW.  RUNWAY-BEAUTY-FAIRCHILD _ No matter what the city, runway beauty seemed to follow distinct trends this season _ here, the key hair and makeup looks from New York, London, Paris and Milan. WITH PHOTOS.  -----  BUSINESS STORY  NEVER TRUST ANYONE OVER 30  BOOMERS-FAIRCHILD _ What are fashion labels loathe to do? Take aim at baby boomers as their primary marketing target, for one thing. Despite the plentiful lip service they've paid to focusing on the affluent boomer _ a consumer now 36- to 57-years-old who spends more on women's apparel than any other age group _ most fashion marketers are persistently targeting a twentysomething or teen customer with both their designs and advertising. In part, that's because the fashion crowd continues to perceive young adults as being more exciting, energetic and sexy, and, as such, offering a more appealing image than the boomers.

"129502"	"he"	"admits"	" As co-star of HBO's ``Six Feet Under,'' the multiple-Emmy-nominated series _ 23 nominations in two seasons _ about a family-run funeral business, the strapping, 6-foot-1-inch former gymnast has come to terms with many things that most men his age don't have to face. Dealing so frequently with death has moved him to all kinds of uncharacteristically dark thoughts and feelings, he admits, all the more so since the second-season finale, which back in June left his character clinging to life after brain surgery. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"129665"	"he"	"admits"	" She liked it, the influential editor, Maria Guarnaschelli, bought it, and that first book, ``Thrill of the Grill,'' became a hit. More followed: ``Big Flavors of the Hot Sun,'' ``How to Cook Meat,'' ``Lettuce in your Kitchen.'' ``They're like children,'' says Schlesinger. The books help the exposure of the restaurant, he admits, especially to a national audience. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"129699"	"he"	"admits"	" She liked it, the influential editor, Maria Guarnaschelli, bought it, and that first book, ``Thrill of the Grill,'' became a hit. More followed: ``Big Flavors of the Hot Sun,'' ``How to Cook Meat,'' ``Lettuce in your Kitchen.'' ``They're like children,'' says Schlesinger. The books help the exposure of the restaurant, he admits, especially to a national audience. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"131007"	"she"	"admits"	" Still, she admits, ``Americans are not very good about following directions.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"131093"	"she"	"admits"	" Still, she admits, ``Americans are not very good about following directions.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"132206"	"he"	"admits"	" Spurrier has changed starting quarterbacks four times, and, he admits, he has relied on the pass too much. The three Redskins quarterbacks have taken 28 sacks, been intercepted 13 times and have not had a 300-yard passing day since the season opener. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"132606"	"he"	"admits"	" Trimm, for example, who is also an artist, almost always takes his sketch pad when he hunts, and sometimes, he admits, he comes back more enthusiastic about the quality of light than about the hunt itself. James, who also hunts with a bow and arrow, exulted recently about a gold-crowned kinglet that perched for a moment on the tip of his bow before flying off into the trees _ a trip that also produced no killing. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"132651"	"he"	"admits"	" It is a difficult and exhausting straddle, he admits, but essential to preserving a relationship that helped produce the modern Saudi nation and, for more than six decades, fed the insatiable American appetite for oil. The rest of the Arab world, he warns, is taking note of the tension between friends. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"132661"	"he"	"admits"	" It is a difficult and exhausting straddle, he admits, but essential to preserving a relationship that helped produce the modern Saudi nation and, for more than six decades, fed the insatiable American appetite for oil. The rest of the Arab world, he warns, is taking note of the tension between friends. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"133264"	"he"	"admits"	" Actually, he admits, he's always had a hankering to direct. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"136535"	"he"	"admits"	" It was a blow, he admits, but Brody has done his best to get over it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136676"	"he"	"admits"	" Novelists like himself, he admits, have also failed out of laziness and self-absorption. ``Writers aren't taken seriously anymore, and a large part of the blame must go to the writers of my generation, most certainly including myself. We haven't written the books that should have been written. We've spent too much time exploring ourselves. We haven't done the imaginative work that could have helped define America, and as a result, our average citizen does not grow in self-understanding. We just expand all over the place, and this spread is about as attractive as collapsed and flabby dough on a stainless steel table.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136954"	"he"	"admits"	" He also had developed a brand. So popular is ``Girls Gone Wild'' that today Francis estimates seven out of 10 of the mainly college-age women his company targets on a shoot _ at frat parties, Mardi Gras, spring break _ say yes. His youngest sister, he admits, did d'cline a request from one of his cam'ramen during a shoot. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"137015"	"he"	"admits"	" It was a blow, he admits, but Brody has done his best to get over it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200302.gz"
"137751"	"he"	"admits"	" --Romney insists ``we are going to maintain our vital services and preserve the core mission of state government, perhaps do even better than that.'' At the same time, he admits, ``you will see some reductions in services. . . . I'm not saying no one will notice.'' Overall, he says, the key is not just cutting but reforming: This is where the battle continues to be waged.'' The ultimate goal is ``to shrink the size of state government.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200306.gz"
"137825"	"he"	"admits"	" And the barbecue in North Carolina or Texas might be good barbecue, he admits, but to Trillin, it isn't real barbecue because it doesn't taste like home. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20030618.0020 type=story > <HEADLINE> JAILBIRD NEWLYWEDS WILL WAIT A LONG TIME FOR HONEYMOON </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 06-18-03 13:34:00EDT (BC-PRISON-WEDDING-HNS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200306.gz"
"137965"	"he"	"admits"	" But, he admits, knocking out Mayorga (35-3-1) was not really an option. The guy has too much chin. On more than one occasion Saturday, Mayorga dropped his gloves in front of Forrest, offering him a number of free shots to the face, without registering a wince. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200307.gz"
"138925"	"she"	"admits"	" And now Otto _ who recently married fellow Aussie actor Peter O'Brien _ must contemplate life, love and career post-``Rings.'' It is, she admits, both daunting and exciting. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200312.gz"
"139489"	"he"	"admits"	" The problem is the testing. Vaughters said UCI, cycling's Swiss-based world governing body, has done more about advancing testing than just about any other sport. However, he admits, there is room for improvement. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"139774"	"she"	"admits"	" This is not anything I ever thought I could do, sitting in that task force, getting up and talking, she said. And it is hard, she admits, to keep talking about issues that remind her of her daughter's death. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"139888"	"he"	"admits"	" Most of the neo-Mods, he admits, are influenced by the Jam, the most popular of the punk-era Mod revivalists. The first time I heard the Jam, I thought they were around at the same time as the Small Faces, McLagan says. Then I looked at the date on the recording and it says '76! They weren't (expletive) Mod, they were punks, part of the reason I had to leave England. Nobody wanted Hammond organ on their records after punk. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"141028"	"he"	"admits"	" As he started to raise money to buy a race car, he began to think of ways to combine racing with motivational speaking. The Follow a Dream foundation was the result. To create the foundation, he admits, I've invested everything I have. I've gone into debt. I've done a lot of things people say you shouldn't do. He is hoping a corporate sponsor will step forward to help fund the speaking program. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"141515"	"she"	"admits"	" Perception is, she admits, a double-edged sword career-wise. On the one hand, Gibson's name still sells tickets. At the same time, there are directors and casting directors out there who, upon hearing her name proposed, reject the possibility outright. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"143780"	"she"	"admits"	" Ask Heidi Kirkland, who loves to cook the potatoes she, husband Tom and their nephew/partner Jason Jonas grow. During harvest time, there aren't enough hours in the day to fit in much cooking, she admits, but ask her about potatoes, and she'll take the time to tell you about her favorite tuber. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"143782"	"she"	"admits"	" Ask Heidi Kirkland, who loves to cook the potatoes she, husband Tom and their nephew/partner Jason Jonas grow. During harvest time, there aren't enough hours in the day to fit in much cooking, she admits, but ask her about potatoes, and she'll take the time to tell you about her favorite tuber. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"143850"	"she"	"admits"	" Plus an English accent. Bening shrugs off that part of the job, saying she learned to do it in acting school at San Francisco's American Conservatory Theater. But pressed, she admits, Yes, it was daunting. Especially at that first reading, when I knew all the British actors would be there. ... Of course, they were completely supportive and fantastic. But I worked very hard at it, worked on it every day. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"144694"	"she"	"admits"	" Alma, Ohio, is closer to Kentucky than to I-70. At the By the Way General Store there, Toni Telschow charges $1.99 plus tax for a dozen night crawlers for live bait but opines about politics for free. Business is bad, she admits, but I'm for Bush all the way. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"145038"	"he"	"admits"	" Over a black screen, a self-professed man of science discusses reincarnation, something he does not believe in. And yet, he admits, were a bird to come to his window and proclaim itself his wife he would have to take it seriously. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"145166"	"she"	"admits"	" SPARK-NOVELS (Civitella della Chiana, Italy) -- Even at the age of 86, with five botched operations on one hip and a successful one on the other, her eyesight troubling her and her hearing no longer perfect, Muriel Spark is still doing what every writer likes to do. Having just published her 23rd novel, The Finishing School (Doubleday), she is working on another. True, she admits, she no longer writes quickly. For instance, she completed her 1961 bestseller, The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, in just six weeks. Now she works for three-hour stretches on just three days a week. And a novel, including research, can take her up to a year. But her new one, she noted with quiet satisfaction, is going very well indeed. By Alan Riding. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"145167"	"she"	"admits"	" SPARK-NOVELS (Civitella della Chiana, Italy) -- Even at the age of 86, with five botched operations on one hip and a successful one on the other, her eyesight troubling her and her hearing no longer perfect, Muriel Spark is still doing what every writer likes to do.

"145584"	"she"	"admits"	" During her four years in law school, Batista worked during the day and attended classes at night. At times she was discouraged and tempted to give up, she admits, but her relatives back in the village were having none of that. They'd say, 'You better get that degree, because we are going to need your services,' she said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"146417"	"she"	"admits"	" But, she admits, the FTC often relies on community-based organizations to report fraud, and it was not until 2003 that the agency began a Spanish-language monitoring campaign. Moreover, immigrants are the least likely to report fraud. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"146451"	"he"	"admits"	" Established jewelry houses have also kept pace with the times, few more so than Bulgari. Its latest necklace design, a tangle of gold chains with semiprecious stones cut in octahedral shapes, seems at once elegant and casual, like fashion itself. Tiffany was one of the first companies to mix pedigree with fashion, beginning with Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso. The chairman, Michael J. Kowalski, says that Tiffany has not lost ground to its newer competitors, though it is a subject, he admits, that he and other store executives have thought a lot about. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"146464"	"he"	"admits"	" That's understandable, according to San Diego offensive tackle Roman Oben. After all, he admits, the Chargers -- who haven't made the playoffs in eight seasons -- haven't exactly forced their way into such conversations. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"146874"	"he"	"admits"	" Brooks himself was contending with the dissolution of his own marriage while making Spanglish, and though he prefers discussing superdads and the dynamic between foreign domestics and their bosses, he admits, It may sound crazy, but I don't think this just occurs with me, but you can look at a movie years later and say, 'Oh, this is what I was doing.' I did so much research on 'Broadcast News,' and then when I saw it a couple of years later, it hit me -- three people miss their last chance at real intimacy. That's intriguing, that's what that was about, that's what happened in the course of the movie, (but while making it) I never had the thought. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20041215.0205 type=story > <HEADLINE> A SILVER-SCREEN 'SIMPSONS'? </HEADLINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"147445"	"he"	"admits"	" It is, he admits, a Catch-22 situation, because our forces need to establish security before they are safe to go out there. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"148041"	"he"	"admits"	" The pay isn't much different at ESPN than it was at UCLA, he admits, so there's no dramatic change in his quality of life. And if he ever wanted to get back into coaching -- which someday is likely -- it's always there, even if he has to give back a large chunk of money back to ESPN if he leaves before his contract is up. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"148415"	"he"	"admits"	" Six years ago Gilley was a 29-year-old actor with the Royal Shakespeare Company on his resume but with a modest career mainly in television, and he was dabbling in producing documentaries. He was not satisfied and he linked his personal quest for self-fulfillment to nothing less than world peace, intending to film every step of the process. His ambition, he admits, was more about filmmaking than peacemaking. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"149527"	"he"	"admits"	" It's like a fraternity party, said Teddy Eynon, 30, a Republican congressional staffer from Cincinnati. A big attraction, he admits, is Southern girls. They're polite, smart, attractive and fun to be with. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"
"150148"	"he"	"admits"	" In a telephone interview, Wheaton said that even though he has mixed feelings about his time on Star Trek, My biggest regret was that because I was a teenager, I wasn't fully able to appreciate it. He recalls being sullen and ridden with angst, and, he admits, a jerk. At the same time, he was upset by the animosity that so many people expressed toward his character. I was really taking it seriously, and personally, he said. And it hurt. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"151930"	"he"	"admits"	" This, he admits, is a big if. The Ifo Institute in Munich, one of the six institutes that lowered the growth forecast, released a separate business survey on Monday showing that April had the third consecutive monthly decline in corporate confidence. Oil prices, economists say, are the main culprit for this, since Germany is one of the world's leading importers. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"156748"	"he"	"admits"	" It isn't the first time Gomes has run into this attitude. He wasn't, he admits, a prospect coming out of high school in Petaluma, Calif. Not only was he undrafted, Gomes was unrecruited. There was not a single scholarship offer waiting for him, so he walked on at Santa Rosa Junior College. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"158061"	"he"	"admits"	" One incentive, he admits, was the apparent attractiveness of an aging American to surprising numbers of young Chinese women. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
"158771"	"he"	"admits"	" Sure, he admits, sometimes the good folks get annoyed at a crowd shouting outside their windows while they're trying to put their kids to bed. But the world won't stop spinning just because a couple of kids lose sleep, he says. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
"159514"	"he"	"admits"	" Not all invisible men are single. Scott Stanley, 36, has been hitched for two years, but he still wants to be looked at. Damn right, said Stanley, a real estate appraiser for the Minneapolis Assessor's Office. I'm married, I'm not dead. His wife, Jaime, isn't crazy about him looking at other women, he admits, but he said he's more than happy to extend the same opportunity to her to check out other men. It's OK to read the menu as long as you eat at home, he said. She knows I'm faithful, not running around. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"159728"	"he"	"admits"	" But, he admits, it was difficult prepping himself for a return after missing so much time with such a serious injury. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"160227"	"she"	"admits"	" The best conversations, she admits, are those going on in the row behind you, where you get to hear everything without having to be involved. Oberle's husband, Paul Cullen, 42, also travels on business. He remembers an older man and younger woman one row back, divulging every aspect of their personal lives and Internet dating experiences. Definitely better than an in-flight film. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"161228"	"he"	"admits"	" Sampson readily admits that the immigrant effect weakens with each successive generation. Like Edwin Sutherland and Thorsten Sellin, Sampson finds that the children of immigrants are more crime-prone than their parents, the third generation more crime-prone still. Why that is, he admits, is really the $64,000 question, that's really at the forefront of the research. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"161411"	"he"	"admits"	" Philipp Oswalt, a 41-year-old architect who helped organize the campaign to save the Palace, has no illusions about its history. He is not blind to the sins of the former East German government. Trying to replicate its original rooms, he admits, would be as false as trying to rebuild the Schloss -- a parody of real history. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"163469"	"he"	"admits"	" Once there, he lived on the Left Bank, where he worked on a novel while witnessing the student uprising of May 1968, undergoing psychoanalysis and even, he admits, smoking marijuana. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"164098"	"she"	"admits"	" Being in the Bay Area has had surprise benefits, too, she says: Fruits and vegetables taste better here. And the uphill trek from her office to her classroom on campus is helping her stay in shape -- a tougher job, she admits, as she approaches age 70. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164332"	"he"	"admits"	" I don't understand, said William Baker, 47. If a man wants to change, why won't society give him a chance to prove he's a changed person? Baker has a lot of record to overcome, he admits, not least his recently ended 15-year stay in the state penitentiary for armed robbery. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164807"	"she"	"admits"	" Now the Queen B is setting aside her knitting needles to take up the hook - even though, she admits, knitters and crocheters are like Sharks and Jets. Of course, crocheting is a relatively young needlecraft - a mere 200 years old, she says. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164900"	"he"	"admits"	" Krieger's grandmother was once a casting director. I can talk to her about indie-film actors that my parents have no idea who I'm talking about, he says. Of his work, he admits, She's pretty critical at the end of the day, she's proud of the work. ... But if I want a pat on the back, I go to my mom. My grandmother can be more brutal. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"165162"	"she"	"admits"	" Al-Janabi, 27, is a television journalist. She is East-meets-West, coming from a religious Shiite family but favoring snug jeans and insisting that women should carry guns -- though, she admits, it makes you feel a little like a boy. A friend in the Interior Ministry showed her how to use her 9-millimeter pistol. She appears quite smooth -- and proud -- loading it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"165219"	"he"	"admits"	" Faulhaber hopes the tickets are worth more unscratched. But, he admits, the whole collection might fetch only $3,000 or $4,000 in an estate sale. On the other hand, he figures he could make upward of $200,000 selling tickets himself. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"167665"	"he"	"admits"	" Still, he admits, he's just warming up to housewives using it when they are talking about remodeling the living room. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"168586"	"he"	"admits"	" After all, he admits, getting letters from people all over the country bragging on how good it was makes me feel pretty good. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"
"169132"	"he"	"admits"	" Joe Callender, 47, a retired New York City corrections officer and a father of four, has had long-term relationships with two women but has never married. One obstacle, he admits, has been his own infidelity. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169656"	"she"	"admits"	" A small amount, she admits, is not going to throw them into obesity. However, she said, many kids are drinking it through the day. Add in other nutritional lapses, like fast food, and you get obesity, she said. The only way that we can handle this is to start going after them one at a time. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169679"	"she"	"admits"	" A small amount, she admits, is not going to throw them into obesity. However, she said, many kids are drinking it through the day.

"169911"	"he"	"admits"	" Ben, a 20-year-old from the South Shore who is a junior at a college in Washington, D.C., started playing poker online two years ago, after watching it on television, and says he has won $20,000. At first, he used play money. Then a friend won real money, and Ben wanted to try. He made $20 his first hand. Now he plays an hour a day and feels it's a hobby he can handle. Still, he admits, there are times when it's hard to walk away from the screen. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"170185"	"he"	"admits"	" No one has come close, he admits, with a slight shake of his head. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"

INTERNATIONAL (i code)  NKOREA-BUSH (Washington) -- President Bush reaffirmed his faith in tough, multinational diplomacy to deal with North Korea and declared that the United States had no intention whatever of invading that country. I believe the commander in chief must try all diplomatic measures, Bush said at an hour-long news conference, during which he also offered a vigorous defense of his administration's handling of Iraq. Early story by David Stout. Later byline to come.  NKOREA-NUKES (Seoul) -- North Korea's No. 2 leader says in an interview that the country might test more nuclear devices if it feels threatened. By Norimitsu Onishi  NKOREA-JAPAN (Tokyo) -- The Japanese government announces new sanctions on the North; also a look at how Japan's new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is handling the crisis created by North Korea's claimed nuclear test. So far he appears to be getting high marks with the Japanese. By Martin Fackler.  NKOREA-U.N. (United Nations) -- Developments at the U.N. Security Council on the North Korea issue. By Warren Hoge.  IRAQ (Baghdad) -- A reported mortar attack set off fire and explosions in a ammunition depot on an American military base, seriously disrupting military operations. In other developments, Parliament approves a law that sets out the mechanics of forming federal regions, an issue Sunni minority leaders fear might tear the country apart in sectarian civil war. By Kirk Semple.  BRAZIL-CRASH (Rio de Janeiro) -- Developments in the Brazilian government investigation of the Boeing/Embraer collision a few weeks ago. By Paulo Prada.  NATIONAL GENERAL (a code)  CONGRESS-ELECT (Columbus, Ohio) -- Deborah Pryce has represented her sociologically diverse district in Ohio for 14 years. She is a conservative Republican, and a member of the House Republican leadership. She is also a friend of Mark Foley. Pryce always thought she'd have a fairly difficult reelection battle in a state that has been swept by Republican corruption scandals. But since Foley quit, Pryce said in an interview during a tense day of campaigning, her support has cratered under the assault of attacks on her connection with Foley. This contest has emerged as a case-study in how the Foley scandal back in Washington is causing problems for Republicans in key races across the country. By Adam Nagourney.  DEMS-CAUCUS (Las Vegas) -- Dina who? The Democratic candidate for governor of Nevada is not the subject of conversation around many dinner tables in America. But her name -- Dina Titus -- is tattooed on the brain of just about every Democrat who wants to be president because of Nevada's new position in the 2008 election calendar. Since the Democrats moved the caucus here smack between the Iowa and New Hampshire contests, Titus has worked the fundraiser circuit in Nevada with Mark Warner, the former Virginia governor, and Bill Richardson, the New Mexico governor, and says Senators Russ Feingold, John Kerry and Tom Vilsack are on their way. The decision to move the Nevada caucus, announced in July, has infuriated Democratic officials from Iowa and New Hampshire, long accustomed to being the electoral prom queens of the primary season, who have been openly snarking about Nevada's historically low turnout in primary contests and questioning the state's ability to pull off the complex and tangled process of a high-profile caucus. By Jennifer Steinhauer.  MAMMAL-EXTINCT (Undated -- Wobbles in the earth's orbit produce global cooling that may be responsible for the puzzling regularity with which mammalian species go extinct, Dutch paleontologists say, based on a survey of 22 million years' worth of fossil data. By John Noble Wilford.  CHEMO-CONSEQUENCES (Undated) -- Survivors of childhood cancer have a high rate of illness owing to chronic health conditions, a new study finds. By Denise Grady.  DEMENTIA-DRUGS (Undated) -- Anti-psychotic drugs, widely prescribed for Alzheimer's patients, do nothing more than sedate them, a new study finds. By Benedict Carey.  WASHINGTON (w code)  SCOTUS (Washington) -- Supreme Court hears arguments in two cases; one on whether it violated a murder defendant's rights for relatives of his victim to appear in the courtroom during the trial wearing buttons with the victim's picture; the second on the constitutionality of California's criminal sentencing statute. By Linda Greenhouse.  BUSH (Washington) -- Domestic developments from President Bush's news conference. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Jim Rutenberg.  FINANCIAL (f code)  MCAFEE-OPTIONS (Undated) -- McAfee, the maker of security software, said its chairman and chief executive, George Samenuk, and its president, Kevin Weiss, were leaving after the company found accounting discrepancies in its stock options grants. By Laurie J. Flynn.  GOOGLE-YOUTUBE (Undated) -- More on the origins of the Google-YouTube deal. By Miguel Helft.  DYLAN-ADS (Undated) -- Bob Dylan has always been famously anti-commercial and anti-establishment, but in late August, he appeared -- without a hint of embarrassment -- strumming his guitar in a commercial for iTunes and iPod, both owned by Apple Computer Inc. Clearly, Dylan does not suffer from lack of name recognition, and he likely does not need the extra income from the ad. Instead, his spot for Apple demonstrates an increasingly common type of partnership between consumer product companies and A-List celebrities who view celebrity commercials as mutually beneficial. By Louise Story.  CIRCUITS-COLUMN (Undated) -- State of the Art: Sony reader. By David Pogue.  BASICS-HOME-HARDWARE (Undated) -- Inexpensive hardware that allows home automation and/or remote control of lights and other systems. By Peter Wayner.

MICROSOFT-VIDEOGAMES (Undated) -- Microsoft announces initiative to educate parents on video game content. By Matt Richtel.
