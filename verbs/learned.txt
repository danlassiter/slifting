TORCH GRAPHIC with information about the torch.  OLY-RELAY _ undated _ Payne will accept Olympic flame in a ceremony today in Greece. (s)  OLY-LOGIC _ undated _ It will take an army to bring the Olympic flame to Atlanta during the 84-day Torch Relay, and a platoon working behind the scenes to take care of the 120 staff and volunteers and 30 vehicles. (s)  OLY-TORCH _ ATLANTA _ When planning for the Olympic Torch Relay began three years ago, ACOG officials had few firm ideas. That is, beyond the particularly American impulse to make it the biggest ever. (s)  OLY-SECURITY _ ATLANTA _ Security for the Olympic Torch Relay is not so much a matter of protecting the flame from the hundreds of thousands of people who want to get close to it as it is protecting overeager spectators from the flame. (s)  OLY-CEREMONY _ ATHENS, Greece _ Atlanta's Olympic flame burned vibrantly in an unattended black caldron in the center of the marble Panathenaic Stadium here Thursday. Tourists walked up and snapped pictures, nearly close enough to feel the heat from the dancing fire.

(s)  OLY-HUMMER-COLUMN _ undated _ In the series of challenges that is Lenny Wilkens' life, this one was to be among the thorniest: how to steer the ever-retrenching Hawks through another NBA season while also preparing to coach the various corporate shills of Dream Team III? On one hand, the Hawks, a team in need of constant nurturing just to produce the least little amount of growth. On the other, a collection of talent so overwhelming that it could win the '96 Olympic gold over the phone. (s)  OLY-DISABLED-ART _ ATLANTA _ Wolf Creek gets run-through as site for paralympics events.

(s)  OLY-JAKE-ART _ MARIETTA, Ga. _ Bryan Jacob looks for mental edge on eve of crucial American trials. (s)  OLY-SCHERR _ COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. _ This is not the office of your typical aspiring Olympian. It's one of those corner deals, the territory of a power broker. Most phone calls don't get through without passing a gauntlet of screeners. The decor includes two signed pictures of Ronald Reagan.

(a)  CHAMPION _ HARTFORD, Tenn. _ Champion International Corp. will showcase Saturday the U.S. Canoe and Kayak Team and the company's efforts to clean up the Pigeon River, a stream polluted by its paper mill for almost 90 years.  But the river still runs dark and, at times, smelly, contend the Cocke County, Tenn., residents who for the past decade have pressured Champion to clean up the waste water it dumps 40 miles upstream in Canton, N.C. To them, Champion's sponsorship of the Champion International Whitewater Series as well as the canoe and kayak team, is just an effort to ``greenwash'' the image of the corporate giant. (a)  Business  FORD-RECALL _ ATLANTA _ During a quiet evening of television watching last fall, just a few days after taking comfort in the fact that they didn't have a car payment to worry about, Ted and Carolyn Reagan heard what they thought was a very big car door slamming.

Luckily, I phoned to place the order; the owner, Craig Weil, told me that the bracelet-necklace combo sets (``three-pack glowsticks'') were out of stock. But after he checked with his supplier, then called me back to say he could get them in time, I placed an order for six boxes of 24 three-packs at $15 a box and four dozen pairs of glowing earrings at $7.20 per dozen. And to meet the site's $75-per-order minimum, I asked him to throw in some eerie glow-in-the-dark mouthpieces in assorted colors ($7.80 per dozen) that should be a real treat to see in action. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"

The Owens-Thomas House is one of the prettiest, a honey-colored Regency mansion on Oglethorpe Square built in 1819 for a wealthy cotton merchant, Richard Richardson, and his wife, Frances Bolton. Our well-informed guide led us briskly through, pointing out this classical detail and that innovation. Symmetry, we learned, is a hallmark of the Regency era. In its service, the architect had included three false doors to counterbalance functional doors in corresponding locations.

Priceline, in fact, has turned back into a hot company, after a year as an Internet laughing stock. (The name-your-own-price system, it learned, is not so suited to some categories _ like telephone calls and toilet paper.) Of course, the other companies that aspire to be major players in the growing and profitable online travel market _ Cendant and Sabre Holdings _ could also bid for Priceline. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"

DEMS-KERRY (Norfolk, Va.) -- Unwilling to cede to the White House the responsibility for reshaping the nation's intelligence apparatus, Sen. John Kerry on Tuesday called for an 18-month extension of the commission investigating the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to monitor implementation of the recommendations it released last week. Backpedaling and going slow is something that America can't afford, Kerry declared in a pointed critique of President Bush's response to the report, addressing a flag-waving rally at a military base as part of his trip into the Democratic convention. Leadership requires that we act now -- not talk, not vague promises, not excuses, he added. By Jodi Wilgoren and David D. Kirkpatrick.  Editors, this story will include spot elements in the previously budgeted CHENEY, which is now scratched.  DEMS-RDP (Boston) -- A ledeall on the second day: Viewers of the Democratic convention Tuesday night will get a chance to check out two relative unknowns who have potentially big futures.

DEMS-FOREIGN-POLICY (Boston) -- Foreign policy, a virtual non-issue in the 2000 election, has become a big one, no longer a remote subject for post-Cold-War pontification but a matter of life and death. Sen. John Kerry has responded by trying to position the Democrats as no less resolute than the Republicans but smarter, saner and more solid. A news analysis by Roger Cohen.  CHINA-CITIES (Dongguan, China) -- On the proliferation of Chinese mega-cities whose extraordinary growth reflects both China's boom and its challenge. China's rapid urbanization is helping to lift hundreds of millions of rural Chinese out of poverty. But at the same time, these new second-tier cities are locked in a ferocious competition, spawning ambitious development schemes that escape the control of Beijing's central government. By Howard W.

FRANCE-DETAINEES (Paris) -- Four French citizens held without trial for more than two years at the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay arrived in France on Tuesday and were immediately detained by French authorities under the country's tough anti-terrorism laws. The four men, who were captured during the American-led-war in Afghanistan on suspicion of fighting with the Taliban, were released following what President Jacques Chirac called long and intense negotiations with the Bush administration.

TERROR-ISLAMIC-CHARITY (Washington) -- Five former leaders of the Holy Land Foundation, once the biggest Islamic charity in the United States, were arrested Tuesday on charges they funneled $12.4 million to Palestinian terrorists. But two other charity officials wanted by the government were able to leave the country recently for the Middle East even while they were under criminal investigation.  PALESTINIAN-POLITICS (Ramallah, West Bank) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his prime minister, Ahmed Qureia, hugged, kissed and settled their political dispute on Tuesday with a pledge to pursue limited reforms that have been attempted previously without success. As the two Palestinian leaders stood just outside Arafat's battered offices, Qureia announced he had withdrawn the resignation he submitted 10 days earlier to protest internal Palestinian fighting and rampant lawlessness in the Gaza Strip. Under the new arrangement, Qureia is to gain authority over some parts of the security agencies, including the police. However, Arafat will still control the bulk of the security forces and will remain the dominant figure on all major political and security issues. By Greg Myre.

A relative, he learned, had guarded Japanese war criminals after World War II at the infamous Sugamo Prison in Tokyo. He had collected souvenirs and kept them in his basement for a half-century. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"144623"	"I"	"learned"	" I didn't write it with the idea of providing anyone with any answers to any of life's tough questions, she said. Intense grief, I learned, is a totally foreign mind-set. Like being in love. Love imposes a prism on life, and through it everything and everyone is slightly skewed. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he added,	 I remember telling Joe when I left that he was going to have a great two years, McCurry said. I told him all this investigation stuff was going to pass, and the last two years were going to be terrific. With a laugh, he added, I guess I was wrong. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, they argue,	 HBO executives maintain that even at that price, the series makes sense. If Rome is successful, they argue, the cost of the elaborate set will be amortized over what HBO hopes will be as much as a five-year run, and revenue streams from DVD and deals like the one with RAI will bring in continuous profits. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 Heller explained that the early production problems were a result of not having had a pilotlike process in the beginning because of the need to build the set to shoot the initial episode. The first part was like a pilot, though no one called it a pilot, he said. We're learning as we go. For example, he said, the British actors -- James Purefoy as Marc Antony and Kevin McKidd and Ray Stevenson as the two lead soldiers -- first spoke in strong regional accents, which were difficult for Americans to understand. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, she said,	 Most of the movies from those boxes have since been sold, but until the final 10 minutes before the auction closed, Flying Tigers had not flown anywhere. As she has done before, she said, she decided to sell it for a penny to make room for new merchandise. Her penny sales, she acknowledged, are all business losses. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, she said,	 But buy them she did. In that case, she sold more than half of the stock at a profit, she said, enabling her to survive even if she had to sell the remainder at a loss. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 Sellers who engage in these practices, Durzy said, are usually discovered quickly by watchdogs among eBay users and reprimanded by eBay. If the violations continue, he said, they could be kicked off the site. In a cursory search last week, the highest shipping charge to be found on 1-cent Buy It Now items was $29.99 for a box of 200 cell phone adapters said to weigh 15 pounds. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 Cortese said he had listed Ming vases worth thousands of dollars, and we've sold them for pennies. In some cases, buyers who might have recognized their value weren't paying attention, he said. Losing that much money can be painful, he said, but in the long run, bargains attract more customers. It's possible, of course, that newcomers to eBay may not see the distinction between 1-cent Buy It Now sellers and 1-cent auctioneers. And this worries Jay Senese, who sells CDs on eBay with his wife, Marie. On eBay they are known as JayandMarie, an ID that has gained an international reputation for selling hundreds of CDs a week, each one opening with a 1-cent bid. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 There are people who use 1 cent as a come-on, Jay Senese said. Buyers quickly learn, he said, that the real price might be hidden in the shipping charges. It kind of hurts me, he said. If people are seeing items and thinking, 'It must be a scam, it must be on the shipping,' he added, they may decide to not even look at his inventory. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he sings,	 David sued the company when he was fired, then spent the money on a vanity music video, and that sketch is priceless: dressed all in white in a white loft, he sings, or more likely lip-syncs, the pop ballad If You Don't Know Me by Now, in a vicious parody of Enrique Iglesias-style romantic music videos. His video did not sell, and he spends a lot of time dropping by the office, assuring his former employees that he is a big success and that they are delighted to see him again. You are always welcome, Gareth tells him insufferably. But you should phone ahead. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 But the bullet train, he said, transcends politics. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, I think,	 Barry's humor draws on what might best be described as a wacko-everyman persona: part goofball, all guy. By the time I'm done [with a column], I think, 'Boy, is this stupid,' he once told The Washington Post. The idea is to make it look like it took me 15 minutes and I was drunk. But that's all a lie. Actually, it took me a long time, and it's drudgery. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, I think,	 I've been a platoon leader for about a month, he said. And yeah, I hear the guys talking about the election. Both sides of it. We've got some voting one way and some the other and they talk about it and argue about it. But most people, I think, are just starting to get their minds around it. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, I think,	 The bitterness that exists between Democrats and Republicans, I think, has degenerated into ... a stalemate, and I'm very, very unhappy with it, Ford said in a telephone interview from his home in Palm Springs, Calif. It does turn off voters, and it results in a lack of action that has to be done for the country's good. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 The international consortium, principally laboratories in Britain and the United States, with contributions from China, France, Germany and Japan, spent $300 million to prepare the draft sequence of the human genome. Filling all the gaps and other finishing work has taken $320 million more, Collins said. The article appearing Thursday is probably the final report on the genome as a whole, he said, although work continues on specific aspects. Closing the remaining 341 gaps is a research project for the future. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he added,	 About his formula for success, Gockley said: I try to encourage the composers to write theatrical but listenable music, not continuous, but in numbers, with duets and quartets. The themes, he added, can't be so opaque that you don't get them musically. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he says,	 Until then, he says, union negotiators are doing a tactical retreat, not surrender when it comes to giving in to carriers. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 The phenomenon of refusal, or disobedience, he said, is dangerous to us as an army, as a society and as a state. So calls for disobedience by political and spiritual leaders forces soldiers and commanders to face difficult dilemmas that can undermine the army, he said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 The senior military officer said the problem was much more acute in the army, which has young conscripts, than in the police, who will do most of the physical removal of settlers who do not leave voluntarily (they and the other settlers will get up to $200,000 tax free in any case). The police, he said, are older and professional; those with qualms can quit. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 For the army, disengagement will be a relative term, he said, adding, Without a responsible, effective Palestinian leadership in Gaza -- and we will have to wait for that -- the army must be there to ensure that Gaza does not become a haven for terrorism and a launching pad for Katyusha rockets against Israel. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 While troop strength could be reduced at least 30 percent in Gaza with the settlers gone, he said, we must ensure that the impact of disengagement -- and especially the evacuation of settlers -- won't be seen as running away from terrorism or evacuation under fire. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 Israel must ensure that Gaza does not become the headquarters for militant organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah, now centered in Damascus and Beirut, he said, especially if the Palestinians are too weak or divided to do so. If Gaza becomes Hamasistan or al-Qaidistan, he said, the army would have to act, and would do so with increased legitimacy after disengagement. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20041020.0221 type=story > <HEADLINE> BULLISH ON THE ECONOMY, BUT CAUTIOUS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> NEW YORK </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 Even those who have done well throughout the recent recession are not willing to predict that the future will be as sunny. Leigh Ballen, president of Developers Inc., a real estate firm in Chicago, said: I think we've been riding a wave that others haven't had the benefit of. I have a new fear, because I don't know how long people will stay in the market when interest rates go up. His company, he said, hedges by being in the starter market. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 Sorensen of Penn Cycle, for example, said he planned to keep his staff at about the same level next year. But Gerry Hartung, president of Physician Practice, a medical publishing and education company in Glen Burnie, Md., said his company had been slow to hire and was probably overworking our current staff. Still, he said, his company had hired 13 people this year and planned to hire four more and even more next year. If we don't put people in place, he said, we won't be able to take advantage of the economy. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 Those involved in leasing retail space have seen some increased activity based on pent-up demand for decent areas, according to Brian Moss, the vice president of the Shopping Center Realty Corp., in Greenwich, Conn., which handles the leasing and property management of retail space. But expansion, he said, was more the exception than the rule. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, you know,	 I don't know Laura Bush, Heinz Kerry said in remarks published Wednesday. But she seems to be calm, and she has a sparkle in her eye, which is good. But I don't know that she's ever had a real job - I mean, since she's been grown up. So her experience and her validation comes from important things, but different things. And I'm older, and my validation of what I do and what I believe and my experience is a little bit bigger - because I'm older, and I've had different experiences. And it's not a criticism of her. It's just, you know, what life is about. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he suggested,	 Foreign visitors are rare here. A team of foreign journalists was allowed to visit recently only because they came with cease-fire monitors from the African Union, and only after an African Union commander pressed a Sudanese army representative. If the gunmen have nothing to hide, he suggested, they ought to let in journalists. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, it seems,	 Those Arabs who were the first to take up the call to arms, it seems, had pending grievances with the Fur and the Zaghawa, the two principal African tribes behind the insurgency, grievances that had less to do with race than with disputes over land and water rights. Arabs are mainly nomadic herders; Africans are largely farmers. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, they say,	 Observers from the African Union say there is no question that the paramilitary outfit here, whatever its name, is in the vanguard of the government's counterinsurgency effort in the western Sudan. In turn, they say, these fighters are responsible for some of the most egregious human rights violations over the last year and a half: burning villages, gang-raping women, slaughtering civilians who belong to enemy African tribes. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he maintained,	 Once this war is over, what will happen to these men? They will have to be further trained, Saeed said. Then, he maintained, they would be incorporated into the regular army. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20041020.0226 type=story > <HEADLINE> ALSO MOVING IN THE NATIONAL CATEGORY POLL SHOWS BUSH RETAINS LEAD AMONG COLORADO VOTERS </HEADLINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he acknowledged,	 Nitze was a Democrat who changed parties to protest Roosevelt's effort to pack the Supreme Court. He returned to the fold at the beginning of the Eisenhower administration. Squeezed out of office because of his close association with Acheson and discouraged at being on the outside, Nitze went back to his farm and, at the suggestion of his wife, who wanted to take his mind off his troubles, entered a horse race at the Charles County fair. When he won, he acknowledged, at least to himself, his longing for recognition. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 The paratrooper, who agreed to be interviewed upon condition that he be identified only by his first name, Aleksei, said that from then on he was beaten and kicked daily. The captain, he said, broke his nose. He ultimately received an early discharge, after hospitalization. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20041020.0229 type=story > <HEADLINE> 18 DIE AS SEASON'S 10TH TYPHOON RAKES JAPAN, BREAKING RECORD </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> TOKYO </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 On CNN on Tuesday, however, Robertson conceded, I thought it was going to be a blowout, but I think it's razor thin now. Still, he said, he believed Bush will win an electoral college victory. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, you know,	 She gave me that look, like, you know, this guy's a complete idiot, and I'm going to have to help him, he recalled in early October, sitting on his front porch in Bedlam, N.Y., near here. Rose's assessment (she was 5 months old at the time) came shortly after Katz left a utility gate open, something you might do puttering around your yard in Montclair, N.J., where he also lives, but not on a farm with animals. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 As he had with previous books, he continued to explore, at a personal level, what people's relationships to their pets says about them. During the year Katz laid to rest the ghost of his father, from whom he was estranged when he was 11, he said, and he reconnected with a long-lost sister, Jane Richter, a stranger with whom he uncovered common new ground -- dogs. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, they said,	 Orthopedic experts said no similar cases had ever been recorded in medical literature. In fact, they said, they could not think of another situation where they would recommend such a procedure. However, they agreed that treating a big-time pitcher before a big-time game was that rarest of circumstances warranting it. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 The Kansas casino also would not be subject to Missouri's gambling-loss limits, he said, meaning it could be marketed to high rollers. It also could be sold as a way to keep Kansas dollars inside the state. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 It was the debates, in Rohde's estimation, that made most of the difference. In Michigan, he said, a very substantial proportion of the electorate now, for the first time, considers John Kerry plausible as a president. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, she said,	 Granholm produced a piece of paper on which she had noted the morning's television news headlines and read them out for her visitor: the deficit larger; the Dow dropping; unemployment claims up, hitting an all-time high; General Motors profits below expectations, with health claims crippling profits; flu vaccine in short supply; oil prices rising. They added up, she said, to a perfect storm of bad news. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 It was the debates, in Rohde's estimation, that made most of the difference. In Michigan, he said, a very substantial proportion of the electorate now, for the first time, considers John Kerry plausible as a president. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 But his communications director, Dan Bartlett, said the other day that the president understands that part of democracy is that you can't dictate what voters are going to do. But look at each step so far in Afghanistan and Iraq, he said, and people have demonstrated so far that they are not inclined to go that route. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, I think,	 In a point-by-point condemnation of Bush's handling of Iraq, terrorism, homeland security, intelligence and diplomacy, Kerry ticked off a list of terrible mistakes by Bush. What did the president learn? he asked. Apparently nothing. He is, I think, literally in denial. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 One reason phone makers have not offered analog TV service, Cetto said, is because analog signals can be easily interrupted. By contrast, he said, the digital signal can be processed in such a way as to compensate for interruptions in the radio frequency. But while digital technology makes it easier to display a constant stream of images while the phone user is moving, digital programming has been slow to develop. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 Sanjay Jha, president of Qualcomm's chip set and system software division, said digital TV technology on phones is the next logical step. In fact, he said, that while he expects the phones to be on the market in high volumes by 2007, the likelihood is that it could be even sooner. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20041020.0261 type=story > <HEADLINE> A CARTOON FOR ADULTS WITH PAID, BRAND-NAME PRODUCT PLACEMENT </HEADLINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he added,	 A goal is to make it organic to the show, Fried said, rather than so obtrusive it would annoy viewers. In some instances, he added, after previewing the episodes in production, We gave feedback to tone it down; we said it was too much. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 Wearing a frayed business suit at the meeting with the American generals, Naima pulled out a folded piece of paper from his jacket that outlined his plan for how to proceed. Because looting had broken out in Baghdad and crime was rampant, he said a show of power was needed. The most important thing, he said, was security. He also said that the Americans had to act fast to get the Iraqi noncommissioned officers and the police back to work. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 Naima urged the Americans to establish three Iraqi military divisions, which would be deployed in northern, central, and southern Iraq. An army company would be stationed in each town to back up the police. Naima said there were plenty of potential military leaders who were not committed Baathists. The idea, he said, would be to start at the top, create a new Iraqi Ministry of Defense, and then work down. All the officers would be required to denounce the Baath Party. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 He also offered some political advice. The Americans should announce a departure plan so Iraqis did not view them as occupiers. And they needed to pay the military, the police, and the bureaucrats. Iraq was a nation of civil servants, he said, and they needed their salaries to survive. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 The role of top Bush administration officials in approving the plan is unclear. Slocombe said the decision was the subject of extensive consultations with senior Defense Department officials in Washington. A draft of Bremer's decree abolishing the army, he said, was sent to the Pentagon before it was issued. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 Senator Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said he was profoundly struck by the House GOP's propensity to limit bipartisan input - a tactic, he said, we couldn't contemplate on the Senate side. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 The abuse did not stop with nudity. With one hooded detainee, he said, I grabbed his arm by the elbow, put it on his genitals and moved it back and forth with an arm motion and he did it, while male and female soldiers watched. With another detainee, he performed the same act, but this time, he said, I lifted his hood and gave him a hand gesture, telling him to keep doing it himself. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 Frederick also acknowledged involvement in the now-infamous scenes of Iraqi prisoners piled on top of each other. Another soldier, he said, jumped on the pile and stomped on prisoners' hands and feet while sort of laughing. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 The Iraqi, who had been accused of stealing a car and rioting, said he and other prisoners in the pile had been crying and screaming. Afterward, he said, soldiers took them to cells that were flooded with water and told them to sleep there, naked, without beds or blankets and with bags on their heads. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he asks,	 But computers, of course, are only a means to a healthy end. No matter how wired this place gets, this still starts with a perfect stranger who wakes up somewhere, doesn't feel well and comes to us, Abrams said. That's what this is all about. None of us want to be programmers. The deal is, we're supposed to take care of these people. We appreciate the system and whatever efficiencies we're getting, but in the end it's all about the patients. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20041020.0279 type=advis > <HEADLINE> ONE-TIME SPIRITUAL WANDERER WRITES GRAPHIC NOVEL BASED ON SCRIPTURES </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> FLOWER MOUND, Texas </DATELINE> <TEXT> Robert Luedke says he spent most of his first 40 years wandering in a spiritual desert, looking at accounts of Jesus and Christianity as nice, harmless stories.  Why, he asks, should young people have to do the same thing? And why can't they learn about Christianity and still be entertained?  No reason at all, Luedke says. That's why he spent most of the past two years writing and illustrating the graphic novel Eye Witness: A Fictional Tale of Absolute Truth, which blends a fictional spiritual awakening and Jesus' trial and crucifixion.  That's right -- it's one of those books your Spiderman- or Superman-obsessed teen-ager might read, and that you might wish would be set aside for something a little more, well, highbrow.  od pushed me and said, 'Somebody should do this -- why not you?'  Luedke, 46, said last week at his home, sitting next to his wife of 21 years, Sandy. The couple and their children Rob and Madison, 15 and 12, became born-again Christians in 2000. I just think it's a great way to transfer information about the Scriptures to young people.  But getting Eye Witness into bookstores was more difficult than he anticipated. Released in both hard and soft-cover editions by his own company, Head Press, the book has been picked up by a few comic-book stores and Christian bookstores, but not many.  The reason, Luedke says, is a bias against graphic novels by some conservative Christians.  When the general public hears 'graphic novel,' they think 'Superman,'  he said. That's the challenge getting it out. People working in Christian bookstores, people on the front lines, aren't sure about it. It's a little edgy for some of them. It's like Christian rock music 10 years ago. While much of Eye Witness closely follows the gospels, there are some modern and irreverent touches, including several lines in the book that are clearly Luedke's invention. Among them are a Roman soldier saying, 'Scuse me, anybody seen my ear? when the apostle Peter cuts it off.  The line I drew is, if someone is referring to a line out of the Bible, I kept it verbatim, Luedke said. I gave myself leeway with things I added to conect the dots, so to speak, to add to the entertainment value for kids.  Todd Robison, owner of SonRise Christian Store in Grapevine, sells the book and said it's very creative in getting the message across.  Jim Wicker of the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary said he's looked at Eye Witness and he believes that Christian graphic novels will appeal to teens and young people because of the style of presentation.  More young people would pick this up than a Bible, said Wicker, an associate professor of New estament studies. I have mentioned it in my classes as a clever way to present the gospel in a way young people will read.  There's no question that young people do read graphic novels; local mainstream bookstores have considerable space devoted to such series as The Punisher and Sin City. Also, numerous recent movies -- The Crow, The Punisher, Hellboy and Road To Perdition among them -- were adapted from graphic novels.  Luedke wasn't orrying about sales back in 2002, when he began working on Eye Witness. A graphic novelist who also owned comic book stores, he hit upon the idea around Christmas. He soon began writing out a draft of the story, which includes a forensic archaeologist, Dr. Terry Harper, whom he based on himself.  He's a metaphor for me, Luedke said. I'm the kind of guy, I have to understand why things happen the way they happen.  There aren't many religious graphic novels, but Luedke isn't alone.  Begun in 2002, Metron Press s an arm of the 188-year-old American Bible Society that is solely devoted to Christian graphic novels.  General Manager Robert Schwalb said that although its two titles are in a couple hundred comic book shops or Christian bookstores, sales could be a lot better. Part of this, he said, is the racy nature of some graphic novels, and part is due to simple issues such as where to put the books in the stores.  A lot of Christian bookstores don't have well-defned teen sections, he said.  --  About graphic novels:  They are basically book-length comics.  The first full-length graphic novel is generally considered to be William Eisner's A Contract With God and Other Tenement Tales, which was published in 1978.  Many graphic novels continue storylines and characters, such as Spiderman and Superman, that began in comic strips. Others feature new characters, such as The Crow, James O'Barr's Gothic hero.  The next major graphic novel adaptation due to hit the big sreen is Sin City. It's based on Frank Miller's successful series of the same name. The film is being directed by Robert Rodriguez and stars Bruce Willis, Josh Hartnett, Clive Owen, Elijah Wood, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba and Brittany Murphy. It is scheduled to be released in April 2005.  --  (Online: For more information on Eye Witness, go to www.headpress.info.

, we believe,	 I don't see any conflict between genuinely and honestly regretting the pain that this has caused and still standing by the decision that was made, we believe, by the leading of the Holy Spirit, he said. I think it is a terribly significant thing that this report does not say that this action was wrong, it does not call for me to resign, it does not call for me to repent, it does not call for the Episcopal Church to repent. It says, 'Do you really realize how painful this is for some parts of the Communion?' And I think part of the answer is I don't think I did understand how painful this would be, but that does not mean that I feel like I shouldn't have done it, because, frankly, I feel just as strongly as I ever did that I was led to this by the Holy Spirit. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz

A mixed marriage between a mortal and a witch could work, we learned, if their love was real. And if the witch stayed home and pretended she was nothing special. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"156802"	"she"	"learned"	" Calise, the client from Mount Olive, said that in their frequent conversations, she and McGuire discussed everything from ovulation cycles and the surrogate's medication protocols to overarching themes like life, death and fate. A few years before, Calise had lost a daughter shortly after birth, and McGuire, she learned, had recently lost a husband. We talked a lot about how life can change so quickly, Calise said. How you wake up one day and say, 'How did this become my life?' She added, I felt like she was a friend. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"157247"	"he"	"learned"	" Marshall reads neither French nor music, so he studied English translations of the libretto, biographies of Offenbach (who, like Marshall, enjoyed enormous success through comedy but yearned to be taken seriously) and histories of Europe on the eve of the Franco-Prussian War. Offenbach, he learned, had written a happy ending to the work, but after his death, interpreters added a malicious twist. Marshall, who has virtually trademarked the fairy-tale finish, promptly restored the original. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"157253"	"he"	"learned"	" Weatherford said the best advice he received from Weldon was about the importance of footwork. How you move your feet, your balance and how you shift your weight, he learned, were far more important than arm strength. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
"158456"	"we"	"learned"	" The 65-acre gardens, we learned, were laid out shortly after Henry Middleton acquired the property through marriage in 1741. Middleton, who subsequently became president of the First Continental Congress, oversaw the creation of the famed gardens with, as the story goes, the assistance of 100 slaves working for 10 years. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
"161484"	"I"	"learned"	" After e-mailing Nathan to call the doctor, I did some quick research. Well, it can't be epiglottitis, I thought. An inflammation of the cartilage covering the windpipe, the disease is most common in children 2 to 6, I learned, an age range that Nathan passed about 30 years ago. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"161742"	"I"	"learned"	" A. Let me start with the word nose. Poking into current wine literature, I found brilliant noses, subtle noses, off noses and troubling noses. Some wines, I learned, are said to have memorable noses while others, it is claimed, have no noses at all. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"161962"	"we"	"learned"	" The selling of Samuel Alito is a perfect illustration of how our world works. From the moment Alito emerged from Harriet Miers' penumbra, his supporters' story line was clear: He'd be presented as a humble exemplar of American values too mainstream to be labeled out of the mainstream by his opponents. In his first courtesy calls on Capitol Hill in November, we learned, Alito often cited his father as a proud immigrant who instilled in him empathy for minorities and the poor -- an empathy not remotely apparent in the judge's legal record. A particularly poignant anecdote had it that his father had once defended a black basketball player from discrimination in college. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"162601"	"I"	"learned"	" And another thig the instructors didn't do was tell the kids they would be taking a tumble or three durng the day. But that warning, I learned, is really never part of the plan. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"162604"	"I"	"learned"	" And another thing the instructors didn't do was tell the kids they would betaking a tumble or three during the day. But that warning, I learned, is really neer part of the plan. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"

"164090"	"she"	"learned"	" She discovered early on that the history of Jewish food is the story of assimilation. There are very few authentic Jewish foods, she learned, aside from matzo, haroset (a Passover blend) and cholent (slow-cooking Shabbat stew, sometimes called hamin). </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"166837"	"I"	"learned"	" These days, I learned, all kinds of memorabilia from the Cultural Revolution have become highly collectible; in addition to porcelain statues, the category includes vintage posters and ticking Mao mantel clocks. And you don't have to travel to the Panjiayuan flea market to shop. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"167286"	"I"	"learned"	" I didn't want to write a story about myself, he grimaces. I just couldn't see that it would be that interesting. It takes time to write a movie script, I learned, and to write one about my own show seemed uncomfortable to me. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"167716"	"I"	"learned"	" That, I learned, was my Dad job at the time. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"169079"	"we"	"learned"	" This, we learned, is how heart failure manifests in young children, a sharp contrast to the sudden stoppage in adults. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169961"	"we"	"learned"	" The head-stretchers, we learned, were on another part of Malakula, and because there were no roads, it was impossible to get there without hiring a boat and supplying 100 gallons of fuel, which wasn't exactly part of our honeymoon kit. So we settled for a hike to a nearby cannibal site, where we were proudly shown the slab of rock where victims used to have their heads bashed in and the jungle-chewed shoes of an unlucky missionary who was roasted and eaten generations ago. His Docksiders (that's what they looked like), apparently, didn't taste so good. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"170875"	"I"	"learned"	" A moment passed and then another, the silence pointing up the exact thing our tryst lacked until finally we rolled into our regular positions and fell asleep. I felt ridiculous and didn't mention thunderstorms to him again. Vulnerability, I learned, has limited currency. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171439"	"we"	"learned"	" Our hostess, we learned, was also a massage therapist. She'll be giving guests who reserve rooms online from now until Nov. 1 a free 15-minute chair massage. It's just another good reason to visit sunny St. Pete. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171610"	"he"	"learned"	" There were ambulances in the street, he said. One man, he learned, had been killed just up the hillside. We didn't know if we should stay or leave. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172055"	"we"	"learned"	" Penn's Cave bills itself as America's only all-water cavern. Nearly all caves, we learned, were formed a few million years ago by water flowing underground. But everywhere we visited, except Penn's Cave, most of that water was gone. We walked down a long path to the entrance, which was shielded by a natural archway of gray limestone slabs. Then we climbed into a long, red motorboat. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"173709"	"we"	"learned"	" She was, we learned, Adrienne Lamb, a poet and -- big surprise -- blogger who'd been chronicling her post-hurricane travails on afterkatrina.blogspot.com. As she told us about her ups and downs -- her flight to Florida, her anger and depression, her sudden divorce -- I was reminded of the way New Yorkers like myself still find ourselves recounting our Sept. 11 experiences to total strangers. Now, though, I was on the receiving end, feeling conflictedly creepy for my curiosity. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"174530"	"I"	"learned"	" I decided the time has come to investigate the possibility of adding some personality to my incoming calls. Ringtones, I learned, have become big business. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
