Billings for 1995 were estimated at $25 million.   Richard Zien, a managing partner at Mendelsohn/Zien, said on Friday that his agency was awarded the account after a ``shootout'' with Grey. Mendelson/Zien had been one of three finalists in a previous Carl's Jr. review, he added, and had worked for the chain since October on a strategic assignment.   Volkswagen of America Inc. has narrowed to five finalists the review on its account with estimated billings of $90 million. Berlin Cameron Doyle in New York, which was dismissed in December, had handled the account since August 1993.   Maria Leonhauser, a spokeswoman for Volkswagen in Auburn Hills, Mich., identified the finalists on Friday as Arnold Fortuna Lawner &AMP; Cabot in Boston; DDB Needham New York, which handled the account before Berlin Cameron; Deutsch Inc. in New York; the Martin Agency in Richmond, and the Richards Group in Dallas. A decision is expected by the end of March, she added, when Berlin Cameron completes its work on the account.   Neil Kraft, a well-known creative executive in fashion and retail advertising, has joined Elizabeth Arden Inc., the cosmetics and fragrance company, as a consultant.   Susan Arnot, a spokeswoman for Arden in New York, said Friday that Kraft was consulting on a ``very open-ended basis'' on creative elements like ``the visual image of Arden,'' working with executives like Paulette Dufault, senior vice president for advertising and creative services, and Joseph Spellman, executive vice president for marketing development and creative services.   Kraft was most recently senior vice president and director of advertising and creative services at Calvin Klein Inc. in New York, where he worked on highly visible campaigns like the Calvin Klein underwear ads featuring the singer Marky Mark.   He also was vice president for advertising and marketing at Barneys New York and image director at Esprit de Corp. in San Francisco.   In an acquisition of one New York-based public relations agency by another, Ruder-Finn has bought the Kahn Communications Group. The terms were not disclosed. Kahn, which has billings estimated at $2 million from clients including AT&AMP;T and Liz Claiborne, will keep its name and move into Ruder-Finn's office in New York. Jeff Kahn, 36, chairman and creative director at Kahn, was named to the additional new position of president at Ruder-Finn Technology.   The following accounts have been awarded:   -- Ammirati &AMP; Puris/Lintas, New York, resigned the domestic portion of the Lexmark International account, with billings estimated at less than $5 million, as part of an effort to concentrate on larger accounts. The account was originally assigned to Lintas New York, a predecessor shop, in 1988. Ken Bissell, a spokesman for Lexmark in Lexington, Ky., said a review had begun.   -- Miles Inc., Elkhart, Ind., has assigned the accounts of two brands recently acquired from Sterling Health U.S.A., New York. McCann-Erickson New York was awarded Phillips' Milk of Magnesia, and Tatham Euro RSCG, Chicago, was awarded Midol pain reliever. Under Sterling, both accounts had been at Ammirati &AMP; Puris/Lintas, New York, until that agency resigned them because of a conflict.   -- Keycorp, Cleveland, to Borders, Perrin &AMP; Norrander, Seattle, to handle advertising for its Key Bank unit in states including Alaska and Washington, previously handled by J.

"15776"	"I"	"believe"	" The Arizona Supreme Court found it ``repugnant to the principles of a free society,'' 177 Ariz., at 204, 866 P. 2d, at 872, to take a person ``into police custody because of a computer error precipitated by government carelessness.'' Ibid. Few, I believe, would disagree. Whether, in order to guard against such errors, ``the exclusionary rule is a `cost' we cannot afford to be without,'' ibid., seems to me a question this Court should not rush to decide. The Court errs, as I see it, in presuming that Arizona rested its decision on federal grounds.

"19888"	"I"	"believe"	" Moreover, whenever possible, such questions should be resolved before the court accepts the bond as security for collection of the judgment being appealed. After a debtor has benefitted from the postponement of collection of an adverse judgment, both that debtor and its successors-in-interest should normally be estopped from asserting that the judgment creditors who relied to their detriment on the validity of the bond had no right to do so. The very purpose of a supersedeas bond is to protect judgment creditors from the risk that insolvency of the debtor may impair their ability to enforce the judgment promptly. When the bond has served the purpose of forestalling immediate levies on the judgment debtor's assets levies that might have precipitated an earlier bankruptcy it is inequitable to postpone payment merely because the risk against which the bond was intended to provide protection has actually occurred. See id., at 319 (``It is manifestly unfair to force the judgment creditor to delay the right to collect with a promise to protect the judgment only to later refuse to allow that successful plaintiff to execute the bond because the debtor has sought protection under the laws of bankruptcy''); In re Southmark, 138 B. R. 820, 827-828 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Tex. 1992) (internal quotation marks omitted) (``The principal risk against which such bonds are intended as a protection is insolvency. To hold that the very contingency against which they guard shall, if it happens, discharge them, seems to us bad law and worse logic''). The inequity that the Court today condones does not, of course, demonstrate that its legal analysis is incorrect. It does, however, persuade me that the Court should not review this case as though it presented an ordinary collateral attack on an injunction entered by an Article III court. (footnote 22) Instead, the Court should, I believe, more carefully consider which of the two competing tribunals is guilty of trespassing in the other's domain. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"

"24869"	"we"	"believe"	" Relying on these post-Brillhart developments, London Underwriters contend that the Brillhart regime, under which district courts have substantial latitude in deciding whether to stay or to dismiss a declaratory judgment suit in light of pending state proceedings (and need not point to ``exceptional circumstances'' to justify their actions), is an outmoded relic of another era. We disagree. Neither Colorado River, which upheld the dismissal of federal proceedings, nor Moses H. Cone, which did not, dealt with actions brought under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U. S. C. s2201(a) (1988 ed., Supp V). Distinct features of the Declaratory Judgment Act, we believe, justify a standard vesting district courts with greater discretion in declaratory judgment actions than that permitted under the ``exceptional circumstances'' test of Colorado River and Moses H.

"24877"	"I"	"believe"	" The lead opinion uses one term, ``strict scrutiny,'' to describe the standard of judicial review for all governmental classifications by race. Ante, at 34-36. But that opinion's elaboration strongly suggests that the strict standard announced is indeed ``fatal'' for classifications burdening groups that have suffered discrimination in our society. That seems to me, and, I believe, to the Court, the enduring lesson one should draw from Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214 (1944); for in that case, scrutiny the Court described as ``most rigid,'' id., at 216, nonetheless yielded a pass for an odious, gravely injurious racial classification. See ante, at 12 (lead opinion).

Such conduct, we believe, falls on the other side of the statutory line from that of one who delivers false documents or testimony to the grand jury itself. Conduct of the latter sort all but assures that the grand jury will consider the material in its deliberations.

"26730"	"we"	"believe"	" The Court of Appeals (and the dissent) are correct to extract from our decisions the principle that we have recognized special Establishment Clause dangers where the government makes direct money payments to sectarian institutions, citing Roemer v. Board of Pub. Works of Md., 426 U. S. 736, 747 (1976); Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 614-615 (1988); Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S., at 742; Tilton, 403 U. S., at 679-680; Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236 (1968). The error is not in identifying the principle but in believing that it controls this case. Even assuming that WAP is no different from a church and that its speech is the same as the religious exercises conducted in Widmar (two points much in doubt), the Court of Appeals decided a case that was, in essence, not before it, and the dissent would have us do the same. We do not confront a case where, even under a neutral program that includes nonsectarian recipients, the government is making direct money payments to an institution or group that is engaged in religious activity. Neither the Court of Appeals nor the dissent, we believe, takes sufficient cognizance of the undisputed fact that no public funds flow directly to WAP's coffers. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"26735"	"I"	"believe"	" In this case, I believe, the reasonable observer would view the Klan's cross display fully aware that Capitol Square is a public space in which a multiplicity of groups, both secular and religious, engage in expressive conduct. It is precisely this type of knowledge that we presumed in Lamb's Chapel, 508 U. S., at --- (slip op., at 10), and in Mergens, 496 U. S., at 250 (plurality opinion). Moreover, this observer would certainly be able to read and understand an adequate disclaimer, which the Klan had informed the State it would include in the display at the time it applied for the permit, see App. to Pet. for Cert. A-15 to A-16; post, at 11, n. 1 (SOUTER, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), and the content of which the Board could have defined as it deemed necessary as a condition of granting the Klan's application. Cf. American Civil Liberties Union v. Wilkinson, 895 F. 2d 1098, 1104-1106 (CA6 1990). On the facts of this case, therefore, I conclude that the reasonable observer would not interpret the State's tolerance of the Klan's private religious display in Capitol Square as an endorsement of religion. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

"44763"	"we"	"believe"	" This practice has some virtues. In an appropriate case, a GVR order conserves the scarce resources of this Court that might otherwise be expended on plenary consideration, assists the court below by flagging a particular issue that it does not appear to have fully considered, assists this Court by procuring the benefit of the lower court's insight before we rule on the merits, and alleviates the ``(p)otential for unequal treatment'' that is inherent in our inability to grant plenary review of all pending cases raising similar issues, see United States v. Johnson, 457 U. S. 537, 556, n. 16 (1982); cf. Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 323 (1987) (``we fulfill our judicial responsibility by instructing the lower courts to apply the new rule retroactively to cases not yet final''). Where intervening developments, or recent developments that we have reason to believe the court below did not fully consider, reveal a reasonable probability that the decision below rests upon a premise that the lower court would reject if given the opportunity for further consideration, and where it appears that such a redetermination may determine the ultimate outcome of the litigation, a GVR order is, we believe, potentially appropriate. Whether a GVR order is ultimately appropriate depends further on the equities of the case: if it appears that the intervening development, such as a confession of error in some but not all aspects of the decision below, is part of an unfair or manipulative litigation strategy, or if the delay and further cost entailed in a remand are not justified by the potential benefits of further consideration by the lower court, a GVR order is inappropriate. This approach is similar in its flexibility to this Court's longstanding approach to applications for stays and other summary remedies granted without determining the merits of the case under the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. s1651. See, e.g., Heckler v. Lopez, 463 U. S. 1328 (1983) (REHNQUIST, J., in chambers) (staying a District Court order pending the decision on the merits of the Court of Appeals). (Naturally, because GVR orders are premised on matters that we have reason to believe the court below did not fully consider, and because they require only further consideration, the standard that we apply in deciding whether to GVR is somewhat more liberal than the All Writs Act standard, under which relief is granted only upon a showing that a grant of certiorari and eventual reversal are probable, see id., at 1330.) Used in accordance with this approach, the GVR order can improve the fairness and accuracy of judicial outcomes while at the same time serving as a cautious and deferential alternative to summary reversal in cases whose precedential significance does not merit our plenary review. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"

The order, Zenith's biggest for a product other than televisions, calls for the money-losing company to make at least 3 million digital set-top boxes for Americast, a joint venture between Walt Disney Co. and four regional Bell telephone companies. Production of the boxes, which are small computers attached to televisions that allow customers to receive programming, is slated to start in the first half of 1997. The contract is ``a launching point in the digital world'' for Zenith, said William Luehrs, president of Zenith's network systems division. Zenith, the nation's last TV maker, still depends on TV sales for about 90 percent of annual revenue. It sold a majority stake to a Korean electronics company last year and in April formed an alliance with U.S. Robotics Corp. to sell modems that provide cable-TV customers with fast access to computer on-line services and the global Internet network.

The department store operator said in a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it implemented ``an aggressive action plan'' to cut back on its rising writeoffs of uncollectible debts. ``Components of the action plan include increases in collection staffing levels and additional investments in technology,'' the filing said. Sears' effort followed a 73 percent jump in uncollectible accounts in the second quarter, to $270 million from $156 million for the quarter last year. Rising cardholder bankruptcies and debt writeoffs accounted for the surge, the company said. The latest total includes $15 million the company put aside for future bad debt. Income from credit cards ``means a lot to the bottom line, and if you take this out it really hurts their profit,'' said Alan Creech, an analyst with Olde Discount Corp. Published 15:48 (See story: NI RET) Bundesbank Cuts Repo Rate, Cuts Across Europe Follow By Kathleen Sullivan  Frankfurt: The Bundesbank made an unexpectedly deep cut in a key German interest rate, setting off rate reductions across Europe aimed at boosting sluggish economies. Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer said slower money supply growth and an appropriate ``international environment'' allowed the central bank to cut its securities repurchase, or repo, rate by 30 basis points to a fixed 3.00 percent for the next two weeks. ``We will now observe further developments for some time,'' Tietmeyer said. ``We have, we believe, established clarity for the foreseeable future.'' The German cut -- coming amid deutsche mark gains against the U.S. dollar and European currencies -- was quickly followed by announcements of rate reductions in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Austria. Bond and stock markets rose across Europe, while the deutsche mark slipped to a five-week low against the U.S. dollar. ``It's an expansive impulse for the European economies,'' said Gerhard Grebe, an economist at Bank Julius Baer (Deutschland) AG.

It's a sign of continued U.S. growth for one of the few foreign banks that have succeeded in establishing a strong American retail banking presence. ``They have been expanding in this region, and I would expect them to continue to do so,'' said Katharine Rossow, a fixed-income banking analyst at Chase Securities. ``They're probably one of the most successful non-U.S. banks to operate a retail bank in this country.''

Martin  New York: Shanghai Petrochemical Co. chose Peregrine Brokerage Ltd. to arrange a HK$1.04 billion ($134 million) sale of stock, after Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. was unable to find enough investors to complete a similar sale last month. China's biggest petrochemical company hired Hong Kong-based Peregrine, onia's leading investment banks, to sell 500 million shares at HK$2.075 each. The choice of Peregrine won't help Merrill's standing in Asia, where it is seeking to expand. The world's largest underwriter of stocks and bonds bought Smith New Court Plc for $842 million last year in part to boost its business in Asia. The sale comes as China's central bank today cut interest rates for the second time this year, giving a boost to Chinese stocks. ``Shanghai Petrochemical picked a good time for their sale,'' said Linda Johnston, who manages $300 million of Asian stocks at Guinness Flight Investment Management Ltd. in London.

That's when PepsiCo started to diversify into snacks and restaurants and lost its fervor for soft drinks, says Gustavo Cisneros, a scion of the powerful Venezuelan family. ``Pepsi-Cola was a religion for them,'' he said. ``Then (the soda) was no longer that important.'' The family's stunning switch is just one of Pepsi's problems to crop up in the region. Last month, Pepsi took control of its Argentine bottler, the largest outside the U.S., and may need to spend $500 million to fix it. And two weeks ago, a franchisee in Puerto Rico turned in a loss following a skirmish with a Coke bottler and will restate its earnings. Published 16:40 (See story: NI BVG)  ECONOMY AND MARKETS Thursday's U.S. Markets: Stocks, Dollar Rise; Bonds Steady By Monique Wise  New York: U.S. stocks rallied as an unexpected cut in German interest rates promised faster economic growth in Europe and a jump in orders for U.S. exporters. ``We're living in a global economy, so if you get a revival somewhere else it helps us,'' said Mark Stumpp, chief investment officer at PDI Strategies in Short Hills, New Jersey, which manages assets of $22 billion. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 43.65 to 5733.47. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index jumped 5.60 to 670.67, boosted most by oil, beverage and regional bank stocks, while the Nasdaq Composite Index soared 17.05 to 1143.91. U.S. bonds erased an early gain and were little changed as a rise in weekly claims for unemployment benefits did little to ease concern that a robust labor market will speed inflation later this year. The benchmark 30-year Treasury yield rose 1 basis point to 6.84 percent.  U.S. Economy: Jobless Claims Signal Employment Growth By Marthe Fourcade  Washington: An unusually low number of U.S. workers is applying for state unemployment benefits, suggesting the nation's job market remains vibrant. The report lends weight to analyst predictions the economy will add more than 200,000 new jobs this month. The government reported that weekly jobless claims rose 6,000 last week to 327,000, the third weekly increase in a row but less than the 350,000 that analysts say would require a lid on wage increases to ward off inflation. ``It's a very strong labor market,'' said Asha Bangalore, an economist at Northern Trust in Chicago. While other indicators show signs of an economic slowdown, the labor market ``is one the few sectors of the economy where you see unambiguous strength,'' Bangalore said. Since the beginning of the year, the U.S. economy has added more than 1 million jobs, with monthly job creation figures exceeding analysts' expectations throughout the spring.

Times News Service  NEW YORK _ Lest there be any doubt that the fall book party season is moving into full swing, consider two gatherings taking place Monday evening.  A crowd of about 250, ranging from Toni Morrison, the Nobel Prize-winning novelist, to Ralph Branca, the former Brooklyn Dodger pitcher, is expected at the Celeste Bartos Forum of the New York Public Library to honor Rachel Robinson. Her book about her husband, ``Jackie Robinson: An Intimate Portrait,'' is being published by Harry N. Abrams.  Next year will mark the 50th since Robinson joined the Brooklyn Dodgers and broke the barriers keeping black athletes out of the major leagues. Writers and documentary filmmakers have deluged his widow with proposals for projects commemorating the anniversary.  ``I knew that they didn't know the man I knew, and I decided I wanted to contribute my picture of him,'' she said the other day.  That picture includes 300 photographs winnowed from a collection of 700 and ranging from one taken on their first date in 1941 to those from his funeral in 1972.  Mrs. Robinson had always been the keeper of the family photo albums and scrapbooks, and she said, ``I knew that photos were so evocative that they would lead me into the story.'' The accompanying text traces his life in detail and with candor about both triumph and tragedy.  ``Some people, especially youngsters, think that Jack disappeared after playing ball,'' she said.  ``They don't know how involved he was in the civil rights movement nor that he was a political activist. I want people to decide for themselves what he was, but I also want them to know that he was a man committed to his race, to a more equitable society, and to his family. They know the aggressive player, they don't know the tender and loving husband and father.''  c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service  NEW YORK _ Marlo Thomas and Paul Newman are rounding up their friends to pay tribute Monday night to Dr. Helen Caldicott, the Australian pediatrician who has waged long battles against nuclear weapons and the degradation of the environment.  Dr. Caldicott has written an autobiography, ``A Desperate Passion,'' which is being published by W.W. Norton. The book is a look back at her causes _ she founded Physicians for Social Responsibility _ and the heavy personal toll she paid for her crusades. Her husband of 27 years left her and she suffered bouts of depression and spiritual crises.  ``She was an ordinary woman with an ordinary life who became an extraordinary fighter for nuclear disarmament,'' Ms. Thomas said the other day. ``She gave up her life to travel the world.''  Guests who have said they will be at the party in Ms. Thomas' Manhattan apartment range from Bianca Jagger to Sister Helen Prejean, the Roman Catholic nun whose struggle against capital punishment became the theme of the film ``Dead Man Walking.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960915.0105 type=story > <HEADLINE> SOME SEE REEVES AS COWBOYS' COACH NEXT SEASON </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.

Of course, the Nazis continued to finance the Berlin Philharmonic up to the eyeballs because it was a wonderful shop window for them.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"

It is true, I believe, that we forgive and forget transgressions too easily. We accept the practical, the expedient.

We rationalize: The economy is strong, the mood of the country hopeful; so what if the president has a few personal faults? </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"

"84603"	"I"	"believe"	" The Israeli people did something very hard in forcing this agreement. They overlooked a terrible year and they compelled the Likud to break with fundamental tenets of its ideology. If the Arabs _ Egypt, Syria, Jordan, the Palestinians _ did something hard now themselves, something out of the ordinary, something that really challenged the ambivalence of their own societies about peace with Israel, I believe, over time, the Israeli public would respond again by doing the last two hard things the Arabs want most _ establishing a Palestinian state and making a credible offer to Syria on the Golan Heights. Will the Arabs step up to it, or is the old Arab politics still the only Arab politics? </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19970120.0078 type=story > <HEADLINE> AMERICA, SYRIA AND SOUTH AFRICA </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-R-EDIT-U.S.-SAFRICA-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

If you measure the success of a president by job creation, George W. Bush is a failure so far. The economy now supports 2.2 million fewer private-sector jobs than it did when he was sworn into office.  That fact didn't bother voters in last month's elections, but the president decided that he needs a new economic policy team. On Friday, as some disappointing employment numbers were released, both Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Lawrence B. Lindsey, the president's chief economic adviser, were pushed out.  To whom Bush will turn is unclear. O'Neill had been criticized for off-the-cuff comments that sometimes unsettled currency markets, and for not having the feel for financial markets of Robert E. Rubin, President Bill Clinton's Treasury secretary.  O'Neill had been among the Bush administration officials who seemed most concerned about budget deficits, and most sanguine about the immediate economic outlook. If the Bush administration wants to sell a new economic stimulus package _ and its budget deficits _ it probably needed officials who could advocate the policy with more conviction.  That stimulus may be a good idea was indicated by Friday's job reports. It was no surprise that the number of manufacturing jobs in the United States shrank. That figure has been falling for years. But the weakness in service industries is new. The number of private-sector service jobs edged up by 7,000 in November, but is still 72,000 lower than it was two years ago, when Bush was elected.  Not since 1958 has the service sector lost jobs over a two-year period, not even during the severe recessions of 1973-75 and 1981-82. It is easy to understand why the administration might feel this was not the time to wait and hope for a better economy.  OF MICE AND MEN  Man may not consider himself much like the mouse, but at the level of their genomes the two species look very much the same, according to a report in Nature last week. Each has 30,000 or so genes, inherited from a common ancestor who lived 75 million years ago, just as mammals were entering the stage and dinosaurs were about to exit.  But looked at closely, the mouse's genome has many specialties that the human genome does not. The consortium of scientists that examined the mouse genome found 25 cases in which humans have a single gene and the mouse a cluster of related genes.  The clusters arise because in the course of evolution one gene has been accidentally copied several times over, and the copies, after mutation, have all found useful roles to play. In the mouse, 14 of these gene clusters are related to reproduction, liking making pheromones, the aphrodisiac scents that control the mouse's mating behavior, and forming the copulatory plug, a device used by male mice to prevent their inamorata being made to conceive by rivals. The emphasis on reproduction is not surprising given how rodents and primates differ in their mating habits.  Once evolution has devised a good thing, it sticks with it. All forms of life, from bacteria to humans, have the same basic set of cellular housekeeping genes. All multicellular animals share another batch of genes, largely for cells to communicate with each other. Then there's another set of genes developed for life as a mammal. Less than one percent of the mouse's genes are unique to rodents.  To make a mouse, in other words, scientists can now see that evolution took the generic recipe of mammal-making genes, sprinkled in just a dash of special-purpose mouse genes and eek! _ another wonderfully designed organism from nature's magic cookbook.  NEWS IN BRIEF  SHOW THEM THE WEAPONS: At the White House, the mood came down to this: When it comes to Iraq, there are lies, damn lies ... and inspections. Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, responded to Iraq's claims that it possesses no weapons of mass destruction by declaring that ``Iraq has lied before, and they're lying now.'' He and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said that inspections, which began last week, were bound to fail unless Saddam Hussein led the United Nations to the country's hidden weapons caches and to the scientists and engineers who developed them. The White House is betting Saddam will not meet that high standard, but it is unclear whether the rest of the uneasy coalition against Iraq will agree with President Bush's standard of what constitutes a ``material breach'' _ and a cause for war.  SURPRISING ARRESTS: Indonesia, Southeast Asia's laggard in the campaign against terrorism, is rounding up suspects in the Bali bombing at a rate that surprises, and pleases, foreign governments. The police seized Ali Ghufron, better known as Mukhlas, who is thought to be an operational commander for Jemaah Islamiyah, a regional Islamic network. Indonesian officials are confident that Mukhlas will lead them to Hambali, a reputed senior al-Qaida operative, whose fingerprints are on attacks against the United States going back a decade.  PERSUADING TURKEY: If President Bush decides to use force against Saddam Hussein, the Pentagon wants to use Turkey's bases to mount bombing raids and deploy ground troops. But as Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz discovered during a trip to Ankara, Turkish officials are reluctant to allow large numbers of troops, and it wants the U.N. Security Council to pass a new resolution authorizing force, which could delay military action. U.S. officials hope to appeal at the highest level. The leader of Turkey's governing party, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has been invited to Washington to meet President Bush this week.  MIXED SIGNALS IN MIDEAST: After 26 months of Palestinian suicide bombings and pitiless Israeli retaliation, is there light at the end of the tunnel? Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel said that the so-called road map to Palestinian statehood was ``reasonable, realistic and, I believe, attainable,'' with some changes. Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, talked to Palestinian leaders in Tel Aviv and said that he saw a new yearning for peace among Arabs as well. But officially, Palestinians rejected Sharon's statement as nothing new. And a Palestinian branch of al-Qaida posted a message on a Web site announcing its formation. Its involvement could plunge the search for peace back into darkness.  PADILLA GETS A LAWYER: A federal judge in New York ruled that Jose Padilla, who has been held incommunicado as an enemy combatant in a Navy brig since June, may consult with lawyers challenging his detention. Padilla is suspected of plotting to explode a radioactive bomb in the United States. But the judge affirmed President Bush's power to detain enemy combatants, including Americans captured on U.S. soil, and said the government needed to make only a minimal showing of proof to justify such action.  NO HELP FOR UNITED: The Bush administration refused to give United Airlines, the nation's second-largest air carrier, a $1.8 billion loan guarantee, almost certainly pushing it into bankruptcy court. A federal panel created last year to help airlines deal with the aftershocks of the Sept. 11 attacks declared that the company's business plan was ``financially unsound.'' American Airlines and Continental lobbied hard against the loan guarantee, but the airline is expected to keep flying for at least the near term, even if it seeks bankruptcy protection. And the panel said it can still submit a revised proposal.  HIGH COURT REVISITS: Babies born in 1978, the year the Supreme Court last considered and narrowly upheld affirmative action in university admissions, have grown up and graduated from college, and still the issue remains unresolved in society and the law. Now the court will hear challenges to two affirmative action programs at the University of Michigan, deciding whether racial diversity is a ``compelling'' government interest and if so, whether these programs are drawn as narrowly as possible to accomplish that goal.  The court also agreed to revisit the issue of gay rights, accepting a gay couple's challenge to a Texas criminal sodomy law.  THE CARDINAL'S PAPERS:  Newly released documents show that the Archdiocese of Boston allowed priests accused of sexual abuse to continue working in ministry, apparently dismissing or minimizing allegations against them. The documents show Cardinal Bernard H. Law made decisions about accused priests and wrote several priests sympathetic letters, as late as a few years ago. The archdiocese's finance council also gave the church the go-ahead to file for bankruptcy as a way to deal with the hundreds of lawsuits it faces. The archdiocese has not yet decided if it will seek bankruptcy protection, something no other diocese has ever done. The decision would be subject to Vatican approval.  AOL REVAMPED: AOL Time Warner revealed its latest plan to revive its AOL division, in part by selling a version of its service to high-speed Internet users. The company said it would deliver exclusive video and sound, partly through the company's other divisions, like Warner Brothers' film and music studios.  CLINTON SPEAKS, KERRY EXPLORES: Was there a Democrat left who had not lamented the results of the midterm elections? As it turned out, yes, there was _ former President Bill Clinton, who in a New York speech told his party that Democrats had ceded to Republicans the one issue that has captivated the American public: national security. As it turned out, his counsel came the same week that Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., set up a presidential exploratory committee. Kerry, a Vietnam veteran and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, made clear that national security and foreign affairs would be central issues he would take to President Bush should he win his party's nomination.  $12 MILLION GIFT, WITH STRINGS: Peter B. Lewis, the outspoken philanthropist from Cleveland, resorted to ``tough love'' at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. As chairman, he forced Thomas Krens, the museum's director, to cut the operating budget to one-half of its level just a few years ago. Then, Lewis gave the museum $12 million _ enough to pay outstanding bills and start the new year on a frugal note.  CENTRAL PARK RAPE: An old criminal case came out of storage when the Manhattan district attorney asked a judge to drop the convictions of five men who confessed in 1989 to being involved with the rape of a jogger in Central Park, along with a series of other attacks. A convicted murderer and serial rapist, Matias Reyes, stepped forward in January to claim that he alone assaulted the woman. Prosecutors found his story, backed by DNA tests, persuasive.  COMING UP: In Washington, President Bush will meet with the president of Tajikistan and the prime minister of Finland, as well as the president elect of Brazil. In Philadelphia on Thursday, he will talk about his domestic agenda. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20021207.0074 type=multi > <HEADLINE> NEWS OF THE WEEK IN REVIEW </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 12-07-02 13:37:00EST (BC-THISWEEK-REVIEW-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> SURPRISE, IT'S THE ECONOMY AGAIN, STUPID!

My wife, Jeri, lunges forward to change the channel, but I wave her off.  ``I like that song,'' I protest as she shoots me a look that (to steal a line from P.G. Wodehouse) would open an oyster at 50 paces.  Yes, yes, I know. ``Sugar Sugar%'(cy the Archies stands alone and unchallenged atop the all-time list of ghastly pop songs. It's one of the tunes the U.S. Army's Psych Ops forces once blared at former Panamanian leadersakes. The Archies were a quintet of cartoon characters with, if I remember correctly, Jughead on drums.  Still _ when ``Sugar Sugar'' pops up on the radio, I don't think of any of that. I'm transported back to the summer of 1969, when my mom, my sisters, my friend Greg and I were packed into an overloaded Ford Fairlane station wagon en route to D.L. Bliss State Park at Lake Tahoe. Cringe if you will at the brain-damaging lyrics (``Sugar sugar, ah honey honey/ You are my candy girl/ And you've got me wanting you`') but to me they bring to mind pine-scented mountain air, the mustiness of an old canvas tent and a Pavlovian salivation at the thought of s'mores.  Never underestimate the power of a bad pop song. As Dave Barry once wrote, ``Your brain, as part of its lifelong effort to drive you insane, insists on remembering the songs you hate and playing them over and over and over.'' But, if you let them, these tunes can summon up surprisingly vivid travel memories, in much the same way certain smells evoke a much deeper, more sensual recollection than a photo ever could. Like it or not, these inescapably grating tunes are the subconscious sound tracks of our lives.  As anyone who's traveled outside the United States knows, bad American pop songs are almost as ubiquitous an export as bad American movies. The more saccharine the tune, the more imbecilic the lyrics, the faster it races up the pop charts from Kiev to Kuala Lumpur. Appallingly awful pop songs, apparently, are the world's language.  You can let these songs drive you mad, or you can do what I do: treat them as souvenirs of your travels _ cthat Lake Tahoe camping trip are ``In the Year 2525'' by Zager and Evans (``Ain't gonna need your teeth, won't need your eyes/ You won't find a thing to chew/ Nobody's gonna look at you'') and ``Young Girl'' by Gary Puckett and The Union Gap (``[o}733irl, get out of my mind/ My love for you is way out of line.'') But that one aCvu66 10627::0 20920964299760 12$617nfusing it with the 1969 Gary Puckett hit, ``This Girl is a Woman Now,'' which, as Barry points out, is almost exactly the same song.  ``Good Morning Starshine'' by Oliver has lyrics that make ``Sugar Sugar'' sound like Cole Porter (``Gliddy glib gloopy/Nibby nabby noopy''), but to me it's the souvenir of another family camping trip, to Yosemite. When I hear it, I see cloud shadows scudding across the face of Half Dome and feel the cool tingle in the air after a crackling, booming thunderstorm. Let others jam their fingers in their ears and make yucky faces; the song always makes me smile.  New Zealanders are among my favorite people on Earth, not least because of their wholehearted, unapologetic embrace of syrupy pop songs. It goes with their unaffected, un-ironic, un-postmodernist national character. To the rest of us these tunes are guilty pleasures; to the Kiwis they're merely pleasures. New Zealand was the first country I ever visited outside the United States, the place where the wanderlust bug bit me good and hard. On that trip, in 1982, the song everyone was humming was the almost unbearably chirpy ``Hands Up!'' (``Hands up, baby, hands up/ Gimme your heart, gimme gimme your heart, gimme gimme''), which, I believe, at the time was the theme song for the All Blacks, the national rugby team. Whenever I hear it, I think of white-eyebrowed men in tweed jackets with matching shorts and knee socks, Maori bus drivers with Cockney accents and that feeling of the whole world opening before me, like a fabulous present I was unwrapping. (To others, ``Hands Up!'' no doubt conjures memories of Club Med; it's become their unofficial theme song.) Several years later, when I returned to New Zealand, the No.1 song on the pop charts was Madonna's ``True Blue'' (``I've had other lips/ I've sailed a thousand ships/ But no matter where I go/ You're the one for me, baby, this I know''), a sugary ditty that even hard-core Madonna fans in this country disown. No matter. When I hear it I'm mentally downing the last sip of DB Lager and getting ready to go tramping on the Routeburn Track.  Janet Jackson's ``Nasty Boys'' (``I don't like no nasty car/ I don't like a nasty food, huh/ Ooh ooh yeah/ The only nasty thing I like is the nasty groove, huh'') sends me back to 1986 and a wretched London hostel where Jeri and I began our first around-the-world adventure. There were speakers in the hallways, and they always seemed to be blaring that song. When I hear it now, I'm wrapped again in my cheap towel, padding down the hallway to the moldy communal shower. (And such is the cleansing power of memory that even this thought brings a grin to my face.)  In the summer of 1990, Chris DeBurgh's ``Lady in Red'' (``I've never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight/ I've never seen you shine so bright'') seemed to be on every radio in the Mediterranean world, and when I hear it now I'm mentally strolling through the faded lobby of the Grand Hotel in Cairo, hopping off a Greek ferry on the island of Paros or riding a long-distance Turkish bus, slathering on the sweet-smelling lemon cologne they pass around.  Far from covering my ears when these songs come on the radio, I've actually sought them out. I've burned them all onto a handy CD I can popffer it to the Pentagon in case they ever need to smoke Osama bin Laden out of his cave.

That's what they're thinking as well. And we're not going to cut and run if I'm in the Oval Office,'' he said.  He addressed the annual convention of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, which includes executives of more than 1,500 papers.  Hours earlier, 68 people were killed when a series of car bombs detonated in the British-controlled city of Basra in southern Iraq and at least four people were killed in a suicide bombing at Saudi national police headquarters in Riyadh.  ``There was a terrorist act. ... And they just blew up innocent Iraqis. Well, they attacked in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. ... And they attack all the time,'' Bush said. ``They'd like to attack us again as well, by the way.''  Although his prevailing message was serious, Bush at times was jocular. It was one of the rare instances as president where Bush addressed a large group not dominated by his own supporters.  Bush, who has said he prefers to get his news from trusted aides, playfully addressed the newspaper executives as ``members of the Politburo,'' the central committee that controlled the Communist Party in the former Soviet Union. And he joked that he welcomed a chance to duck their questions.  Bush was asked how he will convince Americans the war against terrorism can be won.  ``I can understand why they think we're going to get hit again. They saw what happened in Madrid. This is a hard country to defend,'' Bush said.  After outlining efforts by the Homeland Security Department and others to safeguard the nation and extolling the Patriot Act, Bush concluded, ``We just got to stay on the offense, is what we've got to do.''  He urged the editors to see the movie ``Osama,'' the story of a young girl in Afghanistan during the Taliban rule who disguises herself as a boy to earn money for her family.  ``It's hard for the American mentality to grasp how barbaric the Taliban was toward women in Afghanistan.

One consequence could be longer airport security lines this summer as vacationers add to the traffic and not enough screeners are on duty to expedite lines after layoffs by the Transportation Sesu2aty Administration. ``The good news is we're coming back to pre-9/11 levels,'' said James C. May, the president of the Air Transport Association. ``This summer, we're looking at loads of roughly 65 million passengers a month for a sustained time,'' he said. ``But we're also looking at 6,000 fewer screeners. He said his group, the airline industry's main trade organization, was speaking with TSA officials to try to ''findpated after the terrorist bombings on Madrid trains March 11, though some businesses reported short-term declines. ''Overall, dyhe number of tourists to Madrid was up 7.9 percent for March,`` Antonio Nieto, general manager of tourism for the Madrid region, said in an interview Sunday at the World Travel and Tourism Council annual summit in Qatar.  MORE FOREIGN VISITORS TO U.S.  Leisure and business travelers to the United States from overseas rose 5 percent in January over January 2003, according to the Commerce Department. The biggest national increase, 11 percent, came from Britons. Japanese arrivals rose 9 percent in January and visits from Germany were up 8 percent. Meanwhile, analysts at the World Travel and Tourism meeting in Qatar predicted that as foreign travel expands into new markets, the United States will continue to see growth in overseas visitors in the coming decade, while the growth rate of Americans going abroad should remain relatively flat.  PHILADELPHIA HERE THEY COME  Reacting, as expected, to the arrival of Southwest Airlines, which starts operations in Philadelphia next week, US Airways slashed fares at its hub there and issued a statement noting that US Air, unlike Southwest, is a network carrier with routes offering ''nonstop service to 106 destinations`` in North America and ''10 European destinations from Philadelphia.`` In announcing lower fares (and the abandonment of Saturday night stay requirements) to battle Southwest on competitive routes, US Air also noted that its customers get ''advance seat assignments.`` Colleen Barrett, the president and chief operating officer of Southwest, which is known for its ''cattle call`` seating in which passengers take any available seat, described her company as ''simply ecstatic`` about coming to Philadelphia.  SONG ADDS FRILLS  Increasingly, low-fare airlines are adding amenities even as their network competitors cut back. Song, the low-fare carrier created by Delta Air Lines, said it had completed installation0o&amp; in-flight entertainment systems on its 36 airplanes.

The committee's cHaibman, GaryA.0Hack, dean of the School of Design at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote a four-page letter of recommendations March 10, but nearly two months later few people have seen it.  This includes Rob Tuchman, the Hale and Dorr lawyer who has co-chaired Mayor Menino's Artery Completion Task Force for years. ``This is a stealth organization,'' Tuchman said. The committee and the Turnpike Authority seem so hobbled by process considerations, he added, that ``we are losing all the benefit of the substance.''  And benefit there is, at least potentially.  The Hack letter, after praising much of the design work that has gone into the two North End xaRo parcels straddling Hanover Street, {ays he new parks is ``not well integrated with the park design,'' he writes.  The YMCA building needs public access and room for pedestrian passage on both sides of the parcel, the letter says. And the Bulfinch Triangle area just south of North Station should be developed with buildings having multiple entrances to encourage street life.  Overall, the letter emphasizes the committee's conviction about ``how vitally important it is to maintain a sense of continuity along the entire length of the corridor and connecting to the Charles River Basin.''  These and other recommendations from the Design Advisory Committee are significant and deserve a wider airing. With design work proceeding on various parts of the greenway, every passing week lessens the opportunity for the level of inspired coordination this project must have if it is to reach its potential.  For instance, the current design work is going forward under contracts that focus on the new park parcels themselves so the design teams are not putting as much effort as they should into coordinating with adjacent properties. Likewise, there needs to be better-integrated planning that pulls the four sets of park parcels, the ramp parcels, the development parcels, and the adjacent properties into a whole that is designed and programmed with high ambition.  Hack's letter calls for the greenway to be ``of an international design standard in terms of quality, identity, implementation, and durability.''  It still can be that, but not if the goal is to get the job finished with minimal fuss and at minimal cost. The goal must be excellence. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20040503.0046 type=story > <DATELINE> 05-03-04 19:16:00EDT (BC-LADN-BUDGET-ALL) </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200405.gz

And he's a jet-setting, spike-haired playboy who's been involved with such high-profile women as Swedish film star Britt Ekland and model Rachel Hunter.  These days, Stewart, who regularly vacations in Palm Beach, probably needs such opportunities for escape. In the past few years, his career has taken an unexpectedly busy turn, thanks to his platinum-selling albums of standards, It Had to Be You: The Great American Songbook and As Time Goes By: The Great American Songbook Volume II.  A third volume, featuring such songs as Stardust, Blue Moon and 'S Wonderful, is in the works.  I do believe it's better than the other two put together, Stewart says without hesitation. The first one I did -- I sang with no confidence. As the albums have come to be blockbusters, I've gone, 'Wow, people actually like it.' So I'm much more comfortable with the material.  Which is not to say that Stewart, whose classic hits include Maggie May, You Wear It Well, Downtown Train and You're in My Heart, has forsaken his rock 'n' roll past.  Among his current projects is an album with Rolling Stones guitarist Ron Wood, whose friendship with Stewart goes back to their days in the '70s British band Faces.  It's called 'You Strum and I'll Sing,'  Stewart says of the long-simmering recording, though he concedes we'll be in wheelchairs by the time it comes out.  A Faces boxed set  Also in the works: a four-CD Faces retrospective, which Stewart calls amazing.  I was listening to it for two hours yesterday. They've dug up some wonderful BBC archive tapes. (Faces keyboardist) Ian McLagan spent four years putting this stuff together, Stewart reports. It might sound biased, but so be it: It's the best boxed set I've ever seen.  Perhaps it's not an empty boast, given the growing acclaim for Faces, a band that also included drummer Kenny Jones, who later joined The Who. But why did the group, whose hits included Stewart's classic Stay With Me, have such a short stint of six years?  I think we took it as far as we could, mainly because if we stayed together, we'd all be dead. Our livers would have packed up, Stewart recalls of the band's reckless run.  Still, Stewart's distinct interpretive abilities were largely shaped during his time with Faces. He says there's no particular trick to finding the right song for his raggedly telling voice.  It's almost like trying on a suit and a pair of shoes and a shirt and tie. All the components (have to fit): the lyrics, the melody, what the song is about, he says.  The challenge becomes all the greater when it comes to the great American songbook, Stewart adds. You can get some of these songs from that era that are a little bit too -- how can I say? -- a little too Liberace, a little too Broadwayish. Most of the songs I've done on all three albums have got a little edge to them.  Stewart includes a selection of standards on his current tour, replete with a set -- in the second half of the show -- that recalls the Big Band ballroom era. But he doesn't neglect his other standards -- that is, the rock and pop ones.  And he brings back an old favorite from his catalog -- Cat Stevens' The First Cut Is the Deepest, which was recently made popular again by Sheryl Crow.  She did a good version, Stewart says. But I thought if Sheryl has done it and it's become a Top 10 hit, I just want people to know that I did it first.  A deeper appreciation  Actually, it's something of a small miracle that Stewart is singing at all these days. In 2000, he underwent surgery for thyroid cancer -- and his voice was nearly lost forever.  It really was scary, he recalls. It came just out of the blue. I was lucky, because they caught it early, and I was in and out of the hospital in 24 hours. (But) there was a point I couldn't sing a bloody note. You almost have to re-teach yourself how to sing. When they cut through the muscles in your throat, you go through what they call muscle memory loss. Your muscles forget how to tell your vocal box what to do.  But when he recovered, Stewart found a hidden benefit: His voice had deepened. It's given me a (certain) tonality, which is why I can do these American songbook things. I don't think I could have done them 20 years ago, he says.  Stewart's new life also includes a relatively new beau. He's been with Penny Lancaster, a leggy model and photographer, for about five years. (They met, he notes, the night he broke up with former wife Rachel Hunter.)  Stewart describes Lancaster as pretty much his biggest fan: She's known to stand in the first few rows at his concerts, rather than wait backstage, so she can see him in action and take a few pictures.  She has been kicked out a couple of times, Stewart notes, explaining that her height poses something of an issue for the audience members seated behind her. She's had her back scratched and all sorts of things. What we have to do now (is) give her a security guard whenever she goes in the audience.  And, yes, Lancaster is a big fan of Palm Beach as well: In fact, she shot an exercise video here when the couple was previously in town. That said, Stewart's history on the island goes back well before Lancaster -- to the early '90s.  We were in the middle of a winter tour. I was in New York. I was beginning to get a bit sick, and someone suggested going down to Palm Beach, he recalls. I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton and fell in love with that and started looking for a house.  There's just one problem with the island, Stewart hints: Even with his wealth, he has trouble keeping up with the Joneses.  I'm the smallest house on the beach! he says of his Palm Beach estate, which he purchased for $7 million. All the houses up the road, they're in the $50, $60 and $70 million (range).  Stewart has thought about starting fresh -- perhaps tearing down his manse and building another. But his five kids, particularly his three youngest ones -- Ruby, Renee and Liam -- have stopped him.  They said, 'We all grew up in this house. It's got far too many memories,'  Stewart concludes.  Charles Passy writes for The Palm Beach Post.

The business travel industry is certainly in a recovery mode, said Matthew Davis, the director of global consulting for American Express. As demand continues to increase, domestic air fares could rise 1 percent to 3 percent, the survey said. Other recent surveys have shown that corporate travel managers are keeping the pressure on domestic prices by continuing to increase their use of cheaper nonrefundable advance-purchase fares that formerly were categorized as leisure-market fares. International business-class fares, meanwhile, are expected to rise 2 percent to 5 percent, the survey said. In North America, corporate rates for hotels in the mid and upper ranges are expected to rise as much as 3 percent. Business-travel growth trends on trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific trips, as well as travel to South America, said Davis, who added: These trends, we believe, will place upward pressure on prices as demand begins to outpace supply. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"

Trained as a neurologist, he found a position at St. Elizabeth's, a large mental hospital in Washington, D.C., which, like most institutions then simply warehoused the mentally ill. Freeman was appalled at this waste of human potential. Convinced that mental illness stemmed from organic causes, he searched for a neurological solution and found it in a new procedure, developed by a Portuguese doctor and eventual Nobel laureate, Egas Moniz, who simply cut through neural pathways in the frontal lobes that, he believed, produced harmful or obsessive behavior. Freeman, who dismissed psychoanalysis as a sheer waste of time, jumped at Moniz's new procedure. Here was something tangible, something that an organicist like myself could understand and appreciate, he later wrote. A vision of the future unfolded. He formed a partnership with a skilled neurosurgeon, James Watts, and very quickly developed his own procedure, prefrontal lobotomy, which entailed drilling two holes in the skull, above the left and right frontal lobes, and then removing a dozen cores of white neural fibers. </P> 	nyt_eng_200501.gz

IRAQ (Baghdad) -- A Marine transport helicopter crashed in bad weather early Wednesday morning in the desert near the Jordanian border, killing 31 soldiers aboard.

IRAQ-BUSH (Washington) -- President Bush said Wednesday that the elections this weekend in Iraq mark a grand moment in Iraqi history that he described as part of a global march toward freedom. Yet he acknowledged that Iraqis themselves have not yet taken the initiative in defending their country and may doubt Washington's will to prevail against the insurgency. By David E. Sanger.  An early version has moved.  With NYT photos 5-7.  IRAQ-BUSH-MOOD (Washington) -- President Bush's opening statement at his news conference on Wednesday was striking for what it left out: any mention of the 31 Marines who died the night before in a helicopter crash in Iraq, the largest loss of American lives in a single incident since the war began. Bush instead focused on his long-term goal of ending tyranny in our world, and then cast the upcoming Iraqi election on Sunday, a critical test of his claim that the country is on the path to stability, as part of a march of freedom around the globe. The election was a grand moment in Iraqi history, the president said, adding that if had told the reporters in the room a few years before that the Iraqi people would be voting, you would look at me like some of you still look at me, with a kind of blank expression.

CHILE-PENSIONS (Santiago, Chile) -- Nearly 25 years ago, Chile embarked on a sweeping social experiment that has since been emulated in a score of other countries. Rather than finance pensions through a system to which workers, employers and the state all contributed, individual workers were asked to pay 10 percent of their salaries to private investment accounts under their own control. Under the Chilean program, which President Bush has cited as a model for his own plans to overhaul Social Security, the promise was that such investments would deliver monthly pension benefits larger than what the traditional system could possibly hope to offer. But now that the first generation of workers to depend on the new system is beginning to retire, Chile is finding that it is falling far short of what was originally advertised. By Larry Rohter.  REEFERS:  TERROR-EUROPE (Paris) -- France said Wednesday it had smashed an Islamist militant cell that was recruiting fighters to fight in Iraq.

MIDEAST (Jerusalem) -- Senior Israeli and Palestinian aides resumed public meetings on Wednesday, and Israel agreed to suspend the pinpoint killings of Palestinian militants, further signs of warming relations with the new Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. The meeting of the senior aides was announced publicly as a senior American diplomat, William J. Burns, arrived here after talks with the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak.

RICE-CONFIRM (Washington) -- Condoleezza Rice, the Cold War scholar who served as President Bush's foreign affairs tutor during the 2000 campaign and later became the architect of his policy in Iraq, was expected to be sworn in as secretary of state Wednesday evening, hours after the Senate confirmed her by a vote of 85-13.

The meeting of the senior aides was announced publicly as a senior American diplomat, William J. Burns, arrived here after talks with the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak. By Steven Erlanger.  EXP-RICE-CONFIRM (Washington) -- Condoleezza Rice, the Cold War scholar who served as President Bush's foreign affairs tutor during the 2000 campaign and later became the architect of his policy in Iraq, was expected to be sworn in as secretary of state Wednesday evening, hours after the Senate confirmed her by a vote of 85-13. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.  EXP-CALIF-TRAINS (Glendale, Calif.) -- A commuter train smashed into an SUV left on the tracks by a suicidal man early Wednesday, sending the train off the rails in a wreck that killed 10 people and injured about 200, authorities said. Dozens of the injured were in critical condition. (Summary from wires.) By John N. Broder and Charlie LeDuff.  EXP-CHILE-PENSIONS (Santiago, Chile) -- Nearly 25 years ago, Chile embarked on a sweeping social experiment that has since been emulated in a score of other countries. Rather than finance pensions through a system to which workers, employers and the state all contributed, individual workers were asked to pay 10 percent of their salaries to private investment accounts under their own control. The promise was that such investments would deliver monthly pension benefits larger than what the traditional system could possibly hope to offer. But now that the first generation of workers to depend on the new system is beginning to retire, Chile is finding that it is falling far short of what was originally advertised. By Larry Rohter.  EXP-TYCO-TRIAL (New York) -- Prosecutors in the fraud trial of the former top executives of Tyco International accused the two men Wednesday of systematically stealing millions of dollars in bonuses. The two defendants -- L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive, and Mark H. Swartz, the former finance chief -- are accused of stealing unauthorized bonuses and loans and of defrauding shareholders by selling stock they inflated by misrepresenting Tyco's financial condition. By Andrew Ross Sorkin.  EXP-ECON-FORUM (Davos, Switzerland) -- As the world's most rarefied talk-shop opened for business here on Wednesday, two things were as clear as the Alpine air: the sinking dollar and soaring deficits in the United States are Topic A at this year's conference of the World Economic Forum. By Mark Landler.  EXP-HEALTHSOUTH-OUTLOOK (Birmingham, Ala.) -- Despite the discovery of $2.6 billion in fraudulent accounting and a platoon of senior officers who pleaded guilty, HealthSouth has succeeded in recruiting experienced new senior executives, avoided bankruptcy, placated bondholders and bankers and restored morale among downcast employees, who have all along kept its hospitals and clinics operating.

TOP  Lede story:  IRAQ (Baghdad) -- A Marine transport helicopter crashed early Wednesday in the desert near the Jordanian border, killing 31 soldiers aboard. With the deaths of six other American soldiers elsewhere in Iraq, it was the deadliest single day for the United States since the invasion 22 months ago. By Dexter Filkins.

Yet he acknowledged that Iraqis themselves had not yet taken the initiative in defending their country and might doubt Washington's will to prevail against the insurgency. By David E. Sanger.  With NYT photos 5-7.  (An early lede has moved in i news file; the 1stld-writethru will be filed by 9 p.m.)  Linked at bottom to:  IRAQ-BUSH-MOOD (Washington) -- President Bush's opening statement at his news conference on Wednesday was striking for what it left out: any mention of the 31 soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Iraq, the largest loss of American lives in a single incident since the war began. Bush instead focused on his long-term goal of ending tyranny in our world, and then cast the Iraqi election on Sunday, a critical test of his claim that the country is on the path to stability, as part of a march of freedom around the globe. The election is a grand moment in Iraqi history, the president said, adding that if had told the reporters in the room a few years before that the Iraqi people would be voting, you would look at me like some of you still look at me, with a kind of blank expression. By Elisabeth Bumiller.  CALIF-TRAINS (Glendale, Calif.) -- A man the police described as deranged and bent on suicide abandoned a light truck on a heavily-traveled commuter rail track here early Wednesday, causing a violent wreck involving three trains that left at least 10 people dead and nearly 200 injured.By John N. Broder.  CHILE-PENSIONS (Santiago, Chile) -- Nearly 25 years ago, Chile embarked on a sweeping social experiment that has since been emulated in a score of other countries. Rather than finance pensions through a system to which workers, employers and the state all contributed, individual workers were asked to pay 10 percent of their salaries to private investment accounts under their own control. Under the Chilean program, which President Bush has cited as a model for his own plans to overhaul Social Security, the promise was that such investments would deliver monthly pension benefits larger than what the traditional system could possibly hope to offer. But now that the first generation of workers to depend on the new system is beginning to retire, Chile is finding that it is falling far short of what was originally advertised. By Larry Rohter.  OBIT-JOHNSON (Undated) -- Philip Johnson, at once the elder statesman and the enfant terrible of American architecture, died Wednesday at the Glass House , the celebrated estate he built for himself in New Canaan, Conn., He was 98. By Paul Goldberger.  MIDEAST (Jerusalem) -- Senior Israeli and Palestinian aides resumed public meetings on Wednesday, and Israel agreed to suspend the pinpoint killings of Palestinian militants, further signs of warming relations with the new Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. The meeting of the senior aides was announced publicly as a senior American diplomat, William J. Burns, arrived here after talks with the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak. Burns, the assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs, said that the U.S. is determined to do everything we can to contribute to the opportunity of progress between the Palestinians and Israelis. He said that he and Mubarak agreed that we have the most promising opportunity for progress for several years. By Steven Erlanger.

It followed a week of intense debate over the Bush administration's Iraq policy, as Senate Democrats used her confirmation to assail the White House, and Rice herself, as misleading at best and untruthful at worst.

IRAQ-BAGHDAD (Baghdad) -- When American troops entered Baghdad and overthrew the government of Saddam Hussein 21 months ago, Raad al-Naqib felt he was free at last. But Naqib, a 46-year-old dentist, will not vote on Sunday, when Iraqis will have their first opportunity in a generation to participate in an election with no predetermined outcome. It was, he said, far too dangerous when insurgent groups have warned that they will target anybody who approaches a polling station. Starkly put, Baghdad is not under control, either of the Iraqi interim government or the American military. By John F. Burns.  With photos NYT12-14 sent 1/21.  (Scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in i news file.)  IRAQ-TERROR (Basra, Iraq) -- More than two-thirds of all Iraqis live in districts that have experienced insurgent attacks in the past month, according to an analysis of new intelligence data. More than half the Iraqis live in districts -- roughly the equivalent of large counties in the United States -- that suffered an average of at least one attack every three days in the 30 days ending Jan. 22, according to the analysis, which was conducted by The New York Times using Iraqi census data and information gathered by two private security companies with extensive access to intelligence on Iraq.

But Naqib, a 46-year-old dentist, will not vote on Sunday, when Iraqis will have their first opportunity in a generation to participate in an election with no predetermined outcome. It was, he said, far too dangerous when insurgent groups have warned that they will target anybody who approaches a polling station. Starkly put, Baghdad is not under control, either of the Iraqi interim government or the American military. By John F. Burns.  With photos NYT12-14 sent 1/21.  IRAQ-TERROR (Basra, Iraq) -- More than two-thirds of all Iraqis live in districts that have experienced insurgent attacks in the past month, according to an analysis of new intelligence data. More than half the Iraqis live in districts -- roughly the equivalent of large counties in the United States -- that suffered an average of at least one attack every three days in the 30 days ending Jan. 22, according to the analysis, which was conducted by The New York Times using Iraqi census data and information gathered by two private security companies with extensive access to intelligence on Iraq.

By Paul Goldberger.  With photos NYT 4, 8.  FINANCIAL  (Coded f)  CHILE-PENSIONS (Santiago, Chile) -- Nearly 25 years ago, Chile embarked on a sweeping social experiment that has since been emulated in a score of other countries. Rather than finance pensions through a system to which workers, employers and the state all contributed, individual workers were asked to pay 10 percent of their salaries to private investment accounts under their own control. Under the Chilean program, which President Bush has cited as a model for his own plans to overhaul Social Security, the promise was that such investments would deliver monthly pension benefits larger than what the traditional system could possibly hope to offer. But now that the first generation of workers to depend on the new system is beginning to retire, Chile is finding that it is falling far short of what was originally advertised. By Larry Rohter.

STOCKS-MARKETPLACE (Undated) -- Profits this earnings season are better than expected so far, but have not been able to pull stocks out of a new year slump. Even though stocks have climbed the last two days, there are plenty of signs that the market may stay in the doldrums for a while. By Jonathan Fuerbringer.  HEALTHSOUTH-OUTLOOK (Undated) -- The HealthSouth sign was removed without fanfare from the Surgery Center of Des Moines shortly after federal investigators seized truckloads of financial records at the company's headquarters in Birmingham, Ala., two years ago. But the doctors at the Des Moines clinic are still partners with the big national health care chain, doing more cataract and plastic surgery procedures than ever, they say. With the help of doctors like the Iowa group and cash from patients around the country, HealthSouth has survived a business and public relations nightmare that began two years ago when the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission accused the company of accounting fraud totaling $2.6 billion.

CIRCUITS  (Coded a)  CIR-APPLE-HELP (San Francisco) -- It was just past noon on a recent weekday at the Apple store here, and the Genius Bar was buzzing. At one end of the 40-foot maple counter, a 25-year-old cherub-faced Genius in a black T-shirt spoke soothingly to a middle-aged customer whose iPod kept erasing songs. At the other end of the bar, another Genius, who appeared as amiable as he was knowledgeable, greeted a couple who had arrived with an ailing PowerBook.  In an age when human help of any kind is hard to come by, the eight or nine Geniuses -- Apple's term for its in-store technical support staff -- on duty at any given time here are a welcome anomaly. In fact, go to any of the 102 Apple-owned retail stores around the country and, if you are willing to wait, you will be treated to what is an increasingly rare service: free, face-to-face technical support.

But the fiber now generates meager returns on the local market, and most young people move in search of other work. Since July, however, a team volunteers has banded together to help Cochiraya sell its alpaca to the world. They have offered advice on how to set up and maintain an e-commerce site, arrange for international payments, draft a business plan and even choose a logo. Cochiraya is one of about 50 villages participating in a virtual aid network known as Nabuur, a Dutch nongovernmental organization that was begun in 2001. By Douglas Heingartner.  CIR-IPOD-DISCOS (Chicago) -- Whose iPod is this? yelled the manager. Is this the Pogues? Bar managers do not typically ask their clientele about the songs pumping out of the bar's music system. They tend to have intimate knowledge of the jukebox or leave any music questions to the DJ. But that is changing in some bars, where customers who bring their own iPods have started to take control of the tunes. By Ashlee Vance.  CIR-CELLPHONE-DJ (Undated) -- The cellphone already serves as a camera, a calendar and a portable arcade. But it could take on a new set of uses if a group of audio engineers, software designers and marketers has its way. The music-mixing software now on millions of PC's may soon become a fixture on cellphones and hand-held organizers. These early programs are crude, able to blend only a few sound snippets at a time. But by allowing amateur DJ's to create mixes with their cellphones, the software could offer musicians a new level of autonomy, and give nonmusicians another reason to stare at the little screens in their hands.

CIR-INTERNET-BROWSERS (Undated) -- The basics of browers: IT used to be that Internet Explorer, the one-size-fits-all Web browser bundled with every copy of Microsoft Windows, was enough for most people. It worked well and cost nothing. Who needed anything else? That attitude is fading these days as consumers begin to realize that other browsers offer more features, better security and greater freedom. Bells and whistles, perhaps, but some of them can be surprisingly useful. The number of competitors to Internet Explorer is surprisingly large and diverse. By Peter Wayner.  CIR-MICRO-DEVICES (Undated) -- What's Next: Bharat Bhushnan, at Ohio States, in seeking to design micro-scale devices, finds in the lotus leaf a secret to low friction and repelling water. The trick is not in smoothness but in the leaf's microscopic bumps. By Ian Austen.  Editors, there is no CIR-Q&amp;A this week.  HOME  (Coded l)  DESIGN-BLOGS (Undated) -- On a recent day, the cyber design world was buzzing. Bloggers at Apartmenttherapy.com had discovered the mystery manufacturer of a hot paint color called Fresh Melon Green. Over at treehugger.com, bamboo coffins were the talk of the moment. A post at Designsponge.com, meanwhile, praised ceramic bowls that double as wall sconces and endorsed all furniture on wheels. Now that blogs, or Web journals, influence just about everything from politics to buying gadgets, they are starting to transform the once clubby design community By Lockhart Steele.  ANTIQUE-GLASS-REPAIR (New York) -- Ted Foscolo was devastated when movers accidentally dropped a 19th-century glass chandelier he had bought for $16,000, destroying the fixture's blown glass shade with its engraved starburst pattern. I picked the chandelier for the beauty of the glass, said Foscolo, who tried to glue the fragments back together. Luckily, an Internet search led him to Michael Davis, a glass artist in Long Island City, who specializes in conjuring replicas of antique glass, sometimes armed only with shards. Equal parts detective, glass historian and technical wizard, Davis is among a handful of people in the country who have become specialized craftsmen in the field of reproducing glass masterpieces and beloved heirlooms. Part of the process, Davis explains, is deducing how the glass was created and channeling the glassmaker. By Andrea Truippin.

, he adds,	 We put vastly more money into advising today, says Peter H. Likins, the university's president. With the Integrated Learning Center, we've made a massive commitment in terms of physical facilities and the advising that goes with it. But, he adds, it is a more Darwinian environment, a public university of this character. Of foundering students, he says: We always have the feeling that if we had the resources to recognize them as they fall through, to pick them up, in the way that a liberal arts college does, we could keep them from falling. But we don't have those resources. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz

Nor, he says, do they have to. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, he says,	 Richard H. Hersh, former president of Trinity College and Hobart and William Smith colleges, refers to this situation as a mutual nonaggression pact. Professors see teaching as a requirement they have to fulfill to do the research they prefer, he says, so the professor goes into class and doesn't ask much of students, who in return don't ask much of the professor. The professor gives out reasonably high grades as a way of camouflaging that this bargain has been struck, his evaluations will be satisfactory, and students don't complain about grades or about whether they've learned much. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, you know,	 About the purpose of college, he says: You go so you can get a job and make money when you're older. But at the same time you get life experiences that are priceless, like networking. He expects that to pay off: I've made so many connections I never would have been able to make without it, and these are all my friends and people that I know from the bars and from classes and, you know, people that I've hung out with that later in life I'm going to be able to call on and be like: 'I know you have a job with this company. Do you know if they're hiring, or can you get me an application? Can I use you as a reference?' </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, you know,	 Bhalla, who grew up in the Los Angeles suburb of Oak Park, chose Arizona to get away from the ground rules of home. My parents always needed to know where I was, what I was doing, he says. 'You can't do this, you can't do that.' And they'd always be hounding me to do my homework. So I always had someone to tell me what to do. He went a little crazy with his new independence. My parents are, you know, 1,000 miles away, he says. Other than phone calls, they can't really watch me, or see what I'm doing. Here it's: 'We're not going to watch you. Turn it in if you want; if you don't turn it in, we don't care.' </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, he says,	 A month after the interview, in December, Bhalla graduated after four and a half years in college. He moved to Miami to room with a college friend. He has just started working for a pharmaceutical sales company (base salary: $30,000). For the most part, he says, he goes out only on Friday and Saturday nights. I definitely miss my college days, he says. They were the best four years of my life! </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, he adds,	 Like many young people, Keith Caywood equates a college diploma with a higher salary. You go to college because you don't want middle- and lower-class jobs, because you don't want to sit there making $20,000 to $40,000 a year, he says. And that, he adds, necessitates that piece of paper. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, you know,	 Caywood remembers how overwhelmed he felt when he arrived on campus, the classic nerd with a map and no idea where Old Main was. Course offerings were dizzying. You didn't have someone, you know, leading you by the hand, he says. No one actually sat there and grabbed me and said: 'Hey, you know, this is a scary place. Come with me, and we'll talk this through.' I went ahead and just kind of jumped in, grabbed a schedule and took what I thought was needed. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz

I got bored and I would talk with my friend. There was no interaction, no one making sure I was obtaining the knowledge that I should have been getting. He remembers one class in particular, with 60 or 70 students, taught by a graduate teaching assistant. We never actually saw a real professor, he says, just people who were either working on their graduate degrees or in between jobs, people just three or four years older than I am. As he relives the memory, his voice rises in indignation, and several customers look up from their drinks. We're reading a book and giving our insights, but how can you get a good view of people's insights when there's 60 people in there? he asks. How can a TA read 60 papers over the weekend and give each a fair shake? It would have been nicer if I had someone more credible, someone I had to call 'professor' who's finished his degrees and has published books. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, I did,	 Caywood lasted until midterm exams and then enrolled at Pima Community College. I had smaller classes, anywhere from 18 to 25 students, he says. The teachers knew me by name and were willing to meet me after class and work on projects. It was a whole lot better. Still only 18, he got a job in a bar when he boasted to the manager that he could lift a full keg above his head. She challenged me to prove it, I did, and she hired me, he says. He finished the year at Pima but dropped out to work full time. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, you know,	 Anonymity is not an issue if you're a 6-foot-11 African-American basketball player on a campus that is mad about the Wildcats and whose student body is only 3.6 percent African-American. The state's high school player of the year, Channing Frye began his freshman year on an athletic scholarship. Easing the acclimation to campus life, he roomed with a teammate, and two others lived across the hall. A junior on the team, Jason Gardner, gave him the ABCs. Channing, here's what you do, Gardner told him. You find the hottest girl you can find and you ask her where your class is, even if you know where it is. That's just how you break the ice and, you know, get comfortable with it. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, you know,	 An assistant coach and the adviser helped Frye select classes. They told him which professors to avoid. To be honest, he says, I think it's better both for the athlete and for the professor if the professor doesn't want to adjust the rules or, you know, be a little more lenient toward the athlete and his schedule. During the season, players may miss classes and tests two or three days a week because of road trips. Sometimes you can't take a test, Frye explains, because you can't open your eyes because you're so tired from getting back at 2 or 3 in the morning. He does not think athletes get a free ride; he says they walk a tougher path than the conventional student because of the responsibility they shoulder. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz

She decided that she needed to start over somewhere else, but meanwhile, she enrolled in a semester's worth of general-education requirements -- sampling, as she puts it. Students must take 11 courses in different areas: math, composition, a second language, natural science, humanities, art, non-Western studies, traditions and cultures and individuals and society. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, she says,	 She appreciates the university's general-education requirement, she says, although everyone complains about it. It is important for two reasons: Students who may have found what they want to do are forced to get a deeper understanding, so they get more context to explain things to others. And students who don't know what they want to do can experiment and study lots of subjects. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, she says,	 Schmidt ended up having the experience that Arizona administrators would like all students to go through. We don't want our students to feel like they came here and just got a trade, but that they left here educated, says Vito, the dean of students. Even if you're going to be a scientist, it's important to have some experience with the humanities and other traditions and cultures. The university's fundamental belief is that being educated means, she says, having a sense of wisdom and culture, which is different than just being prepared to go into a job. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz

In his lectures, he poses problems that students answer with hand-held transponders supplied by the university: If students understand the concept, he moves on; if not, they discuss it in small groups and then revisit the problem.

More sunlight -- and thus heat -- reaching the ground could help explain the record-high global temperatures reported in the 1990s and could accelerate the warming trend in the future. But the findings also highlight a major gap in the understanding of climate. Scientists do not know what caused the dimming and subsequent brightening or how these changes the rest of the climate system. By Kenneth Chang.  FINANCIAL  (Coded f)  HEALTHCARE-BURDEN (Undated) -- The relentless rise in health care costs is causing states and businesses to fight over whose job it is to insure workers. And nearly two dozen states, struggling with the growing burden of providing public assistance to people with jobs but no insurance, are looking to shift more of the financial burden onto the workers' employers. By Reed Abelson.  With photos NYT39,40.  IBM-EUROPE (Frankfurt, Germany) -- In the fierce global battle for jobs and capital, Western Europe just lost another round. IBM announced cuts of 10,000 to 13,000 jobs will fall heaviest on Germany, France, Britain and Italy, where the costs are high and growth prospects have recently been dim. IBM said Thursday that at least 60 percent of the cuts would be in its European operation. That division, which is based in Paris and also covers Africa and the Middle East, employs 100,000 people. By Mark Landler.  DECEPTION-NORRIS-COLUMN (Undated) -- To an extent not understood by investors or regulators, it appears that insurance companies, as well as investment and commercial banks, had profitable little businesses in what might politely be called financial statement beautification. They sold products that had little or no economic rationale, but that were promoted -- ever so quietly -- as being able to hide losses or smooth earnings. In some cases, the products arguably complied with accounting rules. But the intent was to deceive investors, and in the post-Enron world that is not permissible.

LICENCE-PLATES-COLLECT (Undated) -- Lenny Shiller is a man who cares about historical accuracy. Each of the 50 antique cars he keeps is a testament to his preservationist beliefs -- down to his license plates, each of which is exactly as old as the vehicle that bears it. Such plates confer the final touch of authenticity to an old car. Typically, collectors find them at swap meets, at flea markets or on eBay. The plates may sell for just a few dollars, but using a year of manufacture tag can reveal a surprisingly complex world of legal regulations, automotive history and down-home Americana. By Tim Sultan.  TROPHY-GARDENS (Undated) -- In the Hamptons, where many people already have things like trophy wives and trophy houses, the trophy tree is turning out to be the latest must-have accoutrement. Hedges that screen out prying eyes are being pushed to ridiculous heights, hothouse orchids are trotted outdoors, and the price tags for glamour gardens and mock nature preserves are topping $1 million. And with just weeks to go before Memorial Day, the race to get your instant -- and established-looking -- garden in place is on. By Denny Lee  GOLF-FITNESS (Undated) -- It has been nearly a decade since Tiger Woods exploded onto the professional golf scene and began devouring his opponents with an aggressive, physical style of play. Today, the vision of the PGA Tour pro with his stomach straining at his Sansabelts has all but vanished, replaced by an army of flat-bellied young men with arms like cannons. It was just a matter of time before the golf fitness craze trickled down to the masses. Now, an increasing number of golfers send themselves off to boot camp to improve their games. By Joe Bargmann.

RETIRING-YOUNG (Los Angeles) -- For Rodney Rothman, 31, a former head writer for Late Show With David Letterman, 40 years was too long to wait for retirement. Burned out after years of writing jokes (well, a few years, anyway) and unemployed after the situation comedy he was working on was canceled, Rothman decided to hop off the workaday hamster wheel of life in Manhattan and Los Angeles and give retirement in Florida a try -- at age 28. Care of Roommate Finders, he found a room in the condominium of a widow with two cats and three birds at Century Village, a 775-acre, 16,000-resident retirement community in Boca Raton. From an intellectual property point of view, Rothman's six-month sojourn at Century Village may go down as one of the most productive retirements in history. He has turned his account of life there into a book called Early Bird (Simon &amp; Schuster) and a television pilot under development with NBC Universal; the book was published this week, and Rothman will find out soon whether NBC is going to pick up the TV show. By Warren St. John.  With photo.  RUNAWAY-BRIDES (Undated) -- In the annals of cold feet, there are celebrities like Jennifer Lopez, who thought better of making Ben Affleck husband No. 3 after planning an extravagant wedding. And now there is Jennifer Wilbanks, the runaway bride from Georgia, who set off a huge search-and-rescue by disappearing just days before her wedding day and pretending to have been kidnapped, only to reappear. While Wilbanks' fiance continues to profess his loyalty to her, people in the wedding industry say that in most cases of canceled nuptials, couples split up for good. They say, weddings are called off after a tearful breakup spurred by any number of reasons: infidelity, a last-minute push for a prenuptial agreement, a sense of panic brought on by out-of-control wedding preparations or, very often, the epiphany as the date approaches that this is not Mr. or Ms. Right after all. But the worst part, some say, is dealing with the emotions of a breakup that can be as tough as a divorce. By Mireya Navarro.  With photo.  MODERN-LOVE (Undated) -- I'm a good mother. This is not an idle boast; I have a signed certificate that says so. I earned this de facto mothering license by successfully completing four weeks of court-ordered parent classes. Why did a judge order me to do this? Was I a child abuser? Did I leave my children alone and go out to a bar? Was I on crack? No, I got a divorce. After 12 years of marriage and three children, ages 11, 7 and 4, my college sweetheart and I broke up. In the wake of our separation, I felt as if I might keel over and die from heartbreak. I rarely ate, slept or ventured out. Eventually, however, I began to pull myself together, thinking the worst was surely over. But I was wrong. Seven months into the separation I received a call from my lawyer. Are you sitting down? she asked. My husband, she explained, was seeking full custody of our children on the grounds that I was an unfit mother. By Katie Allison Granju.

They've attacked here twice, and if they're able to do it a third time, it's a major, major victory for them. They're looking to do it in a spectacular way. We have to be on our guard.

A bit more of a nitty-gritty newspaperman, I hope to raise the blinds at The Times in some new ways to allow readers to get a clearer view inside the newsroom process.

"157311"	"I"	"believe"	" I don't think this is a simple tale of incompetence.

"157416"	"I"	"believe"	" The network talking heads have all made their apocalyptic predictions for Southeast Louisiana and according to them, our doom is near. In the end Hurricane Katrina will be measured by her strength, the number of lives she took and the amount of damage she caused. But, I believe, the true measure that matters will be how we react and deal with the aftermath. The homeless will need shelter, the hungry will need food and all victims, volunteers and emergency workers will need support. Help if you can. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"

"157757"	"I"	"believe"	" Rehnquist, who died last week, spent his career standing at the door of the high court, beating down countless Americans, whether they were black or brown, gay or lesbian, Florida voters, or women trying to control their bodies. A half century ago, he wrote a memo as a clerk to Justice Robert Jackson that said the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson separate-but-equal ruling was right and should be reaffirmed. In 1964 he spoke out against desegregation in public accommodations in Phoenix, saying it would result in the unwanted customer and the disliked proprietor ... glowering at one another across the lunch counter. It is, I believe, impossible to justify the sacrifice of even a portion of our historic individual freedom for a purpose such as this. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
"157984"	"I"	"believe"	" Democrats, I believe, believe in fair, open elections, where every vote is counted, whether it's in Florida, or Ohio, or Bergen County, Corzine said at a news conference in the State House, where he unveiled a plan to curb wasteful spending and patronage appointments in New Jersey's myriad governmental authorities. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
"157993"	"I"	"believe"	" When I was a federal prosecutor, I prosecuted a lot of those cases. As a young prosecutor, I was sort of an expert at it in the '70s, and I proved sometimes the interstate commerce by simply putting an agent on there saying there was no gun manufacturer in Alabama. Or it said Made in Italy on it. I remember I got that affirmed one time as proof beyond a reasonable doubt that it was not made in Alabama. So Lopez, I believe, is a good decision. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"

There had been testimony that some creationists believe the Earth was created in seven days, as described in Genesis, with geological formations such as the Grand Canyon resulting from the flood described in the story of Noah and his arc.

NIGER-URANIUM (Washington) -- A closer look at the early doubts expressed by the State Department about the reported sale of uranium from Niger to Iraq. The charge was included in President's Bush State of the Union speech in 2003, and played a part in the decision to invade Iraq. By Eric Lichtblau.  CHINA-EXPLORER (Beijing) -- A much-hyped map was unveiled Monday by a prominent Chinese lawyer and collector, claimed to be a 1763 copy of a map from 1418 proving that Zheng He, a 15th century Chinese explorer, circumnavigated the world long before the European explorers, and discovered America at least 75 years before Columbus. The claim was greeted skeptically by scholars but has generated considerable buzz. By Joseph Kahn.  BIRD-FLU-EUROPE (Rome) -- With outbreaks of bird flu continuing in Turkey, a top U.N. agricultural official recommended Monday that European countries should adopt policies like increased checks of airline passengers and their belongings to prevent the disease from spreading across the Continent. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.  MECCA-BRIDGE (Mina, Saudi Arabia) -- In the valley where the devil once roamed, this narrow stretch of holy land, nestled between mountains of basaltic rock, has long bedeviled the hajj, the pilgrimage that is a duty for devout Muslims. Here, they believe, the devil sought to tempt Abraham into disobeying God as he took his son to be slaughtered, only to be pelted with stones by the prophet. Each year, pilgrims pelt three columns at the site, known as Jamarat, to re-enact the moment in a symbolic rejection of temptation. But the site, where an imposing two-story overpass was built to carry the waves of pilgrims, has also been the scene of one catastrophe after another. Finally, on Sunday, bulldozers rolled in to change all that. The pedestrian bridge will be demolished to make way for a new four-story structure from which pilgrims can carry out the ritual. A Journal by Hassan M. Fattah.  NSA-LEGAL (Washington) -- Several defense lawyers, journalists, political and religious activists and other Americans with Middle East ties are expressing concerns that they might have been monitored under the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance program. And they are wondering whether those efforts were legal. By Eric Lichtblau.  NATIONAL GENERAL  (Will move in a news file.)  KING-BUSH (Washington) -- President Bush saluted the memory of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on Monday, saying that the slain civil rights leader, like Rosa Parks, who died last year, roused the dozing conscience of a complacent nation. By Richard W. Stevenson.  PLAYING-DEAD (Columbus, Ohio) -- Chuck Lamb might be the world's chattiest dead guy. He loves to talk, and his favorite topic is how he is fast becoming the most famous dead body alive. Isn't it incredible? said Lamb, who speaks at a volume that most people reserve for rock concerts. I had no idea it would blow up like this! Lamb became Dead Body Guy on Dec. 5. That is when he put up his Web site, deadbodyguy.com. The site features photos of Lamb playing dead in various scenes around his house. Crushed by his garage door. Electrocuted in the bathtub. One series shows Lamb face-down in a bowl of chicken soup, above a caption that reads Dying from bird flu. By staging his own death, Lamb hopes to attain a modest form of immortality. He says he always wanted to become a famous actor. Instead, at age 47 he finds himself with six children, working as a computer programmer for Nationwide Insurance. By Chris Maag.  With photo.

IRAQ-ITALY (Rome) -- Italy will withdraw its nearly 3,000 troops from Iraq by the year's end, the defense minister said Thursday amid a fiercely fought general election campaign in a nation where the Iraq war is not popular. This is not a retreat, a word that is not part of our vocabulary, the minister, Antonio Martino, told a parliamentary commission. Rather, he called it a dignified and just return. By Ian Fisher.

In the same papers, the special prosecutor in the case, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, accused Russert of selectivity in protecting confidential sources. The papers demonstrate that three of the main figures in Libby's trial have different understandings of how confidential source relationships are formed and protected, and they suggest that the trial may explore and even turn on how the craft of journalism is practiced in Washington.

The State Department has warned Americans against traveling to Haiti because of the continuing instability. And in what amounted to a mass legal protest, the lawyers filed motions in dozens of individual deportation cases, calling on immigration judges to stop the deportations, saying that the lives of their clients were in danger. By Rachel Swarns.  ALITO-CONFIRM (Washington) -- In an indication of how Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr. may fare when the Senate Judiciary Committee votes on his confirmation next Tuesday, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the panel, declared his intention to vote against him. I cannot vote for this nomination, Leahy said. I will not vote for this nomination. Leahy said he was disturbed by Alito's responses during the committee hearings last week on the issues of privacy and conflicts between government and individuals. He also said he believed Alito, who has spent his entire legal career working for the government, would be too deferential to what the senator called his patrons. By David D. Kirkpatrick.  FINANCIAL (f code)  QWEST-NACCHIO-TRIAL (Undated) -- A look at the coming trial in Denver of Qwest's Joseph P. Nacchio, charged with 42 counts of insider trading The decision to pursue one of the last titans of the Internet bubble on insider trading charges may be sign that prosecutors are simplifying their cases and steering clear of complex cases that rely on juries grasping esoteric financial data and efforts to manipulate it. By Ken Belson.  IRAN-OIL (Undated) -- While the international community debates how to deal with Iran's nuclear program, it is the country's oil that is causing concerns to energy analysts these days. Over the weekend, Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, hinted that his country might be willing to use its oil weapon -- meaning it would be willing to curb its oil exports -- if faced with international sanctions. At the same time, some members of the U.S. Senate said Iran should be sanctioned regardless of what that means for oil prices. Such talk is causing waves of anxiety in the oil markets, which have been rattled by Iran's decision to resume its nuclear research at the beginning of the year. By Jad Mouawad.

MERRILL-EARNINGS (Undated) -- Merrill Lynch said Thursday that fourth-quarter profit rose 25 percent as stock-trading revenue and merger advisory fees surged. By Jenny Anderson.  JAPAN-STOCKS (Tokyo) -- Tokyo Stock Exchange executives announced plans to double their computers' capacity for executing and clearing trades by the end of this year, a day after the exchange nearly collapsed under a barrage of electronic orders.  An early lede, on the Thursday rebound in stock prices, has moved.  INDIA-AIRLINES (Bangalore, India) -- India's largest airline, Jet Airways, said it would buy rival Air Sahara for $500 million in cash in the first signs of consolidation in an increasingly competitive airline market. Jet Airways said the combined market share would give Jet Airways half of the domestic market. By Saritha Rai.  DISNEY-PIXAR (Undated) -- Disney is in talks with Pixar that could result in one of three deals: an outright acquisition, a purchase of a stake or a straight-up distribution deal. No transaction is imminent, but Disney is particularly interested in a deal that would gives its parks the rights to Pixar characters. By Laura M. Holson.  RUSSIA-OIL-IPO (London) -- London will be home to what may be one of the largest initial public offerings ever later this year, when the Russian oil giant Rosneft makes its debut on the London Stock Exchange. The listing of Rosneft, expected in June, is one of the most visible rewards yet for London's financial markets, which have embraced the Russian and central Asian companies buoyed by the recent energy and commodities boom. But the rash of IPO's is prompting concerns that London's competitive advantage is thanks in part to less stringent listing requirements than the United States. By Heather Timmons.  HEDGE-RETURNS (Undated) -- The weekly Insider column: The conventional wisdom holds that too much money is pouring into hedge funds and other alternative investments and that returns will diminish as result. Not so fast, says a new study. By Jenny Anderson.

, I suspect,	 Ford Motor Co. slides deeper into that market with plans for shared-platform cars called the Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX. The plan, I suspect, is to start young families out in the Edge and then, when they're a bit older and their wallets are a bit fatter, move them into the Lincoln. To Ford's credit, designers did a nice job of making them look like different cars, not just re-badged editions. Power is in the 250-horsepower range. </P> 	nyt_eng_200601.gz

The job was scheduled to be finished in August 2003, but when she visited in March 2004, with the rental season only two months away, there was still much work to do. Kopriva decided to simply stop the work, but at first the contractor wouldn't give back the keys, she said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200601.gz
, he said,	 Steve Games, chief executive of Prudential California Realty in Southern California, estimated that impulse purchases now make up about 40 percent of his agency's regional sales to buyers whose primary homes are elsewhere. The number of impulsive buyers -- whether motivated by a pleasant vacation or already out looking and ready to buy after one visit -- has shot up in recent years, he said, because there's so much wealth looking for a place to land.

"162138"	"I"	"believe"	" The answer, I believe, is that pundits and policymakers don't talk about the veterans' system because they can't handle the cognitive dissonance. (One prominent commentator started yelling at me when I tried to describe the system's successes in a private conversation.) For the lesson of the VHA's success story -- that a government agency can deliver better care at lower cost than the private sector -- runs completely counter to the pro-privatization, anti-government conventional wisdom that dominates today's Washington. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"

"162786"	"I"	"believe"	" This indefinite imprisonment at Guantanamo Bay is unlawful, Robertson wrote.

"163536"	"I"	"believe"	" I am speaking now of the Americans. The rest of the world, I believe, has a more common view. For them, winning a medal is truly precious. Very often it means they have had the chance to bring honor to their country, and this feeling of pride is usually in inverse proportion to the size of their native land, which makes perfect sense. In the rest of the world, it is all about being on the podium, i.e. finishing in the top 3. I believe that for many foreign athletes the podium is the quest, and it doesn't matter as much as an American might think whether it's gold, silver, or bronze. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"

"164687"	"I"	"believe"	" One other issue bothers me about this mess. The Times' decision to treat Qaissi's claims as credible was influenced by the awareness of similar earlier reports in Vanity Fair and on PBS that had gone unchallenged, Bronner acknowledged to me. But those reports weren't mentioned in The Times until they were invoked in the March 14 story and the Editors' Note. Readers of the original story, I believe, deserved to know that secondary sources were influencing The Times' acceptance of Qaissi's claims. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"

Israel, on the other hand, is convinced of its virtue and believes -- as its leaders have often said -- that its hand has always been extended in peace. It believes it has the most moral army in the world and insists that it goes to unparalleled lengths to avoid harming civilians.

"171858"	"I"	"believe"	" One of the more curious episodes this past week was the surprise return of Michael Olowokandi. Over the summer, Ainge had told Olowokandi's former agent, Bill Duffy, that the Celtics would welcome the big guy back on a make-good contract. Duffy, understandably, thought Olowokandi deserved something better. Olowokandi got nothing better and then, two days before Media Day, Duffy called Celtics basketball operations assistant Frank Burke and told Burke to expect Olowokandi in camp. Burke then told Ainge, who knew nothing of the situation. But the matter got dicier when the Celtics received a call from another prominent agent, whose specialty is placing players in Europe, asking about Olowokandi's whereabouts. That call came on Monday. The response: He's here. Asked about playing for a minimum make-good deal, Olowokandi said, Honestly speaking, what is enough for everyone? That's a highly personalized process and I think I've come to terms with what is enough for me. Playing now is not about the financial incentives. I can go on the record and actually say that. Over the summer, there was a point where I had a conversation with my agent and told him to tell [teams] that I would play as long as they cover my costs. No wonder he's acting as his own agent. Four percent of nothing is, I believe, nothing. Olowokandi's name has been removed from the list of clients on Duffy's website. The two had been together since 1998, when Olowokandi was the No. 1 pick in the draft. I have nothing but respect and admiration for Bill Duffy, Olowokandi said ... The Celtics' thinking regarding the Monday call for Olowokandi was that the agent was going to find a place for Olowokandi to play overseas, possibly in Athens. The Greek city is hosting the 2007 European Final Four and, thus, the top Athens-based teams, notably rivals Panathinaikos and Olympiakos, have beefed up their rosters, hoping to be among the participants in the annual spring affair. Old friend Tony Delk has signed on with Panathinaikos, as has Lithuanian big man Robertas Javtokas, who the Spurs were thinking (hoping?) might come across the pond and play for them this year. (He was the team's second-round pick in 2001, the same year they drafted Tony Parker.) Another old friend, Scoonie Penn, is one of several new faces on Olympiakos, joined by Alex Acker, who was on the Pistons' roster last year (the last pick of the second round of the 2005 draft) and played 35 minutes for the conference runners-up. Olympiakos also signed Lithuanian sharpshooter (is that redundant?) Arvydas Macijauskas, but he tore his left Achilles' tendon two weeks ago and is out for at least five months. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"

"172176"	"I"	"believe"	" A. The normal way brickwork is done is to build a brick wall against the sheathing with a proper cover such as tarpaper or Tyvek, adding brick ties, metal straps mortared into the brick joints and nailed to the sheathing, to keep the brick in position. This is called brick veneer and I think any mason would tell you that this is the only way it is or should be done. That mortar you say is between brick and sheathing is, I believe, what is left of a cap that was mortared on the top of the brick wall to act as a drip edge to keep water away from the sheathing. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172452"	"I"	"believe"	" Q: My wife's desktop connects to the Internet through a Wi-Fi hookup. She is only 7 feet away from the router. There is a television between the router and her Wi-Fi antenna. Her connections to the Internet are very slow, especially relative to mine. At times it is like dial-up service. My computer is wired to the router, and there is no easy way to wire her machine. What could be causing the slowness? We have done all of the things, I believe, to speed up her desktop. I wonder if the TV is causing some sort of interference. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172561"	"I"	"believe"	" It was disappointing, but it was a smart decision -- the right decision, I believe, Carpenter said Monday. They were looking out for my career, not just for one series or one game. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"

"173391"	"I"	"believe"	" She said the terrorist threat was serious, is growing and will, I believe, be with us for a generation. It is a sustained campaign, not a series of isolated incidents. It aims to wear down our will to resist. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173892"	"I"	"believe"	" Mick got exactly two votes that year, and promptly disappeared from the ballot forever. That other vote, I believe, came from my man Revo. It was you, wasn't it, Mr. Reeves? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"174032"	"I"	"believe"	" If it is sufficient to point to a simultaneity of events to prove plagiarism, then we are all plagiarists, and Shakespeare is in big trouble from Petrarch, and Tolstoy stole the material for 'War and Peace,' wrote the Australian writer Thomas Keneally, the author of Schindler's List. Fiction depends on a certain value-added quality created on top of the raw material, and that McEwan has added value beyond the original will, I believe, be richly demonstrated. If not, Keneally added, God help us all. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"

"174367"	"I"	"believe"	" Movies had a major impact on Vidal's development, but the most significant influence was his grandfather, Oklahoma Sen. Thomas Gore.
