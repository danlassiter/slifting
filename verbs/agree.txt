"38670"	"I"	"agree"	" It's harder to make an argument against the Vanguard Quantitative portfolio. This fund seeks to maintain a portfolio that's similar in nature to the S&AMP;P 500, but to exceed the index's return. Over the last five years it has done so, having bested the average by 0.19 percent per year, according to the latest report from Morningstar Mutual funds. In contrast, the Vanguard Index 500 fund has trailed its target by an average 0.18 percent during the same period. But it hasn't always been a smooth road _ the big edge for Quantitative came in 1993, when it beat the index by 3.73 percent; the worst was the next year, when it trailed by 1.93 percent. In the last 10 years, the weakest relative performance of Index 500 was in 1986, when it trailed the index by 0.62 percent. Because of its simpler mission (and dramatically larger asset base) Index 500's expense ratio is usually about 0.20 percent, compared to about 0.48 percent for Quantitative. In the end, I tend to favor Index 500 because it's a plain vanilla product; with its portfolio of 500 stocks, there's less to go wrong, while the managed portfolio of Quantitative, 182 issues at the last Morningstar count, is slightly more volatile. Finally, as in my assessment of Value, when in doubt, I go with the dividend yield, which is 2.10 percent for the Index 500 portfolio compared to 1.92 percent for Quantitative, according to Lipper Analytical Services. Yes, I agree, these are pretty niggling variations. There's a real difference between Index Growth and Index Value, but with this pair, the philosophy and results are very similar. If I were to chose I'd take the plain vanilla Index 500. But it's pretty clear from the record you're not likely to get hurt much with Quantitative, and you could well end up ahead. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"

By Jay Root  DIVINITY-BRITE  FORT WORTH, Texas _ Texas Christian University's Brite Divinity School will undertake a major expansion of its facilities and programs to recruit young people to the ministry and to teach them about non-Christian religions. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Brite officials saw an urgent need to add resources so students can be exposed to ``other religions and cultures'' and play a more diverse role within Christendom, said Anne Bass of Fort Worth, who with Fort Worth businessman Paul Ray Jr. is leading a campaign to raise $13 million for construction.

"143772"	"we"	"agree"	" At some point, we agree, if you're on board long enough, you stop caring about what time it is where you are headed.

"148423"	"they"	"agree"	" Beyond their concerns about the legitimacy of the election lie a host of other disagreements with the president. They express pessimism about the upcoming election in Iraq, ask why no one has been held accountable for prewar intelligence errors, and voice fears that Bush's proposed changes to Social Security will lead to benefit cuts down the road. His educational and economic policies, they agree, are a disaster for the nonrich. This incredible skewing toward the haves, getting people to vote against their own interests: It is incredible, says Rothstein. The president's syntax also comes under fire: It is embarrassing to hear him speak, says Baughman. He can't put two sentences together. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"

"153051"	"I"	"agree"	" When people say if you don't play defense, you can't win titles, I agree, Phoenix Coach Mike D'Antoni said Monday, a day after the Suns lost Game 1 to the San Antonio Spurs, 121-114. But our defense doesn't have to be as good as some other teams'. We've got to stop them from scoring 115. We should be able to do that. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"159779"	"they"	"agree"	" The solution, they agree, is to give correct but simple answers. Parents have a tendency to blurt out more than what's needed: answering a question about nipples, say, with a flustered, halting lecture on sexual pleasure. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"159817"	"they"	"agree"	" White House advisers convene secret sessions about the political dangers of revelations that American troops committed atrocities in the war zone, and about whether the president can delicately intervene in the investigation. In the face of an increasingly unpopular war, they wonder at the impact on support at home. The best way out of the war, they agree, is to prop up a new government that they hope can unite the fractured foreign land. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"

"165396"	"I"	"agree"	" Oh. In that case, I agree, it is an unacceptable situation. But Americans are equally guilty because we benefit from it.

, she said,	 Mangini participated in a variety of sports as a child. When she was in fifth grade, she turned down an invitation to join a gymnastics traveling team because, she said, she did not want to concentrate on one interest to the exclusion of others.

, he said,	 Another example of Sprecher's research was a memorandum he sent Storey on Sept. 21, 1945, which included a list of 535 people the Nazis listed as members of the opposition in 1939. If these people were later persecuted, he said, it would prove conspiracy. </P> 	nyt_eng_200605.gz
