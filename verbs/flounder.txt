"106141"	"I"	"flounder"	" I do fine as long as the old landmarks are in sight. But when I get toward the edge of the map, I flounder, taking one wrong turn after another, eventually finding myself sitting on a park bench across from a little bakery that's doing a bang-up business, the only place in town I've seen with lines spilling out the door. A steady stream of children on bikes, older couples on foot, and families in small cars that they leave idling and double-parked on the street go in, leaving moments later with armfuls of bread and pastries. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
