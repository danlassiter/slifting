"6644"	"she"	"advises"	" Speakerphone power games are ``just pathetic,'' Ms. Baldrige said in a nonspeakerphone interview. ``It's so sad that people are so insecure they have to pull stunts like that.'' When it's absolutely necessary to use a speakerphone, she advises, explain why, ask the other parties to the conversation whether they mind being on the speakerphone and tell them who else is in the room. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199410.gz"

FEMALE-STUDENT-GUIDE  UNDATED _ College women have come a long way since Elizabeth Eldridge penned her 1936 guidebook for young ladies on campus, ``CO-EDiquette: Poise and Popularity for Every Girl.'' In it, she advises, ``A girl's best defense is her helplessness; it appeals to a man (while he is still sober) more than shrewishness.'' Clearly, it's time for a new guide, and two recent Barnard graduates have obliged with 614 pages of practical advice titled ``The College Woman's Handbook.'' By LINDA SWIFT. Story has moved in ``l'' lifestyle category.  FASHION-MESSAGES  UNDATED _ Skip the shrink. It's the closet that needs analyzing. Clothing can be more powerful than a handshake and more revealing than a diary. Like it or not, the way people cover their bodies sends out vital messages about themselves, positive or negative, writer Toby Fischer-Mirkin says. ``Fashion is powerful,'' she says. ``By understanding the clothes that work well for you in business and personal relationships, you can enhance both your private and professional life.'' By KELLY DeGARMO. Story has moved in ``l'' lifestyle category.  BOOK-LEAKEY FAMILY  UNDATED _ Hard upon European dominion over Africa came the missionaries. Thus it was that Canon and Mrs. Harry Leakey left turn-of-the-century England to establish a mission in British East Africa. Here in 1903 was born Louis S.B. Leakey, principal figure of this lengthy, marvelously entertaining and informative study: ``Ancestral Passions: The Leakey Family and the Quest for Humankind's Beginnings.'' By ARTHUR K. BERLINER. Story will move in ``e'' entertainment category.  BOOK-ALBERT SPEER  UNDATED _ In a season of few ``important'' books, here is one. Perhaps only now, historically distanced, can we begin to fathom the Third Reich in all its horrific particulars. Gitta Sereny's post-mortem testimony should be read alongside Albert Speer's own books. If only for those, we should be everlastingly grateful that he wasn't hanged. By LARRY SWINDELL. Story will move in ``e'' entertainment category.  BIZ-BOOKS  UNDATED _ Some say the best way to learn is through our mistakes. If that's true, then American business managers can learn a lot from a new book by renowned management consultant Alan Weiss ... if they can stomach it. All Weiss does is point out their mistakes over the past 10 or so years, with no holds barred, and then offer quite a different take on how to fix them. His book is ``Our Emperors Have No Clothes: Incredibly stupid things corporate executives have done while reengineering, restructuring, downsizing, TQM'ing, team-building, and empowering ... in order to cover their ifs, ands or `buts.''' By TERESA McUSIC. Story has moved in ``f'' financial category.  WANDERINGS-COLUMN  UNDATED _ Notes from the travel world, including items on South Padre Island, Disney World, Ireland, Eseeola Lodge, N.C., various halls of fame, St. Thomas and Natchitoches, La.

"44496"	"she"	"advises"	" For her, the forbidden ``F'' word is ``feel,'' and an addiction to ``I'' signals indecision. Skip the ``touchy-feely'' syntax, she advises, and head for the real subject. People who say, ``I (think)(guess)(feel) we need more time,'' are perceived as uncertain; people who say, ``We need more time,'' or even, ``More time is needed,'' are not. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"

"78096"	"it"	"advises"	" In the most extreme weather, it advises, there would be even less service, and ``the smartest travel plan is to stay home.'' Riders are advised to listen to radio and television for reports on which level of service to expect. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"
"78699"	"she"	"advises"	" Courtney Love is one rock performer who has never been at a loss for words. And in ``Not Bad for a Girl,'' Lisa Rose Apramian's noisy documentary study of female hard-rockers, she is given the movie's parting shot. Instead of having to get the football captain, she advises, ``Be the football captain.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"
"92181"	"he"	"advises"	" Not surprisingly, many of Wodehouse's lyrics are wonderfully effervescent, flirtatious and frivolous. In ``Shimmy With Me,'' from 1922, he advises, ``Just make it feel like you swallowed an eel _ that will help with the shimmy.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"

"94861"	"he"	"advises"	" While Sadeh notes that many children will develop healthy sleep patterns regardless of their parents' behavior, he still has some advice for parents to help that happen. To give babies a chance to learn to fall asleep on their own, he advises, parents should refrain from exaggerated and quick reactions to light crying while they are falling asleep, should create bedtime rituals and routines and should establish quality time with the child, even if that requires coping with sibling rivalry. They should also be wary of adopting a pattern of communal sleeping with the baby as a response to the infant's sleep problems and should foster the bond between the child and the father, which, Sadeh said, ``greatly helps in preventing'' a child's sleep difficulties. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"
"103068"	"he"	"advises"	" ``What you've accomplished gives you a track record, and downplaying it doesn't make sense,'' he said. ``Sometimes people do it out of loss of self-esteem, a feeling of `no one wants to hire me.''' But, he advises, ``Don't sell yourself short.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"110084"	"she"	"advises"	" So go ahead, she advises, sleep with a man on the first date. But if you're going do it, haz lo bien (do it good) and rock his world. And if you want, forget having children. Si, nena. Yes, girl. It's OK for a Latina to be childless by choice. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"122530"	"he"	"advises"	" Thomas says parents with a newborn should be investing most of their college fund in equities because there is an 18-year horizon to take advantage of market ups and downs. But he says it is wise to begin moving money to bonds within five to six years of college. One year before college, most of the money should be in bonds, he advises, with the first semester's tuition in a money market account. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"132141"	"he"	"advises"	" Begin slowly, he advises, with just a few of the species you have observed in your own woods. Don't buy one of each. ``Choose a few that are well adapted to your property, and get a number of them,'' he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"135254"	"he"	"advises"	" In a few weeks, the wart grows ``tired,'' says Litt, and disappears, leaving no scar. But be sure, he advises, to ``treat only one digit at a time, the largest first.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"136916"	"it"	"advises"	" The closest thing to a prince in the series is Mr. Big, an attractive but realistically flawed businessman with a healthy sense of humor and a roving eye. But he is no romantic savior. In lieu of salvation, ``Sex and the City'' promotes a sensible, post-feminist agenda in which female friendship and loyalty are placed on a par with the true love that eludes its seekers. At the end of the day, it advises, you may not have been living your dream, but you still have your friends. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"142993"	"he"	"advises"	" Listen Up came on after the season premiere of Still Standing, whose male lead, Mark Addy, wears a T-shirt that says, I'm only here for the beer. Faced with a depressed teenage daughter, he advises, Try to be happier, while on his second beer of the day. The son sums up what's wrong with his dad: Too much drinkin', not enough thinkin'. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"145261"	"it"	"advises"	" The American Institute of Architects has not taken an official stand on matchmakers, said a spokesman, Phil Simon. But along with a list of its members, the organization has provided guidelines at its Web site (www.aia.org) on how to select and negotiate with an architect. Choose an architect as carefully as you would choose a dentist or a doctor, the site suggests. Clients, it advises, should ask frank questions, interview three to five prospective architects and ask owners of buildings they admire for recommendations. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"145467"	"she"	"advises"	" Children in their '50s and '60s, she advises, might initiate the subject in terms of their own planning. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"145567"	"he"	"advises"	" Lagasse thinks all turkeys are delicious if you cook them right. The biggest mistake is overcooking them. Invest in a meat thermometer, he advises, and roast the turkey to 155 degrees F, then let it rest for 20 to 30 minutes prior to carving (it will continue cooking; it should reach 160 to 165 degrees F) -- and you should end up with a moist bird. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"155799"	"she"	"advises"	" In the ad, the sister describes the Lane character as voluptuous, because skinny in a way that only movie stars are wouldn't necessarily attract the right kind of man. Perkins deadpans her way to several funny moments as a romantic mercenary who urges Sarah to date a student's sexy dad (Dermot Mulroney). Ethics, she advises, are for chumps. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"162783"	"he"	"advises"	" Americans' growing concern about their food supply can be a motivator to curing at home, he says. Restaurateurs who buy from small farms and tell their customers about it are educating the public about naturally raised meat. Perhaps there's a chance we can recapture an art we are in danger of losing, Ruhlman says. Just understanding how food works can reduce your costs. You don't need to buy beef tenderloin for a party. You can make a pate or terrine for much less, he advises, or make sausages that are cheaper than the fancy ones available - and better, he adds. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"173504"	"she"	"advises"	" Then, she advises, talk to your parents about what they would like to have happen if, for instance, they couldn't take care of their yard, became ill and needed help, or fell and needed to be hospitalized. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
