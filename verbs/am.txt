LOPEZ-ACTRESS (Los Angeles) _ Having it both ways is a sweet rarity for actresses. It's a near impossibility for Latina actresses. Jennifer Lopez must be going into sugar shock. Not only is she Hollywood's highest paid Latina _ at a reported $1 million for the movie biography of slain Tejano music star Selena, which starts filming in September _ she's crossing the ethnic barrier to win roles that weren't originally conceived as Latin. Lopez isn't working with bad people, either. She can currently be seen as Robin Williams' crush-provoking fifth grade teacher in Francis Ford Coppola's ``Jack.'' She'll next appear in the film noir thriller ``Blood and Wine'' opposite no less than Jack Nicholson. Lopez just finished shooting the Amazon action adventure ``Anaconda'' with Jon Voight and has signed to play a femme fatale in Oliver Stone's upcoming ``Stray Dogs.'' ``On a roll... Yeah, I am,'' the 25-year-old New Yorker said, following with a can-you-believe-it? laugh and one of her camera captivating grins. ``Doing good. But it's funny; my career hasn't been like, all of a sudden it started happening. It's more like, all of a sudden I started getting press. I've been working steadily since high school.'' By Bob Strauss. (Will move in the ``e'' entertainment news file.) . LATINA-MAGAZINE (Los Angeles) _ As a teen-ager, Christy Haubegger saw page after page of blue-eyed blondes in the women's magazines she read for fashion and makeup tips. ``I clearly remember reading magazines and never seeing anyone with brown eyes in terms of beauty and fashion,'' Haubegger said. ``I felt as though I was missing something.'' So after graduating from Stanford law school, Haubegger, a 27-year-old Mexican American, launched Latina, the only bilingual women's magazine aimed at the more than 8 million Hispanic women in the United States. By Jenifer Hanrahan. (Will move in the ``e'' entertainment news file.) . TARZAN-TV (Los Angeles) _ Tarzan, the King of the Jungle, is heading home. Jane's one-time main squeeze will be back on television in ``Tarzan: The Epic Adventures,'' a syndicated show produced by Keller Entertainment of Encino. Joe Lara, who starred in Keller's CBS movie, ``Tarzan in Manhattan,'' is back in the title role. The stories in the 21 hourlong episodes are supposed to follow the novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs more closely than other incarnations of Tarzan. It is alleged to be more elegant and futuristic. There will be no chimp and Tarzan will not be a one-Jane man. By Keith Marder.

Sorry, no, Mr. Vice President, we're not authorized to accept collect calls any more, but good luck with the bed and breakfast, says the Burned-Out Newspapercreatures Guild, and this is BONG Bull No. 413!  HER MAJESTY'S BOFFINS. Jeremy Condliffe, Editor of the Congleton (Cheshire, England) Chronicle Series, offered, ``When I worked in Malvern, there was (and still is) a top secret Ministry of Defence research base, and whenever we wrote about it, we always called the scientists `top boffins.' I went there on an open day and was being shown some complicated laser apparatus (I probably called it a killer death ray, whatever it was) and the scientist showing me round asked: `Please, could you call me a top boffin? Whenever one of my colleagues is mentioned, he always walks about for a day or so saying, ``I'm a top boffin, I am,'''  ``So there you go _ cliches can be appreciated,'' Condliffe declared.  (``Boffin'' is no cliche on the colonial side of the pond, but a U.S. scientist or techie called a top boffin, after phoning Public Relations for a ruling, probably would react the same as in Malvern.)  Condliffe adds that it is dangerous in Congleton to slide into cliches such as ``is set to,'' though he admits that as a reporter he dueled rivals on how many times each could get ``big hearted fund raisers'' into any one edition of the Malvern Gazette.  MOTTOS. Travis Smith, once the student editor of the Strathcona-Tweedsmuir Mandatum in Okotoks, Alberta, Canada confesses that his high school was a small private institution where students could charge books and supplies _ and the bi-weekly newspaper _ to a tab that got sent home to Dad. Its motto: ``Make your parents pay.''  _ The Abilene (Texas) Reporter-News still carries the legend: ``Without or with offense to friends or foes, we sketch your world exactly as it goes,'' which is attributed to Byron, reports Pennie Boyett, columnist and feature writer for the Arlington (Texas) Morning News.  _ The Atlanta Journal still claims it ``covers Dixie like the dew.''  _ In Philadelphia, the Bulletin's slogan was ``In Philadelphia, Nearly Everybody Reads the Bulletin.'' Apparently, nearly was not nearly enough, notes Joel Albert.  THE READERS ARE ONTO US. In late February a reader rattled the Chicago Tribune for describing a big snowstorm as a ``blizzard of biblical proportions.'' The letter to the editor commented: ``The Bible contains accounts of plagues, windstorms, storms at sea, earthquakes and, of course, the Great Flood--hence `flood of biblical proportions.' But try as I might, I can't find mention of a blizzard. Or even a major snowstorm. Could this be called a flaky metaphor?''  _ Somebody named Ghaar of broadcast noted, ``Re: the discussion of buildings that `rock' when bombed, though they do not. They do rock in earthquakes. Anybody who lives here in San Francisco can attest to that. Equally absurd is what happens to the whole town after the bomb has gone off. It reels. One radio station and two television news channels informed me only this morning that Atlanta was reeling after the most recent bomb rocked it. I have always thought as I was returning to my hotel room following too-convivial evenings at news directors' conventions in Atlanta that it was I who was reeling. I'm pleased to know that I was perfectly all right. Atlanta was reeling. But, then, unexpected events generally seem to leave their cities doing so. It's been a problem for Boulder for some time, in spite of its being in its nest at the foot of the snow-capped Rockies. When that snow fell, by the way, it was white stuff.''  LOU, THE WORLD'S THE GRIMMER FOR YOUR PASSING. Pat Washburn of the Press Herald Online, Portland, Maine, reports, ``The `St. Lou' story reminds me of the old days (late '80s) back at the Middlesex News (Framingham, Mass.). We had a 3 a.m. press start. Night editors crept in at 7 p.m., and the layout crowd slunk in around 10. A few of us made a cult of a Lou Grant episode in which, for various reasons, Lou has to work a night shift. I may not remember this accurately, but here's how I think it went:  ``All the regular people leave, and Lou stays at his desk working while a bunch of weird night people start arriving. One of them slithers up to Lou and says, `I wouldn't sit at that desk if I were you. A guy DIED at that desk.'  ```What?' says Lou. `I've been working at this desk for two years!'  ```Yeah, but HE WAS ON NIGHTS.'''  _ There's a book of Lou Grant trivia. Sample: What Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist was the model for Rossi? Los Angeles Times media critic David Shaw was among those interviewed by the producers during the research phase of Lou Grant. Actor Robert Walden modeled his performance in part on Shaw, whom he shadowed for weeks. Ask for ``Lou Grant: The Making of TV's Top Newspaper Drama'' (Syracuse University Press, 1996), recommends Douglass K. Daniel. of Kansas State University.  _ Peter R. Pepinsky of Auburn University states, ``I assumed a `St. Lou' was a tribute to the renowned St. Louis Post-Dispatch copy desk, credited with such monumental contributions to copy editing as `city limit' instead of `city limits,' since a city is typically bordeered by one line or limit.''  _ Walter Wiley observes, ``I can remember trying to share a Lou Grant laugh with a friend on the rim at the AM Sacramento Bee and being told he'd never even heard of Lou, much less seen the show what with the hours of the copy desk on an AM.''  _ James Bettinger, former city editor at the Riverside Press-Enterprise and San Jose Mercury News, reflects, ``I agree (Lou Grant) was a pretty good portrayal of a city editor (and I was a city editor at the time). My favorite scene was in the middle of some crisis _ I can't remember what the crisis was, but it was major _ and Lou answers the phone: `City desk. What? Well, do you mean ``stationery'' like a letter or ``stationary'' like something that isn't moving?' The true mark of a city editor: answering a spelling question in the middle of chaos.  ``Of course, it also had its weirdly UNrealistic moments, too. Like the time when Mrs. Pynchon had the paper up for sale and she brought into her confidence not only the managing editor, but the city editor. All over America newshounds were chortling at that one. Speaking of which, why doesn't anyone chortle any more?''  AND THEN, SOMEBODY ALWAYS REMINDS US THAT LOU WAS FICTION. Chris Bunch growls, ``I think you're being entirely too kindly about the unlamented Lou Grant, especially in regards to `the plots being realistic, but always with the Hollywood spoilers.' When I was working with my former partner as mercenary hacks in Hollyweird, our then-agent made several attempts to hit up Lou Grant for a script. He finally was told that `well, uh, we're a little uncomfortable having writers in who actually have a lot of experience in real journalism.' And let's never forget the immortal moment when Asner poses nobly against the camera, firming up ALL his chins, and orders a lackey to tear out a full page ad so a story's got enough room to jump to. The NEW editor wouldn't say that.''  COMIX SECTION.

And so are a lot of horseshoe companies, but you never see a barefoot horse! They'll always need photographers! They'll always need creative minds who know the city like you do! They'll always need guys who work cheap!''  PANEL FOUR: Typo continues, ``Where would mass communications be without massive guys like you, Boss!? Without you writing the cutlines, who would ever need to yell Stop the Presses!?

, he said,	 Times Staff Writer Military veterans, many companies will tell you, make great hires. They're hardworking, resourceful and respectful. And then there's the patriotic undercurrent in hiring someone who served our country. But the high unemployment rate for the youngest veterans nationally, 15.6 percent in 2005 indicates some are falling through the cracks after coming home from tours overseas. Moreover, many young veterans who work feel stuck in jobs that are demeaning or don't pay them what they're worth. Jimmy King joined the Army in 2001 when he was 21 because he wanted to get out of St. Petersburg and knew that working in customer service for U-Haul wasn't the best way to do it. An infantryman, he spent 11 months in Iraq. Those are the guys who really put their life on the line, he said, describing his tour. Finding terrorists, in the trenches that was my job. He finished his three-year commitment in late 2004, when he was 24. Now, he makes $8 an hour at a Pinellas Park warehouse. He's moved in with his parents to save money and can't figure out why he can't seem to find a better job. I wonder if they say, 'All he can do is shoot guns,'  King said. We don't really have any civilian qualifications besides police work, and I really don't want to be a police officer. He hopes that enrolling at Pinellas Technical Education Center in the fall will help his job prospects. Since 1995, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, veterans ages 20 to 24 have had a higher rate of unemployment than nonveterans in the same age bracket, usually by 1 to 2 percentage points. In 2004, the discrepancy jumped: Young veterans had a national unemployment rate of 13.6 percent, compared with 9.4 percent for nonveterans. In 2005, the unemployment rate was 15.6 percent for young veterans, 8.7 percent for nonveterans in the same age range. The trend is especially notable because military veterans collectively consistently have a lower unemployment rate than nonveterans. In 2005, veterans all ages included had a national unemployment rate of 4 percent, compared with 4.6 percent for nonveterans. Mike Bollent, vice president and general manager of Digital Reception Services in Tampa, said his reasoning for hiring veterans is partly ideological. About half of the 250 employees for his company, which installs satellite dishes, are military veterans. By contrast, military veterans comprise about 10 percent of the national labor force. Without them defending us, we wouldn't have this company, Bollent said. If I have two identically qualified candidates and one of them has gone to war, the choice seems obvious. Besides, Bollent said, veterans have been instilled with a good work ethic, so hiring them is a sound business decision. Many employers echo his sentiments. Moreover, veterans can tap into several government and community programs geared toward helping them find work. Why, then, do the youngest veterans have such a high rate of unemployment? Many, apparently, simply don't know what they want to do. They tend to be really smart, really driven guys and girls, said Maj. Kevin Farrell of the Tampa branch of Marine For Life, a transition assistance program for honorably discharged Marines. But they tend to lack a little direction. Especially the young guys. They come to me and say, 'I want a job,'  Farrell said.  'Well, what do you want to do?' 'I'll do anything.' 'Well, what are your skills?' 'I'm a Marine.'  Many of the youngest veterans didn't go to college or dropped out, he said. They join the service because they don't have a life plan; when their military commitment is up, they're lost again and they have no college degree or real civilian job experience. Jason Wayne Owens, 26, of Leto joined the Marines right after high school, so he had never hunted for a career in the civilian world. Discharged two years ago, he is looking for a job in electronics. I have the knowledge, said Owens, who was a radio technician in the Marines. I don't have the experience. Humberto Alvarez, a service coordinator at Sun State International Trucks in Tampa, said the most important things veterans bring to employers are soft skills and the ability to learn quickly. For example, Alvarez said, if they're going to be mechanics, I couldn't care less about their mechanical degree. They just need to be mechanically apt. Besides, he said, many military trades are virtually identical to the civilian world's. Alvarez, a retired Navy chief petty officer, spent 22 years on submarines. I was an electrician, he said. It just so happened that the vessel I was on was a combat vessel. That's not much consolation for Vincent Hall, 27, of Seffner. He spent eight years fueling aircraft for the Navy. Now he wants to try something different, maybe work with computers or in law enforcement. But Hall, who joined the Navy out of high school, hasn't had much luck since he was discharged in November. He pulled up Monster.com and went down the list, but he's working as a toll booth operator for $6.40 an hour. He just wants a job that will let him live comfortably. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he said,	 Some young veterans aren't as easy to please, said Farrell of Marine For Life, which is why they can't find jobs. Part of his job, he said, is aligning the young Marines' expectations with reality. You would not believe how many of these guys, 20 to 24 years old, with no college education, no transferable skills you wouldn't believe how many of them tell me they want to make $60,000 or $80,000 in their first jobs. With tax-free benefits, housing allowances and medical insurance, service members are well compensated, he said. By the time you reach a certain level in the military, he said, it's very difficult to match your military pay in the civilian sector. Besides, Farrell said, after fighting in a war and bearing life-and-death responsibilities, it can seem demeaning to take an entry-level position. Some young veterans might not work because they're going to college full time. Others might take time to travel or rest. After surviving boot camp, being shipped to a foreign country and dodging enemy fire, a timecard might not be their first priority when they get home. The last thing they need first thing they get back is some boss yelling at them, said Sgt. Carlos Jimenez, 26, who trains enlistees for the Florida National Guard in Tampa. King, the former infantryman from St. Petersburg, used to think about rejoining the Army. Iraq was tough, but at least he had job security. He changes his mind, he said, whenever he watches the news. What about the older vets? Unlike many of the youngest vets, older veterans often leave careers that they wish to resume in order to fulfill their military service. The government, to an extent, protects their jobs while they are away. Under the Uniformed Services Employment and Re-employment Rights Act of 1994, employees may be absent from their civilian jobs for military duty and retain re-employment rights for up to five years, with exceptions. Returning service members are supposed to be re-employed in the job they would have attained had they not been absent for military service, with the same seniority, status and pay. Federal law requires employers to make reasonable efforts, such as training or retraining, to enable returning veterans to refresh or upgrade the skills they'll need to qualify for re-employment.

, you know,	 One of the books I found was a moving and understated novel about loss called Grief. It is the story of a professor who tries to move on after the death of his mother in Florida for whom he was the prime caretaker. He goes to teach in Washington, D.C., where he struggles with the guilt of survival so common to his generation ravaged by AIDS but which in his case is compounded by the fact that he never told his mother that he was gay. The novel by Andrew Holleran explores people's ongoing need for intimacy, the loss of which we feel most acutely when we become orphans. When your parents die, you know, your audience is gone, a friend tells the narrator, urging him to find a life partner. But I think somebody has to care about you someone has to think you matter. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz

, he said,	 Israel's military goal is to push Hezbollah away from the border so it cannot strike at Israel, Regev said. The political goal, he said, is to carry out a U.N. Security Council resolution, passed two years ago, that calls for the Lebanese government to take control of its southern border and disarm militias, like Hezbollah. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he said,	 Olmert, then, clearly decided that the policy of restraint exercised by Sharon was not working, and he would lay down new rules. He would not negotiate with terrorists, he said, for the freedom of the soldier kidnapped in Gaza, and he would punish the Gazans for the continuing rocket attacks, going after militants and rocket stores with force. He said that he would act with restraint but that the campaign would be long and the impact very, very painful. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz

Israelis begin to understand his logic -- he starts working harshly and it's logical, and after a few days, he stops, to give a chance for internal Arab processes, then strikes again, Bechor said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz

, she said,	 Derya said her crime was to become involved with a boy she had met at school. She knew the risks: Her aunt had been killed by her grandfather for seeing a boy.

Then came the threatening text messages, sent by her brothers and uncles, sometimes 15 a day. Derya said they were the equivalent of a death sentence. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz

, she says,	 Parents feel this way, she says, in part because they've been spoiled by too many years of childless living. Earlier generations began raising children just after their teens and had such large families that they were busy with their kids well into middle age. But today's adults have children later and have fewer of them, spending decades instead soused on cosmopolitans and scattering their disposable income on Caribbean vacations -- all of which makes buckling down to the financial and personal constraints of life with children extremely difficult. The situation is the worst among -- Guess who? -- highly educated professional women, for whom life with little people who have no respect for time management and no ability to generate performance reviews is as much a shock, Whitehead writes, as was Victorian brides' first experience of sex. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
