"99522"	"she"	"snaps"	" That Dern and Macy both look about as Jewish as Jackie Chan lends the film a fablelike tone that's not always easy to sustain. One neat touch, however, is the way Lawrence and Gertrude aren't portrayed as noble martyrs, suddenly sympathetic to the Jewish plight. He declares he's no ``hebe'' more than once, and when they're turned away from a restricted hotel, she snaps, ``Nobody makes a Jew out of me and gets away with it.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"103348"	"it"	"snaps"	" Review: Hard to know how many ways there are to say ``delightful,'' but every single one of them applies to this intoxicating French comedy romance. Joyously directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, it snaps, crackles and pops with imagination and heart. Amelie (Audrey Tautou) is a shy waitress living in Montmartre who decides to do some secret do-gooding. But she's unable to do for herself what she so easily does for others. Jeunet's ever-inventive direction deserves a lot of credit, but so does his star. She's a sprite, a pixie, a gamine, a waif. She may even remind you of a certain other Audrey. One named Hepburn. (ERG) 2 hours. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"

Skarsgaard, a talented actor who realizes he's signed up for a losing game, gives us a method Hrothgar, funny, odd, and occasionally moving. Think you need a beer? he asks the newly arrived hero; later, quizzed about the monster's motivations, he snaps, Oh, Beowulf, it's a [expletive] troll! Maybe someone looked at it wrong! Truly, this is a king with huge tracts of land. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
