The political leaders of this town have decided to thumb their noses at $500,000 in federal money that would have brightened this town's main shopping street. As Greenwich's leaders saw it, retail shops that sold $400 pocketbooks, and outposts of upscale chains like Saks Fifth Avenue, Ralph Lauren and Banana Republic, could afford to do their own fixing.

Every day, more than two tons of cocaine flows through Mexico and the Caribbean, with one-third of that ending up in the United States. Once it was ferried by small planes. Now, to evade American radar surveillance, more and more cocaine floats north in the holds of freighters, fishing boats and yachts.

"88792"	"he"	"will"	" This is not what there was to see and hear in Symphony Hall Tuesday night. Helfgott is a radiant, endearing and exasperating presence who runs from the stage door to the piano, bobbing his head delightedly at the audience. As he plays, he talks constantly, moans, groans, conducts, and signals with his whole body musical effects he does not bother to create with his hands. One of his mantras is ``must concentrate,'' which is something he almost never does. If he wants to scratch or adjust his shirt, he will, even if it means leaving out melody notes of the Chopin F-Minor Ballade in order to do so; his right hand simply returned and joined up with the left again. In the Ballade, Helfgott threw his arms up with a tremendous flourish before the coda; the audience assumed the piece was over, although this was a harmonic moment where no piece in F-minor could possibly end. Helfgott grinned, stood up, acknowledged the applause, then reseated himself to resume where he had left off. So much for musical narrative and structure. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199703.gz"

The production had use of a black panther but also relied on a Chinese leopard and a mountain lion, which were dyed black. Leopards are arboreal, nocturnal and completely untrainable, Schrader says.

FOREIGN  With story BC-CONGO-UNREST-NYT  Just a week ago, Kanyabayonga was a teeming town of more than 30,000 people. On Friday afternoon, after several days of fierce clashes, Kanyabayonga was virtually abandoned, a ghost town except for some brave souls who sneaked back to check on their homes and a few dozen ragtag soldiers who had been ordered to stay behind to guard the place.  After six years the tears still come easily among the families of 428 children infected with HIV while under the care of Bulgarian nurses at a hospital here. But their sorrow is mixed with frustration as attention focuses on the fate of the nurses, who have been sentenced to death, and not of the children, who are dying one by one. The nurses were sentenced in May and an international campaign is under way to win their freedom.  Nearly everyone agrees that it will be hard, perhaps impossible, for President Bush to overhaul Social Security without bipartisan support. But the two parties have not been this far apart ideologically on Capitol Hill for decades, some analysts say. And many Democrats assert that the last four years under Bush have only deepened the level of partisan division and mistrust.  We moved SOCSEC_Party-line voting -- 2 x 6  Party-line voting over time as an indication of the extent of the current partisanship in Congress.  With story BC-BABY-DRASTIC-TREATMENT-NYT  Hannah Stimell, 1, has a rare disorder called Niemann-Pick Type A, which causes the internal organs to swell and is invariably fatal. For her parents, Jill and Scott, the diagnosis posed a terrible choice: watch her die, or take a chance on a drastic treatment that has never been used successfully on a child with Niemann-Pick.  In the mid-1990s researchers at the Stanford University Medical School monitoring a torrent of data on arthritis and rheumatism patient records detected a disturbing pattern. Soon, they and scientists elsewhere were sounding a national alarm: thousands of arthritis patients, perhaps as many as 17,500, were dying annually from bleeding ulcers caused by widely used painkillers like ibuprofen. As it happened, a promising new class of designer-drug painkillers meant to avoid precisely that problem were nearing federal approval. The drugs were called COX-2 inhibitors, and the two brands that would become the field's best sellers, Celebrex and Vioxx, reached the market within months of each other in 1999. As it also happened, federal regulators had only the year before relaxed the longstanding ban on advertising prescription drugs to consumers.  We moved DRUGS_Celebrex studies -- 2 x 7  Looking at results of two studies involving Celebrex; data on new prescriptions and sales since 1999.  Weekly feature  What to watch for in the night sky this week.  We moved SKYWATCH_Weekly 1219 -- 3 x 6  The graphic gives insight on stars and a map shows their locations.  With story BC-HIGH-SEAS-INTERDICTION-DEN -- COLORADO OUT -- DENVER POST GRAPHIC  American counterterrorism officials have set up a high seas gauntlet deploying U.S. Coast Guard cutters off Latin American coasts and arresting foreign nationals trying to leave their own countries. Off the coast of Ecuador alone, Coast Guard crews have blocked at least 37 boats and detained more than 4,575 suspected illegal migrants over the past four years, records show.  We moved HIGH_Sunk vessels.fh -- 2 x 7  Locations of 9 of 12 vessels that the U.S. Coast Guard sunk after detaining suspected illegal migrants over the past 2 years; Chart listing all 12 vessels, dates they were sunk and number of passengers transferred. FreeHand document. Denver Post graphic.  We moved HIGH_Interceptions.fh -- 2 x 2 3/4  The number of foreign nationals intercepted by the U.S. Coast Guard since 1997.. FreeHand document. Denver Post graphic.  With story BC-DIRTY-WATER-DEN -- COLORADO OUT -- DENVER POST GRAPHIC  The London Mine, one of the richest gold-ore strikes in the state's history, has hemorrhaged toxic metals into South Mosquito Creek for decades, killing fish habitat over a mile-long stretch. This year, the mine owner and a developer persuaded the state to relax the pollution limits. Now the mine won't violate them so often. The deal symbolizes Colorado's long slide toward leniency for polluters and lax water-quality oversight, according to an analysis of state records and interviews with several government scientists and regulators.  We moved DIRTY_Pollution maps.fh -- 34p8 x 51/4  Maps locating major road construction along I-25 through Denver (T-REX), the London Mine near Fairplay, Colorado and Red Cliff south of Vail, Colorado. FreeHand document. Denver Post graphic.  We moved DIRTY_Water polluters.fh -- 55p6 x 4  The top 25 water polluters in Colorado ranked by the number of violations on pollution-discharge permits. FreeHand document. Denver Post graphic.  METRO  With story BC-STREET-MECHANICS-NYT  In the vast underground of New York's economy, street mechanics hold a peculiar, if utilitarian place.

"160926"	"I"	"will"	" Goldsberry, who is in her 20s, says she was raised in a Christian family but follows no particular denomination.

But it's a personal thing for me. Goldsberry also said that in her experience, shows with African-American casts, like The Color Purple, have had a particular spiritual bent.

"166295"	"you"	"will"	" KHOMEINI: Your boldness and initiative in dealing with the realities of the world is quite likely to bring about changes that would result in upsetting the equations of power dominating the world. I have therefore found it necessary to bring certain matters to your attention. If you hope, at this juncture, to cut the economic Gordian knots of socialism and communism by appealing to the center of Western capitalism, you will, far from remedying any ill of your society, commit a mistake which those to come will have to erase.
