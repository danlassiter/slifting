"15873"	"he"	"confides"	" Underneath it all, LaBruce seems hopelessly infatuated with the very Hollywood trash the film mocks. Bruce's ultimate role model, he confides, is Elizabeth Taylor in the movie ``Butterfield 8.'' ``Super 8{,'' which includes several clips from that film, stops in its tracks to replay the scene in which Ms. Taylor's character dies in a car crash. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"

"86341"	"she"	"confides"	" And, at first, those hopes were met. Helen Mirren, one of those actresses who can apparently do anything _ from ``Prime Suspect'' to ``Some Mother's Son'' _ stars as Chase Philips, a wife and mother recovering from a nervous breakdown at the family summer home on Martha's Vineyard. Rocking restlessly on the front porch swing, she confides, ``I'd committed the one unpardonable sin of my ilk. I'd embarrassed my husband.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"87228"	"she"	"confides"	" ``Boys are a little weird,'' says third-grader Georgina Zelidon. ``They play too rough, and they stare at me, pull my hair and say, `I love you.''' Wriggling her nose, she confides, ``They want to hug me.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"101105"	"he"	"confides"	" At age 56, Martin's projects are piled high. Productions of his play ``Picasso at the Lapin Agile'' are multiplying and a film version is in the works. He has also adapted his best-selling novella, ``Shopgirl,'' for the screen and is contemplating appearing in the film version. But not, he confides, playing the title role. Next year in New York, he expects to open his adaptation of a German play, provocatively titled ``The Underpants.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"101631"	"she"	"confides"	" Every Parker novel is full of incidental pleasures, and ``Death in  Paradise'' is no exception. Local readers will enjoy the real places in  the book. There's a little good cooking; an available high school  principal serves ``lobster meat in a light cream sauce with sherry,  pearl onions and mushrooms and different-colored sweet peppers, over  basmati rice'' to Stone. Cooking, she confides, is ``the second best  thing I do.''  There's some good baseball talk, but what lingers in the  memory are Stone's chapters of inner dialogue. These have the ring of  truth; Jesse Stone may have more inner life than any of Parker's  characters. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20011120.0111 type=story > <HEADLINE> DON'T FORGET TO REMEMBER KEN KESEY </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-BEAM-COLUMN-BOS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"103392"	"he"	"confides"	" In the days when Herbert Ross called ``The New Yorker'' a ``comic weekly,'' its stars were E.B. White and James Thurber. In an introduction to this anthology of ``New Yorker'' humor, the editors describe White as a master of understatement who ``could creep along so quietly you might not realize that he was stalking prey, and that you were it.'' And Thurber, of course, was Thurber, when nothing less would do. Both are here, as are Roy Blount Jr., Woody Allen, Garrison Keillor, S.J. Perelman, Steve Martin, Ian Frazier, Calvin Trillin, Ogden Nash, Groucho Marx and others. Our favorite is a little farce called ``Emily Dickinson, Jerk of Amherst'' in which Andy Borowitz (creator of the series ``The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air'') poses as Dickinson's friend, who knew her as bit of a cad. She got drunk before noon, he confides, and ``became a gluttonous vituperative harpy who would cut you off for your last Buffalo wing.'' </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020104.0043 type=story > <HEADLINE> BC-NEW&AMP;NOTABLE-AZR(a) </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-NEW&AMP;NOTABLE-AZR) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"

"132197"	"he"	"confides"	" Despite the intricacy of ``Adaptation,'' it's interesting that some of the brightest moments in Jonze's film are simply rendered episodes from ``The Orchid Thief.'' Laroche, a seductively blustery autodidact who describes himself as ``the smartest person I know,'' grips the imagination. In one memorable scene, Laroche admits to Susan while driving through South Florida that his seemingly life-dominating orchid fetish _ the quality that defines him for her _ is just his latest obsession. Once, he confides, he harbored a ``deep love'' for tropical fish. Another time, it was vintage mirrors. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
