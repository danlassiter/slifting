"7934"	"he"	"begins"	" I've been studying a remarkable essay by David Bosworth in the fall issue of The Georgia Review. Bosworth -- heretofore a writer of fiction in Seattle -- tries to answer such questions with a theory that encompasses wealth, poverty, psychology, the Soviet collapse, morality and changing notions of the Absolute. We're living, he begins, in an imitation Heaven like the one proposed by Mammon in Milton's ``Paradise Lost.'' Having failed to storm the real Heaven, Mammon proposed a tarted-up Hell -- the ``virtual reality'' of ``Heaven II,'' as Bosworth puts it, juggling ideas across the centuries. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"

WASHINGTON  (Will move in ``w'' news file.)  9-11-TERROR-ALERT (Washington) _ A ledeall: President Bush ordered the country's military and civilian authorities to a state of high alert on Tuesday, after an al-Qaida operative now in custody said terror strikes were planned for the Sept. 11 anniversary, with the most serious threats apparently focused on American interests in Asia. As Bush and then Attorney General John Ashcroft announced that the government was raising the national terrorism warning to an orange alert _ the second highest level, meaning ``high alert'' _ Vice President Cheney canceled a scheduled speech Tuesday night and was taken to a undisclosed location. By David Johnston and Michael Gordon.  An early version of this story has moved.  With a graphic.  9-11-BUSH (Washington) _ A president transformed: A broad look at Bush, whose agenda was institutionally changed with the Sept. 11 attacks. He has handled all the issues rhetorically, but can he get his policies passed? By Elisabeth Bumiller and David E. Sanger.  With photos, NYT1-10.  NATIONAL GENERAL  (Will move in ``a'' news file.)  9-11-ANNIVERSARY (New York) _ One year after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon killed 3,025 people, plunging the United States into war and a suddenly fearsome future, the country on Wednesday marks the first anniversary of 9/11 in countless public ceremonies and private moments, expressions of patriotism and what for some Americans is a deep desire to turn the page. Even as new intelligence information and threats of terrorism said to be reminiscent of patterns detected one year earlier prompted the Bush administration to put the country on high alert, Americans will mark the day with memorial services, bagpipe processions, peace vigils, prayer services, plaque mountings, tree plantings and expressions of every imaginable type. By Janny Scott.  With photo.  9-11-BLOOMBERG (New York) _ Like mourners who mark the first anniversary of a loved one's death by laying a stone at the grave, New Yorkers should take this day to reflect on their collective loss, and then turn their attention from grief to the future, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said. An interview, by Jennifer Steinhauer.  ELECT (Undated) _ A roundup: Eleven states and the District of Columbia vote Tuesday in 50 key elections, including U.S. Senate, House and gubernatorial races. The governor's race in Florida and Senate races in North Carolina and New Hampshire are among the highlights. The campaigns, the parties and elections officials are particularly watching turnout this time to see whether voters feel more inspired to vote because of the proximity to the Sept. 11 anniversary. By Adam Nagourney.  With a graphic.  INTERNATIONAL  (Will move in ``i'' news file.)  IRAQ-U.S. (Washington) _ A ledeall: The national security advisor, Condoleezza Rice, and the director of central intelligence, George Tenet, briefed senators, presumably on the Iraq issue. In addition, Richard L. Armitage, deputy secretary of State, speaks to a conference with Brent Scowcroft as moderator; and the House Armed Services Committee holds an open hearing to hear from reports from former weapons inspectors who have been in Iraq. By David Johnston and others.  TERROR-SEASIA (Jakarta) _ American investigators have uncovered a plot to attack U.S. embassies in Southeast Asia. Some embassies and consulates in Indonesia and Malaysia were suddenly closed. By Raymond Bonner.  FINANCIAL  (Will move in ``f'' news file.)  MARTHA-STEWART (Washington) _ Saying its information casts doubt on Martha Stewart's explanation of how she sold shares of ImClone Systems, a House committee said Tuesday that it had turned over its investigation to the Justice Department. (Summary from wires) By Constance L. Hays.  CULTURE  (Will move in ``e'' news file.)  TV-BUSH-REVIEW (Undated) _ When Scott Pelley asks President Bush about his first visit to ground zero, three days after the attacks, he begins, ``You had been briefed on ground zero,'' and even before he finishes the question, Bush is shaking his head. ``You couldn't brief anybody on ground zero,'' Bush says. ``It was ghostly. It was like you were having a bad dream and you were walking through the dream.'' Speaking slowly, he is clearly haunted by those memories, and he seems moved and engaged. Pelley had two interviews with the president and the hourlong program shaped around them (to be shown on ``60 Minutes II'' Wednesday night on CBS, just before the president is scheduled to speak live) is a typical magazine report chronicling the president's experience on Sept. 11 and in the days after, padded with interviews with others in the administration.

"169857"	"it"	"begins"	" Her latest novel, The Emperor's Children, is entirely different in tone and milieu. Set in New York City on the eve of 9/11, it begins, to put it glibly, as a sort of highbrow Friends -- an antic comedy of manners about three college classmates, now on the cusp of their 30s, trying to sort out questions about love and work and commitment. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
