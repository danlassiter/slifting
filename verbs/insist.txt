SCI-VACCINE (Undated) _ The Institute of Medicine is issuing a report about the safety of thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative used in vaccines. The report says there is no definitive evidence that thimerosal has harmed anyone, but says it should no longer be used because the risk is ``biologically plausible.'' By Sandra Blakeslee. (800 words)  SCI-TERROR-THREAT (Undated) _ Federal agencies and Congress are racing to check the security of everything from soybeans, to municipal water supplies to nuclear reactors to whole cities. Last week, concern heightened with the disclosure that the jet hijackers had investigated crop dusters _ and thus, conceivably, the possibility of spreading deadly germs or chemicals. But experts, including congressional investigators who examined secret federal data, say much fear about weapons of mass destruction _ germ, chemical or radiological weapons _ is misplaced. The likelihood of terrorists attacking soon is low, they insist, and the chance of attackers causing widespread death and sickness even lower. By William J. Broad. (2100 words)  With photo.  With  SCI-TERROR-FEAR (Undated) _ The familiar became strange, the ordinary perilous. On Sept. 11, Americans entered a new and frightening geography, where the continents of safety and danger seemed forever shifted. Is it safe to fly? Will terrorists wage germ warfare? Where is the line between reasonable precaution and panic? Jittery, uncertain and assuming the worst, many people have answered these questions by forswearing air travel, purchasing gas masks and radiation detectors, placing frantic calls to pediatricians demanding vaccinations. Psychologists who study how people perceive potential hazards say such responses are not surprising, given the intense emotions inspired by the terrorist attacks. By Erica Goode. (1500 words)  SCI-WTO-ENGINEERING (Undated) _ Engineers hope to conduct what is, in essence, an autopsy of the buildings felled by the terrorist attacks, to put the pieces together in order to understand how they fell apart. Just as investigations of plane crashes lead to the design of safer airplanes, looking at the twisted steel will lead to safer more terrorist-resistant buildings. By Kenneth Chang. (1400 words)  SCI-WHALE-ANCESTORS (Undated) _ New fossil discoveries in Pakistan appear to have answered a longstanding question about the ancestry of whales, establishing that animals like the hippopotamus may be their closest living relative. By John Noble Wilford. (700 words)  With photo.  SCI-BUBONIC-PLAGUE (Undated) _ The Black Death usually is associated with bubonic plague. But now, two researchers are presenting a new theory. In ``Biology of Plagues: Evidence from Historic Populations,'' the authors argue that a hemorrhagic virus, like ebola, probably caused the Black Death and most of the smaller epidemics that racked Europe for the next three centuries, not bubonic plague. By Mark Derr. (1625 words)  SCI-CATERPILLARS (Undated) _ A noisy caterpillar has ways of communicating with others of his species, scientists find. By Henry Fountain.

SCI-MEXICO-CORN (Undated) _ In a finding that has taken researchers by surprise and alarmed environmentalists, the Mexican government has discovered that some of the country's native corn varieties have been contaminated with genetically engineered DNA. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon. (900 words)  SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: Ovarian cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in American women, after lung, breast and colon cancer, and progress against the disease has been slow because it is difficult to detect in its early stages. But those intent on improving women's chances of surviving ovarian cancer want to alert women to the most common symptoms and urge them to see a doctor without delay and insist on a thorough medical work-up. By Jane E. Brody. (1320 words)  SCI-PATENT-DECISIONS (Undated) _ A look at patients are capable of making decisions for themselves. By Laurie Tarkan.

(1300 words)  SCI-TRANSPLANT-DEBATE (Undated) _ Two experts face off on whether the potential risks of animal-to-human organ transplants outweigh the benefits.  SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and fitness. By Eric Nagourney:  _ Surprised by their own findings, researchers report that women at an in vitro fertilization clinic were more likely to become pregnant if, unknown to the patients, total strangers were asked to pray for their success.  _ People with an uncommon blood disorder, hemochromatosis, are perfectly good blood donors, a study says, in contrast to what was previously thought.  _ Black people are less likely than whites to get flu shots, and the difference is not merely a matter of money or access to health care.  _ Children who are overweight and whose blood pressure is high have an increased risk of developing artery disease later in life.  _ Studies of elderly people show that moderate drinking may protect the brain, while heavy drinking can harm it.  HEALTH-BOOK-REVIEWS (Undated) _ How to deal with workaholics, whether you are one or live with one. How to deal with the sexual and fertility problems that may result from cancer and chemoterapy.

PAKISTAN-U.S. (Islamabad, Pakistan) _ Pakistan is a strange choice as America's indispensable ally in the hunt for Osama bin Laden. It is a country where corruption by the powerful is epic, the poverty of the masses crushing and more people own firearms than refrigerators. By Barry Bearak.  AFGHAN-U.S. (Islamabad, Pakistan) _ Pakistan, the only country that recognizes Afghanistan's Taliban government, said on Monday that the days of the purist Islamic rulers appeared numbered, but it had not lost all hope they would surrender Osama bin Laden. Pakistani military ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf cast doubt on the Taliban's ability to defy international demands for the handover of the Saudi-born dissident, wanted for last month's devastating attacks on the United States. (Summary from wires) By John F. Burns.  WASHINGTON  (Will move in ``w'' news file.)  CONGRESS-IMMIG (Washington) _ Support is building in Congress for proposals to put military personnel on border patrol, to triple the number of agents on the Canadian border, to drastically limit student visas, and to spend emergency funds for other moves to tighten immigration rules and procedures in the wake of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. By Robert Pear.  With graphic.  MILITARY-MEYERS (Washington) _ Gen. Richard B. Meyers, the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, officially takes over. Meyers is the first Air Force general in 20 years to serve as the nation's top uniformed officer. By Elaine Sciolino.  With a photo, NYT9.  SCOTUS (Washington) _ The Supreme Court heard arguments Monday on whether inmates in a federal prison or detention center that is run by a private contractor can sue the company for violating their constitutional rights. The argument in Correctional Services Corporation v. Malesko, No. 00-860, was not quite the first order of business as the court opened its new term on the traditional first Monday in October. Addressing the crowd of lawyers and tourists in the courtroom as he opened the session, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist called for a moment of silence to honor the victims of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. By Linda Greenhouse.  NATIONAL GENERAL  (Will move in ``a'' news file.)  TERROR-U.N. (United Nations) _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani used a rare invitation to the U.N. podium Monday to entreat the countries of the world to abandon neutrality in the battle on terrorism: ``You're either with civilization or with terrorists.'' ``This is not the time for further study or vague directives,'' Giuliani declared in a speech that alternated between lessons in American civics and forceful appeals to the world to join forces in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. Giuliani became only the third New York mayor ever to address the General Assembly, and the first to speak at an event other than a groundbreaking or grand opening. By Serge Schmemann.

SCI-TERROR-THREAT (Undated) _ Federal agencies and Congress are racing to check the security of everything from soybeans to municipal water supplies to nuclear reactors to whole cities. Last week, concern rose with the disclosure that the suspected jet hijackers had investigated crop-dusters _ and thus, conceivably, the possibility of spreading deadly germs or chemicals. But private and public experts, including congressional investigators who examined secret federal data, say much fear about weapons of mass destruction _ germ, chemical or radiological weapons _ is misplaced. The likelihood of terrorists attacking soon is low, they insist, and the chance of attackers causing widespread death and sickness even lower. By William J. Broad.  With photos, NYT7,8.  And:  SCI-TERROR-FEAR (Undated) _ The familiar became strange, the ordinary perilous. On Sept. 11, Americans entered a new and frightening geography, where the continents of safety and danger seemed forever shifted. Is it safe to fly? Will terrorists wage germ warfare? Where is the line between reasonable precaution and panic? Jittery, uncertain and assuming the worst, many people have answered these questions by forswearing air travel, purchasing gas masks and radiation detectors, placing frantic calls to pediatricians demanding vaccinations against exotic diseases. Psychologists who study how people perceive potential hazards say such responses are not surprising, given the intense emotions inspired by the terrorist attacks. By Erica Goode.

INTERNATIONAL (moving in ``i'' category)  BORDER-ECONOMY (Douglas, Ariz.) -- Arizona's border economy is being battered by heightened security at its ports of entry and the general slowdown in the state's business climate. Sales are down among many retailers in Douglas and Nogales, and business leaders fear even worse problems if anticipated changes in visa requirements go through this weekend. Though the $1 billion produce industry isn't yet in a panic, if could be soon if border-crossing delays continue into winter -- and there is a strong likelihood that will be the case. What is usually a four-hour crossing time during the peak produce season in Nogales could double in length unless some alternatives are found to keep commercial trucks moving quickly through the port of entry. Meanwhile, immigration officials say illegal border crossings are way down compared to last year, but they say it is a part of a yearlong pattern that was not substantially altered by the heightened state of alert along America's borders. By PAT FLANNERY. 40 inches. Photos and graphic available.  NATIONAL - GENERAL (Moving in ``a'' category)  HOPI-TAPES (Phoenix) --Tapes of conversations with Hopi tribal members dating back to the 40s are being digitally re-recorded by the Museum of Northern Arizona. The tapes, made by ethnographers and others who happened to be on the reservation, were in such bad condition that the museum worried that they would disintegrate. They are being translated by a Hopi, who says some of the language is no longer in regular usage. The tapes include chants and songs that go with everyday activities like grinding corn or weaving, and personal life histories. By JUDY NICHOLS. 25 inches. Photos available.  STUMP-INVESTIGATION (Phoenix) -- U.S. Rep. Bob Stump wouldn't budge when Maricopa County election officials reviewed why he votes from a ``residence'' in the Phoenix area where he has never lived, so Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley will now look into the situation. ``If he did not live there, it's not his residence,'' Romley said Monday.

ENTERTAINMENT (Moving in ``e'' category)  GOODY02 (Undated) -- OK, nothing else works, so let's try a tactic that's met some success with my 3-year-old. Don't watch the season premiere of (beginitalic)Buffy the Vampire Slayer (enditalic)on its new network tonight. Just skip it. You wouldn't enjoy it. In fact, you're not (beginitalic)allowed (enditalic)to watch it. Really. You can't have any carrots, either. Alas, that probably won't work. Legions of otherwise insightful TV watchers will continue to ignore one of TV's best-written, best-acted shows, mostly for a simple reason: ``The fact of the matter is, with a name like (beginitalic)Buffy the Vampire Slayer(enditalic), you're never going to be looking to be Emmy bait,'' says Joss Whedon, the show's creator.

For the latest photos and graphics from The New York Times, go to www.nytimages.com.  PAGE ONE  CONGRESS-RIGHTS (Washington) _ The top Republican and Democrat on the House Judiciary committee strike a tentative deal on a scaled-back version of President Bush's anti-terror package; they accede to expanded surveillance powers involving wiretaps and tracking Internet communications while putting aside several more controversial provisions opposed by civil libertarians, like permitting indefinite detention of foreigners or execution of search warrants without notifying the suspects. Senators, on a separate track, will meet on Tuesday to discuss their version of the legislation. By Neil A. Lewis.  (Editors, story will include previously budgeted CONGRESS-IMMIG, which is scratched.)  TERROR-U.N. (United Nations) _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani used a rare invitation to the U.N. podium Monday to entreat the countries of the world to abandon neutrality in the battle on terrorism: ``You're either with civilization or with terrorists.'' ``This is not the time for further study or vague directives,'' Giuliani declared in a speech that alternated between lessons in American civics and forceful appeals to the world to join forces in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. Giuliani became only the third New York mayor ever to address the General Assembly, and the first to speak at an event other than a groundbreaking or grand opening. By Serge Schmemann.  With a photo.  PAKISTAN-U.S. (Islamabad, Pakistan) _ For years, Pakistan has seemed a place about to blow. Bankruptcy is at the door, angry mullahs at the gate. The corruption of the powerful is epic, the poverty of the masses crushing. The army has taken charge, once again putting democracy on hold. More people own firearms than refrigerators. This country, then, may seem a strange choice as America's indispensable ally in the hunt for Osama bin Laden. Islamic guerrillas _ many would call them terrorists _ openly operate within Pakistan's borders, with government support. But, for the Bush administration, Pakistan is a rediscovered crony from America's Cold War days, forced back into friendship at gunpoint to fight terrorism. By Barry Bearak.  AFGHAN-CHILD-SOLDIERS (Rahmonkhel, Afghanistan) _ Officials here with the Northern Alliance, a coalition of rebel groups fighting Afghanistan's ruling Taliban, say their soldiers must be at least 18 years of age. But in an afternoon in this village five miles from the front line, baby-faced soldiers kept strolling down the road with Kalishnikovs. They are among hundreds of young teen-age soldiers ensnared in the endless civil war here. When asked about the boys, adults here said they were used out of desperation. By David Rohde.

While the White House says that O'Neill is still an integral part of its economic brain trust, officials also are urging O'Neill to become more of a team player. ``The time has come,'' one White House official said, ``to get on and get along.''

On Sept. 11, Americans entered a new and frightening geography, where the continents of safety and danger seemed forever shifted. Is it safe to fly? Will terrorists wage germ warfare? Where is the line between reasonable precaution and panic? Jittery, uncertain and assuming the worst, many people have answered these questions by forswearing air travel, purchasing gas masks and radiation detectors, placing frantic calls to pediatricians demanding vaccinations. Psychologists who study how people perceive potential hazards say such responses are not surprising, given the intense emotions inspired by the terrorist attacks. By Erica Goode. (1500 words)  SCI-WTO-ENGINEERING (Undated) _ Engineers hope to conduct what is, in essence, an autopsy of the buildings felled by the terrorist attacks, to put the pieces together in order to understand how they fell apart. Just as investigations of plane crashes lead to the design of safer airplanes, looking at the twisted steel will lead to safer more terrorist-resistant buildings. By Kenneth Chang. (1400 words)  SCI-WHALE-ANCESTORS (Undated) _ New fossil discoveries in Pakistan appear to have answered a longstanding question about the ancestry of whales, establishing that animals like the hippopotamus may be their closest living relative. By John Noble Wilford. (700 words)  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients.)  SCI-BUBONIC-PLAGUE (Undated) _ The Black Death usually is associated with bubonic plague. But now, two researchers are presenting a new theory. In ``Biology of Plagues: Evidence from Historic Populations,'' the authors argue that a hemorrhagic virus, like ebola, probably caused the Black Death and most of the smaller epidemics that racked Europe for the next three centuries, not bubonic plague. By Mark Derr. (1625 words)  SCI-CATERPILLARS (Undated) _ A noisy caterpillar has ways of communicating with others of his species, scientists find. By Henry Fountain. (670 words)  SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on wood in pueblos, droughts and wandering manatee. By Henry Fountain.  SCI-MEXICO-CORN (Undated) _ In a finding that has taken researchers by surprise and alarmed environmentalists, the Mexican government has discovered that some of the country's native corn varieties have been contaminated with genetically engineered DNA. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon. (900 words)  SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: Ovarian cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in American women, after lung, breast and colon cancer, and progress against the disease has been slow because it is difficult to detect in its early stages. But those intent on improving women's chances of surviving ovarian cancer want to alert women to the most common symptoms and urge them to see a doctor without delay and insist on a thorough medical work-up. By Jane E. Brody. (1320 words)  SCI-PATENT-DECISIONS (Undated) _ A look at patients are capable of making decisions for themselves. By Laurie Tarkan. (1350 words)  SCI-MYELOMA-PATIENT (Undated) _ A patient with multiple myeloma has high hopes for stem cells, but for now thalidomide is making the difference. By Janet Battaile. (1300 words)  SCI-TRANSPLANT-DEBATE (Undated) _ Two experts face off on whether the potential risks of animal-to-human organ transplants outweigh the benefits.  SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and fitness. By Eric Nagourney:  _ Surprised by their own findings, researchers report that women at an in vitro fertilization clinic were more likely to become pregnant if, unknown to the patients, total strangers were asked to pray for their success.  _ People with an uncommon blood disorder, hemochromatosis, are perfectly good blood donors, a study says, in contrast to what was previously thought.  _ Black people are less likely than whites to get flu shots, and the difference is not merely a matter of money or access to health care.  _ Children who are overweight and whose blood pressure is high have an increased risk of developing artery disease later in life.  _ Studies of elderly people show that moderate drinking may protect the brain, while heavy drinking can harm it.  HEALTH-BOOK-REVIEWS (Undated) _ How to deal with workaholics, whether you are one or live with one. How to deal with the sexual and fertility problems that may result from cancer and chemoterapy. By John Langone.  SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ A science question answered: How does a coronagraph work? How could I build one? By C. Claiborne Ray.

"102865"	"they"	"insist"	" Voice of Choice is pushing a smaller-scale plan that would add only a turning lane in some areas and wider shoulders to handle traffic turnouts and bicycles. Those improvements, they insist, are sufficient to take care of the congestion and safety concerns that have made Arizona 179 a transportation vortex. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"104057"	"they"	"insist"	" And, finally, given the chance to explain away the trade as a fire sale of the outspoken Sheffield, they insist, no, this is a heck of a good deal. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"105291"	"they"	"insist"	" In Kosovo's cities and towns, British patrols often go around in green berets and rolled-up sleeves. That, they insist, is the best way to get close to the local people so as to find out about potential threats or plots and help reassure them that things are gradually getting back to normal. The British also say their more approachable style leaves them more adaptable. If things turn bad, they can change their dress as a signal that they are getting tough. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"

"107219"	"they"	"insist"	" Until Amy comes into his life, Peter smugly professes to despise children, and when she first appears, he goes out of his way avoid her. But overnight, he changes his attitude after the actors in his newest play complain about his inauthentic children's dialogue. Contemporary children, they insist, do not use terms like ``the bee's knees.'' Peter, who hasn't had a hit play since the 1980s, decides to cultivate Amy as a research project into how children really talk and, before long, he is attending one of Amy's tea parties, notebook in hand. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"

"109764"	"they"	"insist"	" But first, they insist, Washington must do more to stop the fighting between the Israelis and the Palestinians and make another push through the United Nations to persuade Iraq to readmit weapons inspectors. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"

"111534"	"they"	"insist"	" The government says that this time is different _ the rebels, they insist, are truly vanquished. A U.N. peace mission on the scale of the last one, which called for a massive peace-keeping operation, is no longer necessary, the officials say. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"117846"	"they"	"insist"	" And his trainers, perhaps reaching a bit, offer an explanation of his mediocre showings the past several years. The problem, they insist, was a lack of motivation. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"121582"	"I"	"insist"	" ``This is not a bad precedent, I insist, that the government is willing to negotiate,'' Cerisola said, ``that the government is willing to take no for an answer and has the capacity and will to seek alternatives. I think that is a good precedent and a good message.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"121614"	"they"	"insist"	" But Bloomberg administration officials insist, take away those worries from a chancellor, and those students will benefit the same way they benefit from parents who are able to turn away from the static annoyances of life and focus exclusively on them. Teachers, they insist, will take their cues from the chancellor. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"123603"	"they"	"insist"	" In the coming days, the United States will announce programs aimed at providing clean water and reliable electricity in developing countries. Action, they insist, matters more than words. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"123808"	"they"	"insist"	" Advocates for the poor, however, insist that regional differences and economic quirks cannot explain the demand increases they are seeing at food kitchens and housing shelters. Instead, they insist, the city is so focused on shedding people that it is scaring away the truly needy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"124609"	"they"	"insist"	" Critics say that the last decade has shown that Saddam can be contained through a combination of U.N. sanctions and carefully targeted airstrikes. Washington should enlist U.N. backing to force Saddam to accept inspectors back, and the assessments issued by the CIA, they insist, show that Washington has time to try its hand at diplomacy and that there is no urgent need to invade Iraq. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"126167"	"they"	"insist"	" Racism, they insist, is a red herring. The real issue, they say, is what introducing 27 migrant workers into the community and what the extra housing will do to everything from property values to water tables to the peace and tranquillity they had become accustomed to. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"131799"	"they"	"insist"	" The bill's authors, on the other hand, say the Russian Orthodox faith is so intimately woven into Belarussian culture that the state is obligated to protect its leading role from dangerous sects _ which, they insist, are the legislation's true targets. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"139976"	"they"	"insist"	" If Israelis are going to the beach and to clubs again, and if bombings have become rare, it is thanks in large part, they insist, to these ditches and guard towers and coils of barbed wire and miles of wire fencing that separate two peoples, demarcating the gulf between them. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"140451"	"they"	"insist"	" His very presence in the White House, they insist, would sweep away the lost trust that is the lingering legacy of Bush's arguments - proved false - for war in Iraq. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"141156"	"they"	"insist"	" Actually, maybe you'd be better off going back to the original source. Aficionados swear that the Yu-Gi-Oh! manga, created by Kazuki Takahashi, is full of lively drawings, interesting stories, and engaging characters; so, they insist, is the original Japanese TV series that grew out of it. But the ugliness and stupidity of the Americanized versions, especially when blown up to big-screen size, don't inspire any particular desire to plumb the depths of Yugi's world. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"

"145294"	"they"	"insist"	" Several gay leaders insisted, however, that the marriage measures were mostly in states Bush was expected to carry anyway. Even Ohio's measure, they insist, did not hurt Kerry. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"148586"	"they"	"insist"	" The people who detest America take a look at this odd conjunction and assume the materialistic America is the real America; the ideals are a sham. The real America, they insist, is the money-grubbing, resource-wasting, TV-drenched, unreflective bimbo of the earth. The high-toned language, the anti-Americans say, is just a cover for the quest for oil, or the desire for riches, dominion and war. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"149746"	"they"	"insist"	" That Olympic ideal, they insist, could well catapult the melting pot of New York over its four rival cities also bidding for the games. But on Tuesday, when the press corps followed in the footsteps of the tour for commission members, the sights and smells of Queens, the city's most diverse borough, were a bit hard to detect. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"
"150682"	"they"	"insist"	" But now, with a new lawyer, they strenuously dispute that. Their daughter is disabled, her brain is damaged, but she is not brain dead, they insist, and they say they have more than a dozen doctors who will back them up. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"152389"	"they"	"insist"	" For example, Saakashvili and Foreign Minister Salome Zourabichvili said in interviews that there had been cases of police abuse, but they also said that retraining the Soviet-era force was changing the law enforcement culture. Human rights, they insist, are a government priority. I think it is a well-taken criticism, Zourabichvili said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"153308"	"they"	"insist"	" Since Metro-North introduced its new coaches, riders have been complaining that they are overcrowded. While the cars do have fewer seats, an average of about 15 fewer than their predecessors, frustrated Metro-North officials say that is not the problem. There are plenty of seats on most trains, they insist, if only people would sit in all of them. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"153625"	"they"	"insist"	" Bush and his top aides have consistently resisted setting a timeline for troop withdrawal or talking publicly about specific goals. Doing so, they insist, would provide information useful to the insurgency - an argument that the House GOP leadership has endorsed. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"154009"	"they"	"insist"	" When dissecting Helton's slump, opponents frequently point to the Rockies' lineup. This, they insist, creates two problems: He gets pitched to more carefully, as noted by Preston Wilson, and he presses harder to get the big hit. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"155149"	"they"	"insist"	" To the stars, the collision in May between cars driven by a photographer and Lindsay Lohan was just the latest result of the escalating tactics of Hollywood paparazzi who will stop at nothing to get a picture. Emboldened by the sudden willingness of law-enforcement officials to take their complaints seriously, celebrities and their lawyers have painted a picture of paparazzi as criminals, stalkers and provocateurs-at-the-wheel, using their vehicles as weapons if necessary to catch a celebrity looking ugly, angry or upset. To the paparazzi, however, this portrayal is utter nonsense, at best the result of stars seeing something happening in their rear-view mirrors but failing to understand it. Rather, they insist, celebrity victims like Lohan are merely collateral damage; the real battle is among the photographers themselves -- pitting veterans against novices, native Angelenos against foreigners and a handful of rival companies against one another, all of them jockeying for position and profit in a wildly overpopulated but nonetheless increasingly lucrative business. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"162909"	"they"	"insist"	" Wikipedians brush off such lapses. Wikipedia is a work in progress, they insist, and Larson's repair to the Tubman entry only proves that it works. The site has an explicit disclaimer: Use Wikipedia at your own risk. ....Wikipedia cannot guarantee the validity of the information found here. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"164306"	"they"	"insist"	" Hamas talks of a long-term hudna, or armistice, with Israel, so long as Israel returns to its 1967 boundaries (the armistice lines of the unfinished 1948-49 war), unannexes East Jerusalem and lets all refugees and their descendants return to their pre-1948 homes. The state of Israel itself, they insist, has no right to exist on Islamic waqf land. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164337"	"they"	"insist"	" Hamas talks of a long-term armistice with Israel, so long as Israel returns to its 1967 boundaries, unannexes East Jerusalem and lets all refugees and their descendants return to their pre-1948 homes.

"164346"	"they"	"insist"	" Hamas talks of a long-term armistice with Israel, so long as Israel returns to its 1967 boundaries, unannexes East Jerusalem and lets all refugees and their descendants return to their pre-1948 homes. The state of Israel itself, they insist, has no right to exist on what is immutably Muslim land. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"165908"	"they"	"insist"	" How? Listen to the pundits Saturday and how they hyperventilate about every pick in the first round. Each player, they insist, is a future All-Pro. One problem: History tells us they're at least 50 percent wrong. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"168899"	"they"	"insist"	" The Saudis agree that at some point, oil production must peak - just not now. Instead, they insist, they will be expanding daily production to 12 million, then 14 million barrels in the next few years. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"
"172107"	"they"	"insist"	" Price increases at the pump would be small, they insist, if they happen at all. And if gasoline prices did rise in response to the tax, the state probably couldn't do anything to stop it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172840"	"they"	"insist"	" They're just looking, they insist, for the most memorable performance. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173757"	"I"	"insist"	" WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Friday marked the official opening of Christmas shopping season, but some of us got started long ago. I confess to being a bit obsessive (in a good way, I insist, my smile inflexible), about Christmas shopping. I begin early on my long list of gifts, send cards, do my own wrapping and don't believe in late packages. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
