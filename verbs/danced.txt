"11883"	"she"	"danced"	" At the home of Miss Wynns's family, a three-story duplex in Flushing, a few minutes' drive from College Point, relatives came and went somberly Sunday evening. One family member who refused to give his name said: ``She didn't deserve it. She was a beautiful person. She went to school, she danced, she loved art, she loved drawing. She was just a normal teen-age kid.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"
"80693"	"he"	"danced"	" Born David Daniel Kaminsky in East New York, Brooklyn, in 1913, Kaye was a man of prodigious talent, perhaps spread a bit too thin. He sang, he danced, he flew airplanes, he conducted symphony orchestras (sometimes doing ``The Flight of the Bumblebee'' with a fly swatter), he was a master of Chinese cooking, he charmed British royalty with performances at the London Palladium. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"

"151839"	"she"	"danced"	" 'DORIS DAY COLLECTION' There no doubt that Doris Day is one of the all-time favorite screen stars (No. 24 on Entertainment Weekly's list), but scan over her list of movies and it's unlikely that any one actor or actress on that list has such a flimsy resume of memorable work. Day, who recently turned 81, was an American sweetheart. She sang, she danced, she kept her virginal status. She did work with a major director -- Alfred Hitchcock on The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) -- and a few decent directors, like Norman Jewison, but her movies were put together to exploit the public's love affair with her. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"

, he says,	 Franco sees nothing out of the ordinary about this. It is, he says, part of his job description, as if inscribed in his contract is a stipulation that requires him to help younger teammates tie neckties and fine tune their swings. But, Franco says, as a gentle reminder, it is not the only thing he can still do. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060421.0284 type=story > <HEADLINE> 2,000 PROTEST IN MARCH ON CAPITOL </HEADLINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, she said,	 Robyn Burrell, a 20-year-old pre-med student at Florida A&amp;M University, wore a Band-Aid over her eye in a reference to Anderson's beating. The point of the march, she said, was to send a message to Bush. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz

, she said,	 Minnesota, in fact, has become a key player in the anti-trafficking movement, said Barb Frey, director of the university's human rights program, which sponsored the conference.

, she said,	 For all her newfound wealth, Crawford said she planned to continue to live in the gray, two-story house she shares with her daughter and son-in-law, Patricia and Lou Orth. Her gray Honda Civic, which she bought just a few months ago, is just fine, she said, beautiful. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, she said,	 Crawford's biggest concession to her new financial situation is a planned family vacation to Italy, where her parents -- her father's last name was Colangelo -- were born. Otherwise, she said, her new millions provide her with peace of mind, knowing she can pass on her wealth to her children, their children and their children. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz

, it reported,	 Teens say they use alcohol for many reasons: from boredom and stress to sex appeal and the cachet of cool. Cash also plays a role, according to a 2003 study by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University. More than half the country's 12- to 17-year-olds, it reported, are at greater risk of substance abuse because of high stress, frequent boredom, too much spending money -- or some combination of these. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz

, he added,	 But, he added, there may be other charges associated with an accident in a rental vehicle that your insurance policy does not cover, like the rental agency's administrative fees and costs associated with the time the vehicle is out of service. That can add up to thousands and thousands of dollars, he said. These charges are covered by most rental agencies' collision insurance, which they often call a damage waiver. Your credit card company also may cover damages to a rental but probably does not offer liability protection. Most car rental companies let you buy collision and liability insurance separately. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, he observes,	 One time-waster: PSAT prep. Montague discourages students from preparing for what is designed to be a practice test. Colleges do not see PSAT scores. And while the highest scorers win scholarship money, he observes, there are not a lot of National Merit scholarships, quite frankly, and therefore, I'm not sure it's worth the investment. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, she said,	 Michelle Barnes, the vice president for marketing for the Outdoor Industry Association said interest in wilderness and survival schools was piqued when Survivor became a hit show in 2000. (The schools are unaccredited so there is no official count.) Then, she said, participation leveled off, but the success of Lost has reignited it, and schools are creating ever-more-extreme and far-fetched experiences. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, he said,	 In his Urban Scout class, Brown uses SWAT training facilities at local police departments to teach students evasion and survival tactics. A few years ago, he said, a couple who took one of his classes used the skills they learned to bust a drug deal in their New Jersey neighborhood. All they did was camouflage up and hide behind some garbage bins and take pictures, he said, which they anonymously gave to the police. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, he added,	 Harvey Mansfield, author of the recent book Manliness, and a professor of government at Harvard, said, When manliness has nothing positive to do it goes to experiences that are contrived. It is odd, he added, that when we need real fighters all we get is pretend fighters. Young men sign up for extreme survival courses because they are as embarrassed about patriotism as they are about manliness, and to go into the military may seem too conventional. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060421.0314 type=story > <HEADLINE> THE SOCIALITE WORE A BLACK TIE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> NEW YORK </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, they argue,	 If it works, advocates say, it's because people are belatedly realizing that men's colleges can play as positive and distinctive a role as women's. And, they argue, at a time when men are lagging badly in higher education, they may be more relevant than ever. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, they compete,	 Fourth is a campus life that strives for the delicate balance between competition and cooperation, and often achieves it. This is a place that cultivates the competitiveness of young men in a very healthy way, said Phillips of Wabash. Because we're small and most students know each other, they compete, but in a brotherly way, without being bloodthirsty the way it might be in a larger place. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, he says,	 David Neidorf, the academic dean at Deep Springs, says that 15 years ago, most of the students felt the single-sex policy was a mistake. Now, he says, most agree with it. My suspicion is it has to do with the fact that for kids of this generation, the whole social struggle for women's rights appears to them as if it's already over, he said. It isn't in some sense, but they don't know that. But that allows them to focus more attention on the personal aspects of single-sex campuses rather than to see them as political issues. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, he says,	 Steven J. Klein, dean of admissions of Wabash, says that every applicant has to get over the initial hurdle of the 100-0 man-woman ratio. So when admissions colleagues compliment him on having a niche to sell, he replies: Yes, but it's a niche that no one wants. Still, he says, in his nine years at Wabash, applications have risen from the mid-700s to the 1,300s. And the college is embracing its identity. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz

Or at least, I explain, I did love sex, once upon a time, before I was writing a book and fronting a band and stripping almost every night and paying a mortgage and managing a household and trying occasionally to sleep. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, she says,	 Madden started off at American University, which had been her second choice, and it soon disappointed her. The university lacked school spirit, she says, and seemed too politically charged. (It was the autumn of the 2000 elections.) She found herself shying away from campus activities, unlike the student she had been in high school. She felt uncertain about her classes, and sometimes overwhelmed. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, she says,	 In Iowa City, she had been a member of a sorority and other campus groups, and she missed her friends after transferring. Still, she says, I wouldn't make a different decision. I like to know what's ahead of me, I like to be very organized, and this was an interest where I saw myself wanting to build a career. It was hard to leave, but I kept thinking, am I going to go back to school just to hang out with my friends? </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, he continued,	 Etzioni disagreed. Politics is really not about good management, he asserted. Politics is about taking conflicting interests, conflicting values and building common ground.

, he argued,	 But recommendations from proxy advisers, who are paid by institutions for advice on how to vote, are not always heeded -- a vivid example of a power shift outlined by Bogle, in his book, The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism. Ownership of American companies, he argued, has moved from a diffuse group of individual shareholders into a handful of powerful financial institutions such as mutual funds and banks. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, he said,	 These organizations are reluctant dragons when it comes to exercising corporate citizenship, Bogle wrote. One reason, he said, is the clear conflict of interest they face in managing the retirement plan assets of the very corporations whose shares they own and collectively control. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, he said,	 Jon Fredrikson, a California wine industry consultant, calls it the perfect wine for a public grown up on soft drinks. Yellow Tail, Fredrikson said, is round, fruity and user-friendly, and it's immediately drinkable. Even more important, he said, is the consistency of the wine's high quality. With a lot of wines, he said, the first batch is great and the second and third are disappointing. Yellow Tail has been consistently good since the first shipment arrived five years ago. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz

, he said,	 The recovery room had a beautiful view of the Tampa waterfront, but Dad couldn't have cared less. He had just come up from the surgery and was in and out of sleep. They were watching him closely because his blood pressure wouldn't go down. It wouldn't go down, he said, because they kept taking my blood pressure. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, he did,	 Jamie Wyeth's landscapes and portraits, of both people and animals, are more freighted than his father's. Born in 1946, he did, after all, come of age during the Vietnam War. He grew up surrounded by an extended family of artists and was home-schooled at an early age after he evinced a strong desire and aptitude for painting. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
