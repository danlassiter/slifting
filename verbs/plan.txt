It is, you see, about dancing. The brainchild of actress Neve Campbell, who danced with the National Ballet School of Canada before injuries forced her -- gosh darn it -- to become a noted television (``Party of Five'') and movie (``Scream'') star, the film focuses on the life of Chicago's Joffrey Ballet troupe. Directed by the oft-offbeat Robert Altman, whose movies range from ``MASH'' and ``Nashville'' to ``Short Cuts'' and ``Gosford Park,'' the film eschews the usual ``Turning Point'' histrionics and ``Red Shoes'' fantasizing for an unemphatic, observational study of what makes dancers and their companies tick.

, he said,	 There were many turning points in his career. One certainly came with his first encounter with Pinter, which he recalled in a tribute on the playwright's 70th birthday. It was 1960 and the actor's agent told him he had been offered a new play that he ``couldn't make head nor tail of,'' and the pay was only six pounds a week. He had a better offer from BBC television, and so there was nothing to discuss. Bates disagreed. He didn't understand the play either, he said, but ``I'd had an instinctive reaction to its poetry and humanity, and I would definitely be doing it.'' After opening night the agent said, ``Never listen to me again.'' The play was ``The Caretaker,g' nd Bates created the role of the wily Mick. </P> 	nyt_eng_200312.gz
, he said,	 And of course there was ``Fortune's Fool,'' his final (and Tony winning) Broadway performance, in which he was poignant and amusing as the wistful title character.

, he said,	 In 1900, when Frank Lloyd Wright was in the early years of his career, the average single-family American house was 700 to 1,200 square feet and could be had for less than $5,000. A century later, it had grown to roughly 2,300 square feet and cost more than $200,000. Now the trend is turning toward the ``not-so-big house,'' in which lofty foyers and unused living rooms are sacrificed in favor of living spaces that are both useful and beautiful. Wright, Maddex writes, ``started out thinking small.'' Home, he said, ``means more than money, and the smaller means sometimes show the very best results.'' This book offers a long and well-illustrated discussion of the techniques Wright used to make small houses seem bigger, followed by profiles of 10 of Wright 's smaller houses, including two here in the Valley. The photographs are beautiful, and each profile includes a floor plan. In every case, these structures are grand despite their reasonable size. ``You have the sense of space -- not space itself but the sense of space,'' was how Wright described it. Then, as now, less was more. </P> 	nyt_eng_200312.gz
