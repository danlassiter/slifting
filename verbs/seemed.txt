But Cathy Kramer (her maiden name) was a flight attendant with Braniff who couldn't place Karl. As the daughter of a basketball referee she had connections with the game, but was unfamiliar with one of the local San Antonio stars. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"

"54322"	"it"	"seemed"	" Such is his nature. As a boy, Runyon's parents could not afford to send him to summer camp, and he remembers watching wistfully as young friends packed off to adventures in the Texas Hill Country. He has tried to compensate ever since _ marathoning, cycling, hang-gliding, bungee-jumping.

"57079"	"it"	"seemed"	" Some of the most exciting choreography was in the program's modern-dance and ballet duets. Jacqulyn Buglisi's ``Sospiri'' was a canny, passionate fling for urgent lovers, danced to the hilt by Christine Dakin and Donlin Foreman.

"63190"	"it"	"seemed"	" ``There's a woman with hair on her chest.'' It's a line from ``The Thin Man,'' but Dashiell Hammett might have been looking at Lillian Hellman when he wrote it. This dual biography portrays her as a self-serving ``she-Hammett'' who drained the hard-drinking writer of his style and professional energy. When he was found in contempt of court for refusing to implicate others during the anti-Communist witch hunts of the 1950s, she worried only for her own career, refusing to post bail, visit him in jail or even meet him upon his release. And she lied, it seemed, about everything, including about her importance to him.

POLITICAL BRIEFS: THE CAMPAIGNS AND THE ISSUES (bl) By MICHAEL WINES c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service  MINNESOTA: GOP Focusing On Welfare Vote  Minnesota Republicans profess delight over Thursday's Senate vote to enact a stiff new welfare law, not so much because their party's proposal passed but because one Democrat made a point of opposing it.  That Democrat is Sen. Paul Wellstone, the energetic and sometimes hyperbolic Minnesotan who is locked in a potentially tight re-election struggle against the man he unseated in 1990, Rudy Boschwitz.  Boschwitz has run a buzzsaw of a campaign featuring billboards that dubbed his opponent ``Senator Welfare'' and ``Welfare Man'' for his support of federal antipoverty programs, and he seems poised to push the issue even harder.  ``The vast majority of Minnesotans want workfare, not welfare, and Paul Wellstone is arrogantly disregarding the wishes of the people of Minnesota,'' said Jon Lerner, the manager of the Boschwitz campaign.  Wellstone, who gave a fiery Senate speech Thursday mocking the notion that cuts in welfare spending were reforms, was unrepentant. In an interview Friday, he said the evidence ``is irrefutable that this legislation will create more poverty and more hunger among people.''  ``There can be a zillion attacks,'' he said. ``I won't vote to take food out of the mouths of hungry children.''  Boschwitz's campaign could use a lift. Many polls say Wellstone has a lead of 6 to 8 points despite Republican attacks.  A former Republican pollster in Minneapolis, Bill Morris, said Wellstone's decision to buck both the Senate and his President on the welfare bill could hurt.  Belying its liberal image, Minnesota takes a moderate stand on welfare and has grown more conservative in the 1990s, Morris said.  Then again, Morris said, one of Wellstone's main assets is his charismatic image as a go-getter and a maverick.  Wellstone solidified that image Thursday, promising a national tour of poverty-stricken areas to underscore the need for government aid.  Friday, Boschwitz announced his own tour _ this one, Lerner said, highlighting ``people who have worked hard and overcome adversity and lifted themselves up from the welfare rolls.''  CALIFORNIA: Change Advocates In Bitter Dispute  In the prohibition movement known as campaign finance reform, it is as if war had broken out between the Salvation Army and the Women's Christian Temperance Union.  The California Public Interest Research Group, part of Ralph Nader's political muckraking network, is locked in a ferocious battle with Common Cause, the League of Women Voters and their allies over whose November ballot initiative will best clean up state political campaigns.  The fray began after talks on a single ballot measure limiting campaign contributions broke down between Calpirg, as the Nader group is known, and an umbrella group led by Common Cause, the League, the American Association of Retired Persons and United We Stand America.  The two groups wrote separate proposals and gathered enough signatures to put them on the ballot.  But they did not stop arguing. Calpirg's measure, it seemed, contained a ``poison pill'' specifying that if both initiatives passed, the Common Cause plan would be nullified if it drew fewer votes, but the Calpirg measure would take effect regardless. Common Cause counterattacked, seeking to bounce Calpirg off the ballot.  When that failed, the Common Cause group sued to force the Calpirg measure off the ballot, arguing that its signers were never told of a fine-print clause that would repeal all limits on gifts to state officials. The court rejected the suit. Common Cause and its allies have appealed.  Meanwhile, Calpirg countersued after California's attorney general added the gift-law repeal to the combined ballot measure that voters will see in November.  The rivals call it a philosophical dispute. But Tony Miller, a Common Cause board member and head of the umbrella group, also calls the Calpirg proposal ``outrageous'' and a loophole-filled ``deception.''  Doug Phelps, who heads both the national Nader group and the California initiative, said Common Cause and its allies ``are not willing to debate the real issue,'' containing spending, but want only to tinker with the current system.  It is the sort of guerrilla fight one expects to see in a nasty political campaign, not a movement for change. ``The way this is going,'' Phelps said, ``the public-interest community in California is going to be on Oprah Winfrey by October.''  FLORIDA: Tumbling Off Spending Wagon  It once seemed that the political temperance movement had succeeded in Florida. But campaigns are once again off the spending wagon there, too.  The state Legislature had enacted a law providing public financing for the campaigns of candidates for governor and the state cabinet, matching all private contributions up to $250 as long as candidates agreed to limit overall spending.  The law worked as planned in 1994, when the state put up $11.4 million to match contributions for statewide candidates, including $4.7 million that aided the paper-thin victory of Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat.  But then a raft of unhappy Republicans and some Democrats, calling the law ``welfare for politicians,'' mounted a petition drive to place on the ballot a constitutional amendment that would abolish the law.  And the Legislature decided this year not to replenish the fund that provides the matching money.  The petition drive has been suspended. ``We think the funding source has been eradicated,'' said Phil Handy, a Winter Park businessman. Many expect the issue to be settled, eventually, in the courts. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960804.0058 type=story > <HEADLINE> CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM DOLE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WASHINGTON (BC-REPUBS-DOLE-750-(2TAKES)-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199608.gz"

Includes a color slide of Jane Curtin in a scene from ``3rd Rock from the Sun.'' By PETER MARKS c.1996 The New York Times (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Jane Curtin was cleaning her kitchen in Connecticut one frigid January evening when the telephone rang.  It was her old friend, the comedy writer Bonnie Turner. The call was not spur of the moment. This was a television emergency. Would Curtin, she wanted to know, consider another go at a sitcom?  Turner, it seemed, was in a bind. She and her husband, Terry, writing partners with whom Curtin had worked on ``Saturday Night Live'' and the 1993 film ``The Coneheads,'' were developing a new comedy about a group of eccentric aliens who come to Earth and take human form.  The writers urgently required a straight woman with a bit of an edge to play the aliens' thoroughly human foil, and Curtin sprang to mind.  ``They'd shot the pilot, and the character that they created for the love interest didn't quite work,'' Curtin says. ``They had made this character too sweet, and so there was no tension.''  Although Curtin said she was committed to another project and was not available, Turner was not put off. She told Curtin she could have the role on her own terms.  ``She said, `You only have to do as many shows as you want,''' the actress recalls. ``I said, `OK, seven.' And she said, `Seven it is.'''  As effortlessly as that, Curtin began her re-entry into a universe she had already conquered in five seasons on ``Kate and Allie,'' the successful 1980s sitcom in which she was a co-star with Susan Saint James.  The new show, ``3rd Rock From the Sun,'' which also stars John Lithgow _ who won a 1996 Emmy for his sitcom debut in this role _ would prove to be another hit for Curtin, an actress who seems unable to miss on series television.  One of the original Not Ready for Prime Time Players on ``Saturday Night Live,'' on which she appeared for five seasons ending in 1980, Curtin was already television-comedy royalty when she signed on to ``Kate and Allie'' in 1984.  ``3rd Rock,'' which had its premiere on NBC in January 1996, completes the actress' comedic hat trick. In The New York Times, the television critic John J. O'Connor called the show ``brilliantly idiotic, a daffy pastiche of farce, burlesque and satire.''  Of all the original ``Saturday Night Live'' cast members, Curtin has had by far the most successful television career. Others who joined ``Saturday Night'' in subsequent years, such as Bill Murray and Eddie Murphy, went on to film stardom or graduated to standout roles in prime time, as did Julia-Louis Dreyfus and Phil Hartman.  But no other ``Saturday Night'' alum can match Curtin for such sustained achievement on acclaimed shows.  ``There's really no formula to this _ you just get lucky,'' Curtin says by telephone from her dressing room in a television studio in Los Angeles, where ``3rd Rock From the Sun'' is taped.  ``I was always hoping for a life in television, but I didn't know what to imagine after `Saturday Night Live,''' she says. ``I had done a movie while I was on `Saturday Night,' and I had done theater before that, but I really liked television.  ``I liked the immediacy of it, the fact that you didn't have to repeat yourself every week and that it was fast,'' she says. ``Ideally, a sitcom is like a little play each week, and I liked that instant gratification.''  On ``3rd Rock From the Sun,'' Curtin plays Dr. Mary Albright, a professor at a Midwestern college who shares an office with Dick Solomon, the human identity that Lithgow's alien character has assumed.  The show revels in its own silliness. Much of the sitcom's humor derives from the absurdities of everyday life as revealed by a family of aliens who are entirely unfamiliar with the mores of expected behavior.  Albright may be a scholar, but she's a little thick when it comes to the bizarre goings-on in the Solomon household, populated by Lithgow and his compadres from outer space, played by Kristen Johnson, French Stewart and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  It may be that she is blinded by her attraction to Lithgow's character. In any event, she is the oblivious/suspicious human bystander, a role with a great tradition in supernatural sitcoms, from Gladys Kravitz, the nosy neighbor in ``Bewitched,'' to Dr. Bellows, the snooty superior officer in ``I Dream of Jeanie.''  Curtin laughs easily about her exploits on ``3rd Rock.'' She takes the show no more seriously than do viewers.  ``It's actually about nothing,'' the actress says, a characterization that in the age of ``Seinfeld'' is a compliment. ``It's just about the way human beings behave.  ``I loved the character, but I also loved the sense of humor on the show,'' she says. ``I had known John in New York, and I'm very comfortable with him. It made me laugh when John and I were working together _ there just would be puddles on the floor.''  Eventually, Curtin agreed to extend her limited commitment to the show. In July, she and her family, diehard Easterners, moved to Los Angeles.  ``We decided to give it a go,'' she says, adding that her daughter is attending high school there.  A semblance of normalcy amid the insanity of weekly television is important to Curtin. One of the things she loved most about ``Kate and Allie,'' she says, was that she was able to walk from her apartment in Manhattan to the studio in the Ed Sullivan Theater, where the show was taped and where David Letterman now performs nightly.  Curtin is not a flashy performer. Unlike many who made their names on ``Saturday Night Live,'' she had no quintessential Jane Curtin character, no Church Lady or Buckwheat or Samurai Dry Cleaner. Curtin made an art of fitting in wherever she was needed, a talent that has served her well through the years.  With continued television success has come a comfort level with her abilities and a confidence that there will always be a place for her.  ``It's gotten to the point where if it wasn't going to be fun, I didn't want to do it,'' she says of the job offers she has turned down. ``If it wasn't going to be right or you aren't interested in the people involved, you should be comfortable enough not to be intimidated into doing it.''  At the moment, she is plenty comfortable. The 20-minute commute from home to studio agrees with her, as does life in California, to her surprise.  ``I keep trying to tell friends of mine in New York who are theater people or movie people what it's like to do a sitcom,'' she says. ``I paint a very rosy picture. And I don't think they believe me.''  (Peter Marks reports on entertainment for The New York Times.)

Excerpted from the book ``Stay Tuned,'' published by Doubleday, a division of Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, Inc. Includes a 100-word sidebar. By JANE MURPHY and KAREN TUCKER c.1996 by Jane Murphy and Karen Tucker World English language rights only. (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  Video can be an entertaining reward and a valuable educational resource when parents get involved in their kids' viewing. But the question of what to watch is perhaps the most highly charged area, because it involves the hot topics of violence, sex, language, stereotypes and negative role models.  ``As a rule, a VCR should be used to watch programs, not to `watch TV,''' say Jane Murphy and Karen Tucker, authors of ``Stay Tuned'' (Doubleday, 1996), a book on responsible family TV viewing. Select what you want to see, watch it, then turn off the set. And consider locating your TV centrally, so it's obvious when and what the kids are watching.  Following is an excerpt from ``Stay Tuned'' on how parents can optimize the quality of their children's TV time. VIOLENCE  Over 1,000 studies have shown connections between violence in the media and violent behavior by children.  ``Children do what they see,'' says Dr. William Dietz, a researcher in the field of TV violence and its effects on children. He goes on to say that children watch approximately 12,000 violent acts per year on TV.  Most major professional organizations of educators and doctors have recommended that parents limit their children's viewing of violence because of the evidence that viewing violence is strongly linked with aggressive behavior.  One-third of kids ages 10 through 16 polled in Los Angeles in 1992 said they often want to try things they see on television. In 1993, the Yich Youth Monitor surveyed kids ages 9-17, and two-thirds of them thought there was too much violence on TV.  The American Psychological Association encourages parents to protect kids from feeling that the world is unsafe, from becoming insensitive to the pain and suffering of others, imitating negative things they see. Limiting what and how much TV our kids see is one very effective way to work toward these recommendations.  Realistically, it's impossible to screen out every bit of violence that's portrayed on the screen. And it's probably not a good idea to do that anyway, because violence is part of our human condition.  The issue and decisions around it involve your particular kid, the context and presentation of violence and whether your child is watching alone or with you to share the experience and offer commentary. SEX  We've come a long way from ``I Love Lucy,'' in which Ricky and Lucy slept in twin beds, and Lucy couldn't even use the word ``pregnant,'' which she clearly was at the time.  The American Psychological Association estimates that American teenagers are exposed to 14,000 sexual references and innuendos per year. Sex is on the soaps, in commercials and in promos for upcoming shows. Kids can easily get the idea from television and movies that sex is the dominant aspect of relationships and one they should sample soon.  Every parent has his or her own point of view regarding the presentation of sex. However you feel, you need to clarify your own feelings first, then you will be confident in presenting them to your kids. LANGUAGE  Another touchy area, language, may reflect a character's point of view, an historical context or a cultural bias. We should sensitize our kids to its impact. And, we should be aware that if we use a fair amount of ``rich'' language at home, it will be tough to rule out some programming on that basis alone.  In fact, cursing language once considered aberrant by mental health professionals is no longer used as a diagnostic criterion for certain emotional disorders.  Dr. Timothy Jay, in ``Cursing in America'' (Benjamins Publishing, 1992), writes that while dialogue in 1940s gangster movies was limited to ``You dirty rat,'' ``GoodFellas'' (1990) had 400 curse words. STEREOTYPES AND NEGATIVE ROLE MODELS  TV and video are full of presentations of characters stereotyped by gender, ethnicity or age. The references may be subtle enough to elude us, or our own biases may filter our awareness.  It's important to be alert to stereotypes and to consider whenever they are truly inappropriate for our kids or whether they represent an opportunity for discussion.  Characters in film and television sometimes act in ways you wouldn't want your kids to imitate. Cheating, drug and alcohol abuse and disrespect of teachers and parents are frequently portrayed.  How the plot gets played out is key when these issues arise. Are there negative consequences for these types of behavior?  The mix of what your kids watch is also important, because an occasional example of drug abuse may well be counterbalanced by other viewing. Of course, your kids' ages are significant indicators as well. SCARINESS  Next to violence and sex, scariness might seem like small potatoes. Truth is, the scariness of dark closets, monsters and things that go bump in the night is another big issue to tackle in selecting appropriate viewing for your kids. And it's hardly ever an obvious decision.  Certainly, age and development can provide guidelines for what are classic concerns at various stages, but what constitutes ``scary'' really comes down to the individual child and what they may be worrying about at the time.  Often you can judge ``not scary,'' ``OK scary'' or ``too scary'' by whether the scene, circumstance or character in question are cartoonish and exaggerated or too real for comfort. Some kids don't mind shoot-em-up action-adventures but can get worked up over real-life situations that are too close to home.  For instance, for a young child who's anxious about his mom who's away at work or visiting relatives even ``Bambi'' could be upsetting because Bambi's mother dies in a fire.  In ``The Uses of Enchantment'' (Random House, 1989), celebrated child psychologist Bruno Bettelheim's book on the value of fairy tales, we learn that ``scary'' may have a rightful place in children's lives. Bettelheim maintains fears and aggressions children experience as part of their normal development get confronted and resolved through these classic stories. The predicaments of Hansel and Gretel, Little Red Riding Hood and a cast of thousands of other familiar characters help kids feel less alone about their own feelings.  Of course, this point of view doesn't give us license to let the kids watch everything. Reading or hearing stories are less graphic than seeing the same themes treated on the screen, so care must be taken. HOSTING OTHER CHILDREN  These colorful gray areas are factors that must also be considered when you have other children over, so you need to be sensitive to what they're viewing.  If you have any doubt about whether the programming is right for them or OK with their parents, check ahead of time to get the green light. In fact, if you're planning a party or another occasion where kids will be watching a tape, poll the kids ahead time on what they'd like to see and get clearance and ideas from parents. Everyone, including the kids, will appreciate this consideration, and your kids' friends and their parents may reciprocate in the future. THE GRAY AREAS ARE NEVER BLACK OR WHITE  It's impossible to be a purist in making choices in these ubiquitous gray areas. Many wonderful films and programs succeed in carrying a valuable message, presenting an engaging story or offering great entertainment, except for one scene, one objectioharacter or stereotype.  For example, ``Old Yeller'' (1957) is a classic heartwarming story about a family dog and a boy's growing responsibility. There are, however, some inappropriate references made to Native Americans in this story, which is set in the 1860s American West, and the dog gets rabies and must be killed by the owner, who loves him. What do you do?  You need to make these decisions based on your knowledge of your own child. If you feel your kid can handle the dog dying, go ahead and let him watch, and discuss the fact that this movie presents some outmoded and unfair comments about America's original inhabitants.  A technology you can consider for restricting access to selected programs is the ``V-chip,'' which would censor violent programs. Parents could program their sets to not show violent programs (indicated as violent in TV listings).  A drawback to the chip is that someone somewhere will predetermine for your family what's considered too violent. The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) ratings of theatrical movies are often steeped in controversy, because one person's PG may be another's PG-13.  Perhaps the best way to handle TV programming is drawing up your own criteria and advising advertisers of your support for government and industry guarantees of programming designed specifically for children.  Begin your deliberations by considering your kids' ages, maturity, concerns and personalities. These will be the factors that will contribute the most to your making the right decisions for them. -0- SIDEBAR: WHAT ARE OUR KIDS WATCHING?  Here are some thought-provoking facts to consider when evaluating what your child watches on TV:  _ The average child grows up watching 20,000 murders before she turns 18.  _ Teenagers are exposed to 14,000 sexual references and innuendos per year on TV. Only 150 of these deal with responsibility, abstinence or birth control.  _ African Americans make up only 5 percent of the casts in children's programming, while, in fact, they make up 12.1 percent of the U.S. population.  _ Even though 10 percent of the U.S. population is Latino, a child sees only one Latino character every other weekend out of the 123 characters on Saturday morning TV.

By KATHY SENA From Los Angeles Times c. 1996 Kathy Sena (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  When the owner decided to sell the Los Feliz, Calif., home where Eva Bizar and her husband were living, Bizar was prepared to be helpful. She polished the floors, kept the kitchen spotless and agreed to stay away from home for an afternoon during an open house arranged by the real estate agent.  What she wasn't prepared for was the two men who blended in with the crowd during the open house and made off with her jewelry _ including a much-loved diamond anniversary band.  ``I couldn't believe some people would go to an open house with the express purpose of stealing things,'' Bizar says.  But that's exactly what about 5 percent of the people who attend open houses are doing, says Gregg McMullin, a police officer for the Manhattan Beach, Calif., Police Department's crime prevention unit.  ``You get a real cross-section of people at an open house,'' he adds. ``You see buyers and you see burglars pretending to be buyers.''  It's tough for a real estate agent to keep a constant watch on everyone who wanders through an open house, McMullin says, ``so you need to control things as much as possible.''  Bizar thought she was doing just that when, in preparation for the open house, she placed her frequently worn jewelry in a box and tucked it in the back of a drawer in the bathroom.  ``I thought I was being careful,'' she says. ``I didn't leave the jewelry out on a dresser, waiting to be stolen.'' But the thieves were in and out of the house in minutes. COVERING YOUR ASSETS  Unfortunately, Bizar isn't alone. Homeowners all across the country have reported having expensive family heirlooms, collectibles _ even prescription drugs _ stolen during an open house. And many of these items aren't covered under a standard homeowner's policy, says Robert Ray, a registered representative with Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Co. in Redondo Beach, Calif.  ``Items stolen during an open house would be (covered under the category) `mysterious disappearance,''' he explains, noting that items valued at more than $500 should probably be scheduled separately on a homeowner's policy.  But even if these items are insured, he says, you should still take precautions.  ``I tell people to put valuables in their safe deposit box during an open house,'' Ray says, ``Why take the risk?'' PROTECTING YOUR VALUABLES  But what if your autographed Mickey Mantle baseball won't fit in your safe deposit box? There are lots of safe places to hide your valuables, according to experts.  The main objective is to get your valuables out of reach, not just out of sight. Try the attic, the trunk of your car or the neighbor's house.  ``You might as well pack up everything of value, because you're going to be moving anyway,'' says Susan Stearns, a realtor associate with Prudential Jon Douglas West Valley in Los Angeles.  ``I always ask the neighbors to be on the lookout for suspicious activity when I'm having an open house,'' she adds.  Also, make sure everyone who enters the home signs the guest register, is acknowledged by the agent, and _ if possible _ is accompanied by the agent as they tour your home.  Having two agents working an open house together can be a great security measure for both the seller and for the agents themselves.  ``With team open houses you can have one agent at the door greeting people and the other agent showing prospective buyers through the house,'' says Dorothy LaRose, an associate broker with Shorewood Realtors in Manhattan Beach.  With just one agent, ``you can't cover a large or a two-story house,'' she adds. FOILING FUTURE BURGLARS  Keep in mind, as you're doing your pre-open-house security check, that a potential burglar may stop by the open house to check out your home for a future break-in.  ``You want to make your home looks lived-in, whether or not you're living there at the time,'' McMullin says. For instance, don't leave a stack of unopened mail or newspapers in plain view.  It's also wise to mark large valuables, such as televisions or stereos, with your driver's license number for easier retrieval in the event of a burglary, he adds. Contact your local police department to borrow an engraver and then inscribe the number into the metal.  ``And don't forget to write down the serial numbers of your television, VCR and stereo,'' McMullin says.  If you have an extra car parked at home during an open house, don't leave the car keys on your dresser or on a hook in the kitchen. That's an invitation to a car thief, McMullin says.  ``Put the keys somewhere such as a suit jacket pocket,'' he suggests.  Credit card receipts left on the dresser are an open invitation to a thief who would love to have your Visa number. Toss them out, and while you're at it, take the trash out too.  ``Thieves like to look in your trash for credit card information and for information about your whereabouts,'' McMullin says.  Your family calendar _ the one in the kitchen noting Jimmy's soccer games and Susie's school play _ can also be a source of valuable information to a burglar. During your open house, don't let the world know you're heading to Grandma's for a week next month.  Also, ask you agent in advance to avoid giving out your schedule inadvertently, Stearns advises.  ``Even if you're at work all day, you want your agent telling people, `Yes, they're home all the time.''' WHO'S RESPONSIBLE?  What if, despite all your precautions, you do have a theft during an open house? Is your real estate agent responsible?  ``(Agents) really don't have any liability unless they are negligent,'' says Gov Hutchinson, assistant general council to the California Association of Realtors in Los Angeles.  Hutchinson explains that, when it comes to safeguarding a seller's property, agents are held to a ``general negligence standard,'' and to be liable, ``the agent would have to do something such as leaving the house unlocked or letting in a known criminal.''  But even though the final responsibility generally rests with the homeowner, agents should explain to owners the element of risk inherent in holding an open house. And sellers should discuss with agents _ in advance and in detail _ how they want their property handled. A CALCULATED RISK  In the end, no matter how careful you are, you're still taking a risk when you open your home to the public. And while holding open houses may increase an agent's overall exposure and bring in potential new business, the average owner's chances of selling a home as a result of an open house are only about 1 percent, estimates Marty Rodriguez, co-owner of Century 21 in Glendora, Calif.  It's important for the owner to weigh both the risks and the benefits of flinging open the doors to the public. Just ask Eva Bizar.  ``People need to be aware of the potential problems when they have an open house,'' she says. ``I never thought this would happen to us.'' SIDEBAR: OPEN HOUSE SECURITY CHECKLIST  While it's easy to remember to remove Grandma's ivory pendant from the jewelry box before an open house, here are some other not-so-obvious things you might want to remove from your home:  _ Small electronic items. Remove portable CD players, radios, cameras, CDs and cassette tapes.  ``Anything that's concealable is a possible target for theft,'' according to Gregg McMullin, a police officer for the Manhattan Beach, Calif., Police Department's crime prevention unit.  Cordless and cellular phones are also popular items.  _ Guns and ammunition. While deterring theft is an obvious reason to remove these items, protecting curious children from possible disaster is even more important. Putting a gun on a high closet shelf isn't enough. Get it out of the house.  _ Small items that might be fascinating to a child.  ``I have a sterling silver bird from Tiffany's,'' says Delia Delgado, a real estate associate with Re/Max South County in Newport Beach, Calif. ``I sure wouldn't want a child to walk off with it, thinking it was a neat toy.''  While young children might not steal something intentionally, it would be easy for a youngster to go home with a bird in the hand.  _ Valuable artwork, figurines and collectibles.  _ Silverware and crystal. Pack it before moving and store it before the open house. An added bonus: Your cupboards will appear more spacious.  _ Cash, credit cards, watches and keys. This may seem obvious, but how many of us have a change jar on the dresser, or emergency cash in the sock drawer? And who doesn't routinely leave a watch or keys on the dresser or nightstand?  _ Garage door openers. ``If you leave your garage-door opener in an unlocked car or on the kitchen counter, someone could walk off with it and break in later,'' Delgado says.

Includes a color slide of Tim Roth with Tupac Shakur in a scene from ``Gridlock'd.'' By IAN SPELLING (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Don't call Tim Roth ``the king of the independent film.''  ``That's a journalist's term,'' the British actor says. ``It's not what I call myself.''  Still, Roth's credentials are impressive, including intense performances in offbeat films ranging from ``The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover'' (1989) and ``Vincent and Theo'' (1990) to ``Reservoir Dogs'' (1992) and ``Pulp Fiction'' (1994).  All were independent, non-studio productions. In fact, Roth's resume includes only two studio releases, ``Rob Roy'' (1995) and the upcoming ``Hoodlums.''  ``It's not snobbery,'' the 35-year-old Roth says by phone from the Los Angeles home he shares with his wife and two kids. ``It's that the scripts I liked were coming out of the independent world.  ``It's still that way,'' he adds.  Roth's latest film is ``Gridlock'd,'' a comedy about three performance artists, Stretch (Roth), Spoon (the late Tupac Shakur) and Cookie (Thandie Newton) that opens Jan. 29. When Cookie overdoses and nearly dies, Stretch and Spoon resolve to kick their heroin habits.  It isn't that easy, though. Before they know it, the two are on the run, suspected of murder.  ``It's not the usual subject matter for a comedy, which I liked,'' Roth says. ``You have a Laurel-and-Hardy thing going with me and Tupac.  ``Tupac was the straight man to my character, who's a little more nutty than his. I bounced off him,'' he adds. ``The chance to play that kind of comedy appealed to me.  ``It's a film I'd see,'' he says, ``so it's the kind of film I like to do.''  Shakur was shot in September 1996, soon after completing the picture, and died soon afterward. But the gangsta rapper whose death drew denunciations of his music and his lifestyle was not the Shakur that Roth knew.  The rapper actually asked director Vondie Curtis-Hall not to screen his films or music videos for Roth. He wanted Roth to meet him first.  ``The idea, I suppose, was that he thought he was a very different animal from how he portrayed himself in the media and his other work,'' Roth says. ``I met him and he seemed charming and enthusiastic. He really wanted the role.''  Shakur won the part and, while on set, he and Roth frequently discussed the likelihood of Shakur dying young. After all, Shakur had survived a previous shooting.  ``We talked about how you get out of a situation you've put yourself in,'' Roth says. ``Tupac said that was difficult, because if you walk away too fast, they'll want you.  ``If you try to slide away and move into different areas, they'll still want you,'' he says. ``It seemed to him to be a Catch-22.''  When Roth heard that Shakur had been gunned down in Las Vegas, he was shocked.  ``Conversations are one thing, but the reality is another,'' he says. ``Tupac always felt it was going to happen.  ``But when he was shot, there was that thought, `He pulled through before, he'll pull through again,''' the actor says. ``It didn't happen this time.''  Roth says he's glad that ``Gridlock'd'' is being released. He hopes it will help the moviegoing public judge Shakur for themselves.  ``Tupac did some nice acting,'' Roth says. ``He was natural and would have gotten even better.''  Like Shakur, Roth found his way into acting indirectly. Growing up in London, he hoped to be a sculptor and painter.  But a role in a high-school play hooked him, and acting became his passion. Stage roles followed, then parts in British TV programs and films.  Roth's big break came when he starred in the British TV movie ``Meantime'' (1983) for acclaimed director Mike Leigh. He has worked steadily since, doing films with such admired directors as Robert Altman, Peter Greenaway, Stephen Frears and Quentin Tarantino.  ``Those guys are completely different in the ways they work, the ways they communicate with actors,'' Roth says. ``Most of them are completely driven and obsessive, to the point where they'll bring the film down if they can't do it their way.  ``Which I like,'' he adds with a chuckle. ``Early on, I worked with Mike, and that stays with you, working within his (improvisational) process.  ``Altman makes you feel you have absolute freedom,'' he says. ``Quentin, you just ride on his insanity and trust him.  ``I'd work with any of them again at the drop of a hat,'' he concludes.  Despite occasional surprises such as ``Pulp Fiction,'' it's rare for independent features to capture the collective imagination of mainstream moviegoers. Thus, budgets are low and creative choices can be constricted.  ``There are huge risks and it's amazing that people actually front them,'' Roth says. ``It's so hit-and-miss. In the end, the risks are more worth taking than not.''  Despite his preference for the cutting edge of independent films, Roth clearly enjoyed his role in ``Rob Roy'' as the flamboyant English nemesis of Scottish hero Rob Roy MacGregor (Liam Neeson).  The film was Roth's first with a hefty budget, and let him get in some agile fencing. It also garnered him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.  ``Rob Roy'' also led to a number of offers for mainstream roles, usually as diabolical villains in action movies.  ``I was asked to do a `Die Hard' movie,'' Roth says, laughing an evil laugh. ``I like the `Lethal Weapon' series, actually. Those things are fun, and I might do one some day.''  Currently he can be seen in Woody Allen's musical, ``Everyone Says I Love You,''casts Roth as a newly freed criminal who romances wholesome Drew Barrymore.  Every actor on Earth seems to pine to work with Allen, and Roth was no exception.  ``It was a strange experience,'' he says of ``Everyone,'' which opens nationwide throughout February. ``Woody I really enjoyed, but I was there an awfully long time for my two big scenes.  ``In all, I shot for seven days but was there for six weeks, because Woody pretty much makes up the schedule as he goes,'' he says. ``I did always want to work with him, and I've done it.  ``There you go,'' he adds with a laugh. ``I'd love to do it again.''  In the meantime, however, Roth continues to work at a breakneck pace in the quirky world of independents. His upcoming films include ``Gasoline Alley,'' a drama about two brothers, and ``Liar,'' a psychological thriller.  Then there's the mainstream ``Hoodlums,'' a 1930s gangster saga with Laurence Fishburne and Vanessa Williams in which Roth plays Dutch Schultz.  Next up may be ``The War Zone,'' based on the Alexander Stuart novel about an abused 14-year-old boy. Roth plans to make his directorial debut with the film, and is currently struggling with paperwork in anticipation of filming in the autumn.  ``I have no idea what I'll bring to the table as a director,'' he says. ``What I'm realizing already, from meetings with lawyers and financiers, is that the difference between being an actor and a director is that you have to be a grown-up to direct.  ``People ask the director grown-up questions,'' he says. ``Actors can be children and, in fact, they're expected to be children.''  Even if ``War Zone'' is a hit, Roth plans to keep acting at his current breakneck pace. For all his protests, it is clearly his true love.  ``My work is a huge part of who I am, I suppose,'' he says. ``I'm deeply unhappy when I'm not working.  ``I bitch and moan if I've been working nonstop and I'm exhausted,'' he adds. ``But if I stop for more than a couple of weeks, I'm dead.'' c.1997 Ian Spelling  (Ian Spelling is a New York-based free-lance writer.)

Sitting on the patio of his Los Angeles home in shorts, a T-shirt and bare feet, his dog romping nearby, Leto shrugs.  ``I'm keeping my mouth shut,'' he says. ``I gotta keep a little mystery.''  If you're over 25 or male, you may be wondering who Jared Leto isacting like such a star commodity. But if you're female and under 25, you probably don't need to ask. Since making a splash in the 1994 ABC series ``My So-Called Life,'' the 25-year-old Leto has had the heart of young female America on a string.  At malls, girls scream when they glimpse him. Fan letters pour in by the bagful. One national magazine dubbed him a ``James Dean for the 1990s,'' though he's less brooding than Dean. He's attitude combined with inner turmoil _ not to mention the bluest eyes around.  And now Leto's film career is off and running _ literally _ in ``Prefontaine,'' opening Jan. 24. He plays Olympic runner Steve Prefontaine, who died tragically in a car crash at age 24.  Next month he will be seen as a serial-killer suspect opposite Dennis Quaid and Danny Glover in ``Going West,'' and later this year comes ``Last of the High Kings,'' with Gabriel Byrne.  Young fans will no doubt line up for miles. But don't mention the words ``teen idol.''  ``I hate when I see these young guys go, `Oh, I'm a real actor and not a teen idol,''' Leto gripes. Nevertheless, he adds, ``I'm controlling things so I don't become a teen idol. I don't do photo shoots, I don't do mall appearances. That's disgusting stuff. I'm not creating this following.''  Leto was a self-professed ``weird kid,'' growing up with his older brother Shannon and their single mother in a nomadic lifestyle that included stops in Louisiana, Colorado, Virginia, Wyoming and Haiti.  ``There was no reason,'' Leto says. ``It was a hippie kind of thing.''  Growing up, Leto had no particular plans for his future, which sets him apart sharply from the character he plays. Steve ``Pre'' Prefontaine was noted primarily for his iron determination.  Born in Oregon, Prefontaine had everything going against him as a runner _ one of his legs was shorter than the other, some said he was too small and others that he wasn't fast enough.  ``These people forgot something,'' Prefontaine said. ``I have to win.''  Prefontaine became world-famous at the 1972 Munich Olympics, and held every American distance record from 2,000 meters to 10,000 meters until his death.  Even making the film involved a race of sorts: Another film about the athlete, called ``Pre,'' produced by Tom Cruise and starring newcomer Billy Crudup, will open this fall. Unlike ``Prefontaine,'' it did not have the consent or assistance of the runner's family.  Director Steve James, creator of ``Hoop Dreams'' (1994), picked Leto for the role after producer Irby Smith spotted him on MTV reruns of ``So-Called Life.''  ``I guess it didn't hurt that I'm a dead ringer for Steve Prefontaine,'' Leto says. ``It's all in the eyes. He had very intense eyes, and people have said the same thing about me.  ``Pre's real sister came to the set one day,'' he adds, ``and she took one look at me and burst into tears. I was real sorry that she was crying, but inside I couldn't help being happy because I thought, `We're really getting this thing right.'''  Getting it right wasn't easy. Leto isn't a runner, to begin with. And on his third day of training _ with coach Pat Tyson, a former teammate of Prefontaine's at the University of Oregon _ he blew his knee out.  ``I wanted to cry,'' he admits. ``I just couldn't believe this happened. We had to start filming two months later.''  Leto went into intense rehabilitation therapy.  ``I had what they call electrostimulation, where they give you little shock treatments to build up the tissue,'' he says. ``The rest was a lot of Advil. The medic at our training center always had an ice bucket for me to literally jump into after doing a lap.''  For the film, Leto had to run only in short bursts of 200 meters.  ``Still, it was exhausting, because we had days when I would be running on and off for 12 hours,'' he says. ``I had to keep reminding myself that single mothers on welfare had it a lot tougher, and I should just shut up because all I was doing was making a movie.''  That he is making movies is in its own way quite remarkable. Leto began acting only three years ago, when he moved to Los Angeles. Previously he had never acted, not even in a school play.  Six months later, he was cast in ``My So-Called Life,'' and his career took off.  ``When I got it, I had no idea it was going to be good,'' he admits. ``I thought it was some dumb teen show. Then I saw the pilot and I was blown away. It hooked me emotionally.''  When ``My So-Called Life'' was canceled after one season because of star Claire Danes's desire to pursue a movie career, Leto declined various offers to star in teen movies.  ``I'm not that much an idiot,'' he says. ``I'm interested in acting, not posturing.  ``For me, I want to be excited when I read a script,'' Leto says. ``I have to go, `Wow!' It's like when I read `Prefontaine.' I said, `I gotta do it.'''  Nevertheless, he doesn't plan to see the film.  ``I'd sit there and go, `Oh God, they picked that take? I want to kill myself,''' he says. ``When I see myself on screen, I just see everything that I did wrong.'''  As to the future, Leto is set on a film career, but is troubled by a sense of his own mortality. He believes that, like Steve Prefontaine, he may be destined to die young.  ``A palmreader once told me that I'm going to have a short life,'' he says matter-of-factly. ``I also get letters from some wacko who tells me that I'm going to die before a certain age. It's just this creepy thing that I live with.  ``I guess that's why I want to be good in everything I do and not waste my chances,'' he says. ``I want to make every moment and every movie count.''  This focus extends even to his personal life. He doesn't have time for dating, Leto says, or even many friends.  ``Honestly, I don't think I've ever had a date,'' he says. ``I'm not the dating type. I didn't have a date in all of high school.''  The actor likes to think of himself as a loner.  ``I like that word, `loner.' It sounds sort of romantic,'' he says. ``I've got friends. I just don't know who they are.''  Instead, his time is spent working _ and, believe it or not, running, a habit he picked up during ``Prefontaine.''  ``It's always just me running around by myself,'' Leto says, ``through the empty streets and up the Hollywood hills like the young loner I am.  ``See, girls?'' he says with a laugh. ``I'm just a cliche.'' c.1997 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.)

By LAURA VITALE c.1996 Diversion (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  Last year a friend and I, in an effort to fill a few holes in our CD collections, each considered joining one of those mail-order music clubs _ the ones advertised in magazine inserts that boast hundreds of selections and amazing offers such as, in our case, ``10 CDs for the Price of One with Nothing More to Buy, Ever!''  Only problem was, neither of us was able to find 10 selections we liked in order to take advantage of the introductory deal. So she, an alternative rock fan, and I, one who prefers '60s music, decided to join a club together under a single membership. We each received five CDs that we wanted, and we split the cost.  Mail-order music clubs work much like book clubs. They offer special deals to get you to join; then they usually require you to buy a certain number of titles (most say just one) within a specified period of time.  The major clubs _ Columbia House, BMG Music Service and CD Headquarters _ advertise in national magazines (Columbia House also solicits by mail) and send out monthly catalogs to their members. Both Columbia and BMG offer cassettes as well as CDs. The clubs also mail a featured selection every month unless you return a response card telling them not to. DO THESE CLUBS SAVE YOU MONEY?  It depends. No one can go wrong by taking advantage of one of the amazing introductory offers. During certain offers you can get as many as 12 CDs for the price of one (though you will also be billed about $2 shipping and handling for each CD).  Follow-up purchases, though, are a different matter. CDs bought in stores in most parts of the country cost $11.99 to $16.99; in some instances, you might be able to find them for as little as $8.99. After you fulfill the terms of your initial offer, future club CDs cost $12.98 to $16.98, plus those shipping and handling charges. No savings there.  But club members are rewarded with a variety of perks. For instance, CD Headquarters (CDHQ) is offering its members such deals as ``buy one disc get two free,'' and BMG Music Service is telling first-time subscribers to buy a selection at the regular club price and all additional selections are just $5.99 per disc. And both BMG and Columbia reward members with four free CDs for getting a friend to join.  So if you buy carefully and take advantage of the perks, you can come out ahead. SCOPE OUT THE BEST SELECTION  Anyone thinking about joining should investigate just what each club has to offer before signing up. The mail-order companies cater to a range of musical tastes, with such categories as hard rock, alternative, R&AMP;B, country, jazz and classical.  Columbia probably has the widest selection, including Latin and gospel. CDHQ specializes in rock and alternative choices, but lacks a classical category. BMG Music Service has a selection similar to but slightly less extensive than Columbia's.  Of course, a club's total repertoire is not represented by one given ad. And just because you don't see a certain release in any of a club's ads doesn't mean it isn't in stock. Call the company and inquire.  Remember, even when making your introductory selection, you do not have to choose solely from the ad that contains the introductory order form. Rock enthusiasts will find plenty to choose from in the ads in Rolling Stone and Spin, but fans of classical music might have a more difficult time; the clubs, intent on mass sales, list few if any selections from this category.  The best bet is to call Columbia and BMG directly and request their classical catalogs. All the clubs have catalogs for each of their categories and will mail one or several on request, whether you are a member or not.  For those with access to the Internet, Columbia and BMG have their entire catalogs online. The CD Club Web Server, a Web site that includes information on current offers and sales, also contains the catalogs of all three clubs, so you can compare the clubs' selections for a given artist at a glance.  In general, don't expect a thorough, up-to-date selection from any of these companies. Because they pay musicians lower royalties than do traditional distributors, some performers prohibit the sale of their releases by the clubs.  And music lovers whose tastes are far from mainstream are better off staying away altogether: If you're an aficionado of eccentric lounge music, for instance, you probably won't find anything that will shake your maracas.  When you join a club, you're asked to indicate your favorite music category, and this determines which catalog and featured selection you'll receive each month from the club. But you are not locked into that category; again, call your club to request other catalogs or to inquire about a given release. SHOP AROUND  The three big clubs frequently advertise different introductory offers in different publications. For instance, currently Columbia House is offering 11 CDs for the price of one. BMG also had ads for both 11 and 12 CDs. Thumb through a number of music and entertainment publications until you find the best deal.  And don't forget to read the fine print that appears on the order form. The clubs will send you several ``free'' CDs initially, then send the remaining few after you've made a purchase. If you respond to Columbia's ``11 CDs for the Price of One'' offer, you may pay the price for only one CD (plus shipping and handling charges) and a $1.49 ``enrollment charge''; then you agree to buy six more selections at regular club prices.  Granted, Columbia gives you three years in which to do this, but you should fulfill the bargain as quickly as possible, otherwise you'll be flooded with statements, invoices and other unwanted surprises. Try to avoid any offers that lock you into buying more than one CD after you join. MAKE SURE YOU'RE GETTING WHAT YOU WANT  Before ordering, it doesn't hurt to do a little research in your local record store. Many releases have been remastered in recent years; if a CD you want fits into this category, find out if the advertised selection is, indeed, the latest, remastered version.  If the club's customer service representative doesn't know, you might choose to order the CD anyway. If it isn't the version you want, call the club and explain the situation. You can send back the unopened CD (be sure to request a postage-paid address label). READ THE MAILINGS  While you're grooving to the recordings you received from your introductory offer, read the little welcome booklet that accompanied them, carefully. It explains how to fill out the club's notification card. This is a little piece of paper the club sends each month: Ignore it and your life will become a living hell.  That's because each club automatically sends you its featured selection _ the club's choice in the musical area of interest you specified on your introductory offer form _ each month, unless you indicate that you'd prefer a substitute selection or none at all.  Take note that, even if you diligently inspect all club mailings and shipments, there's a good chance mistakes will still occur.  And don't expect to see the CDs you ordered right away: the clubs ship the CDs via fourth-class mail, which means your items can take about a month to reach you, maybe longer. THE BOTTOM LINE  Once you've taken advantage of a club's introductory offer, should you stay for the long haul?  Obviously, those of you who are just beginning to build your CD collections will benefit from the sales, bonuses and freebies down the road. But if your collection is already comprehensive, it will be difficult to find titles you don't already own.  For those who live outside major metropolitan areas and don't have access to music megastores, the clubs can be a great resource. But no matter where you live, if a club's inventory isn't to your liking, there's no use sticking around.  Having met the terms of BMG's agreement, my friend and I quit by phone and in writing. (Anyone whose conscience is bothered by our move should note that no sooner had I canceled than I received a mailing from the club promoting a new introductory offer.)  I quit primarily because the club's selection didn't appeal to me. Also, I didn't want to be bothered with all the invoices and response cards.  So is it worth a shot? Sure. As I said, you can always quit. -0- SIDEBAR: MUSIC BY THE NUMBERS  _ BMG Music Service 317-692-9200; 317-542-6244 (fax); 70007.1532compuserve.com (e-mail); http://www.bmgmusicservice.com (Web site)  _ Columbia House 800-457-0500; http://www.columbiahouse.com  _ CD Headquarters 800-242-7096  _ The CD Club Web Server http://www.hirschhorn.com/cdclubs/  (Laura Vitale is copy chief at Diversion magazine.)  ----------------------------------------------  (To publish this ``separate buy'' article it must be purchased -- the rate is not prohibitive -- from one of these New York Times Syndicate sales representatives:  (--Europe and Asia: KARL HORWITZ in Paris at 47-42-17-11; fax, 47-42-80-44 or 47-42-18-81; telex, 282-942.

Includes a color slide of Jane Curtin in a scene from ``3rd Rock from the Sun.'' By PETER MARKS c.1996 The New York Times (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Jane Curtin was cleaning her kitchen in Connecticut one frigid January evening when the telephone rang.  It was her old friend, the comedy writer Bonnie Turner. The call was not spur of the moment. This was a television emergency. Would Curtin, she wanted to know, consider another go at a sitcom?  Turner, it seemed, was in a bind. She and her husband, Terry, writing partners with whom Curtin had worked on ``Saturday Night Live'' and the 1993 film ``The Coneheads,'' were developing a new comedy about a group of eccentric aliens who come to Earth and take human form.  The writers urgently required a straight woman with a bit of an edge to play the aliens' thoroughly human foil, and Curtin sprang to mind.  ``They'd shot the pilot, and the character that they created for the love interest didn't quite work,'' Curtin says. ``They had made aracter too sweet, and so there was no tension.''  Although Curtin said she was committed to another project and was not available, Turner was not put off. She told Curtin she could have the role on her own terms.  ``She said, `You only have to do as many shows as you want,''' the actress recalls. ``I said, `OK, seven.' And she said, `Seven it is.'''  As effortlessly as that, Curtin began her re-entry into a universe she had already conquered in five seasons on ``Kate and Allie,'' the successful 1980s sitcom in which she was a co-star with Susan Saint James.  The new show, ``3rd Rock From the Sun,'' which also stars John Lithgow _ who won a 1996 Emmy for his sitcom debut in this role _ would prove to be another hit for Curtin, an actress who seems unable to miss on series television.  One of the original Not Ready for Prime Time Players on ``Saturday Night Live,'' on which she appeared for five seasons ending in 1980, Curtin was already television-comedy royalty when she signed on to ``Kate and Allie'' in 1984.  ``3rd Rock,'' which had its premiere on NBC in January 1996, completes the actress' comedic hat trick. In The New York Times, the television critic John J. O'Connor called the show ``brilliantly idiotic, a daffy pastiche of farce, burlesque and satire.''  Of all the original ``Saturday Night Live'' cast members, Curtin has had by far the most successful television career. Others who joined ``Saturday Night'' in subsequent years, such as Bill Murray and Eddie Murphy, went on to film stardom or graduated to standout roles in prime time, as did Julia-Louis Dreyfus and Phil Hartman.  But no other ``Saturday Night'' alum can match Curtin for such sustained achievement on acclaimed shows.  ``There's really no formula to this _ you just get lucky,'' Curtin says by telephone from her dressing room in a television studio in Los Angeles, where ``3rd Rock From the Sun'' is taped.  ``I was always hoping for a life in television, but I didn't know what to imagine after `Saturday Night Live,''' she says. ``I had done a movie while I was on `Saturday Night,' and I had done theater before that, but I really liked television.  ``I liked the immediacy of it, the fact that you didn't have to repeat yourself every week and that it was fast,'' she says. ``Ideally, a sitcom is like a little play each week, and I liked that instant gratification.''  On ``3rd Rock From the Sun,'' Curtin plays Dr. Mary Albright, a professor at a Midwestern college who shares an office with Dick Solomon, the human identity that Lithgow's alien character has assumed.  The show revels in its own silliness. Much of the sitcom's humor derives from the absurdities of everyday life as revealed by a family of aliens who are entirely unfamiliar with the mores of expected behavior.  Albright may be a scholar, but she's a little thick when it comes to the bizarre goings-on in the Solomon household, populated by Lithgow and his compadres from outer space, played by Kristen Johnson, French Stewart and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  It may be that she is blinded by her attraction to Lithgow's character. In any event, she is the oblivious/suspicious human bystander, a role with a great tradition in supernatural sitcoms, from Gladys Kravitz, the nosy neighbor in ``Bewitched,'' to Dr. Bellows, the snooty superior officer in ``I Dream of Jeanie.''  Curtin laughs easily about her exploits on ``3rd Rock.'' She takes the show no more seriously than do viewers.  ``It's actually about nothing,'' the actress says, a characterization that in the age of ``Seinfeld'' is a compliment. ``It's just about the way human beings behave.  ``I loved the character, but I also loved the sense of humor on the show,'' she says. ``I had known John in New York, and I'm very comfortable with him. It made me laugh when John and I were working together _ there just would be puddles on the floor.''  Eventually, Curtin agreed to extend her limited commitment to the show. In July, she and her family, diehard Easterners, moved to Los Angeles.  ``We decided to give it a go,'' she says, adding that her daughter is attending high school there.  A semblance of normalcy amid the insanity of weekly television is important to Curtin. One of the things she loved most about ``Kate and Allie,'' she says, was that she was able to walk from her apartment in Manhattan to the studio in the Ed Sullivan Theater, where the show was taped and where David Letterman now performs nightly.  Curtin is not a flashy performer. Unlike many who made their names on ``Saturday Night Live,'' she had no quintessential Jane Curtin character, no Church Lady or Buckwheat or Samurai Dry Cleaner. Curtin made an art of fitting in wherever she was needed, a talent that has served her well through the years.  With continued television success has come a comfort level with her abilities and a confidence that there will always be a place for her.  ``It's gotten to the point where if it wasn't going to be fun, I didn't want to do it,'' she says of the job offers she has turned down. ``If it wasn't going to be right or you aren't interested in the people involved, you should be comfortable enough not to be intimidated into doing it.''  At the moment, she is plenty comfortable. The 20-minute commute from home to studio agrees with her, as does life in California, to her surprise.  ``I keep trying to tell friends of mine in New York who are theater people or movie people what it's like to do a sitcom,'' she says. ``I paint a very rosy picture. And I don't think they believe me.''  (Peter Marks reports on entertainment for The New York Times.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of singer Anita O'Day brandishing a microphone. By LEONCE GAITER (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Anita O'Day never begged a lover to come back to her.  ``I Told You I Love You, Now Get Out'' was a signature song. She sings her joys and pains with a playful, sometimes wistful resignation. Her style knows little of tragedy or high drama. Her songs, and her life, reek of irony and steel, not tears and regrets.  This January, O'Day received the Jazz Masters Award from the National Endowment for the Arts, the highest award offered to a jazz artist. Finally, this often-overlooked, too-often-underrated jazz vocal pioneer is receiving her due.  In addition, with the recent CD release of ``Jazz Masters 49: Anita O'Day'' (Verve, 1996), a compilation of 1950s and 196Os recordings, listeners can finally experience the breadth and depth of this master of the jazz vocal.  And this is no valedictory _ O'Day is still singing. She has a new album in the works, and she still performs at such venues as Los Angeles' Jazz Bakery and New York's Tavern on the Green.  Standing in the lobby of her Hollywood hotel, O'Day seems anything but a jazz diva, smoking an unfiltered Camel and entertaining the guard on duty. In town from her modest California desert digs to sing at a benefit at the Beverly Hills Hotel, she seems self-contained and at peace with herself.  At 75, O'Day still exudes the rugged energy of her early recordings. But hers is not a story of success achieved through canny career planning and driving ambition. Indeed, she is almost a fluke, an accidental legend.  While some singers wlding careers and networking, O'Day was singing, night after night, for little reward beyond the opportunity to sing again the next night. Her tunnel vision was so intense that when she broke up with her longtime companion, this senior citizen had to learn how to keep a checkbook and how a credit card works. She didn't even know to whom she should pay her rent.  All along, she'd focused on one thing, and one thing alone _ her songs.  ``When I met her in the 1970s,'' says her current manager, Alan Eichler, ``she was working little clubs around town for 50 bucks a night or 100 bucks a night, whatever she could get.  ``At Dante's in the Valley, she would work for $100, and the owner would make her sit there until he was closing to pay her,'' she says. ``She would finish her set and had to sit there for two hours waiting to get paid.  ``She has no ego,'' he adds. ``She doesn't think of herself as a star.''  ``I don't play that,'' O'Day says dismissively. ``When I listen to a whole bunch of singers out there, I'll say `Yeah, I sound pretty good,' but I don't linger on it. When it's showtime, it's showtime.''  Knowing nothing of the ``business,'' O'Day never made any effort to build a marketable act or even to cultivate the connections that might have led to a dependable recording career. She never modified her sometimes-eccentric behavior to attract record executives, mollify producers or win friends.  Her one incredibly fertile recording period occurred in the 1950s when jazz impresario Norman Granz signed her to his Verve label. There she recorded her masterpieces ``Anita Sings the Most,'' with Oscar Peterson on piano, and ``Pick Yourself Up,'' with jazz combo and big band, along with the excellent ``Anita.''  The singer remembers the Peterson sessions vividly.  ``I just thought he was gonna play piano for me,'' she recalls. ``Instead, he played Oscar Peterson. I really had to get out there, and when the horses were coming around the back side and going into the stretch, I said to myself, `This son of a bitch is playing so many notes, where am I?'  ``I had to scramble to try to get back on top, but he always nosed in ahead of me,'' she says. ``It was great fun. I lost twelve races. But sometimes it's fun to lose.''  It can also be fruitful. That album is arguably her greatest, feeding off the frisson between Peterson's effusive, bluesy pianism and O'Day's off-kilter, white-girl phrasings. It's a masterpiece of full-out, pedal-to-the-metal jazz.  O'Day came by her jazz mastery the hard way, having been singing professionally since 1934, when she was 14.  According to her autobiography, ``High Times, Hard Times'' (Limelight Editions, 1989), that was when she told her mother that she was ``too dumb'' for school and that she was off to be a singer in the Walkathons, the grueling Depression-era dance marathons depicted so vividly in the 1969 film, ``They Shoot Horses, Don't They?''  Already she was displaying the lack of forethought and planning that would become her trademark, especially since her voice was an unconventional one, far from the style of fellow jazz masters Mildred Bailey, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan.  O'Day had always lacked a ``pretty'' voice. She has no ``tone,'' which she blames on her lack of a uvula, the little ``tongue'' that hangs down in the back of the throat. A careless dentist had removed hers, along with her tonsils, when she was 7.  As a result, O'Day was forced to emphasize faster tempos and 16th notes.  ``Instead of singing, `Laaaaa,' I'd sing `La-la-la-la-la-la,' to keep it moving,'' she says.  To this day, O'Day insists that she doesn't really have a voice.  ``But I'm not a singer,'' she says. ``I'm a song stylist.''  Singer or not, by 1941 she had caught on with Gene Krupa's band.  ``After I joined Krupa, I was just out there every day to learn something from every job,'' she says. ``I was always happy, no matter what the working conditions were, because I was performing my song stylings.  ``That was my life,'' she adds. ``Whatever else I did, music was my mission. The other things were relatively unimportant, if not really quite a bore.''  It was sheer coincidence that documentary filmmaker Bert Stern filmed her performance at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival for his classic documentary, ``Jazz on a Summer's Day,'' but it was a tremendous boost.  O'Day's sinuous, sensuously discombobulated version of ``Sweet Georgia Brown'' and her lightning ``Tea for Two'' proved a watershed in her career, exposing her to a much wider audience.  Perhaps if she had been more ambitious _ and if she hadn't been in the midst of a 14-year struggle against heroin addition _ O'Day might have parlayed the film's success into a high-profile career to rival Fitzgerald's or Vaughan's.  Perhaps, but probably not. Some may say that she was held back by being a white woman in a black art form, but she never competed with black vocalists, never adopted the style or techniques of black jazz.  The fact is, Anita O'Day never wanted to be a star. To the extent that she became one, it was an accident, a side effect of her real passion. She had nothing to spare from singing for the pursuit of stardom.  ``I put a lot of work in it,'' she says. ``At the club, every night, trying this, trying that. I don't have any kids, don't have a husband.  ``And that's the price you pay, but I took it,'' she says, coolly and without regrets. ``That's what I wanted.'' c.1997 Leonce Gaiter  (Leonce Gaiter is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer.)

"86384"	"it"	"seemed"	" The tenor Jerry Hadley worked hard, it seemed, to match the ethereal quality Pears brought to this music, but Hadley's voice was rather emotive and beefy for the task.

"86759"	"it"	"seemed"	" The advent of the State of Israel produced a small rush of films _ ``Exodus'' (1960), ``Cast A Giant Shadow'' (1966) and ``Judith'' (1966).

"86760"	"it"	"seemed"	" All four films were heavily criticized in the Jewish community as the work of ``self-hating Jews.'' And though some of the same criticism has been hurled over the years at Woody Allen, whose protagonists are intrinsically Jewish even if not always identified as such, it was a vein that he mined more specifically in films like ``Annie Hall'' (1977) and ``Crimes and Misdemeanors'' (1989). But Allen's angst-ridden neurotic appealed mostly to audiences on the two coasts. Jews, it seemed, still didn't play well in the American Heartland. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"

"89300"	"it"	"seemed"	" But the soaring Nasdaq was not the only reason for American expansiveness abroad in the past decade. It also had to do with the fact that there is no more military draft, so none of the idle rich, no dot-com-ers, had to give up their stock options to serve in Bosnia or Haiti, and even more important, those who did go went with the assumption, and almost the promise, that these would be ``zero-casualty wars.'' Americans had the same attitude toward the Nasdaq in the past decade that they had toward foreign wars: they were both no-lose propositions. You couldn't get hurt in either the Nasdaq or Kosovo, it seemed, so why not do both? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200103.gz"
"89772"	"it"	"seemed"	" The influence of Schoenberg seemed clear in the highly charged melodic writing that runs through Knussen's ``Way to Castle Yonder,'' a potpourri for orchestra from his opera ``Higglety Pigglety Pop!'' that he conducted next. But the luscious harmonic writing is awash with Impressionism, while the lucid textures and spiky rhythms are steeped, it seemed, in late Stravinsky. Then came Stravinsky's steely, crystalline Movements for piano and orchestra (1958-59), with Bush ably substituting for Serkin at the keyboard. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"

(Sal DiMarco/The New York Times)  (NYT2) UNDATED -- Jan. 21, 2002 -- SCI-FOSSILS-OCEAN-CURRENTS -- Dr. Ellen E. Martin, a professor of geological sciences at the University of Florida, believes the teeth of long-dead fish in the Pacific Ocean could provide an answer about a sweeping shift of deep ocean currents millions of years ago. The teeth preserve a record of the changing chemical composition of the ocean water. Fossil fish teeth, like this one greatly magnified, are actually about one-fortieth of an inch long. (Ellen E. Martin/University of Florida/The New York Times)  (NYT1) UNDATED -- Jan. 21, 2002 -- SCI-INFLAMMATION-DRUG -- Dutch researchers found that people who took anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen for at least two years were only one-sixth as likely to get Alzheimer's as people who did not take the drugs. The studies reflect scientists' growing interest in the idea that a common condition, inflammation, may underlie many chronic and debilitating diseases and that drugs that fight inflammation may have a role in preventing or delaying those diseases, or at least slowing them down. Tylenol treats pain and fever, but doesn't have the same anti-inflammatory properties of drugs like Motrin and Advil that may play a role in fighting debilitating diseases.

We drove by van, then truck, up the rough, unpaved roads to the Grand Canyon, high up on La Malinche, where steep, moss-covered slopes tapered off into a dry river bed. It was mushroom heaven, with a new mushroom, it seemed, under every towering fir tree. I found my first club mushroom, which is so sweet that some Mexican children eat it like candy, and a kind of peppery russula that is consumed in Mexico, but not in the United States. The edibility of some mushrooms, I was finding out, is a question of taste. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"

"121958"	"it"	"seemed"	" No one better exemplifies this allegorical tendency than Clarence Clemons, the band's beloved saxophonist: He spent much of Wednesday night banging a cowbell and waiting for his next solo, but he still received the biggest ovation of any musician, and he was the last one to leave the stage. The idea of the saxophone, it seemed, was more appealing than its sound. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"121990"	"it"	"seemed"	" Embraced 20 years ago as refugees from the massacres that swept Cambodia, they had grown up, found jobs and started families in the United States _ as American, it seemed, as any other immigrants. Cambodia was a dim childhood memory. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"122009"	"it"	"seemed"	" Other Giants have tried to help Shockey, indirectly. Collins mentioned with a straight face that when Shockey made his remarkable 48-yard catch and run Monday, he had run the wrong route. Collins' intention in revealing this, it seemed, was not to criticize Shockey, but to remind reporters that he is still a young player who is going to make mistakes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"122070"	"it"	"seemed"	" As well as he sang the arias and the Neapolitan songs, Hvorostovsky utterly stilled the house with his third encore, a soulful performance of an unaccompanied Russian song, his homeland's equivalent, it seemed, of an American spiritual.

"122881"	"it"	"seemed"	" Pope John Paul II said an emotional, lingering goodbye to Poland on Monday with words and gestures that captured both how hard it was for him to leave his beloved homeland and, it seemed, how uncertain he was that he would return. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"123200"	"it"	"seemed"	" A few weeks ago at a friend's party I experienced the fun of meeting someone new. In this instance the someone new presented himself in the form of a genial, unattached guy in his mid-'30s, the sort of person who, it seemed, could delineate the intricacies of the ImClone scandal, recall Paul Tsongas' 1992 campaign platform and probably even explain the plot line of ``The Big Sleep,'' all with the same kind of ease and utter absence of showiness. He was sweet and inquisitive. If he possessed a single objectionable quality, I couldn't discern it. Our conversation progressed seamlessly. What he did possess, I noticed when we made our exit, was a canvas knapsack. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"123252"	"it"	"seemed"	" Hearing the Bayreuth Festival Orchestra in this acoustically sublime house conducted by such a formidable musician of course offered rewards.

Look another and there was an opera being performed from an elaborate Spanish galleon by a cast of dozens. Turn around and there was a sculpture of porpoises breaching the surface of the desert.

No. A few minutes later he tested it again, pulling out curds and shaping them into a round of fresh cheese. Finished, he silently took out a knife and cut several pieces for me to taste: creamy, warm cheese, smelling, it seemed, of the fields outside his walls. Then he reached for a piece of cheese he was aging, a hard ricotta, and cut into it as well. The flavor, darker, more smoky, was equally tantalizing. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"124737"	"it"	"seemed"	" Chunks of this year's Nashoba Regional School District budget were used to pay last year's bills. Mysterious transfers had been recorded.

After they loaded the bases with none out on singles by Cliff Floyd, Daubach, and Varitek, they scored one run on Nixon's sacrifice fly to left. But they scored no more as Johnny Damon followed Sanchez's single by grounding into an inning-ending double play.

"125959"	"it"	"seemed"	" The Scherzo was also somewhat held back, again, it seemed, to keep the relentless dancing rhythms exact. They were exact, and how, but at the expense of crackling energy and brash humor. The Adagio began very beautifully. Maazel's subdued, unsentimental shaping of the pensive, long-spun melody, and the unforced fullness of the harmonic sonorities he elicited were quite affecting. Yet the mood did not last in the later sections, when the contrapuntal weaving of lines become more complex.

"130068"	"it"	"seemed"	" In Ha Jin's 1999 novel, ``Waiting,'' his opening sentence captured all the poignance, exquisite patience, and comic sorrow of the story to come: ``Every summer Lin Kong returned to Goose Village to divorce his wife, Shuyu.'' Those words went on to be widely quoted in the months that followed, when ``Waiting'' would win both the PEN/Faulkner and the National Book awards. An English professor who had emigrated from China in 1985, Jin had, it seemed, achieved something few writers could claim: the ability to relay complex, interior truths about the human condition in an achingly spare language that was not his native tongue. The simplicity of his prose, underscored by his halting command of English, tends to imbue his fiction with a fabulist quality. And because his subject is modern, Maoist China, this sense of legend or moral consequence feels even more imperative: While a Communist bureaucracy might inhibit a man from acting on the dictates of his heart, how much control could it wield over the heart it </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"

His voice, it seemed, was on an audiotape praising recent terror attacks and vowing new ones. On Thursday, a few hours before Congress and the White House finally agreed to an independent review of the government's failure to prevent the Sept. 11 attacks, the FBI warned that al-Qaida was planning a ``spectacular'' terrorist act. For all the week's momentous agreements _ the largest government reorganization in 50 years, an unflinching inquiry into government fallibility _ Washington realists acknowledge that little has been done to prevent a terrorist attack in two weeks or two months or two years.

TOP  Lead story:  1-col. hed:  TERROR-INQUIRY (Washington) _ President Bush on Wednesday named Henry A. Kissinger, a Republican who has been one of the most esteemed but polarizing figures in foreign policy and Washington for more than three decades, to lead an independent investigation into the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Bush made the appointment as he signed legislation creating the commission, a step he came to support only after opposing the bill for much of the year on the grounds that it could divert attention from the war on terrorism. Democratic leaders in Congress, who will appoint half the members of the 10-person commission, immediately named George Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader and peace envoy to Northern Ireland and the Middle East, as vice chairman.

Off-lead story:  BUSH-FORESTS (Washington) _ The Bush administration proposed on Wednesday to give managers of the 155 national forests more discretion to approve logging and commercial activities with less evaluation of potential damage to the environment. The proposal would thoroughly rewrite rules issued by President Bill Clinton in November 2000, two months before President Bush took office. By Robert Pear.

FOLD  IRAQ (United Nations) _ U.N. arms inspectors on Wednesday made their first field forays in Iraq in four years, checking three sites outside Baghdad with no reported resistance from Iraqi officials. The inspections resumed in accordance with a Security Council resolution adopted unanimously on Nov. 8, which essentially gives President Saddam Hussein of Iraq a last chance to cooperate with arms inspectors and to give a full accounting of his weapons of mass destruction. By Serge Schmemann.  (Scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in ``i'' news file.)  IRAQ-TURKEY (Washington) _ Hoping to lay the basis for a northern front, the Bush administration is making a major effort to get Turkey's new Islamic government to join in an American-led attack on Iraq. Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz leaves for Turkey this weekend. Turkey's agreement is key to the Bush administration's plan to open a northern front if there is a military confrontation with Iraq. By Michael R. Gordon.

FDA-ALLERGY-DRUG (Undated) _ Federal regulators on Wednesday approved the nation's top-selling allergy drug, Claritin, as an over-the-counter medicine, a decision with wide implications for patients, doctors, insurers and drug companies. Nonprescription sales of Claritin will begin next month. Experts said that the change will mean big savings for people without insurance but could raise prices for the insured, whose purchases of Claritin will no longer be subsidized. By Melody Petersen.

And it was again on Wednesday, with airlines expecting as many as 5 million people to fly, an increase of about 6 percent over last year, according to a survey by the American Automobile Association. But from Boston to Atlanta to Los Angeles, passengers said they were finding something quite unexpected in their efforts to reach friends and family in a distant city: a pleasant experience.

BOTTOM  MEXICO-U.S.-TRUCKS (Washington) _ President Bush gave the go-ahead Wednesday for Mexican trucks to travel U.S. roads beyond commercial border zones where they have been restricted while inspection sites and new regulations were put in place. The decision comes nearly a year after Bush had said he wanted to allow Mexican trucks on U.S. roads, in compliance with a provision of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

CRUISE-SHIP-VIRUS (Undated) _ Despite recent outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness on cruise ships, federal health officials on Wednesday pronounced the ships safe and said they would not advise people to delay or avoid taking cruises. The officials said passengers could avoid illness by washing their hands frequently and keeping their hands out of their mouths. But while the government was holding its news conference, executives of the Disney Cruise Line made an announcement of their own, canceling the next cruise of a ship that now has sick passengers on board.

OUTLOOK-CONFIDENCE (Undated) _ What will it take to restore confidence and trust in the markets, management, corporations, accountants, technology, and the United States as a global leader in this post-scandal, post-Enron business environment? Economic growth, of course. Even so, these are not normal times, given terrorism and the threat of war. What will be the engine of economic growth? Can anything take the place of technology? Even with the tumult wrought by Enron, Andersen, WorldCom, Tyco and others in 2002, how much has really changed? By Alex Berenson.  OUTLOOK-SCANDALS (Undated) _ It was, it seemed, the year when corporate America went crooked as it never had before, when chicanery took the place of integrity, when wrongdoing exploded in ways that could not have been anticipated. But then again, maybe it wasn't. Despite all the surprise and anguish set off in the past year by corporate scandals, for many Wall Street historians and fraud aficionados, it almost fit into a pattern _ the re-emergence of a moment that has become something of a tradition in the financial world.

Still, Europe's transition to a monetary union has imposed unique restrictions on governments, tying them to a regionwide monetary policy and a set of fiscal guidelines that require that they keep their deficits below a ceiling and balance their budgets by 2006.

OUTLOOK-RUSSIA (Moscow) _ Russia's economy is entering its fifth year of economic growth, a milestone that would have been unthinkable during the chaotic, economic free-for-all of Boris Yeltsin's Russia. Companies have begun to restructure, the government's economic reforms have begun to take hold, and capital flight has been steadily falling.

TOP  Lede stories:  BUSH-ECON (Washington) _ Anticipating a barrage of criticism, the White House rolled out an array of statistics on Monday to show that President Bush's sweeping new tax proposal does more than benefit the very rich. The $600 billion plan, which includes eliminating taxes on corporate dividends and speeding up rate reductions, would provide 92 million taxpayers with an average tax cut of $1,083 this year, said Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman.

"135959"	"it"	"seemed"	" Now, it seemed, history was repeating itself. Emotions had to be set aside like so much excess baggage. ``Emergency service personnel can't take time to feel,'' said nurse manager Mary Porter. ``You have to gear back into what's coming in next.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136171"	"it"	"seemed"	" But the minute we drove past Lost Valley's familiar blue-and-white sign I saw I was wrong. Nothing, it seemed, had changed. The small parking lot was still right next to the lodge _ no fancy shuttle buses needed here _ and entering the brown wooden lodge itself was like walking into a time capsule. The worn indoor-outdoor carpeting was still there, with seams now visibly duct-taped to keep things from bunching up. The battered pinball machines in the lobby, the still-inexpensive cafeteria food, even the Christmas decorations on the stone fireplace mantel _ it was all exactly as it was circa 1970. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136172"	"it"	"seemed"	" Moreover, everywhere I looked there were children, from elementary school age to high school students, happily hanging out without hordes of hovering parents.

(Scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in ``i'' news file.)  Off-lead story:  IRAQ-GARNER (Kuwait City) _ The retired American general who will run postwar Iraq for the Bush administration flew to Iraq on Monday on a mission to remake the country's politics, a process that he predicted would be messy and contentious. But Gen. Jay Garner insisted that American-style democracy could sprout on the shards of Saddam Hussein's regime. ``I don't think they had a love-in when they had Philadelphia'' in 1776, he said in an interview here before his departure. ``Anytime you start the process it's fraugHt gith dialogue, tensions, coercion, and should be.''

FOLD  IRAQ-TIKRIT (Tikrit, Iraq) _ The breeze off the Tigris River blew through the empty halls of Saddam Hussein's grandest palace on Monday, its once fearsome opulence reduced, it seemed, to the most crushing sort of banality. The end came Monday for the last and most formidable redoubt of Saddam's reign, as thousands of American Marines poured into his hometown, after a supposed collection of his staunchest never-enders finally gave up or ran away. By Dexter Filkins.  (Story has moved in ``i'' news file.)  IRAQ-BAGHDAD (Baghdad, Iraq) _ The scene and developments in the Iraqi capital. Two U.S. Marines were killed Monday in what was described as a grenade accident. Looting in the city continues, with the latest targets a building with a large collection of ancient Qurans and the central bank. A center for children's vaccines was broken into; some vaccines were stolen, but the refrigerators were the real target. They were emptied and stolen, and the vaccines were ruined. By Ian Fisher and John Kifner.  (Story has moved in ``i'' news file.)  IRAQ-SPOUSES (Jacksonville, N.C.) _ Sarai Thompson had finally been able to get some rest after hours of tossing and turning. Then, she recalls rolniff over and seeing her husband tucked underneath the white covers beside her. She began to cry. He was not really there or anywhere near the sprawling Marine base here. He was 6,500 miles away in Iraq. ``I am not sure what's worse, the fear or the loneliness,'' she says of the recent nights without her husband, Cpl. Alan Thompson. There were good reasons to be fearful. At virtually the same moment she sat anxiously awake, her husband was in a drab command tent outside Nasiriyah, as his artillery unit shelled paramilitary fighters and other Iraqis who had been attackingMisine and Army units there for days. The fall of Baghdad may have lessened the worries for many Americans, but for couples like the Thompsons, the days are still consumed with fear, loneliness and pwhat the future holds.

NJ-CHILD-WELFARE (Undated) _ New Jersey officials on Monday for the first time made public the state's own confidential records of the deaths and abuse of more than a dozen children in ips0aare, offering a rare, fully detailed look at how child welfare officials failed some of New Jersey's most vulnerable children. The state, in response to a court action brought by The New York Times, released 2,000 pages of documents that concerned 17 didfmsent children and that chronicled the mistakes, oversights and other missteps that led to four deaths and the sometimes brutal, prolonged!afuse of more than a dozen others.

, he said,	 All of this has come as little surprise to David B. Spanier, a New York attorney with the law firm Greenberg Traurig who specializes in health-benefits law.

As the U.S. soldiers prepared to move down a street, a man quietly approached one member of the patrol and drew a small map.

, she replies,	 Cover story in this magazine of hot fashion and high lifestyle is Madonna, who stars in Steven Klein's arty and bizarre 44-page photo portfolio. In it, the onetime Material Girl, 44, dons weird masks, flaunts baroque costumes and twists herself into a fishnet pretzel next to a poster of a kidney. In an accompanying interview, you'll learn that she's studying the Jewish mysticism of the cabala and skipped the Golden Globe Awards because she wanted to stay home with her two kids. (She deflected rumors that a third child is on the way.)

Sampras defined the sport for the past decade, dominating it since 1990 when he won his first US Open at age 19 _ the youngestm!de player to do so. He went on to take four more US Open titles as well as two Australian Open victories and seven Wimbledon trophies for a total of 14 grand slam championships, more than any other male singles player in the history of the game.  Such a giant lingers forever in the heart of the fan and looms over the swinging rackets of all players, top-ranked or rank amateur. Sampras, 32, may have called it a career Monday at the start of this year's US Open, but his presence will be felt on the tour as powerfully as if his name were still in the draw.  Everybody with a huge serve will be measured against him _ particularly the 20-year-old American player Andy Roddick, who is said to be ``the next Pete,'' though 21-year-old Roger Federer of Switzerland also became an heir apparent after winning Wimbledon.  None of the new guys has achieved the stats yet, however, nor the gravitas of the hulking Sampras taking the court. He often kept his face expressionless and slack-jawed, mouth open, so a viewer might worry about him swallowing bugs. Sometimes he seemed to be shambling back to the base line looking a little hang-dog after losing a point, the body language masking the power that was about to blast an opponent's rising confidenkefack down into the fear zone.  He rarely appreared nervous on big points, dispatching them quickly and, it seemed, easily, without the grunts, groans, grimaces or death grip on the racket often seen in other players. He was criticized for lacking a show-biz personality and for going about his business so matter-of-factly and with such consistency that his wins began to seem routine: He was ranked top in the world for a record six consecutive years, and he got there with none of the crowd-pleasing histrionics of a John McEnroe or Jimmy Connors.  He won games with pulled muscles, sore feet, and cramps. He battled nausea so fierce he vomited between points as he beat Alex Corretja of Spain in the quarterfinal of the 1996 US Open. He sobbed through a match in the 1995 Australian Open after learning that his coach, Tim Gullikson, was dying of cancer _ and he won the match.  Standing in New York's Arthur Ashe Stadium Monday night, he let the rare public tears flow again and said he knew in his heart it was time to leave the game. It is the heart, after all, that ultimately makes a champion; talent is just one part of the equation.  Sampras had a mythic supply of both, and that combination makes him indelible, ever synonymous with the word ``tennis.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20030826.0048 type=story > <HEADLINE> `SUDDENLY': TWO BAD GIRLS LOOK GOOD TO AN AWKWARD SHOPGIRL </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 08-26-03 18:57:00EDT (BC-SUDDENLY-FILM-REVIEW-) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200308.gz"

IRAQ (Baghdad, Iraq) -- Insurgents penetrated the American-controlled Green Zone on Thursday, setting off a pair of bombs within seconds of each other and killing five people, including three Americans, and wounding 20 others. Witnesses said that at least one of the explosions was set off by a suicide bomber and that the second may have been as well. Neither American nor Iraqi government officials had any immediate explanation as to how the bombs were smuggled inside. By Dexter Filkins.  PRISONER-ABUSE (Washington) -- A just-completed Army criminal investigation has implicated 28 active-duty and reserve personnel in the homicides of two Afghan men detained at the American air base at Bagram in December 2002, and describes potential offenses ranging from involuntary manslaughter to assault to conspiracy, the Army said on Thursday. By Thom Shanker.  MIDEAST (Jerusalem) -- Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said on Thursday that he wanted to begin withdrawing Israeli settlers from the Gaza Strip next May or June and complete the pullout within three months. Sharon's comments to a closed session of parliament's Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee marked the most specific target date he has given for the Gaza evacuation. The Israeli media reported the remarks, which also were confirmed by participants at the session. However, Sharon must still win approval for the plan in parliament, and it is scheduled to come up for debate and a vote on Oct. 25. By Greg Myre.  MALARIA-VACCINE (Undated) -- For the first time, researchers say, a vaccine against malaria has shown that it can save children from infection or death. The vaccine, tested on thousands of children in Mozambique, was hardly perfect: It protected them from catching the disease only about 30 percent of the time and prevented it from becoming life-threatening only about 58 percent of the time. But because malaria kills over a million people a year, 700,000 of them children, even partial protection would be a public health victory. By Donald G. McNeil Jr.  NATIONAL GENERAL  (Will move in a news file.)  FLU-VACCINE (Undated) -- Although President Bush said the country was talking to Canada about obtaining more flu vaccine, it's unlikely that there will be much additional vaccine available this year, federal health officials said Thursday.

John Kerry stormed back onto the campaign trail on Thursday only hours after their last debate created what both sides said was an essentially new race that after hundreds of millions of dollars and nearly a year of campaigning had come down to a tie in the last 19 days. By Elisabeth Bumiller and David M. Halbfinger.  DEBATES (Phoenix, Ariz.) -- You might call it a flip-flop -- that is, if you even remember the term. In the debates, it was Sen. John Kerry who proved almost robotically consistent, affecting the same earnest, respectful demeanor even as, through each debate, he lacerated President Bush as incompetent in fighting a war and helping the middle class. It was Bush who was changeable, shifting the thrust of his attacks -- from saying that Kerry was inconstant to saying he was constantly liberal -- and even, it seemed, adjusting his personality for, of all things, political expediency. Yet it was also Kerry who had the most to accomplish in the debates By James Bennet and Jim Rutenberg.  FINANCIAL  (Will move in f' news file.)  INSURE-FRAUD (New York) -- Eliot Spitzer, the New York state attorney general, accused the world's largest insurance broker on Thursday of cheating customers through a long-standing arrangement of rigging prices and steering business to insurance companies in exchange for lucrative kick-backs.

BBN-CARDS-ASTROS (St. Louis) -- Game 2 of the National League Championship Series, St. Louis Cardinals vs. Houston Astros, 8:19 p.m. EDT start.

Ambitiously, across a decade, creator Chris Carter threw thousands of provocative morsels at viewers hungry to understand his unique mind trip. But ultimately, he failed to assemble the pieces into a satisfying, sensible whole. He squandered his audience's good faith. It was as though he'd extended the mythology beyond any possibility of cohesion in order to keep making money on it. Every sweeps period, it seemed, and with the theatrical release of the movie, X-Files ads were promising resolutions that never came.

Regional ballet companies sprang up throughout the United States, and touring increased, fueled, it seemed, only by money from recently enlightened agencies like the Ford Foundation ($7 million to ballet in 1963) and the National Endowment for the Arts, established in 1965. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"147704"	"it"	"seemed"	" It's been a rough couple of years for Broadway musical revivals, with a series of high-profile financial failures, including Gypsy, Man of La Mancha and Wonderful Town. What each of those shows had in common were stars like Bernadette Peters, Brian Stokes Mitchell and Donna Murphy, all of whom had respected theatrical resumes but lacked lasting box-office punch. Theater fans might have cared, but the general public, it seemed, did not. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"

"148237"	"it"	"seemed"	" The premise, it seemed, was that somehow Bill Belichick was up to no good. He was playing loose and fast with the field so that by game time it would be loose and slow. He refused to cover it, some in the national media seemed to suggest, so it would become a quagmire so deep the Indianapolis receivers would be unable to get their cleats out of the ground Sunday evening. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"

Wayne Lukas, Nick Zito and Bob Baffert won 15 of the 18 Triple Crown races, including 11 in a row from the '94 Kentucky Derby through the '97 Preakness. They dominated the Triple Crown stage, they owned the winning script, and all the leading actors, it seemed, ollowed their direction. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"149638"	"it"	"seemed"	" Three years ago, such ordinary treatment of the 9/11 attacks would have been blasphemous. In the months after 9/11, the tragedy and the attendant war on terror were mentioned only in very special episodes of shows such as The West Wing and Third Watch, and each reference was scrutinized and controversial. The crisis of our time, it seemed, had to be protected from TV's reductive ripped from the headlines aesthetic, left untrivialized by fiction. When the terror-themed shows 24, The Agency, and Alias premiered after 9/11, their networks rightly feared hostility from viewers steeped in comfort-food TV and renewed love for the Manhattan unreality of Friends. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"

Here and there, isolated researchers and winegrowers had observed that certain American vines, which belong to a different species than European ones, suffered no ill effects from the phylloxera. For a brief, terrifying period, the French worried that they might have to make wine from American grapes. The cure, it seemed, might be worse than the disease. The country-life correspondent for Le Temps, after attending a half-dozen tastings of American wines, reported that not one of those who took part had the courage to empty his glass. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"

Unable, it seemed, to produce words, Gulager brandished instead a red and black painting, like a Rembrandt or an Anne Rice book jacket, only blacker. He said the painting was how he envisioned Feast.

"151517"	"it"	"seemed"	" After the Mass, the congregation of priests, nuns, pilgrims and a scattering of tourists applauded as the cardinals walked in procession out of the basilica, the applause rising, it seemed, as favored papal candidates passed.

Before they start Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, considered a leading candidate, gives a blistering sermon before all the cardinals against the evils of modernism. A vote is not expected until Tuesday at the earliest. By Daniel J. Wakin and Ian Fisher.  With photos, NYT1-4.  An early lede has moved.  And  VATICAN-EUROPE (Paris) -- A look at the problems of the Catholic Church in Europe, particularly a shortage of priests and general decline in the number of devout Catholics. By Elaine Sciolino.  With a graphic.  IRAQ (Baghdad, Iraq) -- Developments, including oil sabotage mayhem reported in southern Iraq. By Robert F. Worth.  MIDEAST (Jerusalem) -- Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel suggests he may delay the Gaza withdrawal by up to three weeks. Other developments. By Greg Myre.  BOLTON-CONFIRM (Washington) -- Developments on the nomination of John R. Bolton to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. The committee vote on his confirmation is planned for Tuesday. By Douglas Jehl and Steven R. Weisman.  ITALY-POLITICS (Rome) -- Prime minister Silvio Berlusconi was expected to formally hand in his resignation today and was due to present a reshuffled cabinet that he hopes will permit him to stay in office until his mandate runs out in 2006. His action was designed to resolve one of the worst crises of his four-year tenure, which began last week when a rebellious coalition ally pulled four ministers from the center-right government. By Elisabetta Povoledo.  MEXICO-MAYOR (Mexico City) -- Developments in the prosecution of Mexico City's popular mayor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, which has created a political crisis in the country. On Monday President Vicente Fox's spokesman said there was no way he would pardon the mayor because the Mexico constitution forbids it. By Ginger Thompson and James C. McKinley Jr.  ECUADOR-POLITICS (Quito, Ecuador) -- Developments in the political crisis in Ecuador that threatens President Lucio Gutierrez because of what he calls his struggle to created a corruption-free judiciary. By Juan Forero.  CANADA-POLITCS (Toronto) A look at how Prime Minister Paul Martin is scrambling to keep power amid a growing Liberal Party scandal, making deals that delay or even jettison central elements of his political agenda, including a bill to legalize same-sex marriages and a measure to control greenhouse gases in Canada. By Clifford Kruass.  BASQUES-ELECT (Dateline TK, Spain) -- Folo on weekend elections in Spain's Basque country, which weakened the influence of the separatists. By Renwick McLean.  UNITED STATES -- National General (a code)  MINN-SHOOTING (Dateline) -- Developments in the Red Lake Indian reservation school shootings. By Monica Davey.  JACKSON-TRIAL (Santa Maria, Calif.) -- Prosecution testimony continues in the Michael Jackson child molestation trial. By Nick Madigan.  UNITED STATES -- Washington (w code)  SCOTUS (Washington) -- Supreme Court Roundup: The Supreme Court accepts a case in which the question is whether a religious group in New Mexico that uses hallucinogenic tea in its religious services has the right as a matter of freedom to import the substance. The tea contains a drug that is banned under the federal Controlled Substances Act. The Bush administration says that makes the tea illegal and possibly dangerous for members of the church. The administration lost in the lower courts and will now will try to win on appeal. By Linda Greenhouse.  FINANCIAL (f code)  MARKET (Undated) -- Trading on U.S. equity and financial markets on Monday as stocks fell sharply in Asia, with the Nikkei down 4 percent, and were lower in Europe. By Jonathan Fuerbringer.  DRUG-PATENTS (Undated) -- The Supreme Court will hear arguments on Wednesday in a drug industry patent case that could have broad implications for medical research and, as a result, has made temporary allies of various corporate and consumer groups that more typically find themselves on opposite sides of any issue. The case pits Merck against Integra Lifesciences, a small New Jersey biotechnology company. Integra contends that researchers backed by Merck used Integra's patented molecules without authorization in early-stage drug development. Merck argues that such use is legal under a 1984 law that allows patent infringement in some cases if scientists are preparing information to present to the FDA. By Andrew Pollack.  BATHROOM-TECH (Undated) -- At American Standard, the world's largest bathroom and kitchen fixtures company, the physics of flushing and the properties of ceramics are deadly serious. American Standard has promised consumers that the Champion, which uses a complicated flushing tower instead of the familiar flapper and chains, will never clog, no way, no how. Just as important, Champion could be the source of a welcome image change. Bathroom and kitchen fixtures represented just about a quarter of American Standard's $9.5 billion in sales last year; its Trane air conditioners are its biggest sellers, and its Wabco vehicle braking systems are its most profitable products. But when consumers free-associate to the American Standard name, cheap, utilitarian bathrooms are what come to mind. Analysts say the Champion -- which lists for $408, although some stores sell it for $250 -- may yet make the company's name synonymous with upscale products that consumers crave. By Claudia H. Deutsch.  CHINA-ENERGY (Guangzhou, China) -- The clash between China's Communist past and its increasingly capitalist present is now playing out in this country's energy markets, causing fuel shortages and making electricity blackouts temporarily worse. Tight regulations on retail prices for diesel and electricity, a legacy of central planning, have made increasingly profit-oriented refiners and power companies reluctant to sell either. Global markets set wholesale prices for diesel and for the heavy fuel oil used by power stations, but the government still insists on setting retail prices. Disruptions in Chinese markets for these and other oil products are causing ripples in global markets in turn, as traders and investors around the world struggle to interpret the effects on international oil supply and demand. By Keith Bradsher.  INSURE-HOULDSWORTH (Killiney, Ireland) -- A profile of John Houldsworth, the former chief executive of Cologne Re, who organized the transaction with the American International Group that is the center of an investigation into the company. By Brian Lavery.  SINGAPORE-CASINOS (Singapore) -- Singapore said it would legalize casinos to allow the construction of two Las Vegas-style resorts, overruling public opposition in an effort to boost tourism and temper its famous Puritanism with a willingness to gamble on innovation. Singapore plans to award licenses to build the two casinos, which it estimates will entail roughly $3 billion in investment, by the end of next year. The hope is that introducing casinos will enable Singapore to attract more tourists from mainland China. More broadly, however, the casinos are part of a longstanding effort to reorient Singapore's economy toward higher value-added service industries such as tourism and biosciences as it loses manufacturing competitiveness to China. By Wayne Arnold.  JAPAN-MEDIA (Tokyo) -- A contentious and closely watched Japanese takeover battle ended amicably when the Internet start-up Livedoor agreed to sell most of its stake in the target company, Nippon Broadcasting, to rival bidder Fuji Television Network Inc. Under the agreement, Fuji TV will also take a 15 percent stake in Livedoor to seal what the companies say is now a friendly alliance. By Todd Zaun.  ADOBE-MACROMEDIA (Undated) -- Adobe Systems agreed to buy Macromedia for about $3.4 billion in stock to extend its lead in the market for creating and distributing digital documents. By Laurie J. Flynn.

ENTERTAINMENT/ARTS (e unless otherwise indicated)  LINCOLN-MUSEUM (Dateline TK) -- Edwith Rothstein reviews the new Lincoln museum in Springfield, Ill., which President Bush visits on Tuesday.  With a photo.  VIDEO-GAME-LANGUAGE (Undated) -- The language Tho Fan sounds ancient and distinctly Asian. Its sh sounds come from the back of the throat, as they do in Chinese. Its r sounds are made with a tap of the tongue, echoing Mongolian. But Tho Fan comes from Canada and was invented only last year. It is a real language spoken by unreal people in the Xbox game Jade Empire, released this week. Perhaps it is a sign that, these days, languages are not so much discovered as invented.

"151824"	"it"	"seemed"	" I'm not normally much of a television viewer, but while I was recovering from painful surgery, watching TV for several hours a night was a welcome distraction, though not always enough.

"152152"	"it"	"seemed"	" In 2000, the little-known Bob May tangled with Woods at the PGA Championship at Valhalla Golf Club, eventually losing in a three-hole playoff.

"152273"	"it"	"seemed"	" People turned out by the thousands just for a glimpse of him. Whenever and wherever he appeared, television cameras whirred like cicadas. Motorcades accompanied him on the road from Philadelphia to New York. And last June 5, anticipating his coronation, more than 120,000 people attended Belmont Park. The madness didn't last long, however. Only about a month. But that was all the time Smarty Jones needed to win the country's affection and become America's horse. His likeness appeared on magazine covers and seemed destined for a stamp if only he could have continued. Everybody, it seemed, reveled in his Kentucky Derby and Preakness victories; everybody anguished over his Belmont loss. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"152760"	"it"	"seemed"	" The law, it seemed, favored power over truth, Walsh said.

"152905"	"it"	"seemed"	" But Kramlich, who has worked as a venture capitalist since 1969, put it more harshly. The firm, it seemed, had simply run out of patience with Alsop, as it did with others who were not seen as pulling their weight. NEA has raised a pair of billion-dollar-plus funds over the last five years, sums high enough to have raised the stakes of the game. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"153351"	"it"	"seemed"	" Kurnaz, it seemed, had chosen a poor time to go to Pakistan, just as the American war against al-Qaida and the Taliban was getting started. Could he have been a Muslim fighter, recruited to help the enemy? The fact that he was a religious young Muslim from this city in northern Germany, only an hour's train ride from Hamburg, where the main plotters of the Sept. 11 attacks had lived, apparently supported the American suspicions that he was. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"

"155406"	"it"	"seemed"	" So far, four of these fru gene promoters have been found. Three work the same way in both male and female flies.

This difference, it seemed, was somehow the key to the whole suite of male courtship behaviors. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"155800"	"it"	"seemed"	" Two miles in, however, the Cliff Walk devolved into a Cliff Scramble over rocky beaches, through waist-high reeds and ominous tunnels, past stones balanced precariously one atop the other, placed on display, it seemed, by some Newport cousin of the Blair Witch. We finally emerged onto a street near Rough Point, where 18th-century ships unloaded their cargoes of slaves and which eventually became Doris Duke's estate. The grounds brought to mind an American Wuthering Heights: the Gothic sandstone manor looked down over a rolling lawn, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, to a rocky, sea-battered gully. To the west, on enormous boulders jutting into Rhode Island Sound, a pair of fishermen were casting their lines against the setting sun. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"156136"	"it"	"seemed"	" Still, few could have predicted that The Cosby Show would become a phenomenon. Loosely based on Cosby's own family, it was the highest-rated show for five consecutive seasons, and remained in the Nielsen top 20 throughout its eight-year run. Nearly everyone, it seemed, could relate to the warm, loving Huxtables - Cliff (Cosby); his wife, Clair (Phylicia Rashad); and their five children, Denise (Lisa Bonet), Theo (Malcolm Jamal-Warner), Vanessa (Tempestt Bledsoe), Rudy (Keshia Knight-Pulliam), and later, Sondra (Sabrina Le Beauf).

I feel less fine trying to describe the show, because obscenities I am not allowed to quote here burst from almost all his sentences. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"156906"	"it"	"seemed"	" A midget freeway was the description Karal Ann Marling, a professor at the University of Minnesota and a scholar of pop culture, gave to Autopia, with its swelling deciduous trees (in place of indigenous palms) and soothing desert ponds. But Autopia was barely ready on opening day. Marling, editor of Designing Disney's Theme Parks, (Flammarion, 1998) noted that Tomorrowland was far from complete -- and was the least thought-out area of the park -- when it opened. The completion of Tomorrowland was left, it seemed, mostly until tomorrow. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"

In Pittsburgh, Jagr once said he was dying alive during a bad spell. In Washington, he attributed some of his uninspired play to a breakup with his girlfriend, the beauty queen.

Night was approaching, a chilly rain was falling and there was an air of desperation among the sodden backpackers ahead of us. When at last I reached the front of the line, the woman at the window arched an eyebrow and squinted at me as if I were obviously rabid, slid a long form across the counter and gestured that I must go over to another counter by the wall and fill it out. The form demanded all sorts of information that seemed to be nobody's business, like my occupation, my mother's maiden name, the name and address of the hotel I'd just come from, the name and the address of the hotel I'd be checking into after I left Paris and -- maybe I'm imagining this one -- my weight in kilograms. When I finally filled it all out, I went back to the window and the woman scowled and pointed out the door. I had to go back to the end of the line. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"

Even fans of Star Wars, to the chagrin of conservatives, found themselves hearing a real-world rhetorical lilt to Anakin Skywalker's warning, If you're not with me, you're my enemy, in Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith.

And as it became clear that Winfrey was turning on her protege (I feel really duped, You betrayed millions of readers, Why would you lie?), there did seem to be an opening in her esteem.

(A recent article in The Guardian reported on speculation that Turner doesn't write his own lyrics; the main evidence, it seemed, was that they are simply too good.) In the United States, though, the band's future is harder to predict. The album is due out from the independent label's American branch, Domino US, on Feb. 21; it is to be distributed through a new deal with the Alternative Distribution Alliance, a subsidiary of the Warner Music Group.

IRAQ (Baghdad, Iraq) -- At least 138 Iraqis were killed and political negotiations on a new government ground to a standstill Thursday in an outpouring of sectarian fury at Wednesday's bombing of one of the country's most sacred Shiite shrines. On Thursday, a major Sunni Arab group suspended talks with Shiite and Kurdish politicians on a new government, accusing Shiite leaders of igniting anti-Sunni reprisals. The American ambassador, Zalmay Khalilzad, spent the day talking to politicians, trying to urge calm and keep the political process on track, despite the anger felt by both Sunnis and Shiites at each other and at the Americans. With  IRAQ-MOSQUES (Baghdad, Iraq) -- Suddenly it was happening, and no one seemed able to stop it. Angry groups of armed men drove through parts of Baghdad on Wednesday, shooting at Sunni mosques, setting several on fire and even attacking suspected Sunni extremists.

PORTS-DUBAI (Washington) -- The Bush administration is seeking a way to delay the formal acquisition of leases of six major port terminals by a Dubai company to give the White house time to assuage angry Republicans and Democrats in Congress worried about the security implications of the deal, administration officials said on Thursday. The tentative moves by the White House came as Bush administration officials and Senate Democrats clashed in a public hearing on Capitol Hill over the national security risks of allowing a Dubai company to run operations at major American ports. By David S. Cloud and David E. Sanger.  With photo.  FANNIE-MAE (Washington) -- Investigators have uncovered new evidence that senior executives of Fannie Mae, the nation's largest purchaser of home mortgages, manipulated its accounting in the 1990s to meet earnings projections so that top executives could get more than $27 million in bonuses. In a 2,600-page report concluding an 18 month investigation, former Sen. Warren Rudman and a team of lawyers and investigators concluded that Fannie Mae's accounting practices in virtually all of the areas that we reviewed were not consistent with generally accepted accounting principles. By Stephen Labaton and Eric Dash.  With a graphic.  TWINS-SCHOOL (Undated) -- Parents of twins and triplets are challenging long-standing -- and, they say, outmoded -- educational practices that require their children be separated in the classroom, in part to foster their independence. The passionate debate is polarizing families and school administrators across the country, and drawing the attention of lawmakers who say cases should be evaluated on an individual family basis. Advocates of parental choice point to studies in the past two years that have suggested that twins, for example, may actually benefit from being left together in their early years. Since last year, when Minnesota became the first state to allow parents to decide how children of multiple births will be educated, similar legislation has been introduced in Illinois, with groups in New York, Texas, Massachusetts and North Carolina working to get such statutes introduced. By Ginia Bellafante.  KATRINA-DEBRIS (Ponchatoula, La.) -- Dozens of courthouse wrangles and public controversies have erupted recently over the still-gargantuan task of removing tons of debris in Louisiana and Mississippi. The problems are now so clear that even the Department of Homeland Security and its congressional critics said last week that the entire process for cleaning up after storms -- and paying for that cleanup -- needs to be restructured. Contractors and workers, ranging from individual laborers to a quality-control consulting firm, claim that they have been abused, underpaid, or not paid at all. Local politicians are fuming about the slow pace of cleanup and their lack of control over what happens in their communities. And government investigators have opened at least five probes into debris removal operations, and federal prosecutors have filed two criminal complaints involving debris removal. By Leslie Eaton.

"164074"	"it"	"seemed"	" While Braugher was using his post-Homicide life to distance himself from Pembletonian behavior, the rest of television, it seemed, was taking it on. In recent years, dramas have featured a host of black characters who function as the moral centers of their ensemble casts -- Dennis Haysbert's President David Palmer on 24, CCH Pounder's Detective Claudette Wyms on The Shield, Isaiah Washington's Dr. Preston Burke on Grey's Anatomy. Even if the gravitational pull they exert isn't quite as strong, they all owe clear debts to Braugher's Pembleton. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"

There would be no reprieve for the Eagles, who squandered a 16-point first-half lead, committed 21 turnovers, and missed nine free throws, or for senior cocaptains Craig Smith and Louis Hinnant, whose run as the winningest senior class in BC history (96-35) ended two wins shy of reaching the Final Four. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"165472"	"it"	"seemed"	" The case was first uncovered by the SEC last year. Immediately after Adidas-Salomon announced it had a deal to acquire Reebok, sending Reebok's stock up 30 percent, the market surveillance department in Washington detected an unusual volume of trading in Reebok call options, which allow an investor to lock in a price to buy the stock. Within 24 hours, investigators traced the origin of the trading as far away as Croatia and Anticevic. Ms. Anticevic, it seemed, was either the most successful investor in the history of Wall Street or part of something more nefarious, said Schonfeld of the SEC. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"

"167245"	"it"	"seemed"	" Almost out of nowhere, it seemed, Ms. Aboukhadijeh's preschool classroom turned into a farm. One day last month, cows and roosters appeared on the walls.

"167323"	"it"	"seemed"	" But trippy quests were not the only impact of the '60s on Robbins' ballet choreography. More and more, it seemed, he eased his dancers into ballet steps with natural movement, a favorite of the Judson Church group. Robbins' ballet dancers walked and stood about as if pondering their next move. Sometimes you didn't even notice the transition between repose and dance. As Jowitt put it in discussing Ives, Songs, People stroll their way into dancing. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"167436"	"it"	"seemed"	" It was still just a stalling tactic for the franchise's long-term viability. Every year, it seemed, they lost another emerging star who outgrew the team's finances. But the Oilers still made the playoffs in six of the eight seasons from 1997 to 2004. Relying on youth and spunk more than talent and experience, they made the second round only twice, and never threatened to go further. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"167571"	"it"	"seemed"	" Some Iraqis, it seemed, were simply overwhelmed. The memory of the capture of Saddam Hussein, and the continuing violence, was still fresh in people's minds. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"167909"	"it"	"seemed"	" Sports, it seemed, was one place she seemed to fit in best. Later, when she made her high school basketball team an after-school club activity since girls' basketball was virtually off the radar her father always left work early to be there in the stands. But cheers were hardly all that he imparted. Jim Brennan, an unflinching old-school Republican with a rock-solid approach to life, also imbued his daughter with his sense of fairness, the importance of standing up for oneself in tough situations, and the ability to laugh at oneself, too. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"167972"	"it"	"seemed"	" It was an unexpected moment -- unexpected, it seemed, even by management, which would ordinarily be the party to confer such an honor. Asked that morning whether Barenboim would be given a title like conductor emeritus, Deborah R. Card, the orchestra's president, said that he had no interest in titles. Evidently it depends on who's offering. (In our hearts and in our minds, the players' statement read, we consider you our honorary conductor for life.) He is not, in any case, scheduled to return next season. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"167974"	"it"	"seemed"	" The Chandlers think not, nor, it seemed, did investors -- until the buyback plan and news of the Chandlers' opposition drove Tribune stock up during the last two weeks. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"168932"	"it"	"seemed"	" After giving up two runs in the second inning, on a walk to Carl Everett, a two-out single by Yuniesky Betancourt, a walk to Adam Jones, and a single by Ichiro Suzuki, Gabbard controlled the Mariners into the sixth inning. And, it seemed, it could have been longer. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"
"168933"	"it"	"seemed"	" It was a fate that might have been predicted with a look at the name on the scorecard, the name of a kid pitcher whom Francona couldn't even identify in spring training. But, it seemed, it wasn't entirely deserved. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"
"170326"	"it"	"seemed"	" McEnroe never did fully make the conversion to power tennis, and he never won a Grand Slam singles title after his 26th birthday. He wasn't the only champion to flame out young -- Bjorn Borg, Boris Becker and Mats Wilander, to name three others -- and that is what made Agassi's career unique. We charted his highs and lows across the decades. We watched him evolve, it seemed, in the middle of a match. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"170379"	"it"	"seemed"	" Huddling with loved ones at home, attending a ceremony in the heat, or simply working on their houses, every citizen, it seemed, was reflecting Tuesday on the disaster one year ago that altered a way of life here for a good long while, if not forever. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"170570"	"it"	"seemed"	" Slowly, in different times, in different places, in an uncoordinated way, data was being gathered and theories formed about a family of diseases caused, it seemed, by a new kind of virus, one that was virtually indestructible and that the body did not recognize as foreign. In time, what many researchers believed was impossible came to seem possible. The disease was caused not by a virus, but by an abnormally folded, infectious protein dubbed a prion (PREE-on) by Stanley Prusiner, an American scientist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1997 for his work. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171070"	"it"	"seemed"	" Milwaukee public health officials created a hotline for nervous residents, and reported a robust number of calls with questions and worries. At grocery stores, raw spinach bins sat empty and produce managers said they had few inquiries about the product at all. Most people, it seemed, had heard about the outbreak by Friday morning, and had no intention of buying spinach. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"

"171312"	"it"	"seemed"	" The Hold Steady made an album, The Hold Steady Almost Killed Me (Frenchkiss), and started to tour. Finn was an unlikely lead singer: small and rumpled, with glasses that always needed adjusting and a guitar that rarely, it seemed, needed playing. No matter: it turned out that Kubler's beery guitar riffs went well with Finn's beery stories; both went better than well with actual beer. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171725"	"it"	"seemed"	" What happened to Lewis, anyway? In Cape Fear and Husbands and Wives, she created some of the most viscerally complicated female adolescents in the history of American movies. Then she spent the rest of the early 1990s with a monopoly on dim and crazy - Kalifornia, Natural Born Killers, that Melissa Etheridge video where she beat herself up in a big white room. There was nowhere else to go, it seemed, but back to normal - a funny stint, say, as a talking head on VH-1's I Love the '80s series. Lately, she's refashioned herself as a love interest - she's too old for the teenage wasteland. So there she was gamely flirty with Luke Wilson in Old School and here she is now propping up a wishy-washy Jackson. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"

"172124"	"it"	"seemed"	" Yesterday afternoon, the sky was high and blue, the surrounding hills were turning crimson and orange and yellow, and everybody in town, it seemed, had dropped in to check on the Ephs.

"172352"	"it"	"seemed"	" Every boat she was in, it seemed, was gilded. The 'Cliffies won the national crown the next spring and Davies claimed another global gold with the American four in 2003.

"172386"	"it"	"seemed"	" Shawn Green was walked intentionally, loading the bases for Valentin. When Valentin struck out, it seemed, at the time, that it was planned. Chavez was on deck, and a hit would have cemented his place in Mets lore. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"

"172965"	"it"	"seemed"	" The field of classical music has long been waiting for some musician to come along who could use television with Bernstein's galvanizing impact. The closest, it seemed, has been the dynamic maestro Michael Tilson Thomas, a natural who has masterminded some impressive shows. Until recently, though, TV had not been a central component of Thomas' work. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173058"	"it"	"seemed"	" After the concert, Shin patiently signed autographs. But something, it seemed, was ruffling him. At a postconcert party, he was feeling exhausted and in no mood to drink or eat. His manager had booked a hotel here. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"

"173778"	"it"	"seemed"	" Clearly, the kids had no idea what a hoe was. Given the suburban neighborhoods where most of them lived, that wasn't surprising.
