"12516"	"we"	"note"	" The FAA's text, we note, presupposes the vitality of contracts governing transportation by air carriers. Section 411(b), 49 U. S. C. App. s1381(b), thus authorizes airlines to ``incorporate by reference in any ticket or other written instrument any of the terms of the contract of carriage'' to the extent authorized by the DOT. And the DOT's regulations contemplate that, upon the January 1, 1983, termination of domestic tariffs, ``ticket contracts'' ordinarily would be enforceable under ``the contract law of the States.'' 47 Fed. Reg. 52129 (1982). Correspondingly, the DOT requires carriers to give passengers written notice of the time period within which they may ``bring an action against the carrier for its acts.'' 14 CFR s253.5(b)(2) (1994).American does not suggest that its contracts lack legal force. American sees the DOT, however, as the exclusively competent monitor of the airline's undertakings. American points to the Department's authority to require any airline, in conjunction with its certification, to file a performance bond conditioned on the airline's ``making appropriate compensation . . . , as prescribed by the (Department), for failure . . . to perform air transportation services in accordance with agreements therefor.'' FAA s401(q)(2), 49 U. S. C. App. s1371(q)(2). (footnote 7) But neither the DOT nor its predecessor, the CAB, has ever construed or applied this provision to displace courts as adjudicators in air carrier contract disputes. Instead, these agencies have read the provision to charge them with a less taxing task: In passing on air carrier fitness under FAA s401(d), 49 U. S. C. App. s1371(d)(1), the DOT and the CAB have used their performance bond authority to ensure that, when a carrier's financial fitness is marginal, funds will be available to compensate customers if the carrier goes under before providing already-paid-for services. See, e. g., U. S. Bahamas Service Investigation, CAB Order 79-11-116, p. 3, 84 CAB Reports 73, 75 (1979) (``We . . . find that Southeast (Airlines) is fit to provide scheduled foreign air transportation. However, because of Southeast's current financial condition its operations present an unacceptable risk of financial loss to consumers. Therefore, we shall require the carrier . . . to procure and maintain a bond for the protection of passengers who have paid for transportation not yet performed.''). </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"

The Government's strained reading of s1346(a)(1), we note, would leave people in Williams' position without a remedy. See supra, at 1, n. 1. This consequence reinforces our conclusion that Congress did not intend refund actions under s1346(a)(1) to be unavailable to persons situated as Lori Williams is. Though the Government points to three other remedies, none was realistically open to Williams. Nor would any of the vaunted remedies be available to others in her situation. See, e.g., Martin v.

The hundreds of millions of dollars that pour into the state every year are the lifeblood of the commonwealth's universities, hospitals and high tech firms. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"

Though the relationship with China is inherently unequal, they note, Brazil can get more of what it wants only if it avoids being impetuous and is as hard-nosed and pragmatic as the Chinese themselves. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"146930"	"they"	"note"	" Apparently, many people do want to live in Las Vegas. It has, they note, evolved far beyond gambling and showgirls, to include fine restaurants, high-end shopping and even touches of high-brow culture. Locals are calling it the Manhattanization of Las Vegas. But a more fitting term may be the South Beachification of the Strip. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"147350"	"they"	"note"	" Most economists agree that the Bay Area's path to recovery has been promising, albeit slow. Gradual job growth, they note, is better than no growth. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"148565"	"they"	"note"	" Norwegian motorists, already plagued by some of the highest fuel taxes and car-registration fees in the world, now face a 30 percent increase in fines for offenses like speeding. Drivers clocked, for example, at 75 mph in a 55-mph zone will have to pay about $1,300, while the fine for cruising through a red light will rise to $855. Some police officers say they hesitate to enforce the new penalties, which take effect on Feb. 1. In many cases, they note, common traffic offenses will now carry heavier fines than heroin possession or assault. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"151929"	"they"	"note"	" Some private economists take a more positive view. Consumer confidence, they note, rose slightly in a recent survey by the GfK Group, a market research firm in Nuremberg. And the damping effects of the euro may have passed. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"153985"	"they"	"note"	" For those with the means, renovation a l'Americaine can be a fait accompli. Alon and Betsy Kasha, an American couple who develop and sell properties (abkasha.com), put their pieds-a-terre on the market as finished luxury products complete with two-year warranties. Along with such authentic touches as herringbone parquet, they note, Americans want creature comforts like shower stalls and washer-dryers. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"154053"	"they"	"note"	" A U.S. government task force, they note, estimated that cartels last year produced more than twice the amount of cocaine claimed by the White House. A report released last week by the United Nations maintained that cocaine output is actually on the rise. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"154372"	"they"	"note"	" Finally, opponents argue that the flag desecration amendment is a solution in search of a problem. They say there have been fewer than 45 flag-burning incidents since the Supreme Court's first ruling on the issue in 1989. And, they note, most people only witness the U.S. flag burned as the official, sanctioned means of disposal or in protest in other countries. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"154836"	"they"	"note"	" The hotels and downtown interests say the boycott is hurting hotel workers themselves. Every lost convention, they note, means the loss of banquet jobs and other work for employees. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"154930"	"they"	"note"	" Yet some industry analysts contend that the company has carved out enough of a niche to make it a viable long-term player. T-Mobile, they note, is profitable and has the youngest subscribers in the industry, many of them concentrated in wealthier, urban markets. They also say it has one of the most efficient operations among the major carriers. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"155032"	"they"	"note"	" The administration, foreign policy experts say, wants to put off a decision on CNOOC if it can. The United States, they note, faces a series of thorny issues with China on other fronts. Washington wants Beijing to put pressure on North Korea in coming nuclear disarmament talks; the United States is pressing China to restrain its digital pirates, who illegally copy movies, software and other goods; and there are the continuing tensions over China's huge trade surplus with the United States, manufacturing jobs lost to China and Washington's call for China to loosen its fixed-rate currency policy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"156226"	"they"	"note"	" There is, they note, a relatively benign explanation: such companies are taking risks to benefit shareholders, and while some of the risks do not work out, others do. But they offer two other possible explanations. One is that high management pay reflects weak board oversight. The other is that incentive pay packages can create an environment that ultimately leads to fraud. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"157174"	"they"	"note"	" German officials warn that high fuel prices will hobble the country's growth. But some economists say that fear is misplaced. Much of the upward price pressure, they note, stems from rocketing demand in China, which, in turn, imports heavy machinery and other goods from Germany. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"157316"	"they"	"note"	" The victims, they note, were largely black and poor, those who toiled in the background of the tourist havens, living in tumble-down neighborhoods that were long known to be vulnerable to disaster if the levees failed. Without so much as a car or bus fare to escape before Hurricane Katrina hit, they found themselves once again left behind by a failure to plan for their rescue should the dreaded day ever arrive. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
"158374"	"they"	"note"	" Others are not so certain: Benedict, they note, is 78, a man who by his own admission may not have long in office and so may move more quickly than a younger pope if he decides a problem needs fixing. In the meetings, he has shown up with a briefcase, not taking notes but listening intently with his chin on his hand, said an official church briefer. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
"159523"	"they"	"note"	" Family friends snicker at Bush's romantic description of Alito as the son of an Italian immigrant. While true, they note, Alito's father was mostly a consciously assimilated American. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"160126"	"they"	"note"	" The singers acknowledge that Picker's vocal writing is easy on the ear, but, they note, its technical challenges are ample. Picker's use of vernacular American speech rhythms creates metrically unpredictable lines, said Graham, and her arias include some daunting leaps. For Gunn, there was also the problem of making Clyde sympathetic. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"162012"	"they"	"note"	" Analysts say Morales is aware that aid from Venezuela and other countries pales in comparison to U.S. assistance. The Bolivian, they note, lacks the oil wealth that provides Chavez a degree of independence from Washington. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"163463"	"they"	"note"	" It is the Sunnis, they note, who have been the heart of the violent resistance to the newly elected government and that Shiite-led government is fighting those terrorists. Last week, Shiite leaders complained that Sunnis have been too tolerant of the militant bombers who have killed untold thousands of Shiites. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"164221"	"they"	"note"	" Gov. Jeb Bush's popularity insulates the state from the president's problems, they assure themselves. The Florida Legislature's recently passed gift ban and lobbyist disclosure law helps diminish the stench of Republican scandal wafting out of Washington. Florida's economy is stronger than other states, they note, and Florida Democrats are hapless and darn near destitute. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"166050"	"they"	"note"	" The Massachusetts contest, held Saturday morning at the Boston Center for the Arts in the South End, drew representatives from 12 schools, but organizers hope the event will grow in future years as word spreads. Already, they note, there is a lively poetry scene at many schools such as Abington, where nearly 100 students competed to represent the school at the event. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"167234"	"they"	"note"	" The oil companies' efforts, however, have met with skepticism from many environmentalists. The amount of money invested so far, they note, pales in comparison to the cash sunk into finding and producing more oil. Chevron, for example, plans to spend $15 billion to $16 billion annually in 2007 and 2008 on fossil fuel exploration, production and infrastructure. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"168220"	"they"	"note"	" Muslim rituals are guided by the Quran and the Hadith, tomes that detail Islam as it was practiced in the Prophet's time. Advocates and some religious scholars say the books support the women. Muhammad emphasized that the rules for his wives were distinct from those for other women, they note, and he never resorted to a barrier, despite similar debate in the seventh century. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"169107"	"they"	"note"	" Any financial restatements that result from the stock options inquiry, analysts said, would not be cash charges. Thus, they note, the financial fundamentals of the company will not be affected. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169559"	"they"	"note"	" For years, labor activists have characterized Wal-Mart as beholden to Republicans. In the last election cycle, they note, the company gave 80 percent of its contributions to Republicans. The vast majority of its stores are in Republican territory in the rural South. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"172140"	"they"	"note"	" Wyoming's approach to managing the wolf is opposed by environmental groups, who point out that the federal government has spent millions of dollars restoring the wolf population. Various polls, they note, show most Americans support the wolves' return. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172222"	"they"	"note"	" Most sweatshop jobs -- even ones paying just $2 per day -- provide enough to lift a worker above the poverty level, and often far above it, according to a study in 10 Asian and Latin American countries by the economists Benjamin Powell and David Skarbek. In Honduras, they note, the average apparel worker makes $13 a day, while nearly half the population makes less than $2 a day. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172726"	"they"	"note"	" Silicon Valley, they note, no longer relies on silicon factories for its prosperity. Product design, software, services and financing account for most of the 490,000 high-tech jobs in Silicon Valley. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"174215"	"they"	"note"	" Much as Seinfeld thrives in syndication heaven today, so does Festivus and its expanding pool of celebrants. Behind its popularity, devotees say, are its absence of presents, accent on idiocy, and refreshing lack of familial psychodrama. Festivus may have its own quirky rituals, they note, but none involving theology, batteries, reindeer, political correctness, or parental guilt. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
