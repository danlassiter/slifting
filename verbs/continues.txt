Whether confusion had ended was not clear.   On one hand, the Labor-led government says its wants to curtail the expansion of settlements championed by its Likud predecessor. But on the other, it continues, as it did Wednesday, to accept new building in and around sensitive areas like Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley, albeit not nearly to the extent that settler groups would like.   Palestinians expressed anger that construction of any kind would continue in West Bank areas that Israelis claim as ``Greater Jerusalem'' but that Palestinians say belong to them for their hoped-for future state. Settler leaders and the Likud-led political opposition were also displeased, complaining that the government had yielded to PLO pressure and set aside original plans for several thousand more housing units.   KOBE, Japan (NYT) -- In a neighborhood where hearses and teetering buildings underscore the devastation of last week's great earthquake, the Army has set up special tents that for many residents were the key landmark in the restoration of vital services.   The tents contain public baths -- Japanese are among the most scrubbed humans on earth, and its Army may be the only one around that travels with steaming communal baths -- and the thrill the baths aroused illustrates the way Kobe and its neighboring cities are beginning the slog back to normality after the earthquake.   Estimates of the damage caused by the quake are rising steadily and now often exceed $100 billion, one of the largest construction bills in world history. The transport ministry said that the costs of repairing railroads alone will be about $40 billion, but whatever the cost the work is proceeding.   Stores are reopening, some schools are summoning students to class, and every day more families are getting back their telephone lines and electrical connections. Demolition experts are tearing down teetering buildings, and rail service is steadily being extended closer to Kobe.   BERLIN (NYT) -- In an unusually blunt confession of guilt, Germany's Roman Catholic bishops have asserted that Catholics share responsibility for the Nazi Holocaust.   The bishops deplored the failure of German Catholics to act against Nazism, and asserted that they now bear a special responsibility to speak out against anti-Semitism.   ''The denial and guilt that was prevalent in those days also came from the church,'' the bishops said in a statement. ``During the period of the Third Reich, Christians did not carry out the required resistance to racist anti-Semitism.''   Christian and Jewish leaders welcomed the bishops' statement, which was issued in advance of Friday's 50th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp.   CRACOW, Poland (NYT) -- On the eve of commemoration ceremonies to mark the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp, two public opinion surveys suggest that the Polish people underestimate the extent of Jewish suffering in Poland at the hands of the Nazis while stressing their own afflictions.   The results of one poll, released here wednesday by the American Jewish Committee, show that 40 percent of Poles believe the Jews and Poles suffered about equally from Nazi persecution during World War 11 and that only 29 percent believed Jews suffered more.   Another survey, taken for the Polish President Lech Walesa and released Monday, showed a much larger gap with 47 percent of Poles saying Auschwitz was a place primarily of Polish martyrdom with only 8 percent believing it was a site primarily of Jewish death.   The poll results explain a great deal about why the nature of the services in memory of the estimated 1.5 million victims at Auschwitz, about 90 percent of whom were Jewish, have become so contentious, experts on Jewish-Polish relations said.   ROME (NYT) -- Lamberto Dini, Italy's new prime minister, Wednesday won his first confidence vote in Parliament, thanks to the mass abstention by deputies from the center-right coalition led by his predecessor, Silvio Berlusconi.   The 270 abstentions in the Parliament's 630-seat lower chamber allowed the new government to win with a technical majority with 302 ''yes'' votes - a number that fell far short of the broad mandate Dini had sought, and will probably need, as he pushes through a four-point program of economic and political reform.   By withholding its votes, the Freedom Alliance - the coalition which won Italy's elections last spring - put Dini on notice that it keep up the pressure for another round of parliamentary elections, as early as June if Berlusconi has his way.   UNITED NATIONS (NYT) -- A treaty that has limited the spread of nuclear weapons for a quarter of a century is under fire this week as United States negotiators battle influential nonnuclear nations threatening to block an indefinite extension of the pact.   The nuclear accord, known as the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which was signed in 1968 and put into effect two years later, is up for renewal at an international conference beginning in April. This week, representatives of 168 nations who are party to the accord are meeting to establish the ground rules for that crucial conference and to lobby for the treaty's extension or some alternative action.   ``We have one chance -- the only chance -- to make this treaty permanent,'' Thomas Graham, leader of the American team, told reporters on Tuesday. ``It is imporant to remove any doubt about the health of the N.P.T., that it is not going to go away some day.''   MEXICO CITY (NYT) -- Generous though it might sound, an American plan to rescue Mexico's economy with $40 billion of loan guarantees has sparked growing opposition from Mexicans who say it could jeopardize their country's independence without solving its problems.   The terms under which the United States might provide the loan guarantees have yet to be fully decided. Congressional hearings on the issue only began in Washington Wednesday, and American officials say it may take more bargaining to overcome the opposition of legislators in both parties.   But the concessions proposed for the package by American congressmen touch on some of the issues dearest to Mexico's nationalistic heart: control over the oil industry; illegal migration to the United States; the country's traditionally warm relations with the Communist government of Cuba.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950125.0161 type=story > <HEADLINE> CONGRESSIONAL STAFFERS PREDICT MEDICARE CUTS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WASHINGTON  (BC-MEDICARE-440&AMP;add-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"

Until they destroyed him, these traits enlightened him and gave him purpose, and in consequence, gave the whole ship's company a frightful and loathsome purpose.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"116733"	"he"	"continues"	" One of many aspects differentiating Eminem from other best-selling, vulgar pop stars is that there is so much pathos and honesty in his lyrics, especially on ``Cleanin' Out My Closet.'' Here he asks his mother, ``Remember when Ronnie died, and you wished it was me?'' (He was an uncle who committed suicide.) Then, he continues, with words aimed to strike at any mother's heart: ``Hailie's getting so big now. You should see her, she's beautiful. But you'll never see her. She won't even be at your funeral.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"121443"	"he"	"continues"	" ``All of a sudden the fight was really in front of our eyes,'' says a television journalist who was present at the uprising at Mazar-e-Sharif, the prison where John Walker Lindh was discovered and the CIA agent Mike Spann was killed last November. It was an opportunity to show what this war was really like, he continues, ``how dirty it is, now nasty it is, how frightening it is.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"122049"	"he"	"continues"	" In the English-language catalog for ``A Civilian Occupation,'' half a dozen architects do just that, although its fiercest criticism of the settlements in the occupied territories comes from a journalist, Gideon Levy, a columnist in Haaretz. ``They are almost always up there, the settlements, dominating the plateau, challenging, provoking, picking a fight,'' he writes. From everywhere, he continues, ``you can spot the settlement on the hilltop, looming, threatening, dreadfully colonial.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"

"127291"	"he"	"continues"	" The right direction, he continues, starts with knowing the details of President Bush's intelligence briefings before Sept. 11. But that information was recently ruled by the CIA director to be classified: national security. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"129388"	"he"	"continues"	" In the song, he asks his mother, ``Remember when Ronnie died, and you wished it was me?'' (Ronnie Polkingharn was an uncle who committed suicide.)

"138422"	"he"	"continues"	" Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor mirror Doris Day and Rock Hudson in Peyton Reed's buoyant homage to the brightly colored and totally ridiculous romantic comedies of the late 1950s and early '60s. Author of an explosive feminist best seller, Barbara Novak ( Zellweger) crosses swords with a cad of a gossip columnist, Catcher Block ( McGregor). ``The best moments have a glorious, hectic artificiality,'' A.O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. But, he continues, as it ``tweaks the attitudes and behaviors of the past, `Down With Love' is careful to uphold the right-thinking norms of the present, denying the audience the pleasures of subversion and satire.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200310.gz"

"141065"	"she"	"continues"	" The book was a complex endeavor, she continues, because it includes so much anthropology -- the origins of the food, eating customs, food lore, personal stories, ancient recipes, meanings of words, Olympic stories, Greek proverbs and more. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"142068"	"he"	"continues"	" Pro football never caught on there, he continues, because the rules of the sport were too complicated. In general, the state is a barbaric slice of life. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"145937"	"he"	"continues"	" There's this great thing magicians do, where they force a card, he says. They get you to pick the card they want. Once a magician can do that, he continues, you can paint that five of diamonds on the side of a building or tattoo it on your arm, whatever you want. I look at stories that way. There's that one moment where you want to control the audience, make them believe as much as possible in a certain reality. Then, when you make the reveal, the point when the audience's understanding of the situation is overturned, you can do it with a flourish. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"

"166112"	"he"	"continues"	" Imagine, he continues, a time when audiences eagerly awaited the latest from Cole Porter and the Gershwins. Now, the Man says, it's, 'Please, Elton John, must we continue this charade?' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"

"172077"	"it"	"continues"	" Because sheltered coastlines do not typically present long stretches of relatively uniform landscape, the way ocean beaches do, they are more likely to be regulated piecemeal, the report says. While one or two seawalls or bulkheads, installed here and there, may have relatively little effect, it continues, the construction of many structures in relative close proximity to each other can destroy or strikingly alter habitats. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"173160"	"he"	"continues"	" When Snakes opened this summer, he continues, Aca/Fan readers were invited to report on what happened in their local theaters. Many noticed a strong Internet-fueled impact, Jenkins found, whereas others saw little. Yet for cultural disconnect, it was hard to top the experience Jenkins had in rural Georgia. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173161"	"he"	"continues"	" Restricting a child's TV or computer time is fine, he continues, but banning it is an overreaction. Kids use media in productive and destructive ways.
