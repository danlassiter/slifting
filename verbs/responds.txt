"9205"	"she"	"responds"	" Ms. Shange, whose novel ``Liliane: Resurrection of the Daughter'' has just been published by St. Martin's Press, lives with her 13-year-old daughter, Savannah, in a converted brick factory in Philadelphia's artsy waterfront district known as Olde City. Ms. Shange, listed in ``Who's Who in America'' as divorced, is coy about her personal life. Asked her marital status, she responds, ``I'm a happy woman.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"
"19307"	"she"	"responds"	" Scorsese, in introducing the new print earlier this month, quoted from ``The Red Shoes'' to explain what film meant to the Archers: when Anton Walbrook asks Moira Shearer why she wants to dance, she responds, ``Why do you want to live?'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"22518"	"he"	"responds"	" When she chides Burton, her new co-star on ``Cleopatra,'' for being too hung over to work and suggests that he show up in better shape the next day, he responds, ``I'll turn up sober if you turn up on time.'' The director and the crew are later seen waiting patiently on the set while the couple, now openly in love, cavort in her dressing room. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"36912"	"he"	"responds"	" If she says, without real concern, that she's ``nonplussed'' by one of his cruder colloquialisms, he responds, ``You've never been nonplussed in the whole of your voracious, lascivious, libidinous life.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"131934"	"she"	"responds"	" In one of the book's longest letters, Hurston takes Hughes to task over creative and financial issues regarding their collaboration on the 1931 play ``Mule Bone:'' ``In the beginning, Langston, I was very eager to do the play with you. ANYthing (author's emphasis) you said would go over big with me. But scarcely had we gotten under way before you made three propositions that shook me to the foundation of myself.'' Two days later, after apparently receiving an apologetic reply from Hughes, she responds, ``Now, I suppose that both of us got worked up unnecessarily. I have explained myself so that I see no need to rehash it.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"144953"	"she"	"responds"	" After welcoming a tactical suggestion, the usually recalcitrant Tertuliano invites it in but is refused. It's not healthy for the mind to live cheek by jowl with common sense, it cautions him, eating at the same table, sleeping in the same bed, taking it along to work, and asking its approval or permission before making a move, you've got to take a few risks of your own. As for Maria, the wonderfully circular discussions in which she tries to remind her mentally ballooning lover of who she is are moving and shrewd. To quote one line, after he patronizes her for an unexpectedly (to him) original thought, she responds, You're the historian, but I would say that it was only after our ancestors had had the ideas that made them intelligent that they actually began to be intelligent enough to have ideas. The flow and eddy of voices, uniquely conveying Saramago's sensibility, carry his stories and subvert them at the same time. The characters (Tomarctus and Common Sense included, and of course the author) all have a point of view and frequently change it. They pronounce, listen, ignore and argue with each other and themselves. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"145684"	"he"	"responds"	" What a treat it is to find a medical show that doesn't turn its talented MDs into bedside saints in order to calm viewers' fears about mechanical HMO factories. House is a full-on pain in the neck who -- surprise, surprise -- may not even have a heart of gold underneath his gruff surface. He has contempt for all his patients, snapping at the needier ones: Would you rather have a doctor who holds your hand, or one who cures you? When a colleague, oncologist James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), asks for his assistance on a difficult case, he responds, Brain tumor. She's gonna die. Boring. No Marcus Welby, he. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"156197"	"she"	"responds"	" Starved kicks off the comedy bloc tonight with its four heroes attending an eating-disorders group its shrewish matron calls, with dour pride, a community of accountability and shame. When Sam (series creator Eric Schaeffer) admits to having rescued a processed chocolate cake from the garbage to gorge upon it, she responds, If you were a dog, I'd kick you in the face. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"163699"	"he"	"responds"	" At the center of Winslow's Beautiful Ride is Ted, a once-successful California real estate investor who has lost everything -- except his new BMW. When Ted's wife accuses him of loving the car more than he loves her, he responds, It's not a car. It's a BMW Z4. Winslow admitted that he initially spread the paeans to German engineering a bit thick even for his sponsors. They were sensitive about it being too much of a commercial, said Winslow, who agreed to excise some references. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
