"2789"	"she"	"declared"	" A call to 800-number directory assistance and a few voice-mail menus later I reached a service representative.

"38973"	"he"	"declared"	" In announcing his negotiating strategy with New York City's labor leaders earlier this year, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani set a high standard. The city had no money for wage increases, he declared, so that any gains for municipal employees would have to be paid for by concessions in work rules, wages and benefits. By that standard, Giuliani's agreement with the teachers' union fell short. The agreement was too heavily based on questionable savings and assumptions that could set a costly pattern if its terms are repeated with other city labor unions. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"

"55503"	"he"	"declared"	" Such ``inner dowsing'' is a far cry from traditional dowsing, which, while mocked by scientists, at least had a clear-cut procedure. The traditional dowser, or ``water witcher,'' held an outstretched Y-shaped twig in both arms and walked around fields; when the twig lurched downward, he declared, ``There's water under here!'' Dowsing is ``kind of like a sixth sense that all of us may have. The more you use it, the more it gets developed,'' claims veteran water dowser Charlie (CQ) Hawks, 44, co-owner of a pump and well company in Sebastopol. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"
"55540"	"he"	"declared"	" ``The public has a substantial interest in the relationship between health maintenance organizations and their preferred-provider physicians,'' wrote Chief Justice David Brock in an eight-page opinion.

"60196"	"he"	"declared"	" To Sharon, Arafat is anathema. The two major mistakes of the Israeli-Palestinian agreements, he declared, were that it was signed with Arafat _ ``I don't know anyone who has so much civilian Jewish blood on his hands since Hitler'' _ and that it handed responsibility for the struggle with terrorism ``into the hands of a terrorist.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"
"62316"	"he"	"declared"	" When the Watergate scandal first surfaced, Dole shrugged it off with characteristic humor. The break-in, he declared, had occurred on his ``night off.'' He continued to defend the president even as the scandal mushroomed. A White House memo to Nixon from the spring of 1973 notes that Dole had requested a meeting to offer ``his personal encouragement'' about Watergate. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199606.gz"

INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  PERU-HOSTAGES-LEADER (Lima, Peru) _ Profile of the Tupac Amaru leader. By Calvin Sims.  BRITAIN-FLOURIDE (London) _ Britons remain stubbornly resistant to flouride in their water. Only 5.5 million people, or about 10 percent of the population, live in places with fluoridated water, and the government is under pressure not to extend it. By Sarah Lyall.  MEXICO-POLICE (Mexico City) _ An exiled senior police commander describes corruption in high places. By Sam Dillon.  SINGAPORE-MALYAYSIA (Singapore) _ Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew has a new message for his countrymen: Watch out for Malaysia.

By Seth Mydans.  (ART ADV: Locator map has been sent to NYT graphics clients.)  NATIONAL _ GENERAL (Moved in ``a'' category)  NY-SCHOOLS-CREW (New York) _ The pleas of Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew were answered last week with the most far-reaching realignment of the New York City schools since the racial strife of the late 1960s produced an historic decentralization of the massive system. The Legislature granted Crew new powers to govern the 32 local districts, including the ability to pick superintendents and reassign administrators in underperforming districts. By Matt Purdy.  ELDERLY-IMMIGRANTS (Boston) _ A look at the difficulties faced by elderly immigrants, struggling to learn English and pass their citizenship tests, amid fears that new immigration laws will deprive long-term immigrants of their monthly SSI payments, if they fail to become naturalized citizens. By Sarah Rimer.  (ART ADV: Graphic has been sent to NYT graphics clients.)  MALL-MANIA (Garden City, N.Y.) _ Malls are cocoons of shopping convenience. And for all the worrisome cries about the mallification of America, malls like Roosevelt Field _ with its garland-draped railings and its player piano tapping out ``All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth'' _ have become as much a part of the holiday season as community-group renditions of Handel's ``Messiah'' and the glow of electric menorahs through windowpanes. By Dan Barry.  EXCLUSIVE-MARCHOFDIMES (Undated) _ For years, eager children poured change by the trainload into gumball and candy machines bearing March of Dimes stickers, happy to get a treat and play a small role in the battle against polio and birth defects. But many of those gumball dollars never reached the March of Dimes. Instead, the group says that a financially troubled businessman who ran the candy program _ and served as one of the charity's trustees _ kept more than $2 million of the money, the bulk of it with the March of Dimes' understanding that he would pay it back. By Barry Meier.  WELFARE-KIDS (Philadelphia) _ For thousands of children of low-income families who receive Federal assistance for their disabilities, a witching hour is fast approaching.

Many disabled children are likely to lose their federal assisance. By Michael Janofsky.

By Sarah Rimer.  WASHINGTON _ (Moved in ``w'' category)  EXCLUSIVE-MARIJUANA-LAW _ Struggling to limit the effect of recent ballot initiatives in California and Arizona that relax restrictions on the medical use of marijuana and other illegal drugs, federal officials say they plan to prosecute and strip prescription licenses from doctors who help supply such drugs to even seriously ill people. By Tim Golden.  PLUTONIUM-PLEA _ A dozen influential groups concerned with the environment, energy supplies and the spread of nuclear weapons have appealed to the Department of Energy not to consume plutonium from old weapons in nuclear reactors unless the other leading disposal method, mixing the plutonium with waste and embedding the mixture in glass, proves impractical. By Matthew L. Wald.

VATICAN-PAPER-MEDIA (Rome) _ Founded in 1861 as the semiofficial newspaper of what was then a fast-shrinking Papal state, the paper has served 10 popes, and has had 10 editors. With the death of Pravda, it is now one of the most hidebound official government papers in the world. By Celestine Bohlen.

"83728"	"he"	"declared"	" There never was, he declared, but he conceded that once they had had an argument in which he kicked in a door, and that on another occasion they had exchanged words and he had, somewhat playfully, slightly cracked the window on her Mercedes convertible with a baseball bat he was toying with. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"85186"	"he"	"declared"	" But when he left office, Walling noted that the wage-hour provisions, born amid controversy, had won general acceptance. They had become, he declared, part of a ``broad humanitarian program'' and a long-term fact of the country's economic life. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

"85640"	"he"	"declared"	" He was, he declared, the victim of ``lies, libel, fraud, falsification, perjury, blackmail and bribery,'' as well as witnesses testifying by ``script'' and a jury poisoned against him by unfavorable news articles planted by the FBI. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

"86535"	"she"	"declared"	" In addition to the stop at the passport office (a symbol of her commitment to the state department's workers), she met with Mexico's foreign minister, Jose Angel Gurria (a symbol, she declared, of the importance of its relations with the United States). </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"87781"	"he"	"declared"	" Goldstone, a lawyer and an outsider -- he has only worked for RJR Nabisco for two years -- could be instrumental in any settlement. In December, he declared, ``We can't continue in public as kind of an outlaw industry.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"

"102775"	"he"	"declared"	" The Palestinian representative at the United Nations, Nasser al-Kidwa, said in his opening address that the severance of contacts effectively undermined all existing arrangements and precluded further negotiations.

"103337"	"he"	"declared"	" On Wednesday, university President John D. Haeger moved to settle matters definitively: NAU ``violated no laws or regulations'' in handling anthrax spores, he declared, and school researchers are helping the FBI track down terrorists. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"104408"	"he"	"declared"	" What he could not countenance were electric clocks. They have no soul, he declared, not to mention having ``hideous designs, fake pretensions and vulgar proportions.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"104461"	"he"	"declared"	" Quantum mechanics had been saved, he declared, but it still might need to be supplanted by laws that would preserve what physicists call ``naive locality,'' the sense that we are masters of our own fate. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"104590"	"he"	"declared"	" Normally, there would be a sound financial reason for attacking almost everything Pataki is trying to do. But this is not a normal year. The basic principle upon which he says the budget rests is that this is the time to raid various ``rainy day'' funds. In the combination of the recession and Sept. 11, he declared, ``We didn't get a rainy day but we got a monsoon.'' He was making a legitimate point. Some of his ideas seem defensible. New York is suffering, in part, because its chief city was the victim of a terrorist attack that was none of its own doing. If the governor has to rely on gimmicks to get through this crisis, no one in the state, or in the bond markets, is likely to blame him. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"108845"	"he"	"declared"	" When a friend of mine heard about the series ``The American Embassy,'' he was staggered -- anyone who's had to deal with the unhelpful consuls at one of these foreign outposts, particularly the one in London, he declared, would scoff at the idea of making its employees the heroes of a TV series. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"109182"	"it"	"declared"	" In the first of its ``Declarations from the Lacandon Jungle,'' the guerrilla army announced plans to march to Mexico City, where, it declared, it intended to put the country's leaders on trial. The EZLN's strategists expected government troops to turn their guns the other way. Instead, the soldiers drove the Zapatistas back into the jungle. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"110808"	"she"	"declared"	" But fellow comedian Phyllis Diller, who hosted Berle-watching parties when she was an Ohio homemaker in the early '50s, had a different take. In a 1994 Arts &AMP; Entertainment Network profile of Berle, she declared, ``Milton Berle doesn't even have to die to leave a legacy.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"111340"	"he"	"declared"	" Last Friday, while besieged by Israeli tanks at his Ramallah headquarters, Arafat invoked martyrdom when he said he would rather die then surrender. He preferred, he declared, to be a ``martyr, martyr, martyr.'' He called for millions of ``martyrs'' to march on Jerusalem. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"111940"	"he"	"declared"	" He ended by denying he is a ``cold businessman who lacks a heart.'' Instead, he declared, ``their political machine robs our children of their future and breaks my heart.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"112991"	"he"	"declared"	" In his final speech on Thursday, Lieberman stuck to the environmental argument.

"114299"	"he"	"declared"	" But it's clear he has not lost his enthusiasm for the law or his students.

"115019"	"he"	"declared"	" In 1984, he declared, ``months after I came here as archbishop, I was relying upon those assisting me to handle this adequately, and I was relying on their discretion in terms of the medical expertise.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"116494"	"she"	"declared"	" Kircher's books were the first ``great coffee-table books,'' she said. People bought them to prove they were learned, to show that they were part of the international network of reading and writing. They didn't read so much as look at the pictures. One fan cut Kircher's picture out of a book and meditated on it to calm himself. Another fan kept sending Kircher chocolate in order to remain friends with him. Kircher's most ardent fan, a nun in Mexico City, decided to try to make herself over in the mold of Kircher's favorite goddess, Isis, the mother of gods, the ruler of heaven and earth. She also transformed Kircher's name into a verb. Kircherizing, she declared, is making connections among things. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"116603"	"he"	"declared"	" Doctrines of sovereign immunity provide ``no shield'' for state officials accused of depriving citizens of a federal right, said Judge Gilbert S. Merritt, of the 6th Circuit. Thus, he declared, the intended beneficiaries of the Medicaid program may sue state officials in federal court to enforce their right to benefits. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"118581"	"he"	"declared"	" Clark Kerr, who was president of the University of California from 1958 to 1967, had a witty send-off when the state's board of regents _ upset by the rising tide of protests on campus _ removed him from office. He was leaving as he came, he declared, ``fired with enthusiasm!'' What Kerr did not know at the time was that he was also fired, at least in part, by the FBI. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"119499"	"he"	"declared"	" Taro Kono is a 39-year-old member of the Diet, Japan's parliament, an eldest son with a reputation for occasional prodigal impertinence. He once upbraided his father in the Diet over Japan's relations with the United States concerning nuclear weapons. When eyebrows rose, he declared, ``I didn't go into politics to make him prime minister.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"120246"	"he"	"declared"	" Almost no one anticipates an aftermath to the '90s as disastrous as the Great Depression, certainly not Bernstein. Despite the multiplying troubles, nearly every forecaster is betting on a recovery. ``You can call it a tentative recovery, but I would not go any further,'' said Chris Varvares, president of Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis. And turning to a metaphor, as forecasters so often do, he declared, ``We are experiencing a little turbulence on takeoff, but the flight will be fine.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"

"120865"	"he"	"declared"	" The Transportation Security Administration, which is also responsible for improving security for railroads, seaports and the trucking industry, was authorized with great fanfare.

"127929"	"he"	"declared"	" In the mid-1980s he abruptly quit this successful career, saying that American political campaigning had turned ``sick.'' It had become oversimplified and too negative, he declared, and often paid for by unidentifiable backers. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"128074"	"they"	"declared"	" There's little evidence, Corrigan and his sports medicine colleagues say, that the additive smorgasbord made athletes faster, higher, or stronger.

"143159"	"he"	"declared"	" During the Republican convention, Krugman, an op-ed columnist for the (beginitalic)Times(enditalic), spoke at a forum of the like-minded at New York University.

"153374"	"they"	"declared"	" We see not the slightest indication that Congress meant to give that power to the Executive Branch, wrote the panel, made up of federal appeals court judges.

"154730"	"he"	"declared"	" Some people -- including, sadly, some of our colleagues in the news media -- have mistakenly assumed that a reporter and a news organization place themselves above the law by rejecting a court order to testify.

The book included news photographs of Henry Ford, Sir John Gielgud, Alger Hiss and others whose looks were not improved by small collars, and photographs of Jimmy Carter and Edward I.

"160462"	"he"	"declared"	" J. Carlo Cannell, a successful San Francisco hedge fund manager, owned 14 percent of BKF as of Oct. 31.

The iceberg did not loom over the ship like a frosty landmass, she declared, and the band did not play on the deck as the ship was sinking.
