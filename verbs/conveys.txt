"111959"	"it"	"conveys"	" Hairston has an annoying tendency to have his characters talk around subjects; seemingly for literary purposes he makes them more oblique than they need to be, and the credibility of this is suspect. But if he is not yet attuned to the way people speak, he knows absolutely how people feel. In spite of the play's many imprecisions, it conveys, with exciting authenticity, life on a frontier that has long been real but is only now visible. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020409.0224 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-SUNDAY-EARLY-BUDGET) </DATELINE> <TEXT> The New York Times News Service has scheduled the following entertainment/arts and travel articles for release April 14, 2002.

ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS  (Coded `e')  COVER STORIES  FILMS-TO-BROADWAY (Undated) _ Once upon a time, Hollywood depended on Broadway to supply its musical hits: between 1961 and 1968, ``West Side Story,'' ``My Fair Lady,'' ``The Sound of Music'' and ``Oliver!'' all won Oscars for best picture. Today, the opposite is true. Theater people are going ever more resolutely to the movies, drawn by the need for new stories. The appeal is also economic: Producers have found that a connection with a movie is often a marketing bonanza. By Peter Marks.  ETHAN-HAWKE (New York) _ Unlike some actors who achieve prominence and then fade away, Ethan Hawke has displayed resilience and versatility. Some of Hawke's long-simmering projects are coming to fruition. On Friday, Hawke, 31, makes his directorial debut with a stylistic film called ``Chelsea Walls,'' and his second novel, ``Ash Wednesday,'' is finished and on its way to a July printing. By Dana Kennedy.  CULTURAL-EXPORTS (New York) _ For decades Austria has bankrolled national treasures like the Vienna State Opera, the Vienna Philharmonic and the Salzburg Festival. Now, on Friday, it will dedicate its towering new American outpost, designed by the Austrian-born architect Raimund Abraham. The building contains galleries, a library and a theater as well as offices. But it doesn't stand alone; it's only the latest in a flurry of gestures by foreign nations to show their cultural bona fides in New York. By Michael Z. Wise.  FILM  FILM-SAM-JACKSON (Undated) _ The word ``no'' surely exists in Samuel L. Jackson's vocabulary, but he clearly prefers to say ``yes.'' Since his 1981 film debut, he has appeared in, by unofficial count, 63 feature films. Though often grouped with Denzel Washington and other middle-aged black actors, his career is much more like Michael Caine's: long and prolific, and full of popcorn pictures and arty gems; parts starry and supporting; characters posh and raffish; performances thoughtful, subtle and spot on. By Jamie Malanowski.  FILM-FRENCH-MURDERS (Undated) _ The story of Christine and Lea Papin, sisters and servants in France who murdered their mistress and her daughter in 1933, has inspired a host of literary and cinematic interpretations. A new film about the crime, ``Murderous Maids,'' directed by Jean-Pierre Denis, opens on Friday. By Leslie Camhi.  THEATER  BROADWAY-ELEPHANT-MAN (New York) _ On Sean Mathias, the director of ``The Elephant Man,'' a revival opening on Broadway on Sunday night. By Sylviane Gold.  MUSIC  MUSIC-DIRTY-DOZEN (Undated) _ The release of ``Medicated Magic'' commemorates the 25th anniversary of the Dirty Dozen's formation, an occasion the band will also mark with a week of performances in New Orleans at the end of April. That the celebration will be joyous goes without saying. It will also be well deserved, for the Dirty Dozen's contribution to American music is inestimable. Working almost single handedly, the group revived and rejuvenated a style that was nearing extinction. By Mac Randall.  MUSIC-GOGOL-BORDELLO (New York) _ Few bands embody the idea of culture-juggling 21st-century globalism better than Gogol Bordello. Made up of immigrants and refugees from Russia, the Ukraine and Israel, the members converged in New York four years ago with a mission to make a new kind of rock 'n' roll that reflected their struggles and their peripatetic heritage. Their sound is raucous, sweaty, tuneful and recklessly vibrant, like the punk and Gypsy music that inspired them. By Ben Sisario.  MUSIC-CLASSICAL-CALM (Undated) _ Classical music seems to be defining itself as music of respite and evenness, perhaps largely in distinction to the frenzy and keen edge of rock. Two hundred years ago, when Beethoven was writing, the European Classical orchestra would have provided some of the loudest and most intense sonic experiences available, exceeded in that respect only by the battlefield. But heard on record or over the radio, at low volume and with dynamic compression _ and in a world now so full of clamor _ the same music becomes gentle, a comfort. By Paul Griffiths.  TELEVISION  TV-LANCE-LOUD (Undated) _ In the landmark 1973 PBS documentary series ``An American Family,'' Lance Loud interacted with the medium so profoundly that it shaped his destiny, and he its. As the first star of reality television and the first obviously gay teen-ager asked into many American homes, he was, in his own way, as much a trailblazer as Milton Berle. By Richard B. Woodward.  TV-JIMINY-GLICK (Undated) _ Jiminy Glick may not be the only lunatic to have his own talk show. But as ``Primetime Glick'' settles comfortably into its second season, he has established himself not only as television's most inspired madman, but also as the most unpredictable and hilariously uninhibited comic creation to hit TV since Bart Simpson was in diapers. By Hal Hinson.  ART/ARCHITECTURE/ANTIQUES  ART-GUGGENHEIM (Las Vegas) _ The two Las Vegas satellites launched last year by the Guggenheim Museum will disappoint those who have been hoping to have their faith restored in the mother institution. Far from bringing art to the masses, the Guggenheim has brought corporate branding to an anticipated public that has thus far failed to show up. But the enterprise has delivered a crisis for the museum itself: The Guggenheim's efforts to remake itself in the image of a multinational corporation have reached the point of collapse. By Herbert Muschamp.  BESTSELLERS, CHILDREN'S-BESTSELLERS and PAPERBACKS moved on Monday, April 8.  TRAVEL  (Coded `t')  TRAVEL-SONOMA (Undated) _ Napa's sister valley, Sonoma, offers a Queen Anne-style inn with Japanese touches and unhurried tastings. By Hilary de Vries.  With photo  PRACTICAL-TRAVELER-BACKPACK (Undated) _ Backpacking is meant to be liberating. With your possessions on your back, you can leave cities and cars behind, or simply have your hands free to hold a latte. Yet a poorly fitting or overloaded bag can make a backpacking excursion feel more like a forced march. To enjoy backpacking, you need to follow three principles: Choose the correct bag, keep the load light and distribute the weight properly. By Susan Catto.  RESTAURANTS-LONDON (Undated) _ In London, a group of chefs from Australia and New Zealand have imported their refreshingly open-minded philosophy of using local ingredients and interweaving elements of East and West to create their own unique style of cooking (but please don't call it fusion). By Nina Simonds.  With photo  HAWAII-TOURISM (Undated) _ Because tourism in Hawaii is almost totally dependent on visitors who arrive by plane, few other destinations appeared so vulnerable to the downturn in air travel after Sept. 11. But the industry has managed a gradual recovery; one travel agent attributed the trend to the array of bargains and the desire to escape to a place that's warm, exotic and on American soil. By Edwin McDowell.  TRAVEL-NEWMEXICO (Undated) _ On my frequent trips to New Mexico I usually choose between two types of lodging: a tent when I want to hike and explore the outdoors, and a hotel or bed-and-breakfast when I want a comfortable bed with fine linens, a well-appointed bathroom, attentive service and good restaurants nearby. I got the best of both on a recent visit to Rancho de San Juan, 35 miles northwest of Santa Fe. By Kathryn Jones.  With photo  TRAVEL-BARGAINS _ Air fare and hotel promotions for destinations including Nevis in the Caribbean; the Montauk Yacht Club Resort and Marina on Long Island; Holiday Inn hotels; the Chesterfield Hotel in Miami; and the Galleria Park hotel in San Francisco.  TRAVEL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Items on Australia's Year of the Outback; the World's Largest Garden Party in Philadelphia; helmet rules for children who ski at the resorts of the Aspen Skiing Co.; an exhibit of the botanical works of three artists from Florence at the National Gallery of Art.
