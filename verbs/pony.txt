"9929"	"you"	"pony"	" CHER FITNESS: BODY CONFIDENCE ($19.95; $14.95 starting in January). Cher helped unleash the latest celebrity fitness video wave by being one of the first to enlist a professional trainer on her step-aerobics tape in 1991. Now she's back in her remarkable wardrobe -- Morticia Addams goes aerobic. The 38-minute dance section may take a few run-throughs to get down, and Cher will be happy to send you a set of giant rubber bands for the 45-minute body-sculpting workout. The music and dance steps have baby boomer appeal. At one point, Cher, hopping from one leg to the other, breaks into this mysterious chant: ``I pony, you pony, we all love the pony!'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"
