POLAND-JEWS-APOLOGY (Warsaw, Poland) _ Sixty years after as many as 1,600 Jews were killed in eight hours in a village in northeast Poland, the nation's president offered a strong apology on Tuesday: It was not Nazi soldiers, he affirmed, but ordinary Poles who beat, stabbed and, finally, burned their fellow villagers alive in a barn. ``For this crime, we should beg the souls of the dead and their families for forgiveness,'' he said. ``Today, as a man, citizen and president of the Polish republic, I ask pardon in my own name and in the name of those Polish people whose consciences are shocked by this crime.'' By Ian Fisher.  MIDEAST-HOMES-RAZED (Dateline to kum) _ Moving tanks and bulldozers into a Gaza refugee camp early Tuesday, Israel demolished Palestinian homes it said served as cover for gunmen, setting off one of the fiercest gun battles since a truce was declared a month ago. The action came a day after Israel destroyed 14 homes in a Palestinian refugee camp in East Jerusalem. The U.S. called the demolitions ``provocative.'' (Summary from wires) By Joel Greenberg.  WASHINGTON  (Will move in ``w'' news file.)  HOUSE-CAMPAIGN-FINANCE (Washington) _ House Republican leaders began an all- out drive Tuesday to persuade party members to oppose a sweeping bipartisan measure to overhaul the campaign finance law, as they looked to dispense with the issue quickly by this week to minimize any political fallout. Instead of urging a simple vote against legislation to ban the unlimited contributions known as soft money to the national political parties, Republicans were urging their members to support an alternate bill that would put some limits on such contributions. But the Republican bill would allow unlimited soft money donations to continue to flow to the state parties. By Alison Mitchell.  With graphic.  SALVATION-ARMY-GAYS (Washington) _ The Bush administration is considering a request by the Salvation Army to exempt religious charities that receive federal aid from local laws barring discrimination against homosexuals, a development that has outraged some civil rights groups and raised fresh questions about one of President Bush's top priorities. By Frank Bruni and Elizabeth Becker.  NATIONAL GENERAL  (Will move in ``a'' news file.)  NY-TERROR-TRIAL (New York) _ A federal jury in Manhattan said Tuesday that it had deadlocked on whether to impose the death penalty on a terrorist convicted in the 1998 bombing of the American Embassy in Tanzania, which killed 11 people. As a result, the bomber will be sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole. The verdict is the second in the embassy bombings case in which a terrorist who could have faced execution will instead be sentenced to life in prison. Two other terrorists convicted in May did not face execution, and will also receive life imprisonment. By Benjamin Weiser.  With photo.  NY-BUSH (New York) _ One hundred and seventy-one days after he was sworn in as president, George W. Bush paid his first visit to New York state on Tuesday, proposing ways to ease immigration restrictions and paying tribute to the late Cardinal John O'Connor. But Bush seemed less than delighted to be back in a state, no matter how briefly, that he lost by nearly 25 percentage points last November. By Adam Nagourney.  With photos, NYT1,2.  FINANCIAL  (Will move in ``f'' news file.)  BROKER-ETHICS (New York) _ Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. on Tuesday barred its research analysts from buying shares of the companies they cover. With its new policy, extending to the firm's worldwide operations, Merrill Lynch becomes the first major firm to go beyond some recent guidelines adopted by the brokerage industry. The move comes less than a month after Congress convened hearings on the conflicts of interest among big brokerage firms that bring securities public and publish mostly glowing research reports about the stocks. In recent weeks, the nation's top securities regulators have also announced that they will increase their scrutiny of the potential for biased research that these two brokerage firm activities create. By Gretchen Morgenson.  SCIENCE  (Will move in ``a'' news file.)  SCI-STEM-CELLS (Washington) _ Breaking a long-held scientific taboo against creating human embryos expressly for medical research, scientists at a Virginia fertility clinic announced Tuesday that they have mixed donated eggs and sperm and derived three new types of stem cells from the resulting embryos. The experiment, at the Jones Institute in Virginia, comes as President Bush is considering whether to approve federal funding for research on embryonic stem cells. But that work would involve excess embryos, kept in cold storage at fertility clinics, that would otherwise be discarded. The Virginia experiment, experts said, may be the first time anyone in the United States has created an embryo for the purpose of research. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.  SPORTS  (Will move in ``s'' news file.)  OLY-SUMMER-2008 (Moscow) _ Having arrived here as strong favorites to secure the 2008 Summer Games, leaders of the Beijing bid must now survive a peculiar 72-hour Olympic malady _ agony of the front-runner. Recent Olympic history is fraught with candidate cities that seemingly held a hefty advantage, only to fritter it away in the final days before members of the International Olympic Committee held their vote. Beijing is still perceived as the desired choice on Friday by a majority of the 119 voting IOC delegates. But the days before the vote are always anxious moments, what Francois Carrard, executive director of the IOC, calls a time of ``rumors, rumors, rumors, intoxication and manipulation.''

CHINA-U.S.-OLYMPICS (Washington) _ The Bush administration, uncertain that it could effectively oppose the Chinese bid for the 2008 Olympics, has decided to remain silent but in doing so has come to believe that there are positive gains for the United States if Beijing prevails, officials said Tuesday. A victory for China in the vote to be held Friday by the International Olympic Committee in Moscow on Friday, could make the Beijing government more hesitant to strike at Taiwan in the coming seven years, a senior administration official said.

By Ian Fisher.  CHECHNYA-REPRISAL (Assinovskaya, Russia) _ In the largest reprisal action against Chechen civilians this year, hundreds of Russian interior troops backed by helicopter gunships swept into this village and a neighboring one on July 3 and 4. They arrested 1,500 people, looted homes and vehicles and subjected male residents to beatings and torture with electric shocks from hand-cranked generators, said dozens of witnesses interviewed here and in Sernovodsk over the past two days. The large-scale ``mopping up'' operation followed two mine blasts on roads outside these villages that killed at least four Russian soldiers and wounded a number of others. By Patrick E. Tyler.
