Mandy Laderer isn't letting her fear of flying ground her these days. After 15 years of aerial abstinence, the New York fitness expert just returned from a flight to Florida with her husband. And now she's planning to take to the skies again, with upcoming flights to Florida and California.  But according to Laderer, the recent Valujet and TWA air accidents made it difficult for her to leave terra firma.  ``The TWA crash made me especially nervous because it happened so close to home,'' says Laderer, who lives on Long Island. ``My fear of flying is a fear of dying in a plane crash, and after I watched the coverage on TV, I became emotionally involved with the victims and their families.''  Laderer would be more comfortable about flying if the TWA accident investigation was completed.  ``Like everybody, I want to know what happened. If it turns out to be a missile or bomb, I won't be effected as much as if it's a mechanical problem or pilot error,'' she says.  But because her husband's business flight couldn't be put on hold until after the investigation, Laderer went to Florida despite her worries.  ``My husband was my motivation to fly. In the past, I'd promise to fly with him, and then at the last minute, I'd get cold feet. This time, I made up my mind, I wasn't going to let my fears of flying, or my nervousness about driving control me anymore.''  Laderer is not alone in her fears. Though there are no up-to-date or accurate statistics, the estimate, based on a 1980s study done by the Boeing Aircraft Corporation is 25 million Americans are afraid to fly. And certainly the ranks of white knucklers has swelled since the recent spate of air accidents and the ensuing media coverage.  However, the fear of flying isn't necessarily a fear of crashing. (OK, everybody is afraid of crashing!) According to phobia experts, aviaphobia is usually part of a ``Stop the world, I want to get off'' syndrome that can make an individual feel anxious and out of control around bridges, tunnels, elevators, trains, parkways and planes.  At first the sufferer worries that she can't control a flight, or traffic on a parkway. Then she worries about controlling her fear symptoms: the sweating palms, heart palpitations, nausea and dizziness. Soon, the fear of the fear symptoms begins controlling an individual's mobility.  ``The most difficult part of any flight, for people who fear flying, is the anticipatory anxiety an individual feels during the days or weeks before a flight,'' explains Dr. Martin Seif, a New York psychologist and phobia expert.  Seif says that after an air crash, a phobic flyer's worst case scenarios become even more terrifying because the fearful individual focuses on the media coverage of the crash, and then casts himself, like Mandy Laderer did, in the role of the victims or their families.  Psychologists report that the classic time to develop travel-related fears is between the ages of 18 to 30 years old, times of lifestyle change and flux. The changes can be positive _ graduation from college, starting a career, getting married _ and the traveler may never have had a bad flight. Yet this is the time when he starts to think, ``Everything is going great. It would be my luck if this plane crashed.''  If there is an actual crash, the traveler justifies his fears and uses the tragedy as a rationale to stop flying.  If you're afraid of flying now because of recent air accidents, here are some tips to help you get off the ground in time for your holiday and business flights:  _ Stop feeding your, ``See, I told you so _ planes crash!'' attitude by avoiding anything negative about aviation. Instead, focus on the fact that flying is by far the safest means of getting from point A to point B.  _ If you feel compelled to read about an accident, take positive action and feel less like a potential victim by writing to the airlines, newspaper or Federal Aviation Administration offering positive suggestions for change.  _ Stop asking friends who recently flew, ``How was your flight?'' You're practically asking for flight fright tales.  _ If you are unable to fly now, don't encourage a travel companion to take the train with you. If she does, she'll be giving tacit approval to your fears.  _ Avoid action and disaster films such as ``Speed'' (1994), ``Fearless'' (1993) and ``Executive Decision'' (1996). Action movies are based on ``what if'' fantasies of disasters, and you don't need any help there.  _ Don't allow superstitious thinking to feed your fears. Air crashes don't come in threes, and there's no personal irony in the fact that there was an air accident in Florida, and you're flying to Florida this winter.  _ When making airline reservations, identify yourself to the airline as a nervous flyer; request a nonstop, direct flight on a wide body plane such as a 747, DC-10 or Airbus whenever possible and select a seat toward the front of the plane, where you'll feel fewer bumps.  Ask for a passenger agent to meet you at the check-in, accompany you aboard the plane and introduce you to the flight crew.  _ Stop watching the nightly news on television. Instead, watch ``Seinfeld'' reruns. You'll go to sleep in a better mood, and you probably won't have as many bad dreams about flying. -0- SIDEBAR: YOUR DREAM P.A. ANNOUNCEMENT  If you're plane scared, here's what you'd like to hear on your next flight:  This is your pilot speaking. Today we'll be flying to Florida in 10 minutes. Our altitude will be two feet from the ground, with no bumps. The seat belt sign goes on when we serve the champagne, caviar and Belgian chocolates.  You'll be happy to hear that last night I was home with my wonderful wife of 25 years and my two adorable children. We ate dinner, and then watched the Disney Channel before going to bed at 9:30 p.m. I had a wonderful night's sleep.  Recently, I completed my monthly battery of physical, psychological and drug tests. I passed them with _ you will excuse the pun _ flying colors. I don't drink or smoke. I don't even wear glasses. My psychological profile shows one so-called fault _ I'm a perfectionist!  If you have advice for me during the flight, knock on the cockpit door. Maybe you'd like to sit in the cockpit and help me fly the plane. If you need fresh air during flight, just open a window. There's a button on your arm rest. And if for some reason during our flight you decide that you've had enough flying, just push the button on your armrest, and we'll land immediately and let you out. No hard feelings!  This is my last announcement. I don't use the P.A. during flight. If I wanted to talk, I'd be on Letterman. But I'm your pilot, so now I'll just shut up and concentrate all my attention on flying the plane.

By MAURA RHODES c.1996 McCall's (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  Rose Wagner is living the kind of life sitcoms are made of: At 41, the New York City resident has a devoted husband, a pampered pooch named Bosco and a quirky, satisfying job photographing people with their pets.  This is quite a change from 14 years ago when, soon after moving to Manhattan from Wisconsin, Wagner developed a relentless ease of the blues.  ``It was hard to focus and concentrate, and I was drained by the end of the day,'' she recalls. ``On weekends I preferred sleeping to taking a walk. It reached the point where I wasn't even up to going to the movies with my boyfriend.''  Wagner's tenacious dreary mood lingered _ for 12 long years. Despite it, she married, switched careers and adopted Bosco, all the while believing her glumness to be ``just the way I was.''  It wasn't until two years ago, while she was watching a television program about depression, that she realized she might need a medical boost to help her out of the doldrums. After seeing a psychiatrist, Wagner was diagnosed with a form of chronic mild depression called dysthymia (dis-THIGH-mee-uh), also known as dysthymic disorder.  Dysthymia, which means, literally, ``ill-humored,'' affects up to 5 percent of the population of the United States, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Most people diagnosed with dysthymia are between the ages of 15 and 54, and the malady is twice as common in women as it is in men, although this may be because women are more likely to report their symptoms, says Kay Redfield Jamison, a professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore.  Jamison is the author of ``An Unquiet Mind'' (Vintage, 1996), a book about her own battle with manic depression.  Yet, pervasive as dysthymia is, many who struggle with it spend years being misdiagnosed and mistreated simply because they mistake their symptoms for personal shortcomings or personality quirks.  ``Dysthymia causes you to think there's something wrong with your character,'' explains John C. Markowitz, an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Cornell University Medical College in New York City.  ``You're likely to think, `I'm just a bad person.''' WHEN YOU JUST DON'T HAVE ANY ZEST FOR LIFE  It wasn't until 1980 that psychiatrists began offering medical treatment for this disorder. That was the year dysthymia was classified as a form of depression, thanks to a major overhaul of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM (the criteria developed by the American Psychiatric Association to define mental illnesses).  According to the DSM, dysthymia is a depressed mood that occurs for most of the day, on more days than not, and persists for two years or longer.  In addition, at least two of these symptoms are present:  _ poor appetite or overeating;  _ insomnia or sleeping too much;  _ fatigue or low energy;  _ low self-esteem:  _ poor concentration;  _ difficulty in making decisions;  _ feelings of hopelessness.  While dysthymia is rarely incapacitating, ``it puts a glass ceiling on life,'' says Michael E. Thase, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. ``You're unable to enjoy yourself, have fun or experience pleasure. You may feel shy or embarrassed around others, and you procrastinate because you're afraid of failing or because you have no energy.''  ``You might not achieve your full potential at work, believing you're not being promoted because you don't deserve it,'' adds Kimberly A. Yonkers, an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry and of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. ``You may not get married, or you may not feel satisfied with your marriage.''  Given this broad and somewhat vague spectrum of symptoms, it's easy to see how dysthymia can go undetected. Often it takes a crisis to alert sufferers to the fact that they have a problem: Because they lack the self-esteem, energy or optimism needed to pull through hard times, as many as half of those who have dysthymia are driven to episodes of severe sadness when faced with significant adversity.  This compounds the illness, resulting in a situation called double depression.  Sandy Marincic, 33, of North Huntingdon, Pa., experienced this vulnerability when, within two years, she lost her live-in boyfriend, relocated because she had landed a new job, then lost the position.  Rotten as her luck had been, ``the worst part was I had to find another job, make decisions. I was paralyzed,'' she recalls.  While most people would have brooded for a few weeks, then started picking up the pieces, Marincic sank into a deep funk. Severely depressed, she finally answered an ad for a research study of antidepressants at the University of Pittsburgh and learned she was dysthymic.  ``I realized I had suffered from the blues all my life,'' she says. ``Thinking back I could remember only two periods during childhood when I actually felt good. I was lethargic and unhappy at my job. I accepted all this as my lot in life.''  Dysthymia can have a variety of causes. For some sufferers early adversity _ say growing up with an alcoholic parent _ sets them up for depression. For others, a chronic disease, such as arthritis, may send them into a tailspin.  But for many, the predisposition to depression may be biological.  ``There's likely to be a family history of depression,'' Thase says. GOOD NEWS: HELP IS ON THE WAY  Fortunately, medication is effective for relieving the problem, and drug treatment for dysthymia is usually straightforward. The various kinds of antidepressants work their mood magic in different ways, usually by affecting the neurotransmitters that help to regulate emotional expression.  Among the drugs used for dysthymia are such old-timers as imipramine and desipramine (both sold under a variety of trade names) and newer drugs such as Zoloft (sertraline) and Prozac.  ``They're all effective,'' Markowitz says. The major differences between antidepressants are their side effects, which range from nausea, dry mouth and weight gain with imipramine to sexual dysfunction (including a lack of libido and an inability to reach orgasm) with Zoloft and Prozac, he explains.  Recently, researchers have been experimenting with ways to minimize sexual repercussions, including lowering dosages and advising that people take weekend ``holidays'' from their medication.  They are also developing new antidepressants _ for example, Serzone (nefazodone) _ that are less likely to cause sexual problems. Still, it often takes some trial and error to ascertain the drug and dosage that are both effective and comfortable for the patient.  While antidepressants rarely become permanent residents in the medicine chest, people must continue taking them for a period of time after they feel better, to prevent a relapse.  Many antidepressant users experience long-term improvement after having taken the drug for four to six months; others need more than one course of treatment.  In addition to medication, psychotherapy _ talk sessions with a trained professional _ can also banish the blues. But of the over 250 kinds of psychotherapy currently practiced, only two seem to work for dysthymia, according to Markowitz. Both deal with the here and now rather than delving into a patient's childhood.  ``Interpersonal therapy'' aims at improving your mood by helping you learn to cope with events that are fueling your current depression, such as the loss of a loved one. ``Cognitive therapy'' teaches you to recognize and correct negative thinking. Your therapist may ask you to write down self-defeating thoughts you have, so you can review the list together.  As researchers continue to find out which drugs and forms of psychotherapy are most successful, treatment for dysthymia may become even more effective. But the mere fact that the condition now has a name is providing great relief to countless women who otherwise would have chalked up their misery to nonexistent shortcomings.  Instead, many feel as satisfied as Rose Wagner, who is ``happy, motivated and at peace.'' -0- SIDEBAR: DOWN TIMES: WHEN DEPRESSION IS MOST LIKELY TO HIT  There are a number of periods in a woman's life when she may be especially prone to feeling blue. Many of these coincide with reproductive events, explains Kimberly A. Yonkers, an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry and of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.  Experts believe estrogen and other female hormones influence the workings of the neurotransmitters that control moods. Here are the times when women (and girls) are mostly likely to find themselves battling different forms of depression.  _ Menstruation: Three percent of woman experience a recurring condition known as premenstrual dysphoric disorder.  Characterized by severe tension or irritability and/or difficulty concentrating, all of which affect the ability to function, this condition commences every one to two weeks before each period and subsides within a few days after a woman's period has begun.  _ Childbirth: About 5 percent to 10 percent of women will experience minor depression while pregnant. In addition, the ``maternity blues'' _ minor mood swings _ hit approximately 80 percent of new mothers during the first three days after giving birth.  A smaller number of women experience a more serious and persistent condition called postpartum depression, which is marked by a low mood, obsessive worrying about the baby, panic attacks, trouble sleeping, flagging energy and feelings of guilt.  _ Menopause: It is during the five years immediately before or after a woman stops menstruating that she is most likely to experience depression. Estrogen treatment may help.

Mandy Laderer isn't letting her fear of flying ground her these days. After 15 years of aerial abstinence, the New York fitness expert just returned from a flight to Florida with her husband. And now she's planning to take to the skies again, with upcoming flights to Florida and California.

You're practically asking for flight fright tales.  _ If you are unable to fly now, don't encourage a travel companion to take the train with you. If she does, she'll be giving tacit approval to your fears.  _ Avoid action and disaster films such as ``Speed'' (1994), ``Fearless'' (1993) and ``Executive Decision'' (1996). Action movies are based on ``what if'' fantasies of disasters, and you don't need any help there.  _ Don't allow superstitious thinking to feed your fears. Air crashes don't come in threes, and there's no personal irony in the fact that there was an air accident in Florida, and you're flying to Florida this winter.  _ When making airline reservations, identify yourself to the airline as a nervous flyer; request a nonstop, direct flight on a wide body plane such as a 747, DC-10 or Airbus whenever possible and select a seat toward the front of the plane, where you'll feel fewer bumps.  Ask for a passenger agent to meet you at the check-in, accompany you aboard the plane and introduce you to the flight crew.  _ Stop watching the nightly news on television. Instead, watch ``Seinfeld'' reruns. You'll go to sleep in a better mood, and you probably won't have as many bad dreams about flying. -0- SIDEBAR: YOUR DREAM P.A. ANNOUNCEMENT  If you're plane scared, here's what you'd like to hear on your next flight:  This is your pilot speaking. Today we'll be flying to Florida in 10 minutes. Our altitude will be two feet from the ground, with no bumps. The seat belt sign goes on when we serve the champagne, caviar and Belgian chocolates.  You'll be happy to hear that last night I was home with my wonderful wife of 25 years and my two adorable children. We ate dinner, and then watched the Disney Channel before going to bed at 9:30 p.m. I had a wonderful night's sleep.  Recently, I completed my monthly battery of physical, psychological and drug tests. I passed them with _ you will excuse the pun _ flying colors. I don't drink or smoke. I don't even wear glasses. My psychological profile shows one so-called fault _ I'm a perfectionist!  If you have advice for me during the flight, knock on the cockpit door. Maybe you'd like to sit in the cockpit and help me fly the plane. If you need fresh air during flight, just open a window. There's a button on your arm rest. And if for some reason during our flight you decide that you've had enough flying, just push the button on your armrest, and we'll land immediately and let you out. No hard feelings!  This is my last announcement. I don't use the P.A. during flight. If I wanted to talk, I'd be on Letterman. But I'm your pilot, so now I'll just shut up and concentrate all my attention on flying the plane.

By MAURA RHODES c.1996 McCall's (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  Rose Wagner is living the kind of life sitcoms are made of: At 41, the New York City resident has a devoted husband, a pampered pooch named Bosco and a quirky, satisfying job photographing people with their pets.  This is quite a change from 14 years ago when, soon after moving to Manhattan from Wisconsin, Wagner developed a relentless ease of the blues.  ``It was hard to focus and concentrate, and I was drained by the end of the day,'' she recalls. ``On weekends I preferred sleeping to taking a walk. It reached the point where I wasn't even up to going to the movies with my boyfriend.''  Wagner's tenacious dreary mood lingered _ for 12 long years. Despite it, she married, switched careers and adopted Bosco, all the while believing her glumness to be ``just the way I was.''  It wasn't until two years ago, while she was watching a television program about depression, that she realized she might need a medical boost to help her out of the doldrums. After seeing a psychiatrist, Wagner was diagnosed with a form of chronic mild depression called dysthymia (dis-THIGH-mee-uh), also known as dysthymic disorder.  Dysthymia, which means, literally, ``ill-humored,'' affects up to 5 percent of the population of the United States, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Most people diagnosed with dysthymia are between the ages of 15 and 54, and the malady is twice as common in women as it is in men, although this may be because women are more likely to report their symptoms, says Kay Redfield Jamison, a professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore.  Jamison is the author of ``An Unquiet Mind'' (Vintage, 1996), a book about her own battle with manic depression.  Yet, pervasive as dysthymia is, many who struggle with it spend years being misdiagnosed and mistreated simply because they mistake their symptoms for personal shortcomings or personality quirks.  ``Dysthymia causes you to think there's something wrong with your character,'' explains John C. Markowitz, an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Cornell University Medical College in New York City.  ``You're likely to think, `I'm just a bad person.''' WHEN YOU JUST DON'T HAVE ANY ZEST FOR LIFE  It wasn't until 1980 that psychiatrists began offering medical treatment for this disorder. That was the year dysthymia was classified as a form of depression, thanks to a major overhaul of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM (the criteria developed by the American Psychiatric Association to define mental illnesses).  According to the DSM, dysthymia is a depressed mood that occurs for most of the day, on more days than not, and persists for two years or longer.  In addition, at least two of these symptoms are present:  _ poor appetite or overeating;  _ insomnia or sleeping too much;  _ fatigue or low energy;  _ low self-esteem:  _ poor concentration;  _ difficulty in making decisions;  _ feelings of hopelessness.  While dysthymia is rarely incapacitating, ``it puts a glass ceiling on life,'' says Michael E. Thase, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. ``You're unable to enjoy yourself, have fun or experience pleasure. You may feel shy or embarrassed around others, and you procrastinate because you're afraid of failing or because you have no energy.''  ``You might not achieve your full potential at work, believing you're not being promoted because you don't deserve it,'' adds Kimberly A. Yonkers, an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry and of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. ``You may not get married, or you may not feel satisfied with your marriage.''  Given this broad and somewhat vague spectrum of symptoms, it's easy to see how dysthymia can go undetected. Often it takes a crisis to alert sufferers to the fact that they have a problem: Because they lack the self-esteem, energy or optimism needed to pull through hard times, as many as half of those who have dysthymia are driven to episodes of severe sadness when faced with significant adversity.  This compounds the illness, resulting in a situation called double depression.  Sandy Marincic, 33, of North Huntingdon, Pa., experienced this vulnerability when, within two years, she lost her live-in boyfriend, relocated because she had landed a new job, then lost the position.  Rotten as her luck had been, ``the worst part was I had to find another job, make decisions. I was paralyzed,'' she recalls.  While most people would have brooded for a few weeks, then started picking up the pieces, Marincic sank into a deep funk. Severely depressed, she finally answered an ad for a research study of antidepressants at the University of Pittsburgh and learned she was dysthymic.  ``I realized I had suffered from the blues all my life,'' she says. ``Thinking back I could remember only two periods during childhood when I actually felt good. I was lethargic and unhappy at my job. I accepted all this as my lot in life.''  Dysthymia can have a variety of causes. For some sufferers early adversity _ say growing up with an alcoholic parent _ sets them up for depression. For others, a chronic disease, such as arthritis, may send them into a tailspin.  But for many, the predisposition to depression may be biological.  ``There's likely to be a family history of depression,'' Thase says. GOOD NEWS: HELP IS ON THE WAY  Fortunately, medication is effective for relieving the problem, and drug treatment for dysthymia is usually straightforward. The various kinds of antidepressants work their mood magic in different ways, usually by affecting the neurotransmitters that help to regulate emotional expression.  Among the drugs used for dysthymia are such old-timers as imipramine and desipramine (both sold under a variety of trade names) and newer drugs such as Zoloft (sertraline) and Prozac.  ``They're all effective,'' Markowitz says. The major differences between antidepressants are their side effects, which range from nausea, dry mouth and weight gain with imipramine to sexual dysfunction (including a lack of libido and an inability to reach orgasm) with Zoloft and Prozac, he explains.  Recently, researchers have been experimenting with ways to minimize sexual repercussions, including lowering dosages and advising that people take weekend ``holidays'' from their medication.  They are also developing new antidepressants _ for example, Serzone (nefazodone) _ that are less likely to cause sexual problems. Still, it often takes some trial and error to ascertain the drug and dosage that are both effective and comfortable for the patient.  While antidepressants rarely become permanent residents in the medicine chest, people must continue taking them for a period of time after they feel better, to prevent a relapse.  Many antidepressant users experience long-term improvement after having taken the drug for four to six months; others need more than one course of treatment.  In addition to medication, psychotherapy _ talk sessions with a trained professional _ can also banish the blues. But of the over 250 kinds of psychotherapy currently practiced, only two seem to work for dysthymia, according to Markowitz. Both deal with the here and now rather than delving into a patient's childhood.  ``Interpersonal therapy'' aims at improving your mood by helping you learn to cope with events that are fueling your current depression, such as the loss of a loved one. ``Cognitive therapy'' teaches you to recognize and correct negative thinking. Your therapist may ask you to write down self-defeating thoughts you have, so you can review the list together.  As researchers continue to find out which drugs and forms of psychotherapy are most successful, treatment for dysthymia may become even more effective. But the mere fact that the condition now has a name is providing great relief to countless women who otherwise would have chalked up their misery to nonexistent shortcomings.  Instead, many feel as satisfied as Rose Wagner, who is ``happy, motivated and at peace.'' -0- SIDEBAR: DOWN TIMES: WHEN DEPRESSION IS MOST LIKELY TO HIT  There are a number of periods in a woman's life when she may be especially prone to feeling blue. Many of these coincide with reproductive events, explains Kimberly A. Yonkers, an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry and of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.  Experts believe estrogen and other female hormones influence the workings of the neurotransmitters that control moods. Here are the times when women (and girls) are mostly likely to find themselves battling different forms of depression.  _ Menstruation: Three percent of woman experience a recurring condition known as premenstrual dysphoric disorder.  Characterized by severe tension or irritability and/or difficulty concentrating, all of which affect the ability to function, this condition commences every one to two weeks before each period and subsides within a few days after a woman's period has begun.  _ Childbirth: About 5 percent to 10 percent of women will experience minor depression while pregnant. In addition, the ``maternity blues'' _ minor mood swings _ hit approximately 80 percent of new mothers during the first three days after giving birth.  A smaller number of women experience a more serious and persistent condition called postpartum depression, which is marked by a low mood, obsessive worrying about the baby, panic attacks, trouble sleeping, flagging energy and feelings of guilt.  _ Menopause: It is during the five years immediately before or after a woman stops menstruating that she is most likely to experience depression. Estrogen treatment may help.
