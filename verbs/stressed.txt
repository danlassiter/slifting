O'Connor called the crimes uncovered in Chicago, ``horrendous'' and said they have had a negative impact on the image of show horsing.

"62988"	"they"	"stressed"	" Agreement on the issue isn't necessary here, they stressed, adding that they don't fear that the gold sales plan will be forced through here against their opposition.

"78332"	"she"	"stressed"	" The findings, she stressed, do not show that exercise works better than drugs, only that it should be an option. This is especially true when the side effects from medication might be unpleasant, while the side effects of exercise _ increased self-esteem, higher energy levels, improved appearance _ are positive, even welcome. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"
"79368"	"he"	"stressed"	" Specifically? Holtz said coaches are expected to make sure athletes ``are perfect gentlemen,'' ``good students,'' ``grow up to be men,'' and ``win.''

"84423"	"he"	"stressed"	" Gingrich's own lawyers soon followed in his defense. Randolph Evans spoke long of how ``the context'' was being overlooked in the speaker's admitted misdeeds, with his actions unintentional, he stressed, and in no way comparable to the political ``money laundering'' that Democratic critics have been accusing him of. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"86046"	"he"	"stressed"	" Sharing a stage convincingly with other actors, he stressed, is just as important as creating a character. ``It's a very bitter pill for the actor to swallow,'' he once said, to be told that another actor ``is more important than you are, but you have to believe this. It must become your religion.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"

"92136"	"he"	"stressed"	" Even though Powell is prepared to put forward a proposal, a senior official suggested that the spotlight was now on the administration far more than it would like. Thus, he stressed, it was up to the Israelis and the Palestinians to take advantage of the move, and Powell should not be blamed if it fails. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"
"93393"	"she"	"stressed"	" ``If there is anyone who people think deserves execution, McVeigh probably personifies it,'' said Jane Henderson of Equal Justice USA, which has proposed a moratorium on death penalties. But, she stressed, McVeigh is hardly typical. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"

"100909"	"he"	"stressed"	" There is much work to be done, Mayar said. Afghans must draft a new constitution, disarm the people and reconstruct.

"102129"	"he"	"stressed"	" The spore discovered in Seymour should not make people afraid to open mail, Rowland said at the news conference. The letter was sent six weeks ago, he stressed, making the likelihood of further anthrax cases more remote each day. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"103079"	"he"	"stressed"	" Happily, there was no need for burkas, turbans or the leather jackets of the Russian mafia. Even with the dozen singers and a chorus of 120 decked out in the rich colors of period costumes, the political choices on offer _ a known past facing an uncertain future, religious fundamentalism resisting secular power, conservatism versus reform _ seemed very much of the moment. Serban, wary of overdrawing historical analogies, did draw a line. The opera's Old Believers who opposed westernization, he stressed, were not the Taliban. But he was nonetheless struck by how czarist Russia's struggle with the future resembled today's confused world, ``where progress in the West leads nowhere, where divisions between peoples grow, where religious fanaticism is on the rise.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"

"108177"	"he"	"stressed"	" With the election hours away, it appears now that efforts are under way to mend fences with Simon's camp. But Parsky told The Chronicle that _ contrary to published reports _ neither he nor Rove have had any contact or meeting with Simon's camp on behalf of the White House yet. Nevertheless, he stressed, ``the White House will support whomever the nominee is.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"

"117991"	"she"	"stressed"	" Right now, though, her mind is on her current stop. Los Angeles, she stressed, has always been a ``very special place. I feel obligated in my heart to L.A. because the first big thing I did after Gianni's death was the Fire &AMP; Ice Ball,'' she recalled of the 1998 Revlon/UCLA Women's Cancer Research Program gala that raised $1.8 million. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"120990"	"he"	"stressed"	" But, he stressed, prison time will act as a deterrent only if ``the manpower and resources'' are committed to prosecution. ``We found, in dealing with the aftermath of the savings and loan scandals in the 1980s, that additional resources enabled us to greatly expand our efforts. Resources are the answer.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"

"127481"	"he"	"stressed"	" The horror show, which Steinbrenner watched on television because, he stressed, he had to handle personal matters ``that were more important than baseball,'' caused him to morph into a scout and a sleuth. The Angels were so devastating on offense that Steinbrenner wondered if David Wells had tipped off some of his pitches on Bloody Saturday. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"131972"	"she"	"stressed"	" Often, Seltzer said, the law is unclear. In one letter that appears on the site (www.chillingeffects.org), for example, a lawyer from Paramount Pictures warns a Star Trek fan in Peoria, Ill., that the plot synopsis of ``Star Trek: First Contact,'' he posted on his Web site constituted copyright infringement. In fact, Chilling Effects' legal team explains that this is not necessarily true. Since its Web site was inaugurated four months ago, Seltzer said, Chilling Effects has received 450 letters (including some, she stressed, from users who had clearly been breaking the law). </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"

"137349"	"he"	"stressed"	" The majority of cluster investigations done by public health departments at the request of concerned citizens turn out not to show an excessive amount of cancer, Delclos said.

"143561"	"he"	"stressed"	" If you have fluorescent lighting, be sure to use a daylight or full spectrum bulb, Quattrocchi said.

"144267"	"he"	"stressed"	" Poland will reduce its contingent from the start of 2005 and will discuss subsequent reductions, Belka said during a speech to Parliament.

"146296"	"he"	"stressed"	" Rumsfeld said his words of caution and even criticism of efforts to create a new national intelligence director to control budgets and the flow of intelligence were offered early in the debate.

"146747"	"he"	"stressed"	" What consumers need to understand, he stressed, is that it's sometimes all right to give out your Social Security number if you know whom you're dealing with or if you initiate the transaction, such as calling an opt-out number. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"148853"	"he"	"stressed"	" Gannon Boyd, a son of F.X. Toole (who died in 2002), said that his father suffered throughout his life from heart trouble and had strong feelings about not wanting to live in a reduced state. But, he stressed, it was Toole's personal choice, not something he preached for other people. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"149993"	"he"	"stressed"	" Of course, any decision would be completely within the discretion of the parole board, said Robert Owen, an adjunct law professor and co-director of the Capital Punishment Clinic at the University of Texas School of Law. Consideration for parole, he stressed, does not guarantee that an inmate will be released. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"150528"	"he"	"stressed"	" It is factually untrue that the current system is unfair to blacks, said the caucus chairman, Representative Mel Watt, Democrat of North Carolina. Moreover, he said in an interview, it is insulting because it is based on the assumption that life expectancy will continue to be shorter.
