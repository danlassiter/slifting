"2961"	"he"	"argues"	" Uwe Reinhardt, an economist at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School, adds an ominous note to the debate about whether incipient market forces are indeed taming cost inflation.

Grubart Brief 6. But this is not fatal criticism. This Court has not proposed any radical alteration of the traditional criteria for invoking admiralty jurisdiction in tort cases, but has simply followed the lead of the lower federal courts in rejecting a location rule so rigid as to extend admiralty to a case involving an airplane, not a vessel, engaged in an activity far removed from anything traditionally maritime. See Executive Jet, 409 U. S., at 268-274; see also Peytavin v. Government Employees Ins. Co., 453 F. 2d 1121, 1127 (CA5 1972) (no jurisdiction over claim for personal injury by motorist who was rearended while waiting for a ferry on a floating pontoon serving as the ferry's landing); Chapman v. Grosse Pointe Farms, 385 F. 2d 962 (CA6 1967) (no admiralty jurisdiction over claim of swimmer who injured himself when diving off pier into shallow but navigable water). In the cases after Executive Jet, the Court stressed the need for a maritime connection, but found one in the navigation or berthing of pleasure boats, despite the facts that the pleasure boat activity took place near shore, where States have a strong interest in applying their own tort law, or was not on all fours with the maritime shipping and commerce that has traditionally made up the business of most maritime courts. Sisson, 497 U. S., at 367; Foremost, 457 U. S., at 675. Although we agree with petitioners that these cases do not say that every tort involving a vessel on navigable waters falls within the scope of admiralty jurisdiction no matter what, they do show that ordinarily that will be so.

Penguin, $10.95.   This novel is a tale of marital hypocrisy in which Ira Holloway, a man of about 35, betrays his wife not only by seducing other women but also by drawing away from her the love of the couple's young son. Presented as Ira's sexual history, it is ``a shape-shifting narrative that lingers in the reader's moral consciousness and memory,'' Jane Smiley said here last year.   JOSEPHINE: The Hungry Heart   By Jean-Claude Baker and Chris Chase. Adams, $12.95.   Josephine Baker, the alluring singer and dancer who faced racism in American society but became the toast of France in the 1920s, is the subject of this ambivalent biography. She emerges as a talented, determined, and brave woman who could also be childish, manipulative, and dishonest. Jean-Claude Baker, who was taken under the performer's wing when he was a boy and later adopted her surname, tells the story with Chris Chase, a professional writer. Last year, our reviewer, Mindy Aloff, praised the book's ``rhetorical fluency and narrative techniques,'' adding that Baker's ``legend is dismantled with a vengeance, yet ... her humanity is affirmed.''   THE BALTIC REVOLUTION: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and the Path to Independence   By Anatol Lieven. Yale University, $15.   In a revised and updated edition, the author examines the ethnic nationalism of these former Soviet states and its implications for the West. Such a political climate, he argues, fostered the drive for autonomy but also gave rise to authoritarian new governments. His ``sensitive account'' succeeds in ``raising questions, sharpening our vision, and forcing us to reconsider our notions,'' Liah Greenfeld said here in 1993. The future of the former Soviet Union is also explored in the newly revised RUSSIA 2010: And What It Means for the World, by Daniel Yergin and Thane Gustafson (Vintage, $13). Analyzing studies conducted by Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm, the authors imagine four possible scenarios: economic collapse, a military dictatorship, miraculous prosperity, or civil war. In 1993, our reviewer, Serge Schmemann, said that the work is like ``a sophisticated board game, challenging the reader.'' Two books about the dark side of the Soviet past have also been reissued. THE UNQUIET GHOST: Russians Remember Stalin, by Adam Hochschild (Penguin, $12.95), features interviews with both perpetrators and victims of the dictator's repression, as well as their descendants. The result is ``a perceptive, intelligent book demonstrating that the significance of the gulag transcends the confines of one country and one generation,'' Paul Goldberg said here last year. STALIN AGAINST THE JEWS, by Arkady Vaksberg, translated by Antonina W. Bouis (Vintage, $13), discusses the regime's murderous anti-Semitism, which was disguised by giving Jews empty appointments and meaningless awards. Last year, one critic said it ``draws much important new information to the surface.''   THE GRANDMOTHERS' CLUB   By Alan Cheuse. Southern Methodist University, $10.95.   Ordinary life proceeds in extraordinary ways in this novel, which concerns a group of elderly women who discuss the fates of the generations they've spawned. At its center are Minnie Bloch and her son, Manny, a rabbi. It is ``a bitter, brilliant series of songs, heartless and tender,'' Jerome Charyn said here in 1986.   ON LOOKING INTO THE ABYSS: Untimely Thoughts on Culture and Society   By Gertrude Himmelfarb. Vintage, $12.   Post-modern academia is under attack in these seven essays, which underscore the dangers of espousing ``value-free principles'' and regarding morality as a variable to be manipulated. Last year, our reviewer, Michael Howard, said: ``They are unashamedly and enjoyably bellicose, and their succinct form makes them all the more effective.'' Miss Himmelfarb's 1968 collection, VICTORIAN MINDS (Ivan R. Dee, $16.95), has also been restored to print. In this intellectual history, she analyzes the philosophies of thinkers ranging from Edmund Burke to John Buchan. ``She is always sharp, and often original,'' John Clive said here.   THE FLIGHT OF PETER FROMM   By Martin Gardner. Prometheus, $15.95.   Is religious belief justified, and if so, what kind? These are the questions posed by the author, whose main characters, a lapsed Pentecostal divinity student and his skeptical Unitarian teacher, dramatize the possible answers. In 1973, our reviewer, Martin Levin, called the book ``a brilliantly illuminating metaphysical novel.''   THE PAINTED ALPHABET   By Diana Darling. Graywolf, $12.   Myth and magic blend in this tale of a Balinese peasant who travels into the mountains with his wife and niece, seeking enlightenment through the teachings of a holy man. Based on a traditional Balinese dance drama, the novel ``is a vastly entertaining story, told with warmth, humor, and wisdom,'' Edward Hower said here in 1992.   SILK HOPE, NC   By Lawrence Naumoff. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $11.   When two sisters inherit the family farm, their reactions illustrate the different ways of regarding home: as a refuge to preserve or as an encumbrance to flee. Last year, our reviewer, Linda Barrett Osborne, found the novel ``irresistible ... a love note to the American past.''   DEADLINE   By Gerry Boyle. Berkley, $4.99.   A burned-out newsman leaves New York City for Maine, where he is to edit a small mill town's weekly paper. Instead of peace, he finds murder and corruption. This is ``a bone-cracking first novel'' that ``strongly conveys that stark terror of isolation,'' Marilyn Stasio said here in 1993.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950305.0024 type=story > <DATELINE>  (BC-ECON-CALENDAR-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"

Playing his time-honored games with labeling, Mailer still coyly insists that ``Oswald's Tale'' is ``most certainly not fiction.''

By MARY ANN TAWASHA c.1995 Omni magazine (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Number of public elementary schools in the United States: 59,680.  Number of year-round elementary schools in the United States: 1,508.  Number of mandatory public extended-year schools in the United States: 1.  That one is Brooks Global Studies Extended-Year Magnet School in Greensboro, N.C.  What's the difference between year-round and extended-year schools? Most year-round schools merely reorganize the traditional, 180-day school calendar, while extended-year schools (such as Brooks) literally extend the year by providing more days of instruction.  This extension means that by the end of their elementary school careers, Brooks' students will have one extra year of education under their belts. Tony Meachum, Brooks' principal, describes it this way: ``We give you 30 more reasons to like us because we give you 30 more days a year.''  Julia Anderson, deputy director for the National Education Commission on Time and Learning, says the extra month of instruction provides additional learning opportunities that contribute to Brooks' success.  The federal government directed the commission to conduct an examination of the relationship between time and learning. The nine-member group released a report in April 1994, ``Prisoners of Time,'' which concluded that, ``Learning must become the fixed goal. Time must become an adjustable resource.''  More schools such as Brooks are needed if American students and teachers expect to ever ``break out'' of the constraints of time, according to the commission. Change is inevitable, Anderson says, and schools are going to be forced to modify their programs accordingly. ``I think that we're finally realizing that we can no longer allow students to fail at the rate that we have been.''  While the commission cited Brooks as a benchmark in education, Frederick Morrison, head of the psychology department at Loyola University in Chicago, selected Brooks as the basis of his research in educational reform.  Morrison launched his study on the effects of an extended-year program on average elementary school children when Brooks first opened its doors in 1991. Julie Frazier, a Ph.D. candidate and Morrison's assistant, started the research project _ aimed at comparing Brooks' students' academic achievements to those of students who attended traditional schools _ by administering standardized tests to each group.  After three years, the team found that Brooks' students did ``significantly better'' in areas of reading, general knowledge, math and vocabulary than ``a stringently matched control group of traditional students.''  Morrison says, ``Young children, even kindergartners and first-graders, are making twice the progress, in terms of raw score, than kids in traditional programs.'' The 30 extra days make a difference.  Morrison explains, ``The summer layoff is a critical period of achievement loss, and school-year extension helps to reduce and, in some cases eliminate, that loss.''  Anderson feels that extended-year programs are just one of the ways that schools can make better use of time. Other recommendations include a more flexible time schedule and longer school days. She says the commission has received tremendous response to the report from such groups as the Education Committee and the National Education Association.  So why aren't there more schools like Brooks? ``I think the biggest barrier is financial,'' Anderson says. A study by the North Carolina Public School Forum found that lengthening the school year to 200 days in all North Carolina schools _ still 10 days fewer than Brooks _ would mean spending an additional $180 million by the year 2001.  Jo Ann Norris, associate executive director for the forum, says that kind of money makes state legislators wary of initiating new programs statewide. She says, ``More instruction means more staff and salaries. That's where your dollars are.''  While Meachum understands the reasoning, he questions the logic: ``In the long run, what's really more important? Dollars ... or the future of our children?''

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) By ROBERT M. PATTON (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Until recently, most research into contraception focused on the woman's reproductive system. But many women are frustrated with the options available to them. What's more, they don't feel they should have to bear the lion's share of responsibility _ and risk _ for preventing pregnancy.  While women's contraceptive options include IUDs, diaphragms, foams, creams, pills and other newer choices such as Norplant implants and Depo Provera, an injected synthetic hormone, men have been limited to condoms and sterilization.  Now researchers are making an effort to find cheap, practical contraceptive alternatives for men. By the end of the century experts in contraception research expect a safe male contraceptive to be on the commercial market.  Here's what's currently in the works. TUMMY RUBS AND NASAL SPRAYS  One of the most effective drugs being considered as a male contraceptive is a salve to be rubbed on a man's stomach. Used daily, the salve raises the blood level of two male sex hormones _ testosterone and estradiol _ tricking the pituitary gland into shutting down sperm production.  Dr. Larry L. Ewing, professor of reproductive biology at Johns Hopkins University, has conducted 12 years of tests which so far suggest that the proportion of men reaching azoospermia _ or zero sperm production _ is about 90 out of 100.  Other novel male contraceptives being tested include:  _ ULTRASOUND. Researchers in Missouri are conducting tests on a high-frequency device that, when briefly placed against a man's scrotum, lowers his sperm count. It is said to be painless and effective for up to two years.  _ NASAL SPRAYS. Research is being conducted in Sweden on a nasal spray that contains natural hormones that suppress sperm count without suppressing the libido.  _ ELECTROSTATIC `JOCK STRAPS.' In Egypt, polyester athletic supporters or ``jock straps'' are being tested with a view to increasing scrotum temperatures and setting up electrostatic forces that will weaken or kill sperm.  While chemical or hormonal contraceptives may fulfill many criteria of the perfect male contraceptive, one drawback is that they can dampen sexual drive.  Contraceptives shouldn't effect one's ``urge to merge,'' says Dr. Gabriel Bialy, chief of the contraceptive development branch of the National Institutes of Health. They should be ``fast-acting and non-toxic and act in a post-testicular mode _ after the sperm has left the testicles. And fertility should return promptly after the drug's discontinuance.'' INHIBIN  Inhibin, a natural body substance found in semen, satisfies all Bialy requirements. It seems to work by suppressing a hormone _ follicle-stimulating hormone, or FSH _ that promotes sperm production.  Created in the testicles, it tells the pituitary gland that the body has produced enough FSH, and the gland responds by shutting down sperm production.  In lab studies in Germany and India, sperm count as well as motility were drastically reduced in lab animals, and full fertility returned at the end of one year. It the future, men may be routinely vaccinated with inhibin in the same way that children are vaccinated against childhood diseases.  The pituitary gland plays the most important role in human reproduction because it secretes the hormones that control reproductive activity in the gonads. Located at the base of the brain, it is often called the ``master gland.''  Tests currently being conducted in France under the auspices of the World Health Organization (WHO) involve weekly shots of testosterone. At a high dosage, this hormone overwhelms the pituitary gland, which stops stimulating the testicles to produce sperm.  More than 50 men in France have received such injections with no negative side effects and an effectiveness rate of 99 percent (compared to 97 percent for the birth-control pill, 94 percent for the diaphragm and 88 percent for the condom).  On another front, a recently identified class of neurohormones that occurs naturally in the brain is showing promise. LHRH, for luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, stimulates the pituitary gland to release other hormones that trigger the testes to produce sperm. An injection of an LHRH antagonist can suppress the production of sperm; high doses are said to ``down-regulate'' the pituitary.  ``There is no question that such compounds work,'' Bialy says. ``Though LHRH normally has a libido-damping effect, the libido seems to return to normal levels when testosterone is also administered.'' Research is now being done on a non-peptide antagonist that can be taken orally and will be inexpensive to produce. THE `WHAT-ME-WORRY?' PILL  Researchers in China say they have developed a male birth-control pill that is 100 percent effective in preventing conception. Called Gossypol, it is derived from cottonseed oil. While normal sperm count is 300 million to 500 million per ejaculate, Gossypol is said to depress sperm count to the point where fertilization of the female egg becomes impossible.  But what works in China may not be applicable elsewhere. For some reason hormone-based contraception is more effective in both China and India. No one knows why, but males in those countries show much higher positive response rates to such compounds than caucasian males. THE CONDOM  It takes at least seven years and $15 million for an experimental drug to be developed, tested and approved in the United States. That's why most research into male contraception focuses on non-drug alternatives such as barrier contraceptives (condoms) or reversible sterilization techniques. Surprisingly, sterilization is the most widely used birth-control method for both men and women in the United States.  As for condoms, because of the virulence of the AIDS epidemic, the number of men using them continues to rise. Current research is aimed at producing a condom that is biodegradable, eliminating the problem of disposal; has a built-in anti-viral (read anti-AIDS); and is made of a material such as polyurethane that is thinner than latex, thus increasing sensation.  Because it is more difficult to kill or suppress millions of sperm than to neutralize one egg, research into female contraception has far outdistanced efforts to find a safe and effective male contraceptive. It is estimated that only 10 percent of the yearly funds allocated to birth control are funneled into male-contraception research.  ``More men would take responsibility for family planning if they had support and encouragement and could get birth-control methods easily,'' says Moira Gallen, of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.  Meanwhile, with the meager resources available the search for the perfect male contraceptive continues, with organizations such as the Rockefeller Foundation and Planned Parenthood contributing funding, and the National Institutes of Health and the WHO overseeing the research.  Dr. Henryk van Look, associate director of WHO's reproductive division, says, ``The outlook is promising for a male oral contraceptive to be on the market before the turn of the century.''  By the year 2000 van Look and other researchers expect that women will no longer have to bear the majority of responsibility for preventing conception. ``The question is,'' van Look says, ``will women trust men with such responsibility?'' c.1995 Robert M.

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Lolita Davidovich in a scene from ``Indictment: The McMartin Trial.'' By IAN SPELLING (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  The O.J. Simpson trial may be the high-profile case of the moment, but back in the '80s the case that was making headlines was the now-infamous McMartin Preschool trial.  It began in 1983 when the mother of a young boy enrolled at the Manhattan Beach, Calif., preschool accused Ray Buckey, a school employee, of sodomizing her son.  Initially, Buckey was arrested and released without being charged. Then the media got hold of the story and fanned the flames of controversy with sensational headlines and erroneous reports.  By early 1984, Buckey and other McMartin staffers (including his sister, mother and grandmother) had been indicted on more than 100 counts of child molestation.  Now, more than a decade later, the case that became the lengthiest (six years) and costliest ($16 million) in American history is coming to television as a movie. ``Indictment: The McMartin Trial'' will premiere May 20 on HBO.  Lolita Davidovich stars in the film as one of the trial's key figures: child-abuse therapist Kee MacFarlane, who taped interviews with children who told stories of sexual abuse, satanic rituals, animal mutilations and hidden tunnels and passageways at the school.  When the trial ended without a single conviction and without any concrete evidence to back up the children's stories, MacFarlane's controversial interviewing technique, which some considered virtual coercion, was publicly questioned.  Though Davidovich did not get a chance to meet McFarlane, she says she understands what the trial must have been like for the therapist.  ``In light of what's going on with the O.J. trial, I could see how even people who are pretty conscientious can get caught up in the frenzy, the paranoia of a situation,'' the actress explains during a phone conversation from her publicist's Los Angeles office.  ``They can make mistakes _ and not deliberately. I think MacFarlane was one of those people. She didn't have bad intentions and she wasn't evil, but she became the center of a tornado.''  The 32-year-old actress, who is best known for her performances in films such as ``Blaze'' (1989), ``Raising Cain'' (1992) and ``Cobb'' (1994), says that one of the most difficult parts of making ``Indictment'' was re-creating the scenes in which MacFarlane interviews children. The dialogue was extremely adult in nature and Davidovich was worried about the impact it would have on the young and impressionable child actors.  ``It was a very precarious and uncomfortable situation for me,'' she says. ``It was a delicate situation for the director and for all of us.  ``The kids were deliberately cast a little bit older than they appeared, so they could be a little more strong mentally and it would have some distance. I think those kids were sports.''  The actress is hoping the film will teach the public a lesson about dealing with children in a trial situation.  ``It's astonishing to me how naive we were about what children are capable of or not,'' she says with great conviction. ``The (prosecution's) rationale for these people being guilty was, `Well, kids don't lie.'  ``Now we know full well how little we actually know about the development of a child's imagination, how kids function. No one thought that fear or attention would make their imaginations go off, that being grilled for a couple of hours by a therapist would exhaust the kids and make them say whatever they were being led to say.  ``The fact that that was not addressed 10 years ago, that we were so naive to it, just shocks me. Now, of course, it's the opposite because we've become such an analytical society.''  Davidovich is also hoping ``Indictment'' will make people think about the power of the media and the ``scoop'' mentality that led to inaccurate or misleading information being aired. That, she argues, transformed accusation into implied guilt.  Of course Davidovich has become quite familiar with the media since entering the acting world.  Born in Ontario, Canada, to Yugoslavian parents, Davidovich says she was always ``emotionally and intellectually wired'' for an acting career, which she pursued immediately upon graduating from a Canadian high school.  After studying the craft in both Toronto and Chicago, she tackled bit parts in a few films, including 1987's ``Adventures in Babysitting.''  Davidovich got her big break at 27 when director Ron Shelton (now her boyfriend) cast her as the legendary stripper Blaze Starr opposite Paul Newman's Huey Long in the drama ``Blaze'' (1989).  Since then she has appeared in ``The Object of Beauty'' (1991), ``Leap of Faith'' (1992) and ``Intersection'' (1994), as well as the little-seen comedy-drama ``Younger and Younger'' (1994) in which she played a heavyset, 50-ish woman who died and came back as an increasingly younger and more beautiful ghost to haunt her philandering husband (Donald Sutherland).  ``I love watching people and, perhaps it's ironic, but I don't need to be the center of attention,'' she says. ``I prefer to disappear, to observe the ordinary mess of life and to play ordinary people.  ``When you spend a little bit of time watching people, you realize how fascinating and complicated we all are. My dream, of course, is to play more people like Penny Younger (from ``Younger and Younger'').  ``She was very unglamorous but had a radiance and history and such hope. To have ordinary people on the screen in this age of Guess (jeans) and Revlon is so important.''  Davidovich will next be seen in two big-screen efforts: the eagerly anticipated ``Now and Then'' (formerly ``The Gaslight Addition'') and ``For Better or for Worse.''  ``Now and Then,'' scheduled to open in October, is a comedy-drama that follows four girls (Gaby Hoffman, Thora Birch, Ashleigh Rogers and Christina Ricci) from childhood to adulthood (when they are played by Demi Moore, Melanie Griffith, Rita Wilson and Rosie O'Donnell).  ``That's just a cameo role,'' Davidovich says. ``I play Gaby Hoffman's mom, and I start looking and acting like Nancy Sinatra, which completely horrifies and disgusts my daughter.''  Though Davidovich says she hopes to someday portray a character who is ``thoroughly evil,'' she was happy to be able to try her hand at comedy in ``Now and Then'' and, especially, ``For Better or for Worse,'' in which she shares the screen with James Woods and ``Seinfeld's'' Jason Alexander.  ``It's an irreverent, wacky comedy,'' the actress explains. ``It was also Jason's directing debut, and he did a great job.  ``Jimmy and Jason are brothers and Bea Arthur is their mother. I'm married to Jimmy, but I fall in love with Jason.  ``It's just a fabulous comedy, a little different and offbeat. I hope it gets a chance to get out there and find an audience.'' c.1995 Ian Spelling  (Ian Spelling is a New York-based free-lance writer.) ------------------------------------------------- (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448; fax: 816-822-1444.)

"25214"	"she"	"argues"	" In her new book she focuses once again on power struggles within the Christian church as well as struggles between Jesus' early followers and their Jewish and pagan opponents. In describing these conflicts, she argues, the gospels and later Christian writings frequently used the apocalyptic language of cosmic battle to characterize their opponents as emissaries of evil. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"25404"	"he"	"argues"	" What's more, he argues, ``election news has become increasingly game-centered. Journalists tend to interpret the campaign as a strategic game rather than as a choice among competing platforms ... As a result, election news today, even when policy is being discussed, emphasizes strategy and tactics, winning and losing, manipulation and deceit.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"25616"	"he"	"argues"	" Armey also views the summit as a pivotal turning point in the Republican Party's transformation from second-class citizens to the dominant power in Congress.

"26790"	"he"	"argues"	" Technology, he argues, has only made matters worse, ``permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine.'' There is no way to reform the system, he contends, adding: ``We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"26791"	"he"	"argues"	" Much of the document is devoted to a discussion of what he calls the sources of social problems in modern life: overcrowded cities, the isolation of man from nature, the breakdown of traditional family and community values. A technological society, he argues, must crush those values, and especially human freedom, to sustain itself. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"26841"	"she"	"argues"	" American women, she argues, are an untapped, or at least an underutilized, competitive resource, held back by discrimination and other corporate practices that fail to value their contributions. Doesn't make sense, does it? Well, it probably does, but who wants to complain about angry white men on a holiday weekend? </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"27175"	"he"	"argues"	" The second disavowal is of what Lind variously calls ``the plutocracy,'' the ``white overclass,'' the ``oligarchy,'' which, he argues, has throughout American history struck a series of grand compromises, all of them aimed at maintaining its ascendancy in American life. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"27204"	"he"	"argues"	" Moreover, he argues, AIDS is only the ninth-leading cause of death in America but accounts for more federal financing than diseases that kill more people (an assertion not supported by Public Health Service figures). </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"27800"	"he"	"argues"	" In front of the policemen, he was a preacher, and scientific data were his Book of Revelation. The commitment to health, he argues, is a ``fitness conversion.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"27911"	"he"	"argues"	" But Robert Greenstein, executive director of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, estimates that tighter procedures already in place have cut this error rate in half.

"27993"	"he"	"argues"	" The consequences of waning articulateness, Shachtman notes, are serious indeed. He suggests that sloppy writing (or speaking) implies sloppy thinking, which in turn implies laziness and passivity, the perfect conditions, he argues, for the rise of demagogues and the decline of democratic values. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"28266"	"he"	"argues"	" In doing so, he argues, feminists and civil libertarians have played directly into the hands of conservatives, who have public opinion on their side. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"28807"	"he"	"argues"	" Newsletter subscribers must fend for themselves. ``You can't take everything you read as the gospel truth,'' said Carlton Lutts, who edits the Cabot Market Letter in Salem, Mass. But, he argues, if a newsletter's investment advice isn't sound, because the editor or publisher is recommending stocks or funds for the wrong reasons, the newsletter simply won't survive. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"

(HLW) By LAUREL GRAEBER c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  THE COLD WAR: A History  By Martin Walker. John Macrae/Owl/Holt, $14.  The author looks back on the conflict with some nostalgia: it helped maintain global stability, he argues, and encouraged economic growth. ``With lively prose and well-chosen anecdotes, he deftly traverses a half-century,'' David Callahan said here last year.  THE COLLECTED STORIES  By Grace Paley. Noonday/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $14.  Moments of recognition, love, remembrance, and regret fill these 45 stories, which span more than 25 years in the author's career. The characters, often Jewish New Yorkers, are revealed mostly through dialogue, recorded with an unfailing ear for the vagaries of self-expression. Ms. Paley's ``distinctive, sure-footed command of the short-story form brings to fictional material a quality that must be called poetry,'' our reviewer, Robert Pinsky, wrote in 1994. He added: ``By this I mean not mere verbal sauce ... but the ability of language to dance with playful, lordly authority about the contours of reality.''  THE ROOSEVELTS: An American Saga  By Peter Collier with David Horowitz. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $15.  Theodore and Franklin were both progressive political leaders, but they could not have been more different in their familial relations. The authors portray Teddy as authoritative but deeply devoted, Franklin as aloof, and Eleanor as just plain cold. The book ``offers vivid and persuasive analyses of their personalities,'' John A. Garraty said in these pages last year, calling it ``truly first-rate popular history.'' Henry F. Graff, writing in the Book Review in 1979, found ``history on the grandest scale'' in FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT AND AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY, 1932-1945, by Robert Dallek (Oxford University, $18.95). Reissued with a new afterword, this study shows how F.D.R. guided international relations in a way unsurpassed by any other modern president. Graff praised its ``scope, clarity and judiciousness.''  SHEAR  By Tim Parks. Grove, $11.  A British geological consultant investigating the cause of a construction accident rocks the foundations of his own life through two unscrupulous love affairs. The result is an ``eerie, engrossing, and beautifully written suspense novel,'' David Sacks said here last year.  THE CIVILIZATION OF EUROPE IN THE RENAISSANCE  By John Hale. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $18.  Drawing on and enlarging upon the scholarship in Jacob Burckhardt's 19th-century study ``The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy,'' the author describes the sweeping social changes and emergent European identity that characterized the entire Continent between 1450 and 1620. Last year our reviewer, Theodore K. Rabb, called the book ``a sweeping and learned traversal of the age, full of choice details.'' The scope is even wider in A HISTORY OF CIVILIZATIONS, by Fernand Braudel, translated by Richard Mayne (Penguin, $14.95), which gives an overview of both Eastern and Western cultures. This ``effective and readable'' study is ``enlivened by Braudel's supple prose,'' David Walton wrote in the Book Review in 1994.  BLACKER THAN A THOUSAND MIDNIGHTS  By Susan Straight. Anchor/Doubleday, $11.  Darnell Tucker, a young black man in the author's fictional community of Rio Seco, Calif., doesn't have extravagant ambitions _ his love is fighting brush fires _ but even his modest dreams are imperiled by his impending fatherhood. ``Darnell's painstaking struggle to do the ordinary things becomes extraordinary in Ms. Straight's gifted hands,'' Rosemary L. Bray said in these pages in 1994. Anchor/Doubleday has also reissued UNDERSTAND THIS, by Jervey Tervalon ($10.95), a first novel that explores the underside of black life in Los Angeles's urban sprawl just after a drive-by shooting. The story moves ``with spirit, energy, and truthfulness,'' Michael E. Ross wrote here last year.  BALSAMROOT: A Memoir  By Mary Clearman Blew. Penguin, $9.95.  The history of the women in the author's family is bound up with the history of their land: the rough terrain of central Montana, where homesteaders led an often lonely existence. Ms. Blew reflects on the choices made by her Aunt Imogene, now elderly and senile, as well as on her own choices and her daughters'. In 1994, Susan Lowell said in the Book Review: ``It's hard to imagine a novel casting a longer shadow than this personal testament.'' A sometimes harsh life is also examined in FLAT ROCK JOURNAL: A Day in the Ozark Mountains, by Ken Carey (HarperSanFrancisco, $10), which records 24 hours of the seven years the author and his family spent without plumbing, electricity, or any of the conventional links to the wider world. ``You have to admire Mr. Carey for living so independently,'' Dulcie Leimbach wrote in the Book Review last year.  THE END OF VANDALISM  By Tom Drury. Fawcett Columbine, $11.  What begins as an ironic look at working-class lives in the Midwest becomes something far more poignant, our reviewer, Eric Kraft, said in 1994. This novel's characters, who include a local sheriff and his new wife, achieve a kind of grace through pain. It is as if the author ``had discovered the kind of informed sympathy for the living that the visitor to hell feels upon returning to the light,'' Kraft remarked.  AIR &AMP; FIRE  By Rupert Thomson. Vintage Contemporaries, $12.  Southern California in the 1890s is like a colonial outpost. It is here that Theophile Valence, a fictional disciple of Gustave Eiffel, tries to erect a prefabricated iron church. ``This often surreal, evanescent story takes careful reading, but the effort is well worth it,'' David Murray said here last year. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950723.0040 type=story > <HEADLINE> THE HOLIEST HOT SPOTS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-MIDEAST:HOLY-HOTSPOTS-NEWSWEEK-NYTSF) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"

"29862"	"he"	"argues"	" Dornbusch says that institutions are to blame, not the culture. ``Mexico does suffer from proximity to the United States,'' the world's most profligate economy, he jokes. Nonetheless, he argues, public policy could make a big difference. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"30471"	"he"	"argues"	" To make matters worse, the author adds, the blurring of words and deeds on the Internet tends to devalue the significance of physical reality.

"30595"	"he"	"argues"	" On the stump, Keyes liberally cites both the Bible and the Declaration of Independence, weaving theology and American history into one unified, if often idiosyncratic, political philosophy.

(HLW) By LAUREL GRAEBER c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  ALL'S FAIR: LOVE, WAR, AND RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT  By Mary Matalin and James Carville with Peter Knobler. Random House and Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $13.  The chief spin specialists of the 1992 presidential race explain how they managed not only opposing political campaigns but also their unorthodox courtship. The result is ``a him-and-her comedy, worthy of early Hepburn and Tracy,'' Gore Vidal wrote here in 1994.  CLOSING TIME  By Joseph Heller. Scribner Paperback, $13.  Appropriately, there are bombs and missiles, both military and verbal, in this novel, which features some of the surviving cast of Heller's most famous work, ``Catch-22.'' But now Yossarian and his former comrades from the earlier novel are decades older and fighting a war with mortality. Last year, our reviewer, William H. Pritchard, said: ``Rather than thinking of `Closing Time' as the sequel to `Catch-22,' I'd call it instead an independent creation in whose best parts the seriousness and the joking are inseparable, as they should be in art.''  PROTECTING SOLDIERS AND MOTHERS: The Political Origins of Social Policy in the United States  By Theda Skocpol. Belknap/Harvard University, $15.95.  Republicans weren't always suspicious of big government. According to the author, they were the originators of veterans' pensions and other benefits. What helped doom social spending, she argues, were the lack of a working-class consciousness and the hostility of the judiciary. Her book is ``a monumental study that will likely become a classic,'' Rosalind Rosenberg wrote in these pages in 1993. Harvard has also reissued PITIED BUT NOT ENTITLED: Single Mothers and the History of Welfare, 1890-1935, by Linda Gordon ($15.95), which demonstrates that Aid to Families With Dependent Children was always a flawed program. Intended to buttress the male-breadwinner household that was fast disappearing, it left women with unemployed husbands _ or no husbands _ little recourse. This is a ``skillfully written and well-documented account,'' Frank F. Furstenberg Jr. said in the Book Review last year.  NIGHTFATHER  By Carl Friedman. Translated by Arnold Pomerans and Erica Pomerans. Persea, $7.95.  A Dutch girl of 7 or 8 narrates the story of her family. Her father, a former prisoner in a concentration camp, cannot stop talking about his horrific past, a tendency that ironically perpetuates the long-defeated Nazis' power by making his children fear them. In 1994, our reviewer, Richard Burgin, said the author writes ``without ever compromising her compassion or extinguishing her sense of hope.'' The Holocaust's legacy is also explored in TO PAINT HER LIFE: Charlotte Salomon in the Nazi Era, by Mary Lowenthal Felstiner (Harper Perennial, $16), a biography of a young German Jew who died in Auschwitz, leaving behind her ``Life? or Theater?,'' a combination of drawings and text that captured her family's sad history as well as the period's. ``Ms. Felstiner tells this harrowing tale clearly and emotionally,'' Peter Gay wrote here last year.  RARE &AMP; ENDANGERED SPECIES: A Novella &AMP; Stories  By Richard Bausch. Vintage Contemporaries, $12.  In these nine pieces the author examines the human heart where it often displays its most puzzling vagaries: at home and among family. Bausch shows that his ``fidelity to the domestic is at times extraordinarily daring,'' Carol Shields said in these pages in 1994.  DREAMS OF TRESPASS: Tales of a Harem Girlhood  By Fatima Mernissi. Addison-Wesley, $12.  Raised in Morocco in the 1940s, the author comes from a family whose women often aspired to an equality that Islam denied them. Her reflections make for a ``wonderful and enchanting'' book, Adrienne Edgar wrote in the Book Review last year. Women continue to suffer injuries and indignities in many Moslem countries, writes Jan Goodwin in PRICE OF HONOR: Muslim Women Lift the Veil of Silence on the Islamic World (Plume, $12.95). From genital mutilation to uxoricide, she ``finds a list of horrors almost past belief,'' one critic said in 1994.  HENRY AND CLARA  By Thomas Mallon. Picador USA, $13.  Henry Rathbone and Clara Harris, an engaged couple, shared Abraham and Mary Lincoln's box at Ford's Theater. This fictional account attempts to explain why their own destiny was as dark and bloody as the president's. ``Mr. Mallon makes the grisly denouement feel inevitable,'' Valerie Sayers wrote here last year.  REASONABLE CREATURES: Essays on Women and Feminism  By Katha Pollit. Vintage, $11.  In 19 previously published pieces the author explores the relationship between the sexes and its impact on politics. Writing on subjects like abortion rights and date rape, she has produced a ``cunning and complex collection,'' Susan Shapiro said here in 1994.  BROTHERS AND SISTERS  By Bebe Moore Campbell. Berkley, $6.99.  The setting is a bank in Los Angeles just after the violence precipitated by the Rodney King verdict in 1992. Here men and women, some black, some white, pursue their lives and careers in an atmosphere fraught with tension. Last year, our reviewer, Elizabeth Gleick, praised ``Ms. Campbell's genuine attempt to address the complexities of race in the modern age.''  TUSCALOOSA  By W. Glasgow Phillips. Plume, $10.95.  The 22-year-old son of a psychiatrist falls in love with one of his father's hospitalized patients, a young woman who claims to be sane. The author displays ``keen psychological insights'' and ``an admirable gentleness in his prose,'' Jim Gladstone said in the Book Review in 1994. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950910.0056 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (AM-NYT-BUDGET) </DATELINE> <TEXT> (HLW)  FOR MONDAY AMs  Here are the top news stories in sight at this hour from The New York Times News Service for AMs of Monday, Sept. 11:  For questions about stories call (212) 556-1927.

HOLLAND-EUTHANASIA (Maastricht, Netherlands) _ For over a decade, the Netherlands has permitted inducing death for terminally ill patients who request it.

Nash.  NATIONAL  (Coded a)  THREESTRIKES-LIFE (Waterloo, Iowa) _ A look at the case of the first man sentenced to life under the federal ``three strikes and you're out'' law (attempted robbery of a supermarket). Prosecutors call Tommy Farmer, a two-time murderer and robber, a ``poster child'' for the three-strikes law. His lawyer calls the prosecution racist.  THREESTRIKES-FAMILY (Waterloo, Iowa) _ Tommy Farmer's father, a minister, and brother, a college professor, reflect on their family life, searching for the roots of crimes that earned the son of a respected, intact family, the dubious distinction of being the first person sentenced by a federal court to life in prison for being an incorrigable criminal.  THREESTRIKES-RAPP (Des Moines, Iowa) _ U.S. Attorney Stephen Rapp has more motivation than most prosecutors when it comes to putting repeat felons behind bars under the federal three-strikes law. While working for Sen. Birch Bayh in 1970 as a Harvard undergraduate, he was kidnapped, threatened with a gun, and left to die in the trunk of a car.

"36122"	"he"	"argues"	" But Curitiba and Kerala, he argues, can ease our understandable fear that living with less ``would plunge us into a world of poverty, disease, ignorance _ that it's either our life in all its detail or a grim, short, narrow life.'' Kerala, for example, has achieved life expectancies, infant mortality rates, levels of literacy and an atmosphere of liveliness that rival our own, but on one-seventieth of what we spend per capita. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"37331"	"he"	"argues"	" Richard C. Holbrooke, the chief American envoy to the Balkans, says the impasse over Russian participation does not trouble him unduly. A NATO peacekeeping force could operate in Bosnia without the Russians, he argues, although a Russian presence would clearly be preferable. But behind the scenes, the Clinton administration is engaged in a frenetic attempt to find a compromise with the Russians because, as one senior official said, ``It's vital that this be a cooperative effort on European security.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"

"37642"	"he"	"argues"	" No one is arguing that the MTA's intent was racist, Walcott says. But that's irrelevant.

What Goodman did do, he argues, was open up the field to ``generic astrology'' and pave the way for scores of imitators.

"40341"	"he"	"argues"	" ``The task of public policy should not be a balanced budget come hell or high water,'' warns William Nordhaus, a Yale economist.

"40533"	"he"	"argues"	" The American voters, his argument goes, have been duped by the Contract With America.

The Clintonites assumed, wrongly, he argues, that ``they could take the political capital the public had furnished for 40 years to oppose the Soviets and put it to uses they deemed more virtuous.'' But when faced with the real costs of healing Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia, the administration found it didn't have the public's support, so it balked, leaving it with three fiascoes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"

"42491"	"he"	"argues"	" Lardner, a longtime reporter at The Washington Post, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1993 for a series of articles on Ms. Lardner's death. Here, he extends his earlier investigation, attributing complacency, ineptitude and bungling to various judges, prosecutors and parole officers who, he argues, should have got Ms. Lardner's murderer off the streets before he could take her life. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
"42620"	"he"	"argues"	" In Vergara's view, interior design has become an important anchor in neighborhoods where there is little that might be construed as a public realm. In such surroundings, he argues, interiors ``bring order and coherence and beauty. Traditions persist, reinforcing identity.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
"43433"	"he"	"argues"	" This is nothing more than what philosopher Robert Nozick has described as ``the zig-zag of politics.'' Fairness and efficiency are different goals, he argues, and you can't pursue one wholeheartedly except at the expense of the other. Thus a majority of the electorate will swing back and forth slowly over time in preferring one agenda to another, eventually correcting one leg of expansion in order to pursue a another course. In practice, this is little different from sailing a boat: tacking one way for 40 years, only to come about and tack for a time the other. Proceeding toward a goal which nobody credibly can claim to be able to hit dead-on, everybody nevertheless remains committed to the journey _ and the ship. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"

CONGRESS-INTERNET (Washington) _ Congress has been to the future and discovered that it doesn't work _ at least not yet.

A key step was supposed to be electronic dialogue between members and constituents over the Internet.

The Pentagon wants to eliminate these citizen-soldiers or at least convert them into more useful support forces, but the powerful Army National Guard lobby and 29 state governors are resisting. By Eric Schmitt.  PRISON-RELIGION (PHiladelphia) _ In these days of budget cuts and increased prison populations, religious groups are lobbying state legislatures to reverse the current, seemingly unstoppable trend to expand prisons. The groups are making headway at the state level, asking legislators to reexamine how they send people to prison, for how long and at what cost. By Karen DeWitt.

By Richard Holmes.  ORLEANS-SLAYINGS (New Orleans) _ Murder rate in New Orleans dropped precipitously last year. We visit a housing project that had been the site of slayings.  ATLANTA-STADIUM (Atlanta) _ What will Atlanta do with old Fulton County stadium. Indeed, what will a lot of cities do with old stadiums, now that they are building new ones? Detroit, Washington and Milwaukee, among others, are riding the new stadium boom. By Ronald Smothers.  PUBLIC-SCHOOL-DECAY (Chicago) _ The nation's public schools are falling apart physically. Students in systems throughout the country are studying in buildings that are decaying and in some cases, condemned, according to a recent GAO report. By Peter Applebome.  DENVER-BEAR (Denver) _ Careful stewards of 99 years of tradition, Denver Zoo officials saw no need last spring to innovate with a videotape promoting their newborn polar bear twins, Klondike and Snow. ``We had never marketed an animal before _ initially, I was turned down,'' Angela P. Baier, the zoo's marketing director, recalled of her first attempt to launch a video when the cubs were 1-pound furballs. ``We weren't even sure it would sell. Originally, only 3,000 were produced, and with black and white covers.'' Today, as the year comes to a close, Zoo officials happily tot up the results of polar bear mania. By James Brooke.  CALIF-ELECTRIC-CARS (San Francisco) _ California has signalled that it intends to suspend its requirement for exhaust free cars until 2003.

(th) By LAUREL GRAEBER c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service  THE COLLECTED POEMS OF LANGSTON HUGHES Edited by Arnold Rampersad and David Roessel.Vintage Classics, $16.  Except for pieces written in high school and college, this volume presents the whole of Hughes' work: 860 poems, ranging from light and jazzy verse to passionate and sometimes polemical meditations. ``Langston Hughes is one of the essential figures in American literature,'' reviewer Henry Taylor wrote in 1994. He added, ``His stature demands a collection like this.''  ENDGAME: A Journal of the Seventy-Ninth Year By May Sarton. Norton, $12.95.  With strength of will but not without impatience, the author confronts the infirmities and illnesses that ultimately took her life last summer, when she was 82. She celebrates the small joys of her solitary existence while acknowledging that little time is probably left. ``Her passing thoughts bring insight and the shock of recognition that comes when one is in the presence of truth,'' Sue Halpern wrote in 1992.  Norton has also reissued two of Sarton's earlier journals. THE HOUSE BY THE SEA ($11), begun in 1974, records her painful yet reinvigorating move to the coast of Maine after many years in New Hampshire with her companion, Judith Matlack. Having lost her friend to a nursing home, Sarton both fears and embraces her newfound solitude. Her diary is ``to be pondered, savored, loved for the sheer beauty of the mind and spirit that inform it,'' one critic said.  Childhood and youth are the subjects of I KNEW A PHOENIX: Sketches for an Autobiography ($11), which offers tender portraits of Sarton's parents and the story of her own evolution as a poet. Aileen Pippett, writing in The New York Times in 1959, said, ``Every chapter is illumined by ... the response of an ardent mind and a generous heart.''  THE FEAST OF FOOLS By John David Morley. St. Martin's, $13.95.  The myth of Demeter and Persephone is echoed throughout this novel, which takes place in Munich, Germany, during carnival season in 1987. Stefanie, on the day of her wedding to an artist, disappears in the arms of an avaricious undertaker. The result is ``an entertaining and ingenious performance,'' Suzanne Ruta wrote last year. St. Martin's has also restored to print PICTURES FROM THE WATER TRADE: An Englishman in Japan ($12.95), Morley's fictionalized account of his youthful sojourn in Tokyo, where he found the general spirit of the country in its domestic details. He ``manages truly to enter the heart of a foreign territory,'' Anne Tyler wrote in 1985.  SEARCHING FOR MERCY STREET: My Journey Back to My Mother, Anne Sexton By Linda Gray Sexton. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $12.95.  This memoir of survival portrays the author's mother as a brilliant but tortured woman whose madness was forever interposed between herself and her family. Linda Gray Sexton's odyssey of understanding and forgiveness ``is never less than fascinating,'' Michael Vincent Miller wrote in 1994.  GREEN RIVER RISING By Tim Willocks. Avon, $5.99.  In a brutal Texas prison the warden deliberately provokes a bloody insurrection. Written by a British psychiatrist, this novel explores all the ravaged psyches involved. ``Dr. Willocks's ability to make this dark, doomed life comprehensible is astonishing,'' William T. Vollmann wrote in 1994.  GENDER AND DISCOURSE By Deborah Tannen. Oxford University, $10.95.  The author presents the linguistic research that is the basis for her best-selling books on the communication breakdown between men and women. The sexes belong to different cultures, she argues, and therefore misinterpret each other. Although reviewer Richard A. Shweder didn't entirely agree, she has ``eye-opening and entertaining things to say,'' he wrote in 1994.  THE TALE MAKER By Mark Harris. University of Nebraska, $12.  Rimrose is the writer of the title, a man whose story is followed from his days as a campus newspaper editor to his emergence as a novelist. The book also traces his relationship with his college nemesis, Kakapick. Their story offers ``wry wit and gentle ironies,'' Michael E. Ross wrote in 1994.  WITNESS TO FREEDOM: The Letters of Thomas Merton in Times of Crisis Selected and edited by William H. Shannon. Harvest/Harcourt, Brace, $16.  This final volume of Merton's correspondence reveals the strain between his vocation as a Trappist monk and his political convictions as an American. Asserting his independence during the Cold War, he continued to write against militarism even when forbidden by his order. The letters provide ``a solid basis for our understanding'' of the man, Alexandra Hall wrote last year.  UNDERTOW By Lynn Stegner. Basset Books, $12.  Anne McBain, a graduate student in marine biology, learns that she is pregnant by her lover, a married professor. Her crisis leads her to examine her troubled history with men, including her father. The result is a ``glowing first novel,'' Karen Ray wrote in 1993. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960123.0427 type=story > <HEADLINE> AMERICAN COMPANIES DEMAND CHINA ENFORCE PIRACY ACCORD </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> Washington, Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) (BC-CHINA-INTELLECTUAL-PROPERTY-BLOOM) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"

Moore's 1989 film, ``Roger &AMP; Me,'' made him a hero of sorts among working people, and there's an earnestness to his thoughts on corporate crooks, rich CEOS and the needs of poor Americans.

It isn't shooting fish in a barrel, but it clearly improves the odds. In Washington, for example, only 24 percent of hunters used bait or hounds in 1995, but they accounted for fully half of the 1,218 bears killed that year. Success rates depend on the terrain, though. In the deep woods of Michigan, where 96 percent of the black bears killed every year are hunted with bait or hounds, only 1,200 of the 5,000 hunters manage to bag their trophy, says hunting lobbyist Fred Myers: sometimes the hunters miss, often the bears don't show. And without bait, he argues, hunters would get so few bears that the creatures would have more and more run-ins with suburbanites and pets. But that has not been the case in Colorado, which in 1992 outlawed hounds and baiting.

He said the likelihood was ``very high'' that the state would be his next target.  As he sees it, the Colorado ban failed to pass because its backers came across as anti-immigrant rather than as interested in the most efficient way to teach English to children newly arrived in this country.  The best way, he argues, is to make English the only language of instruction, especially for younger children. He contends that state test scores go up when bilingual programs are thrown out and pupils learn entirely in English.  Unz dropped by The Denver Post to lobby his case. He said the ban proposed last year for Colorado deserved to pass but was crippled by ``the worst possible'' campaign and by the involvement of people who carried ``a lot of very negative baggage on this issue.''  Teachers involved in Colorado's bilingual programs say the programs are an efficient teaching tool. They vow to fight any ban proposed by Unz.  ``Our mission is to protect the language rights of all kids,'' said Silvana Carlos, president of the Colorado Association for Bilingual Education.  Unz also plans to focus on New York and Massachusetts.  BUTCHER IS A NAME; SO WHY NOT CPA?  Back in 1998, state Sen. Christopher J. Lauzen of Aurora, Ill., who is a certified public accountant, ran for state comptroller. He won the Republican primary but was defeated in the fall by a Democrat, Daniel W. Hynes.  Lauzen can't prove it, but he has a feeling that one of the reasons he lost in the general election was because his opponent in the primary, Harry Seigle, hammered him relentlessly about not being a ``licensed'' CPA. Illinois law requires state licenses only for CPAs who do audits, and, Lauzen says, most Illinois CPAs, himself included, don't do audits.  In any event, earlier this year, Lauzen filed a name-change petition with the local circuit court. Henceforth, he said, he wants to be known as Christopher J. Lauzen, CPA.  Such a moniker, he explained, ``might help make things a little clearer in the future,'' particularly during a re-election campaign. (He has recently lost some support in his suburban Chicago district.) Besides, he added, people have been naming themselves for what they do for thousands of years, as in Butcher and Baker and Weaver.  The court declined last week to play the name game. It said that CPA matters, whether certification, licensing or both, were best handled by the Illinois Board of Examination.  Lauzen is pondering whether to appeal.  MICHIGAN POLITICIAN TURNS BACK THE CLOCK  Before he was elected to Congress last year, Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., served six years in the state Senate. That service entitles him to draw a state pension once he turns 55.  How much?  Depends.  If his resignation date is put at Dec. 31, 2000, he will get $28,700 a year, plus 4 percent annual increases. But if it is put at Jan. 1, 2001, or later, he will get $41,900 a year, plus the 4 percent increases.  Why?  Because state senators got a 36 percent raise on Jan. 1, increasing annual salaries to $77,400 from $56,981. At the same time, the basis for computing retirement salaries increased significantly.  Rogers, who hails from Brighton, just west of Detroit, resigned his state Senate job on Jan. 3, the day he was sworn in as a congressman. That was logical enough, he argues. But Democrats have been on his case ever since, calling him greedy and accusing him of ``putting pocketbook before people.''  On Wednesday, he sent a letter to the secretary of the Michigan Senate asking that his resignation date be moved back to Dec. 31. ``I will not allow the issue of the date of my resignation to get in the way of the people's faith in the process or their elected representatives,'' he wrote. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010331.0146 type=story > <HEADLINE> A MOTHER SPEAKS OUT ABOUT HER SON'S EXECUTION IN NORTH KOREA </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> SEOUL, South Korea (BC-KOREA-EXECUTE-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200103.gz"

More and more states have tried to position themselves to play a deciding role in the selection process, and a political exercise that once lasted at least four months has been shortened to two months or so, sometimes less.  And if Terry McAuliffe, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has his way, the nominating season will be compressed even more for his party in 2004.  He wants more states than ever to hold early caucuses and primaries, to the point that the Democratic nominee the next time may be known by late February, or perhaps even sooner.  Why more front-loading, given complaints that the season already is so compressed that candidates with plenty of name recognition and plenty of money, or both, start with a huge, often insurmountable edge?  Will voters now be shortchanged even more in having time to observe and ponder choices?  McAuliffe says President Bush will be a tough opponent in 2004, and therefore Democrats need to settle on a challenger early, without a bitter, drawn-out nominating battle.  That way, he argues, his party can head toward fall fully unified and with plenty of time to make its case.  McAuliffe does not intend to usurp the traditional right of Iowa to hold the first caucuses and New Hampshire the first primary. His plan, approved last weekend by the Democratic National Committee's rules subcommittee and now subject to approval by the full committee (a good likelihood), calls for Iowa to kick off the season with its caucuses on Monday, Jan. 19, 2004, followed by the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, Jan. 27.  After that, however, any state could hold its caucuses or primary on any date it chose, beginning Tuesday, Feb. 3.  In last year's presidential election, the Democratic National Committee, responding to complaints that the nominating process was too front-loaded, tried to slow things down by ruling that five weeks had to pass after the New Hampshire primary before another primary or a round of caucuses could be held. Republicans had no such buffer.  Come 2004, McAuliffe says, Democrats should have no buffer either.  FEINGOLD CAMPAIGNS, BUT WILL HE RUN?  Speaking of White House hopefuls (presumed) Sen. Russell D. Feingold, D-Wis., gets the latest award for Most Peripatetic.  Feingold kicked off a speaking tour last week that, before it ends in early December, will take him to college and university campuses in Michigan, Iowa, Texas and North Carolina, not to mention untold coffee shops, street corners and assorted meet-and-greet spots in between.  Speaking at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, he defended his vote against Bush's anti-terrorism bill _ the only no vote _ and warned that it was important at this time of national crisis and danger to maintain civil liberties and avoid panicky curtailing of constitutional rights.  Would he seek the presidency?  ``I want to be a part of the process,'' he said. ``I want to see a more progressive and exciting ticket for our party in 2004.  As for himself, Feingold added: ``Quite frankly, I'm not even thinking about that right now.''  LOUISIANA APATHY: THE EBB AND FLOW  In Louisiana, there is bad political news and good political news, according to a recent poll.  The bad news is that 45 percent of the state's residents believe the state is so corrupt that their vote for change will not make any difference.  The good news is that a year ago 48 percent of the state's residents believed the state was so corrupt that their vote for change would not make any difference.  Such is the finding of the latest annual survey of the state conducted by the Wirthlin polling organization for the Council for a Better Louisiana, a private, nonpartisan group that seeks to promote the state.  Other findings:  Poll respondents gave state leaders a ``trust'' reading this year of 5.5 on an ascending scale of 1 to 10. The 2000 rating was 4.6.  Would poll respondents leave Louisiana if they had a chance?  Yes, said 31 percent. But a year ago, 37 percent answered yes.  How did the poll strike Louisiana politicians?  ``There have been some scandals which have confirmed suspicions of corruption over the years that are very hard to undo'' Rep. Mike Futrell, R-Baton Rouge, told The Advocate of Baton Rouge.  ``It might be more entrenched in Louisiana than anywhere else,'' he added.  SOME QUESTION THE RUN BY KATHERINE HARRIS  Katherine Harris, Florida's secretary of state and a center-stage player in last year's presidential vote dispute, has been the favorite to succeed Rep. Dan Miller since the day she said she would seek the Sarasota-area House seat he is vacating.  As the political pros see it, it is simply a matter of one well-known Republican replacing another well-known Republican in a district that is heavily Republican.  But wait.  Over the past week or so, there have been reports that some party members in the district are urging Miller to reconsider his decision to retire. He is being told that at a time of national crisis, the country needs to keep experienced legislators on the job in Washington and not send in new folks who are inexperienced or who may be lightning rods for, well, too much attention.  Miller insists he will stick with his retirement plans.  Harris is sticking with her plans, too. And she says that the big recount of last November's vote that was released last week by a media consortium ``vindicated'' the postelection judgments that she made. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20011117.0236 type=story > <HEADLINE> ALBERT TODD, 74, PROFESSOR AND TRANSLATOR </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> NEW YORK (BC-OBIT-TODD-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"102126"	"she"	"argues"	" In a merger with Compaq, Fiorina says, Hewlett-Packard will combine with a company that is pursuing much the same strategy and that has some overlapping and some complementary businesses. The merged company, she argues, will be more competitive against IBM in big data-serving computers and services, and better able to withstand the challenge from Dell in personal computers. The merger plan calls for a cut of 15,000 jobs, and cost savings of $2.5 billion annually by 2004. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"102160"	"he"	"argues"	" His case is one of dozens analyzed in ``Nigger,'' a new book by Randall Kennedy, an African-American scholar at the Harvard Law School. Kennedy recounts many unpleasant episodes, like the embarrassing use of the term by Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia in a public appearance last March. But Kennedy also considers the newer, more complicated use of ``nigger'' as a term of affection by young African-Americans and their well-meaning white friends. All in all, he argues, the new uses are gradually helping to exorcise the word's power as America's paradigmatic ethnic slur. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"102721"	"he"	"argues"	" Dalrymple is unrelenting. Poverty isn't caused by economics, he argues, but rather by a wildly dysfunctional _ and rapidly spreading _ set of values. And a blindly forgiving welfare state in which being ``nonjudgmental'' is the highest objective has helped create a permanent, irredeemable caste of victims, morally adrift and ineducable. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"

"103451"	"he"	"argues"	" Kivy's book, for example, shows just how malleable ideas of genius have been. He demonstrates that genius, far from inspiring a monolithic interpretation, has taken on different shapes and meanings in different periods. There are, he argues, two dominant myths about genius in Western culture. The first, advocated by Plato, is that the genius is a passive recipient of divine revelation. The second, long attributed to Longinus, is that a genius is a creator rather than a receiver. Kivy writes: ``For Longinus genius must seize the day; for Socrates the day must seize the genius.'' These are the two models of genius: the possessor (Longinus) and the possessed (Plato). </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"103897"	"he"	"argues"	" Abrams claims that ethnographic techniques translate smoothly from the jungles of Papua New Guinea to the modern American family. By studying how an American flosses his teeth in his own bathroom, he argues, one can arrive at the same understanding that an anthropologist might have when observing a Fore tribesman flossing his teeth with a reed. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"104123"	"he"	"argues"	" To Houser, comments about Nazis and Indian butchers sound like a lot of new-age babble. If monuments were erected only to honor saints, he argues, then there would be no monuments to Jefferson or Lincoln. There would be no Mount Rushmore or Vietnam Memorial. Houser said his goal with the Onate monument was to commemorate a human struggle, one characterized by great hardship and even greater cruelties, but one that indisputably and indelibly marks the culture of the New World. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"

"104742"	"he"	"argues"	" In his chapter ``Time, Space and Modernity,'' Lewis advances the provocative notion that one of the central elements of Western progress is the prevalence of polyphony _ not only as many voices proceeding harmoniously in music, but also as a capacity for complex interaction in sports, literature, science and ultimately politics. In Islamic civilization, he argues, the long absence of a precise measurement of time has precluded this critical synchronization. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"107374"	"she"	"argues"	" Some executives, like Corning's former chairman, Roger G. Ackerman, even allow ideas they don't like to percolate. They also encourage innovators to play around with their mistakes. The company, she argues, has a ``new-idea culture.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"107656"	"he"	"argues"	" Cassidy thinks that was a huge mistake. Booms, he argues, are inevitably followed by busts, and to prevent the latter you have to keep the former from getting out of hand. This is not brand-new criticism. In 1996 Lawrence Lindsey, then a Fed governor, now President Bush's chief economic adviser, was urging Greenspan to raise interest rates to blunt the rise of stock prices. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"107770"	"he"	"argues"	" In the March/April issue of Foreign Policy, Shlomo Avineri, a professor of political science at Hebrew University, issues a sobering Middle East reality check. If the 2000 Camp David talks didn't lead to peace, he argues, nothing will _ since there's no way Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon will offer the Palestinians more than did his predecessor, Ehud Barak, and there's no way Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, will accept less. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"108309"	"he"	"argues"	" It is possible, he argues, that extraterrestrials could invent radio technology _ the one indispensable entrance requirement to galactic society _ without ever developing the concept of an atom or of a DNA molecule. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"

"109895"	"she"	"argues"	" Harbury sued the government in 1996, contending that by repeatedly lying and refusing to tell her everything the U.S. government knew about Bamaca's case, American officials effectively denied her information she could have used to pursue his freedom through litigation.

This week's Science Times is devoted to articles on cancer:  SCI-CANCER (Undated) _ Over the past few years, investigators have found more and more hints that cancer is not what they had always thought it was. It has now become clear that while some cells look like cancers under the microscope and have growth patterns in the laboratory that are typical of deadly tumors, in some patients, they can stop growing on their own and revert back to normal. And that leaves doctors with a dilemma: The earlier they detect cells that look cancerous, the less certain they can be that what appears to be malignant actually is. By Gina Kolata.  SCI-CANCER-GENES (Undated) _ Until now, cancers have been categorized mainly by where they originate in the body _ breast cancer, colon cancer and so on. Doctors make further distinctions by looking at the cells under a microscope, leading to designations such as ``small cell'' lung cancer. But now cancers are starting to be characterized by their inner workings, by which genes and proteins make up the tumor. In the future, instead of saying a person has lung cancer, it might be said the person has cancer with particular genetic characteristics that just happens to be in the lung. By Andrew Pollack.  SCI-CANCER-MENTAL (Undated) _ As the science of cancer has evolved, so has our mental picture of it. In increasing numbers of cases, it is no longer considered an automatic killer. And so, in increasing numbers, people get cancer and then continue to live with it. How do they deal with the fears? Do they consider themselves cured? We talk to people who are dealing with the new view of cancer. By Natalie Angier.  SCI-CANCER-LOW-DOSE (Undated) _ Early studies show potential for a new way to treat cancer: steady low-doses of chemotherapy. The idea is to kill the blood vessels that feed the cancer cells.

JOAN-BAEZ (Alexandria, Va.) _ It is clear that Joan Baez's fans, who grew up with her clarion soprano on their stereos and tape decks and who remember her as an era-defining presence at antiwar demonstrations and civil rights marches, are more nostalgic than she is. Baez says she does not recall the 1960s particularly fondly.

"115217"	"he"	"argues"	" Now Wolfram is finally publishing his work, and his claims surpass the most extravagant speculation. He has, he argues, discovered underlying principles that affect the development of everything from the human brain to the workings of the universe, requiring a revolutionary rethinking of physics, mathematics, biology and other sciences. He believes he has shown how the most complex processes in nature can arise out of elemental rules, how a wealth of diverse phenomena _ the infinite variety of snowflakes and the patterns on sea shells _ are generated from seemingly trivial origins. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"115220"	"he"	"argues"	" Here is where matters get quite difficult very fast. Not only can complex designs and processes arise out of the simplest of rules, but, Wolfram asserts, simple rules actually lie behind the most sophisticated processes in the universe. Indeed, the universe itself, he argues, is generated by such rules. He presents an example of one cellular automaton program that produces such sophisticated patterns that it can act like a powerful computer. The details are highly technical, but this automaton can actually replicate other processes and patterns just as a computer can be turned into a word-processor one minute and a game machine the next. It has what are called ``universal'' properties. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"

"116282"	"he"	"argues"	" By giving the public some part of himself, he argues, he may not stand so far apart from the exemplar of an anchor. ``One of the things I remember about Cronkite is that he cried,'' Brown recalled. ``That he took off his glasses and wiped a tear when JFK was shot. His awe at men walking on the moon. Or that moment when he came back from Vietnam and said, `I have come to believe.' In some ways, he was omnipotent, the voice of Dad. But in other ways he was real and not afraid to be real. And in that tiny way, I feel like his descendant.'' </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020522.0229 type=story > <HEADLINE> THE WONDERS OF GENETICS BREED A NEW ART </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-EXHIBIT-GENOMES-$ADV26-ART-(TRIMS)-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"116877"	"he"	"argues"	" The problem with the decision is that the 11th Amendment does not apply. Sovereign immunity protects states, as the amendment says, against exercise of the ``Judicial power of the United States.'' But the Federal Maritime Commission is not a court; it is part of the executive branch. It is ironic, to say the least, to see Justice Clarence Thomas, an outspoken critic of judicial activism, explain for the court's majority why it is irrelevant that the Federal Maritime Commission does not exercise judicial power. What matters, he argues, is not the text of the amendment but the fact that a broader notion of sovereign immunity is ``embedded in our constitutional structure.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"117127"	"he"	"argues"	" Comprising doctors, lawyers, scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs and computer programmers _ almost everyone, in short, who is paid to think for a living _ the creative class now accounts for nearly 30 percent of the workforce, Florida writes in his new book, ``The Rise of the Creative Class: And How It's Transforming Work, Leisure, Community and Everyday Life'' (Basic Books). That's double what it was 20 years ago and 10 times what it was at the turn of the last century. Already the dominant economic group, he argues, the creative class is likely only to grow as what it produces _ ideas, information and technology _ becomes an ever larger part of the national economy. ``Creativity has come to be valued,'' Florida writes, ``because new technologies, new industries, new wealth and all other good economic things flow from it.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"

"117831"	"he"	"argues"	" In the past, he argues, such behavior was pointless _ and little indulged in. Who was going to mistake a scullery maid's daughter for a lady, no matter how skillful her piano playing or fluent her Latin? Your place in the rigid social order was fixed at birth. And this, Epstein says, explains why Shakespeare, Dante, Aristophanes and the Bible are basically snob-free: ``Snobbery as we know it today, snobbery meant to shore up one's own sense of importance and to make others sorely feel their insignificance, was not yet up and running in a serious way.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"117963"	"he"	"argues"	" A greater emphasis on propeller aircraft, which are quieter than jets, but which are generally used for recreational flying, not commercial operations. The airport has about 600 propeller aircraft. Silver also suggested that the airport start charging landing fees, rather than just fixed rates for leaseholders. In other words, the airport should charge a fee for each flight, rather than a flat amount to operate a hangar. Such a policy, he argues, would give companies a financial incentive to reduce the number of flights. The major businesses at the airport, called fixed-base operators, are currently charged a flat rate of $14,000 a year per acre. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"

"122042"	"he"	"argues"	" Wills believes that system is an anachronistic distortion, both of the church's early history and of Scripture. The gathering of all wisdom and power in the bishop of Rome was, he argues, an invention of generations of ambitious, sometimes greedy and venal Vatican bureaucrats.

"122633"	"he"	"argues"	" The real problem building up in recent years, he argues, was not low-cost competition, but the reckless expansion of the big carriers between 1996 and 2001, when they added 3 percent more capacity each year in a mostly mature market. Excess capacity led to price-cutting for leisure travelers to bring in marginal revenue. Attempts to compensate for this by raising business fares met with strong resistance. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"

"137906"	"he"	"argues"	" (For use by New York Times News Service clients.) By MARK HELM c.2003 Hearst Newspapers WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Supreme Court finished its 2002-2003 term last week with two blockbuster rulings on affirmative action and gay rights, but the most mm`mrtant decisions of the session didn't involve cases. Instead, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, 78, and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, 73 _ the focus of retirement speculation _ decided not to announce their retirement plans. ``Talk of retirement dominated the court this session, making the cases seem almost a side dish to the bigger issue of who would step down, who Bush would choose to nominate and how vicious the confirmation battle would be,'' says Thomas C. Goldstein, a lawyer in private practice who specializes in the high court. Nonetheless, the justices handed down several landmark cases that blurred their image as strong social conservatives. The justices' decisions in a number of cases involving controversial topics were moderate and, at times, liberal. ``On social issues that really divide the country, this court simply isn't as conservative as people try to make it ?::71290 90;42#0997;01ourt specialist at Emory University in Atlanta. In a pair of cases involving the University of Michigan, the court ruled that universities could use racial preferences in choosing students 0a ducation institutions. In the court's first statement on campus affirmative action in a quarter-century, the justices voted 5-4 to uphold the University of Michigan's system of preferences for minorities who apply to its law school. But, by a 6-3 vote, they struck down a point system used by Michigan's undergraduate program, saying it was too formulaic in giving a boost to minorities. The court said schools cannot blindly give minorities extra points just because of their race and instead must take the time to assess each applicant's background and potential. In another closely watched case involving gay rights, the Supreme Court struck down the Texas sodomy law, ruling that the government has no right to control the private lives of homosexuals. The 6-3 decision overturned a court ruling 17 years ago that states could punish gays and lesbians for what such laws historically called deviant sex. The court's decision infuriated conservatives. ``Both the affirmative action and the gay rights decision reflect a political approach to the law that we deplore,'' Jay A. Sekulow, the legal director of the American Center for Law and Justice, a conservative legal advocacy group, said following the decisions. Other decisions also showed a court concerned with tolerance and inclusion. In a 6-3 decision, the court upheld a Virginia law that outlawed cross burning when done to intimidate or threaten. In another 6-3 decision, the court said that state workers could sue their employers when denied time off to care for a sick relative under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act. Writing for the majority, Rehnquist _ one of the court's most conservative members _ praised the law for attacking the stereotype that only women are responsible for family care. But while the court was softening its conservative stance on social issues, the justices were unrelenting in burnishing their reputations for being tough on crime. In three rulings, the court: _ Upheld t`ewo-called Megan's laws, which permits posting identities of sex offenders on the Internet; _ Permitted 25-years-to-life sentences under the ``three-strikes'' laws for relatively minor offenses; _ Allowed cities to put the streets and sidewalks in and around a crime-ridden public housing project off-limits to nonresidents to control crime by controlling access. The term also reaffirmed the importance of O'Connor, a moderately conservative justice whose vote often determines the outcome of a decision. O'Connor was in the majority on each of the court's 15 rulings that were decided by 5-4 votes. During the term, the court issued 76 opinions. ``O'Connor remains the most important member of the court, which basically makes her the most important woman in the government,'' says Ronald Klain, former assistantHcounsel to President Bill Clinton and a former law clerk to Justice Byron White. --  (STORY COULD END HERE.

As suggested by the complex maneuvering that produced Palestinian acceptance of a truce and agreement on an Israeli pullback from Gaza and the West Bank town of Bethlehem, President Bush and his advisers will have to be unrelenting and evenhanded in prodding both sides to meet their obligations under the road map. The Americans will also have to be supple and shrewd.  The accord among Palestinian factions to observe a renewable cease-fire for at least three months does not strictly fulfill the terms of the road map. Bush left no doubt about what was required Wednesday when he said: ``The true test for Hamas and terrorist organizations is the complete dismantlement of their terrorist networks, their capacity to blow up the peace process.''  But the Palestinian prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas _ whom Israeli officials want to trust _ argues that any immediate effort by his Palestinian Authority to disarm and arrest commanders of Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and other militias would provoke the equivalent of a civil war. Abbas has warned that he does not now have the security forces or the popular support to take on Hamas and the others. The result of a crackdown, he argues, would be to postpone the cessation of violence necessary to begin implementing the road map.  The case Abbas has made to Hamas and the other militias is that if they accept the truce, at worst they will return the ball back in Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's court, showing the Americans that it is Sharon, not the Palestinians, who stands in the way of the peace that Washington is trying to foster. Beyond this logic, Hamas was swayed by the threat of a cutoff of funding from Saudi Arabia, diplomatic nudges from Egypt, and the participation of Hamas leaders based in Syria who appeq{0toole played by Marwan Barghouti, the popular leader of the Tanzim militia linked to Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction. From an Israeli prison, Barghouti was allowed to draw up the truce terms Hamas accepted. His central role demonstrated the fragmentation of political authority in the Palestinian camp. The fact that the Israelis let him confer with go-betweens to compose the truce suggests that despite their protestations, they accept Abbas's brief: that a Palestinian cease-fire and an Israeli pullback may be the soundest way to stop terrorism and start implementing the road map.  Bush should pocket the truce and the pullback but keep pushing both sides to do more. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20030627.0062 type=story > <DATELINE> 06-27-03 21:27:00EDT (AM-ADD-NYT-BUDGET-EXCLUS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200306.gz"

UKRAINE-ELECT (Kiev, Ukraine) -- In defiance of Western leaders and growing popular unrest on the streets, the government of Leonid D. Kuchma, the outgoing president of Ukraine, on Wednesday ignored reports of widespread electoral fraud and certified his prime minister as president-elect. The action ended two days of indecisiveness at the top of government here as a political crisis had deepened, and signaled a decision by Ukraine's incumbent leadership to risk a chill in relations with the West in order to maintain a grip on power. By C.J. Chivers.  With a graphic.  CIA-UNREST (Washington) -- Since the arrival of its new director, Porter J. Goss, what has been playing out within the CIA headquarters is no less than a clash of cultures, on a scale not seen there since the Carter administration, when Stansfield Turner, the retired admiral, brought a half-dozen Navy officers with him to the agency in 1977. By Douglas Jehl.  KY-NUKE (Washington) -- An electrical fire on Tuesday afternoon at a uranium enrichment plant in Paducah, Ky., blacked out most of the equipment used to purify the uranium at a late stage in the enrichment process, the plant manager said Wednesday. Without the ability to withdraw the finished product from the system, operators were forced to mix enriched uranium with more diluted uranium in order to avoid exceeding safety limits on enrichment. The plant is the only domestic source of uranium enrichment. By Matthew L. Wald  CHINA-RELIGION (Huaide, China) -- China's growing material wealth has eluded the countryside, home to two-thirds of its population. But there is a bull market in sects and cults competing for souls. That has alarmed the authorities, who seem uncertain whether the spread of religion or its systematic repression does more to turn peasants against Communist rule. The demise of Communist ideology has left a spiritual void, and it is being filled by religion. The country today has more church-going Protestants than Europe, according to several foreign estimates. Buddhism has become popular among the social elite. But it is the rural underclass that is most desperate for salvation. By Joseph Kahn.  With photo.  THANKSGIVING-IMMIG (Paterson, N.J.) -- Yaser Baker is cooking turkey with a Palestinian recipe, despite the objections of some of his fellow Arab residents of Paterson. Leticia Maravilla of Los Angeles cooked her first turkey soon after arriving from Mexico, before she even got her green card. Thanksgiving, which began as a party for immigrants, remains the most accessible American holiday for newcomers. It requires no specific religious or political allegiance. Even if an immigrant comes from a culture where whole roast turkey is never on the menu -- and that's almost everywhere else except North America -- most are willing to give it a try. By cooking turkey, said Lucy Long, a professor of popular culture at Bowling Green State University, even if you don't like it, you are part of something bigger. Of course, that translates to a nation of cross-cultural Thanksgivings, where sticky rice stuffing edges out cornbread and curry and gravy fight for dominance on overloaded plates. By Kim Severson.  With photos.  FLA-HOMELESS (Pensacola, Fla.) -- Kelly Terrell's family of four is staying in an 8-foot-wide trailer on a concrete lot, surrounded by highways, megastores and a place called Bingo Paradise. The walls are thin, the neighbors too close, the bathroom too small to turn around in. Yet they are among the lucky. At the end of a hurricane season that left much of Florida in ruins, thousands of families remain displaced, the numbers still growing by the day. Water-damaged homes, perhaps livable at first, have sprouted black mold that sends invisible spores through the air. Money for hotel rooms has run out, as has the patience of friends with pullout couches. Gov. Jeb Bush and Michael Brown, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said last month that every hurricane victim who needed it would have free temporary housing by Thanksgiving, a goal that they have raced in recent weeks to fulfill. But about 2,500 families are now waiting for the small trailers or larger mobile homes that FEMA provides for up to 18 months. By Abby Goodnough.  With photo.

Mold spores can cause wheezing, coughing, congestion, sneezing, itching, headaches, and, many believe, far more serious illness. Johnson, 57, retreated to a tent in his yard, he said, and his son slept in an old car.

Among them, he said, are illegal immigrants who fear being deported, poor rural residents who are suspicious of the government and elderly people who are terrified of leaving familiar surroundings. Illegal immigrants qualified only for emergency housing in the first days after the storms, Gair said, though if they have American-born children they are eligible for FEMA trailers or mobile homes. </P> 	nyt_eng_200411.gz

Ladakhis, with help from outsiders like Norberg-Hodge, a linguist, prevented Ladakh from becoming another Nepal, spoiled by an excess of hippies and drugs. At first ashamed by their backwardness, many Ladakhis came to believe that, if foreigners saw such value in their culture, language and dress, they should, too. </P> 	nyt_eng_200411.gz

, they said,	 European diplomats said the issue of suspending Iran's plutonium program, while long discussed with Tehran, was set aside during recent negotiations as a concession to getting the more limited suspension deal. The uranium issue was seen as more pressing, they said, while plutonium production is years away and can be addressed in the future. </P> 	nyt_eng_200411.gz
, he added,	 Although the Bush administration has not made an issue of plutonium production recently, in 2002, Ari Fleischer, then the White House spokesman, said the United States had serious concerns about the planned reactor because of its capacity for producing weapons-grade plutonium. The plan's disclosure, he added, reinforces the concerns that the president has had all along. </P> 	nyt_eng_200411.gz
, they added,	 The Iranians say it is for research and making medical isotopes. But Western experts say it is too big for research and too small for making electricity. Its size, they added, is roughly that of those used abroad to make plutonium bomb fuel. </P> 	nyt_eng_200411.gz
, they said,	 But that could cause other complications. The Russians have a contract with Iran to finish a half-built, light water reactor at Bushehr. The European officials said the Russians might view the European initiative as a rival that would deprive them of revenue. In addition, they said, the United States would have to approve such a transfer of reactor technology, an unlikely move given the Bush administration's hard line against Iran. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20041124.0234 type=story > <HEADLINE> DUTCH SEEK TO STOP TERRORISTS BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> AMSTERDAM, Netherlands </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200411.gz

, he agreed,	 Newly armed with a large-frame revolver -- the impressive kind that Dirty Harry used, says the man who traded it to him for drugs -- McKinney was hoping to commit a robbery. He was full of scattershot rage. When Shepard, who was also at the bar, asked him for a ride home, he agreed, planning to steal his wallet for drug money. Henderson went along on the drive, and after McKinney beat Shepard senseless with the gun, tied him to a fence in a remote field.

, he warns,	 In Alexander the Great, his 1973 biography, which was reissued this fall by Penguin, Robin Lane Fox, the British dean of Alexander studies and an adviser on Stone's film, counts 1,472 books and articles on Alexander from the last 200 years. Many of these works, he warns, adopt a confident tone and can be dismissed for that alone. </P> 	nyt_eng_200411.gz
, he suggests,	 Everywhere he went, Prevas found disturbing levels of anti-Western sentiment, much more so, he suggests, than would have been the case in Alexander's day. Alexander and I traveled over the same roads, deserts and mountains although we traveled nearly 2,400 years apart, he writes. The topography has hardly changed, but the world I traveled through to research this book is a far more dangerous and less peaceful place than it was when Alexander and his Macedonians passed through it. </P> 	nyt_eng_200411.gz
, he writes,	 A similar pessimism pervades his account of Alexander. On the battlefield, he writes, Alexander was a commander of certain genius. Off it, however, he was increasingly a megalomaniac and a tyrant, a man who drank to excess, killed his friends, encouraged his army in the slaughter of innocent civilians and expected to be worshipped like a god. </P> 	nyt_eng_200411.gz
, he argues,	 The sacking and burning of Persepolis has long been a subject of debate. Some scholars believe the palace fires were an accident incurred during a wine-fueled bacchanalia. Politically, Prevas acknowledges, the destruction of Persepolis made some sense: It would be seen by Greece as just revenge for the Persian invasion of Athens and burning of the Acropolis 150 years earlier. Still, he argues, it was a singularly barbaric act, which shows just how thin was the veneer of the Hellenic civilization that many of Alexander's biographers over the centuries would have us believe he was carrying to the East. </P> 	nyt_eng_200411.gz
, he suggests,	 Rogers concedes that Alexander was guilty of drunken rages (during one he murdered his officer and close friend Cleitus) and gratuitous brutality (especially during his campaigns in northern India). But such faults of personality, he suggests, should be measured against other, more precociously modern behavior.

Any increase in private, individual savings, they say, would be partly or wholly offset by an increase in public debt.

"147152"	"he"	"argues"	" Two grand themes animate Downtown. The first is the power of nostalgia, which Hamill posits as the city's ruling passion, after greed, anger and resistance to authority. New York changes so quickly that every generation watches its own past being demolished. The Dodgers leave town. Penn Station disappears. That little cafe where you first went out to dinner with your wife? Gone. The New York version of nostalgia is not simply about lost buildings or their presence in the youth of the individuals who lived in them, Hamill explains. It involves an almost fatalistic acceptance of the permanent presence of loss. This, he argues, makes New Yorkers tougher. It steels them against sentimentality.

Others panted to take the Paris by Night bus tours and get a look at the Folies-Bergere, described by Fodor's as a dazzling Niagara of eroticism. Civilized France and pleasure-oriented France each commanded its own American audience. And there was another category, too: black Americans, who found in France an acceptance denied them at home.
