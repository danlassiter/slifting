Because they suffered dents and scratches and all the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune little tin toys are heir to, and because they rusted in the salt air and sea, early sand pails in mint condition are rare today. Collectors expect to pay from $50 to $1,500 for playthings that once cost pennies.  Nostalgia and a love of tin lithography drive the market for these collectibles, prompting not one but two new books: ``Beach Pails: Classic Toys of the Surf and Sand'' by Carole and Richard Smyth (Running Press, $24.95) and ``Sand Pail Encyclopedia: A Comprehensive Value Guide for Tin-Litho Sand Toys'' by Karen Horman and Polly Minick (Hobby House Press, $24.95).  In a phone interview from her New York home, Carole Smyth said there are quite a few collectors for the pails, herself included. ``People can't stop at one. Once you have one, you have to have more because the graphics are so beautiful.''  Minick, calling from St. Simons Island, Ga., said she and co-author Horman met on the Internet, both collectors, both bidding on eBay. Fortunately, Minick concentrates on early patriotic pails, mostly from 1870 to 1910; Horman collects the later character and Disney pails. The two collections meshed beautifully for their book, which features about 300 color photographs.  The earliest tin sand pails were small, soldered and finished in bright colors, some stenciled, some decorated freehand. Later, as the U.S. tin industry evolved, many toy firms, like George W. Brown and Co., Leo Schlesinger Inc. and Morton Converse, would begin producing tin buckets to be sold cheaply, often for just 10 cents.  Converse would become the largest pail maker in the 1890s, said Smyth, producing a million-plus pails and shovels a year. Though most toy makers didn't bother to sign the cheap toys until about the 1920s, many can be identified with a little experience.  The earliest tin pails were decorated by a technique called ``japanning,'' which used several layers of paint topped with lacquer. French pails often used a dyeing technique, less expensive but pretty. Some makers embossed their buckets, stamping patterns into the sheet tin before making the pail and painting it. Lithography introduced brilliant colors and the ability to do graphics in detail in the 1890s.  Early decoration was simple, often including the words ``sea side.'' Patriotic motifs during events like the Spanish American War and World War I were common and are very collectible today.  Many were meant to be beach souvenirs and bore the name of the town in which they were sold. In the 1920s-1940s, pails often featured kids playing; the 1930s was a big era for cartoon characters like Mickey Mouse and Snow White. Novelty pails with a double use became popular _ often with lids, they held candy, such as saltwater taffy, then could be used in the sand.  Among the most popular pails today are those produced by Ohio Art Co., featuring Disney characters, and J. Chein, known for tin toys. A charming 1930s J. Chein pail in brilliant hues and featuring the Three Little Pigs _ the wolf waits on one side of the bucket while, on the other, two piggies play in the sand and the third enjoys a swim _ sold recently for $276.99 on eBay. The next day, bidding for an early 1900s red, white and blue patriotic pail, a souvenir for Wildwood, N.J., ended at $761. Both prices are probably lower than would be paid in an antiques shop.  Prices have steadily climbed, said both authors, especially for fine and older pails in desirable motifs. Condition is critical in valuation.  For a pail to bring in top dollar, said Smyth, it would have to be in mint condition, with ``no dents, no rust, no holes and the bale or handle intact. The graphics would have to be stunning.'' Among top subjects: Coney Island and Atlantic City, Disney characters, Rosie O'Neill kewpies, images of a dirigible or early airplane or a teddy bear.  Smyth warns to buy with an eye toward quality and good condition. ``The less damage the better. Once it rusts you can't bring it back,'' she said. ``It's not like furniture that you can refinish.''  Still, some collectors don't mind a little damage. ``Some people still insist on buying really cruddy looking ones because they like the thought that a child played with it. They don't mind the condition problems.''  Ultimately, she advised, ``the best thing is to buy what you love and not for investment, because who knows what's a good investment nowadays. The joy of ownership is in the beholding.''  Smyth, with husband Richard, self-published an earlier value guide titled ``Pails by Comparison''; collectors wanting a copy can send $25 plus $4.50 shipping to her at Carole Smyth, P.O. Box 2068, Huntington, N.Y. or e-mail questions to carolesmyth(at)yahoo.com.  Minick, whose home and pail collection recently were featured in Victoria and Coastal Living magazines, said she first noticed the pails in the 1980s after her son decided to become a Marine. She came across a patriotic pail and it spoke to her.  A nationally recognized hooked rug artist and avid antiquer, Minick decided sand pails were the perfect thing to collect when she moved from Michigan to her new home on the Georgia coast.
