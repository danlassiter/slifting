"84600"	"they"	"obeyed"	" We've popped the last of the balloons and crated up the leftover ``Bush for President'' buttons from the 1988 Republican National Convention. We're still catching our breath from the day in 1987 when we had 80,000 schoolchildren in here for an address from the pope _ and 27,500 more for a Tulane-Iowa State football game that night. Remember what we told the 15,000 kids sitting in aluminum chairs on the floor: ``As soon as the pope leaves, you fold up the chairs and put them against the wall''? And for once, they obeyed, so we had time to get the field down for kickoff. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
