In ``Livestock,'' he tells how he has switched his affections from dogs to cats, whose demeanor, he finds, ``is a reminder that it is possible to get through life without having to be the least bit obsequious.'' In ``The Ignorant Man's Guide to Serious Music,'' he describes his increasing interest in serious music, although he also admits that in his lack of musical memory ``I am uniquely unfit for something I so much love, a charmless and not particularly intelligent dwarf in pursuit of Sophia Loren.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"23425"	"he"	"finds"	" Horns appeared late in an animal's life, he finds, suggesting they did not serve to keep away predators. If they did, ``one would expect early rather than late development, so they could be put to use as soon as possible,'' says Sampson. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"

Among the best parts of an excellent book is a comparison of Col. Robert McCormick's Tribune in the heyday of personal journalism, and the same paper under the corporate journalism of the present day. There was, he finds, no golden age. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"

"84530"	"she"	"finds"	" More recently, she finds, reports grow scarcer, more formulaic in describing predatory males who prey on vulnerable females, and more one-sided in their condemnation. But, she writes, with the increasing feminization of the therapeutic professions, abuse is likely to diminish. And with the rise of managed care, the rules against transgression are hardening. So strict is prohibition growing that ``serious considerations of the physical attraction that develops so often between doctor and patient'' are getting ``swept under the rug'' and becoming ``undiscussable.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

"85282"	"he"	"finds"	" For years, Richardson has been juggling a mini-United Nations in New Mexico. His district is more than half Hispanic and Native American, and its 28 Indian tribes all consider themselves sovereign ``nations.'' An unabashed carpetbagger who started running for Congress only months after he selected New Mexico as his launch pad, Richardson had to press a lot of flesh to convince people he was just a good ole boy. He started wearing cowboy boots and learned the local customs quickly. Some friends think his visits to the state's pockets of appalling poverty will make Richardson more sympathetic to Third World concerns at the United Nations. One skill that will come in handy: Richardson's ability to let people with grievances _ whether it's Fidel Castro, Saddam Hussein or an irate voter at one of his frequent town meetings _ vent their spleen at length (for hours, if need be).

So the book's raw data is less valuable than the ways Gladwell chooses to expand on it. More interesting than the mechanisms of blink-fast judgments, he finds, is the way people count on the accuracy of such assessments. We are apt to think we are right even when we are chillingly wrong. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
