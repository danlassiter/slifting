(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Russell Crowe in a scene from `Virtuosity.' By IAN SPELLING (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Russell Crowe is virtually a star.  Thanks to bravura performances in the Aussie films ``Romper Stomper'' (1992), ``Proof'' (1992) and ``The Sum of Us'' (1994), Crowe is quite popular at home ``down under'' and an art-house favorite in the United States.  And if the actor's latest film, the virtual-reality science-fiction thriller ``Virtuosity,'' lives up to its advance billing as a late-summer blockbuster, scheduled to open nationwide Aug. 4, then stardom in America may very well become reality for the handsome 31-year-old.  ``That actually bothers me a bit,'' says Crowe, a thoughtful, engaging conversationalist, during an interview in a Manhattan hotel. ``I've done my last four movies in America and I enjoyed them because I didn't have to carry any of them.  ``Stardom all has to do with attitude. It can crush you and destroy your life, or it can open doors to meeting interesting people, making more interesting films and doing more interesting things in your life.  ``The last few days I've been in Tokyo, Sydney and now New York, and I go to L.A. in a few days. I really enjoy a whole lot of what I do, but the stardom thing isn't of much interest to me.''  Still, Crowe _ whose best-known American film was the Sharon Stone Western ``The Quick and the Dead'' (1994) _ understands that, like it or not, ``Virtuosity'' may very well thrust him right into the spotlight.  A furiously paced, high-tech affair, ``Virtuosity'' is set in Los Angeles circa 1999.  Parker Barnes (Denzel Washington), a former cop, has been imprisoned for accidentally killing civilians while trying in vain to rescue his wife and daughter from a political terrorist named Matthew Grimes (Christopher Murray), who was killed in the effort.  Hoping to reduce his sentence, Barnes becomes a guinea pig in a police-training virtual-reality exercise that pits cops against Sid 6.7, a composite criminal made up of the personalities of nearly 200 infamous serial killers, terrorists and other unsavory types.  Crowe, with great glee, portrays Sid, who eventually breaks free of his virtual-reality environs and wreaks havoc on the denizens of Los Angeles.  Enter Barnes, who was the only cop to come anywhere near capturing Sid in the virtual-reality exercise and _ as if Barnes needed more motivation than the pardon he'll be granted should he stop the actualized Sid _ learns that the dominant killer in Sid's programming is none other than Grimes.  Once in the real world, the enigmatic Sid promptly realizes his myriad powers: He regenerates when wounded, has access to the deviant brain power of a criminal's ``who's who'' and, most frighteningly, is self-aware and egomaniacal.  ``I saw him as evolving into a media slut,'' says Crowe with a laugh, referring to Sid's propensity for making certain his actions are witnessed by TV audiences. ``He craves attention, which was a common thing in all the personalities that were entered into him.  ``(These criminals) all had incredible ambition and drive. Though not successful, so to speak, in life, to stay undetected through 30 or so murders, they had to have a lot going for them in terms of brain organization.  ``As Sid is a composite of 183 criminal types, multiply this brain capacity by 183 and what emerges is a tremendous need for attention. Sid discovers the media and quickly comes to love it because of its effect on people.''  Sid preens for cameras, threatens lives in nightmarish close-up and uses the media to let people see just how much he relishes killing.  ``Remember, he's interactive, which means what he gets from people he gives back to them,'' Crowe says. ``He comes into the world and, based on what he sees people doing to each other, senses humans couldn't possibly want to live. So he helps them out by killing them. He's a very generous man.''  A sly smile crosses Crowe's face, but the actor, sporting a dark stubbly beard, green-lensed sunglasses and a denim pants and shirt combo, isn't remotely as sinister or imposing as his sleek cinematic alter ego.  Crowe, who is single and lives in Sydney, reports that his performance wouldn't have been as effective if it weren't for Washington, who lends his silent-but-strong presence to Barnes, the film's emotional core.  ``I enjoyed working with Denzel,'' he says. ``It wasn't like we were best mates, spending lots of social time together, but we had a totally open level of communication as actors.  ``That meant we could play our roles as disparately as we did. I could take the bad guy, he could take the good guy and we could get in our separate cars and drive on the same freeway.  ``That implies a bit of competitiveness, but that is really healthy for actors. What I'm talking about is the excitement of two actors bringing out the best in each other and trying to achieve excellence in what they do.''  Ultimately, Crowe notes, he is pleased with ``Virtuosity'' and hopes it will click with audiences.  ``I think it's a good ride,'' he says. ``I don't know what will happen with it, but I enjoyed making it and I think (director) Brett Leonard is an excellent filmmaker and must have an incredibly organized mind to pull off this movie.''  Some might argue that Crowe himself must have a rather organized mind to build his career as steadily as he has.  Born in Wellington, New Zealand, and reared in Sydney, he knew early on that acting was in his future.  The fact his parents were location caterers and his grandfather was a cinematographer probably had something to do with his attraction to the craft.  ``Absolutely,'' he says, laughing. ``I was around sets from a very young age and was about 6 when I finally convinced a director to give me a job.  ``It was always apparent to me I wanted to act, so I pursued it.''  Crowe performed in high school plays and in various local theater productions, but didn't land his first major film until he was 25, the result, he jokes, of ``thousands of terrible auditions.''  Eventually, film roles came his way, among them ``The Crossing'' (1990) and ``Proof.'' The latter cast him as the friend of a blind photographer. Crowe earned further acclaim as the leader of a neo-Nazi skinhead gang in ``Romper Stomper'' and as actor Jack Thompson's gay son in ``The Sum of Us.''  Crowe couldn't be more pleased that ``Proof,'' ``Romper Stomper'' and ``The Sum of Us'' all played to American audiences and were well-received.  ``Film is an international medium and Australia has re-established its reputation as a producer of quality films,'' he says.  ``The dollars' drive has been taken out of our films, and films are made by those who seriously want to create in the celluloid medium.  ``I think that's the key to it, and it's wonderful for our country and film industry.''  Crowe's pre-``Virtuosity'' foray into American films, ``The Quick and the Dead,'' died quickly upon its release in 1994. In this Western with a dark comedic edge, Crowe played Sharon Stone's romantic interest.  ``I was surprised that didn't catch on,'' he says. ``I thought it was very American in its humor. It seemed to be dismissed before it was ever seen. I liked it and enjoyed working with Sharon.''  Next up for the actor will be ``Rough Magic'' with Bridget Fonda. Crowe plays the journalist boyfriend of a magician's assistant played by Fonda. Crowe describes the film as a ``metaphorical tale about spirituality and physical magic.''  After ``Magic,'' comes ``No Way Back,'' in which Crowe is a widowed FBI agent living in Los Angeles with his young son.  ``It's a big chase film which also stars Michael Lerner and Helen Slater,'' he says. ``We did it for just $1.3 million.  ``I thought it was important, if I was going to work in America, that I see things from different angles. `Virtuosity' cost $40 million and was a big studio film, while `Rough Magic' cost $10 million but was financed by the French through a British production house, filmed in Guatemala and edited in L.A.  ``There are lots of levels in filmmaking. Things are harder with less money, and sometimes that's really good for you.  ``At least, for me, it is.''

SHUTTLE: High-tech executive Didier Pietri used to fly between the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles four times per week _ so often, he jokes, that he considered Southwest Airlines to be his BART. But now he has a new commute _ a six-hour drive along Interstate 5. ``As long as security measures require you to check in 21/2 or three hours in advance, it's meaningless for me to fly,'' he said from his car phone as he headed to his Fremont office from his Bel Air home. ``For short flights like this one, it becomes counterproductive,'' said Pietri, who's had to cut his commute to once or twice per week, rather than every other day. BY CAROLYN SAID  BIOTERROR: San Francisco Bay Area biotech firms are starting to talk about technologies they hope they'll never need _ tools to detect and combat biological terror. ``We're glad this hasn't had to be used in the worst case,'' said Tom Gutshall, chief executive of Cepheid Inc., a Sunnyvale firm that has developed a portable DNA test device designed to be used at the site of a suspected bioterror attack. BY TOM ABATE  AMD: Advanced Micro Devices absorbed a double-dose of bad news Tuesday as the semiconductor company slashed 2,300 jobs on the same day computer-maker Gateway Inc. announced plans to drop the Sunnyvale firm's chips from its line and only buy from chief rival, Intel Inc. A portion of the job cuts will come from the closure of AMD's two oldest chip fabrication plants, located in Austin, Texas. About 1,000 workers are expected to be affected there. The rest of the cuts will come from the firm's Penang, Malaysia, site, where AMD tests, assembles and packages chips and chipsets. There are about 2,600 workers there and half of them will be let go by the end of the second quarter of 2002, the company said. BY MATTHEW YI  FINE: Health Net of California paid a $100,000 fine Tuesday for failing to reimburse doctors, hospitals and emergency rooms on time. The insurer, which has more than 2 million members in its health maintenance organization and is the state's fourth-largest HMO, also cut a check for $54,000 to cover interest on the late payments. BY VICTORIA COLLIVER  GROCERY: Safeway and Albertson's offered their 28,000 unionized workers in Northern California a contract Tuesday that includes a proposed wage increase the union has said for several months is unacceptable. The union said a strike is very probable as early as Oct. 8. The offer was made about 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, and the leaders of all eight locals of the Northern California United Food and Commercial Workers gathered shortly thereafter and unanimously decided to recommend that members reject it and prepare for a strike. BY GEORGE RAINE  MEDIA (COLUMN): IN the twisted way of the business world, the Industry Standard this week wound up right where it started four years ago: In the possession of IDG. IDG, the Boston technology publisher, provided the seed money in 1997 that launched the Standard, which quickly became the weekly bible for dot-com businesspeople. As the dot-conomy headed south this year, though, IDG bailed on the Standard, leaving its parent Standard Media International to declare bankruptcy.
