"17653"	"she"	"speculates"	" Sellers' ex-wives who speak on camera are generous about him but revealingly honest. Britt Ekland tells of the time, early in her pregnancy with Victoria, when Hugh Hefner asked Sellers to photograph her nude for Playboy. An excellent amateur photographer, he consented. ``This is not normal,'' says Ekland. Anne Levy, Sellers' first wife, gave up an acting career when she married him. Long after their split, he brought his girlfriends around for her to assess, much, she speculates, as he always eagerly sought his mother's approval. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"
"18875"	"he"	"speculates"	" Summer in the Arctic is the breeding season for waterfowl, and a time, while the hatchlings are feathering out, that the adults molt their flight feathers in preparation for the long migration south. The shores and tundra are littered with feathers, and in a perfectly haunting moment, Perkins toys with a handful of wing feathers and wonders, aloud, whether angels molt. If they do, he speculates, they ``would come to a place like this.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"33893"	"he"	"speculates"	" But the majority of athletes who cheat won't be caught, he speculates, because they'll use substances that aren't on the testers' radar screens. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"42836"	"he"	"speculates"	" But these ``wholesale choices'' must be structured so as to ``preserve scientific integrity of choices at the retail level,'' he writes.

"69342"	"she"	"speculates"	" Constantly wondering where to put down roots, she speculates, ``frees me up in a way, because writing becomes the one constant in my life. For instance, if I'm writing about Vermont, it's when I'm living in New York City. And vice versa. If the place is necessary at the moment, it tends to have a lot of emotional reverberations afterward. But it's usually only once I'm removed from that place that I write about it.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199608.gz"

"93576"	"he"	"speculates"	" Once he received from the library the black-and-white digital scans of the negatives, made at a resolution of a million pixels per square inch, Frankhauser faced many obstacles. The biggest problem was the alignment, or registration, of the images. ``There were three ways for these things to go out of registration, and they used them all,'' he said. The camera's weaknesses, he speculates, were exaggerated because Prokudin-Gorsky frantically moved the plate and changed filters and repeatedly fired the shutter before his subjects changed their positions. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"115320"	"he"	"speculates"	" Although drugs and alcohol have clearly contributed to Moody's depressive state of mind, he repeatedly talks about having a guilty conscience, about self-loathing and hopelessness and the sense of dread that issued forth down his father's paternal line all the way back, he speculates, to Handkerchief Moody, who in his youth accidentally killed one of his friends, and who subsequently did penance by hiding his face from the world. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"

"122655"	"he"	"speculates"	" Beginning around A.D. 500, Jha writes, killing cows became increasingly taboo _ according to the religious texts, a sinful practice associated with the lowest social order, the untouchables. In part, he speculates, the change in official attitude may have coincided with the explosion of agriculture. The cow, on whose strength (for plowing), dung (for fuel) and milk the community depended, was just too valuable to slaughter. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"

"131313"	"she"	"speculates"	" Minneapolis grief therapist Elizabeth Levang, author of ``When Men Grieve,'' notes that the simultaneous public mourning of hundreds of men for fallen brothers allowed a momentary catharsis. ``But then when you come back to private life,'' says Levang, ``the life a man shares with his wife and his children, we still say to men, `You are responsible for managing the family grief.' '' In order to be strong for their families, she speculates, these men maintain outward stoicism, mourning only sporadically and in solitude. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"

"142781"	"she"	"speculates"	" Why did they preserve bread this way? asks Rosetta rhetorically. Maybe, she speculates, friselle accompanied Calabrian shepherds on their long forays into the mountains. Maybe people took these lightweight rusks on trips. Today, even with fresh bread readily available, Calabrians still make or buy -- mostly buy -- these thick dried toasts. Bay Area markets don't stock them, and Rosetta and Maria both quickly dismissed a package of imported machine-made friselle sent from New York. These so-called friselle were inauthentic in size, said the authorities, and all wrong in taste. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"146770"	"he"	"speculates"	" The reason toymakers were slow to act, he speculates, is misinformation about Hispanics living in poverty, when in fact many are high earners and prefer American brand names. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"

After all, most leisure travelers are on vacation from everything, including their workout routines. They expect to put on a few pounds while they're away.
