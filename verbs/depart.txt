"147832"	"they"	"depart"	" This novel is melancholy, surreal and funny all at once. In 1990, something happens to Maple Rock, a working-class suburb of Detroit: Its men begin to disappear. One by one, they depart, quietly and without leaving behind any trail of marital discord or obvious discontent. One man writes a note that says only I'm going to the moon. I took the cash. From then on, that's where teenage narrator Michael Smolij and his friends think all of their fathers are: on the moon. The immediate consequences of this abandonment -- dazed and angry mothers working two jobs to support their families, teenage boys serving as sexual partners for older women -- occupy the early pages of the book, but then it becomes a more conventional coming-of-age story for Michael and his friends, who navigate the waters of maturity with only memories of their flawed fathers to guide them. The story, which is wistful yet surprisingly comic, loses some of its focus in the last 50 pages but is a promising first effort from Bakopoulos, a former bookseller from Wisconsin. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
