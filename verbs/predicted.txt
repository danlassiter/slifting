DURABLE GOODS UP 6 PERCENT IN AUGUST   WASHINGTON -- Suggesting only modest slowing of the economy, orders for big-ticket factory-made goods made their biggest gains since late 1992 in August as new-model cars and trucks dominated the Census Bureau's monthly tally.   Although last month's 6 percent jump followed a 4 percent decline in July, analysts said the economy is proving remarkably resilient in the face of efforts by the Federal Reserve to restrain the growth of the economy.   ``The economy's slowing a little, but perhaps not enough'' to avoid further Fed increases in short-term interest rates, said Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, an economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. ``The slowdown is modest at best.''  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19940928.0193 type=story > <HEADLINE> SUCH A DAUGHTER, SUCH AN ETRANGERE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-BILINGUAL-KIDS-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199409.gz"

Times News Service  WASHINGTON _ Republicans in Congress have been fighting Democrats for five months over how to balance the federal budget. Now they start fighting each other.  With broad-brush proposals to reach fiscal balance now approved by both the House and the Senate, the Republican majorities in the two chambers will begin haggling on Friday to reach a compromise plan that both ends of the Capitol can support. And they immediately confront a yawning split over the most divisive issue of the entire budget process: tax relief.  ``It's the crux of the issue,'' Richard May, the staff director of the House Budget Committee, said on Thursday. ``Everything else revolves around tax cuts. The longer this thing hangs out there, the bigger problem it becomes.''  Already it is immense enough. The budget plan that the Senate approved on Thursday omits any guarantee of a tax cut, in large part because Republican moderates refused to go along with one until the deficit is on a proven path toward zero. The plan does reserve up to $170 billion for tax relief later, but only if lower deficits strengthen the economy and create a government windfall from lower interest rates and greater tax revenue.  By contrast, the House would slash taxes by $350 billion over seven years, half of that for $500-a-child credits to taxpaying families earning $200,000 a year or less. Most of the rest would go toward tax breaks for capital gains, estates, small businesses, well-off Social Security recipients and married couples.  Although budget negotiations are legendary for puffery and posturing, Republicans in the House appear adamant about preserving tax breaks, which many place at the core of their ideological revolution. On Thursday, some 80 Republicans sent Speaker Newt Gingrich a letter in which they pledged to vote against any compromise ``that fails to balance the budget or significantly diminishes the tax relief passed by the House.''  ``We're going to insist on capital gains,'' said Rep. David L. Hobson, R-Ohio. ``We're going to want fairness for senior citizens. We're going to go after the tax difference for marriages.''  One House concession, said Hobson, who advises the chairman of the Budget Committee, Rep. John R. Kasich of Ohio, might involve the scope of the family tax credit, which he predicted would be limited to households with annual earnings below $95,000, or even less. But lowering the earnings ceiling would save a scant amount, because the bulk of families who would benefit from the tax break earn less than $95,000 a year anyway.  The Senate, meanwhile, has made clear that a bone of a few score billion is not enough. Only this week, Republicans joined Democrats to deliver a 69-to-31 thumping to a virtual clone of the House proposal, a $300 billion tax cut offered by Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas.  The Senate's chief bargainer, Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, is as firmly opposed to tax cuts as Kasich is for them. Domenici was silent on the issue on Thursday, saying he did not conduct negotiations through newspapers. But the Budget Committee's No. 2 Republican, Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, said he believed that the Senate would demand that the House scale back its tax-cut package by at least half _ to $170 billion, say.  ``When you're out there in grass-roots America and asking questions, people want to balance the budget by a 2 to 1 margin over tax decreases,'' he said. Proposing a big tax reduction now, he said, wounds Congress' already bloodied credibility.  But May, the House committee's staff director, said, ``I don't think the guys on our side are going to be happy with $170 billion.''  That said, none of those experts appeared to believe on Thursday that the tax fracas would destroy the negotiations, as have budget disputes between the House and the Senate in some past years. Gingrich's spokesman, Tony Blankley, predicted that the party would arrive at a united stance on taxes, and he cast the letter from Republican conservatives as a gesture of support for negotiators, not a threat.  An aide to the House leadership put it another way: ``This is typical pre-conference posturing on both sides, which is helpful to the process. Each side stakes out its turf. I think we all recognize the number's going to be somewhere between zero and $350 billion.''  The negotiators face additional differences, but May and others predicted that these would fall like dominoes once the tax question was resolved. They include the following:  MILITARY: The House would spend $1.9 trillion on the military through 2002, while the Senate would spend some $70 billion less. Grassley said he leaned toward the lower figure but predicted that the Senate would give up some of its cuts to satisfy Congress' hawks.  MEDICARE: The House would reduce projected spending by $288 billion over seven years, the Senate by $256 billion. Logic, and the powerful lobby of the elderly, suggest that the Senate's figure will carry more weight, experts said.  CRIME: The House would reduce contributions to the Violent Crime Trust Fund, established in last year's anti-crime legislation, by $7.8 billion over seven years. The Senate would reallocate to law-enforcement agencies $2.7 billion of those contributions.  HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT: The House proposal would shave projected spending by $37 billion through 2002, cutting tenant subsidies, deregulating public housing and turning many programs into block grants. The Senate envisions considerably less paring, $12.2 billion, by cutting some existing block grants and consolidating other programs into new ones.  VETERANS PROGRAMS: The House would save some $7.1 billion over seven years by reducing construction of new hospitals and making other changes in medical programs. The Senate would save $9.7 billion by freezing new construction and, like the House, changing medical programs. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950525.0513 type=story > <HEADLINE> FRIENDLY COURSE BECOMES JANZEN'S FOE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> FORT WORTH, Texas (BC-GLF-COLONIAL-JANZEN-TEX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"

FAMILY TRADITION HONORING THOSE WHO SERVED (lh)  c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  NEW YORK _ Rabbi Alexander M. Schindler, the president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, took the tallit, or prayer shawl, on which his wife had embroidered the Hebrew words for knowledge, compassion and the beauty of holiness, off his own shoulders and placed it on those of his daughter Judith Schindler. He said a few words to her and blessed her.  The torch of the rabbinate had been passed to the next generation. Some members of the audience in Temple Emanu-el on Fifth Avenue had tears in their eyes as they watched the ordination of Ms. Schindler and 17 other new graduates of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. Seventeen more students are to be ordained as rabbis at the institution's Cincinnati campus on June 10.  Rabbi Alexander Schindler, 69, is to step down as president of the union, the central organization of Reform Judaism, in June of next year, after having served in the influential post for 23 years. His daughter is to become the assistant rabbi at Westchester Reform Temple in Scarsdale, N.Y., in July.  Rabbi Alexander Schindler said Monday that he had never urged any of his three daughters or two sons to become rabbis.  ``I felt that they did not really see the rabbi's role through me,'' he said. ``When I was last a congregational rabbi, they were babies. Instead, they saw a guy traveling around the world meeting presidents.''  But now that his daughter has followed in his footsteps, he predicted, ``She will be a better rabbi than I ever was or will be.''  The moment in which he passed his prayer shawl on to her was one of ``indescribable joy,'' he said, adding, ``My soul was singing and my spirit soaring.''  c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  Singer John Denver opened the National Memorial Day Concert on the West Lawn of the Capitol in Washington on Sunday night with a rendition of ``Country Roads'' in honor of the soldiers who returned home from World War II 50 years ago.  The concert, a salute to veterans who had fought in the Pacific, went on despite a dismal hard rain. Denver also sang ``Back Home Again'' and ``Annie's Song,'' a love song he dedicated to all those whose loved ones had gone off to war.  ``It's fitting to honor the memory of those who defended freedom and democracy,'' Denver said in an interview. He did not serve in the military himself, but he is the son of an Air Force veteran.  ``They preserved the world so that today we have a global community,'' he continued. ``For the first time, on the 50th anniversary of V-E Day, I heard an acknowledgment by the United States of the 27 million Soviets who died in the war. They were our enemies in the Cold War, which was the third world war, but they died for freedom, too. All the soldiers brought us to the dream of peace on earth.''  Actors Ossie Davis (who was the host of the evening), Charles Durning and Rod Steiger, all veterans, related personal stories of the war, and George Clooney of NBC's ``ER'' read a letter written by a soldier on the front. Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Gen. Colin L. Powell, his predecessor, also gave tributes to veterans, and John Cullum of CBS's ``Northern Exposure'' sang a medley from the musical ``South Pacific.''  Organizers from WETA, the public radio and television station in Washington, had expected a crowd of about 350,000, but only a few thousand huddled under umbrellas for the concert, speeches and film clips from the war. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950529.0274 type=story > <HEADLINE> SHAQ'S ABILITY LAGS BEHIND HIS MARKETABILITY </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-BKN-COLUMN-VENTRE-LADN) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"

CHARTER (Undated) _ When Arizona approved the creation of charter schools last year, some critics worried that they would lure the best and brightest students away from regular public schools. The result, they predicted, would be the equivalent of state-funded private schools catering to a select group of elite students. But some of the 46 new charter schools have their share of students who are performing well below their grade levels. Some, in fact, have a higher percentage of poorly performing students than regular public schools. ``I can't think of a single charter school that is filled with overachievers. They are all getting some students with academic problems, even the ones who billed themselves as wanting to attract only the best and the brightest,'' says one school official. BY HAL MATTERN.

Dove, who left the laureate post in May, is glad to be returning to life with a lower profile. By BILL PORTER. Story will move in ``E'' category.  JOHNNANCE (Undated) _ John J.

Narrated by Ken Auletta, media columnist for the ``New Yorker'' magazine, the program traces Murdoch's life and times from his roots as an under-caste Australian schoolboy with a penchant for gambling to his reign as true world-wide king of all media.

"138824"	"he"	"predicted"	" ``I hate to be so cliche, but it's true,'' the professional events planner told a Globe reporter last week: The music at gay weddings will be groovier, he predicted, than the dance tunes at your average white-cake, white-dress affair. That cliche _ the word, not the sentiment _ caught the eye of Bob Ruplenas, a Globe information technology guy and avowed nitpicker. The adjective should be spelled cliched _ with or without the accent, depending on your dictionary and stylebook _ but this was no passing typo, Ruplenas notes: Speakers and writers are dropping the d all over the place. He blames it on the young and the reckless, pointing me to a webpage for would-be songwriters where one discussion thread has six uses of adjectival cliche _ ``To me this title is a tad cliche'' _ and not a single cliched. (To be fair, some contributors may have been led astray by the original mistake; tested independently, those copycat posters might have come up with cliched.) Still, even in edited prose, adjectival cliche is moving up fast. In expressions where there's a clear choice between cliche and cliched, the adjective is cliche about half the time. In most of those cases, it sneaks in by way of quotations _ ``It sounds cliche, but he really believed it'' (Miami Herald), or ``I was brought up to love everybody, as cliche as that may sound'' (People magazine). But it's not all spoken-word sloppiness: In the earliest citate, so cliche it hurts.'' Despite its stunning recent advance, the adjectival ``cliche'' is still considered a mistake (check your dictionary). But thanks to its speed, it has outpaced most usage commentators, though Paul Brians includes it in his guidebook ``Common Errors in English Usage,'' published earlier this year. Like Ruplenas, Brians blames Gen Xers: ``One often hears young people say, `That movie was so cliche!''' he writes. ``Cliche is a noun, meaning an over-familiar phrase or image. A work containing cliches is cliched.'' (What constitutes a cliche is a much larger and thornier issue, posing, as it does, the question ``over-familiar to whom, in what era?'' One of the pleasures of older usage books is the perspective they offer on the issue of cliches: In the 1957 Dictionary of Contemporary American Usage, Bergen and Cornelia Evans denounce the sedulous ape, you can see it with half an eye, durance vile, and Mrs. Grundy, all dead or dying of natural causes. Theodore Bernstein, in ``The Careful Writer'' (1965), is more cautious, refusing to condemn any particular cliche. Some wil|090882099ome will become standard English, and even the most hackneyed of them, he recognizes, is occasionally useful: The road more traveled by may be easier for yo7r readers to follow.) If the adjectival cliche does displace cliched _ and sheer exposure may have made it unstoppable _ at least the new cliche-mongers can supply some plausible excuses, if they dip into the word's history. Cliche arrived in English in 1832, from the French clicher, ``click,'' says the Oxford English Dictionary. Derived from the sound of a printing process, it first meant the procedure, then the prints themselves _ hence something easily reproduced. By the end of the 19th century, cliche had acquired today's extended sense, ``a stereotyped expression, a commonplace phrase.'' But even though cliche came into English as a noun, it retains its French form _ and that form is a past participle, perfectly happy to be used as an adjective. English is full of such French words, some used as nouns (divorcee, souffle, negligee), others as adjectives (passe, flambe). In French, you can still call something cliche (or clichee, if it's feminine), meaning ``overused, cliched.'' And though it hasn't been common in English until the past decade, the adjectival cliche isn't entirely the creation of ignorant youngsters. The OED quotes the BBC weekly The Listener, for instance, using cliche to mean ``hackneyed'' in 1962: ``Many of the productions of our `new wave' in the theatre have been narrow in outlook, cliche in sentiment, shaky in stagecraft.'' If we do end up clipping cliche, it's no worse than the treatment we've dished out to English words. Ice cream was once iced, skim milk was skimmed, popcorn was popped. If mere phonological convenience allows us to shear off those endings, why worry about one little d in cliched _ especially when the new version is perfectly good French? I'm almost resigned to the change. Or should I say ``almost resign''? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200312.gz"

Israel would make slight changes to try to prove Arafat's death was significant, he predicted, but those changes would not amount to a serious effort at peace. The ball is in Israel's court, he said. This depends on the Israelis, not the Palestinians. If they end the occupation, there will be no problem. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"

POWER-PLANT-EMISSIONS (undated) -- Northeastern states consider how to set caps on emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. By Anthony DePalma.  (The story is scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in a news file.)  Top center:  BALTIMORE-DRUGS (Baltimore) -- In a city where the drug trade has brought one of the highest murder rates in the country, a look at the new police commissioner and a pilot project of assigning a unit of community affairs officers to patrol some of Baltimore's toughest streets in search of addicts and low-level dealers -- not to arrest them, but to help them find treatment, job training, psychological counseling and other social services. By James Dao.  (The story is scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in a news file.)  NY-SUBWAY-SECURITY (New York) -- Officials unveiled on Tuesday the high-tech future of security for New York City's transit systems, an ambitious plan to saturate subways, bridges and tunnels with a network of 1,000 video cameras, 3,000 motion detectors and a wide array of sophisticated instruments designed to thwart terrorists. Together with a new plan to provide cell phone service in subway stations and a police campaign begun last month to check riders' bags, the new surveillance and security system was a major leap in efforts to do what some have long said could not be done: turn the nation's largest transit system into a hard target, one that would pose as many obstacles as possible for someone who wanted to do it harm. By Sewell Chan.  (The story is scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in a news file.)  Off-lede:  IRAQ (Baghdad, Iraq) -- Secular Iraqi leaders complained Tuesday that the country's nearly finished constitution lays the groundwork for the future domination of the country by Islamic clerics, and that it contains specific provisions that could sharply curtail the rights of women, religious minorities and secular-minded citizens. The secular Iraqi leaders say the constitution, which was presented to the parliament Monday, contains language that not only establishes the primacy of Islam as the country's official religion, but appears to grant judges wide latitude to strike down legislation that may offend the faith. Indeed, to interpret such legislation, the constitution calls for the appointment of experts in sharia, or Islamic law, to preside on the Supreme Federal Court. By Dexter Filkins.

FOLD  GOOGLE-VALLEY (San Francisco) -- For years Silicon Valley hungered for a company mighty enough to best Microsoft, the behemoth to the north that has dominated its realm, the software that powers the personal computer, like few corporations in business history. Now Silicon Valley has one such contender in Google. Not only has Google's phenomenal success spurred Microsoft to develop its own Internet search engine (a project the software maker has code-named Underdog), but Google has legions of engineers banging away on a range of projects of its own that, if successful, could dislodge Microsoft from the pre-eminent spot it has enjoyed since the early 1980s. But now that Silicon Valley can boast of a legitimate powerhouse all its own, its denizens are feeling skittish about the size and power of this growing beast among them. Instead of embracing Google as one of their own, many fret that the very strengths that allow it to take on a giant like Microsoft are turning it into an alien -- even a threat -- to the entrepreneurial culture from which it grew. By Gary Rivlin.  POLICE-PROFILING (Washington) -- A government bureaucrat is paying a price for refusing to cooperate with his superiors on a report on police profiling. By Eric Lichtblau.  (The story is scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in a news file.)  MIDEAST-RDP (Sanur, West Bank) -- Israeli soldiers and police officers on Tuesday completed the evacuation of 25 settlements in Gaza and the West Bank and said that all settler homes would be reduced to rubble within the next 10 days. The political battle to approve this pullout was intense. But it was done with little significant violence and considerable care on the part of the security forces. The Palestinians, too, largely held their fire, keeping a pledge from president Mahmoud Abbas that the Israeli pullout would not take place under a hail of rockets and mortars. The relatively easy withdrawal may also make it harder for Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon, to withstand pressure for further negotiated withdrawals from the West Bank, even though he insists that there will be no more such unilateral retreats. By Steven Erlanger.  (The story is scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in i news file.)  An early lede, slugged MIDEAST-WESTBANK, has moved.  BORDER-SECURITY (Washington) -- Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, acknowledging public frustration over illegal immigration, said Tuesday that the federal government's detention and deportation system must be fundamentally restructured. We have decided to stand back and take a look at how we address the problem and solve it once and for all, Chertoff said during a breakfast meeting with reporters. The unusually blunt assessment by the nation's top immigration official comes after governors in New Mexico and Arizona recently declared a border-related state of emergency, citing a surge in smuggling and violence associated with the steady flow of illegal immigrants. By Eric Lipton.  (The story is scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in a news file.)  ROBERTSON-ASSASSINATE (Undated) -- Conservative Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson has made news over the years for making explosive comments on his daily television show lambasting everything from feminists and activist judges to the United Nations and Disneyland. Now Robertson has set off an international firestorm by saying that the United States should assassinate Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez. It's a whole lot cheaper than starting a war, and I don't think any oil shipments will stop, Robertson said on his program on Monday. On Tuesday, the vice president of Venezuela denounced Robertson for making terrorist statements, and in Washington a spokesman for the State Department called the comments inappropriate. By Laurie Goodstein.  (The story is scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in a news file.)  AUTOS-FUEL-ECONOMY (Detroit) -- The Bush administration's long-awaited plan to overhaul fuel economy regulations was released and swiftly met with a harsh reception from environmental groups, who said it would do little to slow the nation's swelling oil consumption. Federal officials said their plan would save 10 billion gallons of gasoline over two decades, or more than 20 days' worth of gas under current consumption trends. But critics of the new proposal, which covers rules for sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans, said it would make it difficult to accurately forecast fuel savings and could open new avenues for automakers to game a regulatory system already known for its loopholes. By Danny Hakim.  (The story is scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in f news file.)  FETUS-PAIN (Undated) -- Taking on one of the most highly charged questions in the abortion debate, a team of doctors has concluded that fetuses probably cannot feel pain in the first six months of gestation and therefore do not need anesthesia during abortions. Their report, in The Journal of the American Medical Association, is based on a review of several hundred scientific papers, and it says that nerve connections in the brain are unlikely to have developed enough for the fetus to feel pain before 29 weeks. The finding poses a direct challenge to proposed federal and state laws that would compel doctors to tell women having abortions at 20 weeks or later that their fetuses can feel pain and to offer them anesthesia specifically for the fetus. By Denise Grady.  (The story is scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in a news file.)  MOVIE-SLUMP (Los Angeles) -- With the last of the summer blockbusters fading from the multiplex, Hollywood's box office slump has hardened into a reality that is setting the movie industry on edge. Multiples theories for the decline abound: A failure of studio marketing, the rising price of gas, the lure of alternate entertainment, even the prevalence of commercials and pesky cell phones inside once-sacrosanct theaters. But many movie executives and industry experts are beginning to conclude that something more fundamental is at work: Hollywood movies, they say, have lost their edge. By Sharon Waxman.  (Story has moved in the e news file.)  NCAA-INDIAN-NAMES (Tamiami Trail Reservation, Fla.) -- The NCAA will allow Florida State to use its Seminoles nickname in postseason play, removing the school from a list of colleges with American Indian nicknames that were restricted by an NCAA decision earlier this month. The NCAA said it was recognizing the relationship Florida State has long enjoyed with the Seminole Tribe of Florida, which assists the university with its pageantry and celebration of its culture and supports the school's use of its name.

CYC-ARMSTRONG-DRUGS (Paris) -- In a major challenge to Lance Armstrong's domination of the Tour de France, the French sports newspaper L'Equipe charged Tuesday that the American rider frequently used an illegal performance-enhancing drug in 1999 to win his first of seven consecutive Tours. Armstrong, 33, who retired July 24 after his latest victory, strongly denied the charge. He has been under suspicion and investigated a handful of times since his comeback in 1999 from testicular cancer, but has never been proven guilty of doping. By Samuel Abt and Lynn Zinser.

In cooperative housing, said Janice Blanchard, a gerontologist and housing consultant in Denver, the social consciousness of the 1960s can get re-expressed. Baby boomers, she predicted, are going to want to re-create the peak experience of their lives. Whether a commune or a college dorm, the common denominator was community. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
