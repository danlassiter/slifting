CITY STREETS  From Phyllis Mysilk:  During a recent visit with relatives in Los Angeles, while watching a movie being filmed, we were introduced to the Important Producer. I used the archaic, ``How do you do?,'' to which he replied: ``Such a New York response! I love it! Don't you love it?'' They loved it.  Later on, the Noted Actor told us about a play he was rehearsing in an out-of-the-way theater. I asked him if one had to be a member of Actors' Equity to appear in a theater in Los Angeles. He responded, ``Such a New York question.''  Several days later, we went to a party at the home of the Famous Actress. As I handed her the hostess gift we had brought, she exclaimed, ``Such a New York gesture!''  On our next trip to La-La Land, we're taking along a phrase book so we can communicate with the natives.  From Stephen Banker:  Subways, crowded as they are, provide fertile ground for the study of human behavior.  For instance, the other afternoon, I was waiting for the southbound R train at Lexington Avenue (59th Street). Just as the train pulled in, the Queens-bound train arrived at the opposite side of the platform. As the trains arrived, I spotted a man, 25-ish and neatly dressed, looking at the two trains. Then he rhythmically pointed his index finger at one train, then the other, and so on, as his lips silently mouthed, ``Eeny, meeny, miny, mo.''  From Joan Rubenstein:  Generations come, generations go, and not that long ago it was quite common to hear the word ``Bubbie.'' Now, here we are in the mid-1990s, and where have all the Bubbies gone? We hear ``Grandma,'' we hear ``Nana,'' we hear ``Granny.'' So, what about ``Bubbie''?  When my granddaughter, Alexa, was starting to talk, she found it difficult to say ``Grandma.'' ``Bubbie'' came easier, and for the last two years, we settled for that. Recently, though, I decided the time had come to move beyond Bubbie. For one thing, I don't feel like a Bubbie, nor do I look like a Bubbie.  What's more, I'm the only one I know whose grandchild calls her that, even in public.  So, the other day I tried again.  ``Say `Grandma,''' I said. She did.  ``Say `Nana,''' She did that, too, loud and clear. I pointed to myself. ``Who is this?'' I asked. There was a pause, followed by a smile and on to a big love-filled ``Bubbie.''  Stylish or no, Bubbie is back, at least in one home.  The scene: The music department, Barnes &AMP; Noble, Ridgewood, N.J.  Dramatis personae: Two salesclerks, assisting a young male customer, and Seymour Sally, who witnesses the little session.  Salesclerk No. 1: ``He's looking for something performed by Beethoven. Did he perform anything, or did he only write music?''  Salesclerk No. 2: ``If he did perform, we wouldn't carry anything he did: he was deaf.''  The customer walked away Beethoven-less. But under his arm was the book he was about to purchase: ``How to Be Twice as Smart.''  BILL'S WORLD  By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star  In two New Hampshire hamlets voters went to the polls at midnight Tuesday. That's the way Americans often vote _ in the dark.  ``Memo to St. Peter: Be a little cautious with your new arrival, Charles O. Finley. He may try to buy the angels and move them.  Major league baseball is asking umpires to expand the strike zone this year. It would be ironic if the umps balked.  Ward Balk, our spring training correspondent, says the early part of camp has been devoted mostly to pitching, catching and product endorsing.  Overheard on our bus: ``For Lent this year I've decided to give up paying off my Christmas bills.''  The Oklahoma City bombing trial has been moved to Denver. Apparently this wasn't one of those events for which chambers of commerce were competing.  ``We will go all the way,'' says Pat Buchanan. Folks worried about him can take heart that he didn't specify to where.  Liddy Dole says her husband ``has the energy of 10 people.'' Hope she means live ones.  Bob Dole certainly expected an easier time of running for president this year. Still, it's not for nothing that it's known as a cam-pain.  Steve Forbes says he'll consider asking Bill Bennett or Jack Kemp to be his running mate. Each of them might want to keep his day job.  GOOD DAY, WIRE WANDERERS!!!!!
