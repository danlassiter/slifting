Enormous changes happen so gradually, she reflects, that you never notice them. In 1990, history spoke to Jordan's Iowa farm family in the voice of a bank. After 40 years of working the farm that had been in the family since 1867, and living from year to year, Russel and Mary Jane Jordan were told by the bank's new owners that theirs was considered ``a troubled account'' and that their farm was ``on the danger list.'' Unless the Jordans could pay off a $220,000 debt, the bank would remove its fiduciary life support systems and foreclose. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

MIDEAST (Jerusalem) _ A ledeall: The Israeli army planned to withdraw overnight Monday from some Palestinian-controlled territory in the West Bank, Israeli officials said, as Israel moved under U.S. pressure toward meeting Palestinian demands for formal cease-fire talks. The announcement came after a rare joint meeting of Israeli and Palestinian security chiefs, drawn together by Anthony Zinni, who as the Bush administration's envoy here is pushing hard for a truce after two previous attempts failed. Vice President Dick Cheney arrived here Monday for meetings with Israeli officials. On an 11-nation tour of the region, Cheney has been seeking Arab support for a possible war on Iraq, but he has found his trip dominated instead by appeals to address the conflict here.

SCI-DELPHI-ORACLE (Undated) _ Modern scholarship long ago dismissed the explanation that the ancient Greeks gave for the Delphi oracle's inspiration: vapors rising from the temple's floor. They found no underlying fissure or possible source of intoxicants. Experts concluded that the vapors were mythical, like much else about the site. Now, however, a geologist, archaeologist, chemist and toxicologist have teamed up to produce a wealth of evidence suggesting the ancients had it exactly right. The region's underlying rocks turn out to be composed of oily limestone fractured by two hidden faults that cross exactly under the ruined temple, creating a path by which petrochemical fumes could rise to the surface to help induce visions.

This disturbing news from the Children's Defense Fund comes as budget shortfalls have forced many state governments to change their policies to make welfare checks and child care subsidies more difficult to get.  The US Senate should seize the opportunity to change this sorry state of affairs when it considers reauthorization of the welfare reform legislation of 1996 later this month.  According to the CDF, the number of black children living in poverty has surged to 966,000 from 809,000 in 2000. The group defines extreme poverty as $7,064 or less in disposable annual income for a family of three. Overall, the study found that fewer and fewer extremely poor children of all races are receiving cash public assistance.  Separately, a General Accouotmng Office report last week said that since 2001, 23 states have made changes to their child care assistance policies to decrease the availability of aid.  Fortunately, Massachusetts wasn't one of the states to report that it had stopped enrolling new families or narrowed coverage by changing income guidelines. Bus caused unemployment to rise at the same time the Bush administration is making it harder for the poorest children and their families to received federal assistance. As a result, the poorest of the poor are falling behind. They have no welfare and no work.  Federal welfare funding has been stuck at $16.5 billion a year since the reform law was enacted in 1996 despite the eroding by inflation of the value of those dollars. And while trumpeting hundreds of billions of tax cuts for the wealthy, President Bush supports only a measly $1 billion increase over five years for child care subsidies, a fraction of the $11 billion the Democrats have asked for. He also wants states to double work requirements for welfare recipients to 40 hours a week for parents with children under 6. Where does he suppose they will work? Even the summer youth jobs that Boston provides are facing cutbacks.  So it falls to the Senate to make sure that the extremely poor get the help they need and that those fortunate enough to have made the transition from welfare to work get child care and others services to sustain their climb out of poverty. A good start would be leaving the work requirements as they are and funding child care subsidies at more than the $1 billion, five-year plan proposed by the House.  The well-being of those nearly 1 million blicK$children hangs in the balance. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20030512.0054 type=advis > <HEADLINE> DEFENDING VETERANS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 05-12-03 20:01:00EDT (BC-EDITORIAL-VETERANS-BO) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Just weeks before he sent a new generation of US troops into battle in Iraq, President Bush filed a budget that would trim veterans' benefits and reduce drastically the assistance the government provides for the education of vhe cat the cost to programs and personnel he verbally embraces.  After an outcry from veterans' organizations and active-duty personnel, Congress has taken steps to restore the funds. But its capacity to do so in coming years will be curtailed if it approves tax cuts so large that the federal government can no longer afford its most basic responsibilities.  The 10-year, $15 billion reduction in pensions and disability compensation for veterans was part of a proposed administration policy of across-the-board, 1 percent cuts in discretionary spending even as it plans to forgo`$76 billion in revenue through its requested tax cuts. Only the budgets of the Defense Department and the Ho-elnd Security Department are exempted.  The proposed across-the-board cut came a few days after the underfunded Veterans Affairs Administration ordered its health facilities to cease enrolling veterans seeking care if the applicants don't have service-connected conditions or are not indigent. Last year the VA told its hospitals to stop outreach encouraging veterans to use the facilities.  The Bush budget also proposed to cut funding for the civilian schools that bear the burden of educating military children by $172 million, or 14 percent. Districts, including Bourne on Cape Cod, have received this ``impact aid'' since the 1950s because the Defense Department's mammoth facilities generate no property taxes, and property taxes are the base of public school funding. Communities with large federal public housing projects also benefit. The Bush plan would have eliminated altogether funding for children whose parents work on the bases but live in civilian housing.  When the chief of staff of the Air Force, General John P. Jumper, was asked about the cut at a meeting of the Senate Armed Services Committee, he said, ``It is certainly a concern to the Air Force and as father of a child who goes to a school that benefits from this sort of aid.'' Congress got the message from Jumper and others, and its budget resolutions now call for a slight increase in impact aid over last year.

, he wonders,	 While this column has been preoccupied with topics like war, pestilence, and gluttony, the pronunciation complaints _ Iraq-related and otherwise _ have been piling up. My editor heard Wolf Blitzer identify Lori Piestewa, the first female American soldier killed in the war, as a member of the ``Hoppy'' tribe of Arizona. American troops kept reporting the discovery of another weapons ``cachet.'' And a friend phoned to relay the latest broadcasting gaffe: ``They're saying `jubyulant'!'' Hopi, of course, rhymes with soapy. The hidden arms are a cache _ pronounced like cash. (Will we ever find Saddam's cache of cash?) Some guns, in some quarters, do have cachet, that indefinable mark of distinction, and both words derive from the French cacher, ``to hide.'' But only the fashionable cachet rhymes with sashay. As for those briefly ``jubyulant'' Iraqis, it's bad enough that we're living in the ``nucular'' age and calling weddings ``nuptuals.'' There is no joy in mangled jubilation; let's keep that i flying high. Readers' inquiries have been less topical, but no less urgent. ``I wonder what you make of the rapidly growing pronunciation of the t in often?'' asked Christian Alexander in an e-mail. ``Affectation, or return to an older norm?'' Well, it's true that the t was sounded before the 17th century, but that's probably not why it persists in the 20th. Those who dislike ``off-ten''(FD)including Charles Harrington Elster, author of ``The Big Book of Beastly Mispronunciations''_ say the word should have the silent t of softEn,0hasten, and moisten. But often isn't a verb, and maybe its mispronouncers are imitating after or, as Alexander suggests, oft. Or maybe ``off-ten'' is just a fad; ask again in 20 years. What's up with white? ``In words beginning with the digraph wh the pronunciation depends on regional and social factors,'' wrote Robert Burchfield in his 1996 revision of Fowler's usage guide. Mary Carrig, an Irish native, had noticed that: She doesn't think white and W}:2':: 40;2, she says. One of the ``social factors'' affecting whether you ``aspirate'' whack (``hwak'') or say it wack may be age: The distinction is fading fast in America. Dictionaries from the 1960s call for aspirating most of the wh- words, but nowadays both pronun!iations are recognized: Whip or wip cream, as you like. Can't hear the difference? If you think the slang for genius is spelled wiz, not whiz, you're probably not an aspirator. Norman J. Selverstone may have an even keener ear than Carrig: He's peeved by the way people say engine and engineer. ``I have yet to hear a speaker on TV or radio pronounce them other than as injun or injuneer,'' he wrote. ``Is this now the norm?'' Well, dictionaries still give the e sound as the start of engineer. But in practice, the vowel can be closer to i (and has been, for some speakers, since the 14th century) without counting as mispronunciation. Like many words with the en prefix, engineer has a Latin ancestor _ ingenium, ``invention'' _ that starts with in. Whether the Latin prefix arrived in English as en or in was a matter of historical chance, which is why we have synonym pairs like insure/ensure. If you can hear the difference, you may be listening too hard. For Julio H. Vazquez, the problem is habanero, Spanish for someone or something from Havana. Why, he wonders, do English speakers say the name of the chili pepper(FD)or of Carmen's famous aria, the (feminine form) Habanera _ as if the n had a tilde? It's not ``habanyero,'' noted Vazquez.
