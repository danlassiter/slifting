"628"	"you"	"recall"	" It looked for a while there, sir, as if we might have a short-term solution to the problem of Haitian refugees. Panama had offered to accept several thousand. But when the Panamanian government realized that it had misjudged the degree of opposition, it turned around and said it would not take refugees after all. It appears that our options are getting more and more narrow. I'm worried that for reasons either practical or political we may wind up invading Haiti. The last time we did this, you recall, we were there for nearly 20 years. Is there an answer to this problem? (Signed) Concerned </P> "	"nyt_eng_199407.gz"
"3246"	"they"	"recall"	" Everyone has a tale and most are eager to tell their's. When they left their homeland, they recall, they had no idea President Clinton late last week would reverse decades of policy toward Cuban refugees and re-route them to here. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199408.gz"
"9779"	"you"	"recall"	" Those hapless characters, you recall, are crushed in Hamlet's schemes for revenge, just as the curious theater critics who venture out of their seats and onto the stage in ``The Real Inspector Hound'' are suddenly implicated in the deadly complexities of an Agatha Christie mystery. The booby traps are everywhere. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"
"14544"	"you"	"recall"	" For a better baseball analogy, consider Clinton as the Atlee Hammaker of this interminable game. Former Giant Hammaker, you recall, was known as a self-destructing Hamlet, and once gave up a grand slam in an All-Star game. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199502.gz"
"18069"	"you"	"recall"	" And then I think of okra. To be accurate, Harvey Bourland made me think of okra. He was the impresario, you recall, who launched the fig festival for the benefit of a steeple for little Sardis Methodist Church. He has thought again and now wants to combine it with an Okra Olympics for this year. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"
"19143"	"you"	"recall"	" It was Titus Moody, you recall, who, when asked by Fred Allen what he thought of radio, replied, ``I don't hold with furniture that talks.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"26444"	"you"	"recall"	" Last time, you recall, I promised to discuss presidential politics today but _ lucky, lucky you! _ it now seems we can skip it. I know, I know: You planned to skip it anyhow. I was hoping to skip it myself. Discussing presidential politics on a sweet day in June, as Lyndon Johnson once said of the jokes at the Gridiron Dinner, is ``about as much fun as throwing cow flops at the village idiot.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"26711"	"you"	"recall"	" CBS is coming because it needs the Fiesta Bowl as badly as the Fiesta Bowl needs it. CBS, you recall, lost the NFL to Fox a year ago, one of the more spectacular screw-ups in TV history. It didn't happen on Kenin's watch, I should hasten to add. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"27974"	"you"	"recall"	" These are the sons, you recall, whom Smith strapped into their car seats before pushing her Mazda Protege into a lake and then standing by as the boys sank into the water and drowned. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"27975"	"you"	"recall"	" The article also verifies that it was perfectly consistent with Smith's character to murder her children and then concoct that story about their being kidnapped by a black carjacker. It was a story, you recall, that created a nationwide wave of sympathy, concern and fear, and it was nothing but a self-serving hoax fabricated by a vicious killer who was trying to cover her tracks. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"35571"	"you"	"recall"	" It also wasn't long after the prosecution's hopelessly ill-advised decision to have Simpson try on the infamous ``bloody gloves'' in front of the jury. The gloves, you recall, did not appear to fit Simpson's massive hands. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"35742"	"you"	"recall"	" Griffey, you recall, had tagged Wetteland for that ninth-inning, game-winning two-run shot back on Aug. 24.

"36846"	"you"	"recall"	" If that Cromwellian cranium did ramble, the heart of Romanticist poet Percy Bysshe Shelley stayed at home, not far from his loving wife, Mary. It was she, you recall, who wrote ``Frankenstein.'' While in Italy, Shelley had the bad sense to go sailing without a personal flotation device and drowned in heavy seas. With great difficulty, a friend found the drowned remains of the poet and arranged for cremation. While Shelley's corpse was in the medium-rare stage, the friend reportedly reached in and took the heart. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"

Lifestyle, Entertainment  ROSES _ undated _ MOVIES: In the new romance ``Bed of Roses,'' Mary Stuart Masterson plays a ``career'' woman with a big corporate title, a big Manhattan apartment and an empty little life.

When We Were Colored,'' pays tribute to a generation of African-Americans who never got a break coming or going. They were the generation after slavery and before  lunch counter sit-ins. (e)  SCREAMERS _ undated _ MOVIES: The last snore you hear will be your own. (e)  National  CHALLENGER-2takes _ undated _ It was something that engineers and astronauts whispered among themselves, but dared not let slip publicly. They knew that despite 24 successful launches, the space shuttle was not the safe and reliable space transportation system that NASA, the space agency, was touting unabashedly in news briefings, press releases and speeches. On Jan. 28, 1986, the rest of the nation also learned that horrifying secret. (a)  WIDOW-IRS _ ATLANTA _ Nothing is certain except death, taxes and the resolve of Hazel Gaines. The 74-year-old widow from Norcross confronted the Internal Revenue Service on Thursday, as promised. Call it a draw, with reservations. ``I cou ld have thrown myself at the mercy of a moving dump truck with more result,'' said a disappointed Gaines. (a)  SOTTO _ ATLANTA _ A Vinings, Ga., man who spent years pursuing vehicular homicide charges against a Wisconsin trucker after his wife died in a wreck broke down in sobs Thursday when a jury acquitted the trucker. (a)  JORDAN-TRIAL _ LUMBERTON, N.C. _ Daniel Andre Green set out to steal the shiny red Lexus parked along the dark highway, but he fired a shot through the half-opened window that killed basketball star Michael Jordan's father, the prosecution's star witness testified Thursday. (a)  JALOPY _ DAYTON, Ohio _ It's an American tradition, the cheap first car you drove to the prom or your first job, held together with rope, baling wire and a case of oil in the trunk. But the jalopy may be a thing of the past, done in by _ among other things _ the Ohio Emissions Test, required in Clark, Montgomery and Greene counties to help the area meet federal air quality standards. (a)  MUSHROOMS _ STUART, Fla. _ A second Treasure Coast judge threw out a case of possessing hallucinogenic mushrooms Thursday in the wake of a recently discovered 18-year-old Florida Supreme Court decision that says mere possession of the fungus is not illegal. (a)  Business  SURGEON _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A West Palm Beach orthopedic surgeon won a $55 million award Thursday from a federal jury that ruled a medical manufacturer stole his idea for an artificial hip socket. Dr. Raymond G. Tronzo said he was stunned at what the jury ordered Biomet Inc. of Fort Wayne, Ind., to pay for infringing his patent. Biomet had claimed that another doctor designed i ts acetabular cup, a key component in hip-replacement surgeries. (f)  YOUNGERHOMEBUYERS _ ATLANTA _ Younger, less affluent and more likely to be single. That's a snapshot of the typical metro home buyer in 1995. (f)  Sports  KINDRED-COLUMN _ TEMPE, Ariz. _ Sunlight dancing on his shades, his ball cap turned backwards, a smile always there, Erric Pegram is loving this Super Bowl. He has good reason. Once lost in the black hole of Atlanta's run- and-shoot offense, Pegram has been found by the Pittsburgh Steelers. (s)  SUPERBOWL-EMMONS-COLUMN _ TEMPE, Ariz. _ Troy Aikman wasn't standing in the pocket. He was sitting in front of a table, perched on a platform. But wave after wave of adversaries came straight at him. (s)  Commentary  NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Democrats gave President Clinton loud applause when he called for an increase in the minimum wage during his State of the Union address. Republicans gave him dirty looks. The minimum wage is one of those defining issues that divide liberals and conservatives. (k)  MURRAY-COLUMN _ ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ I watched the State of the Union address. I always do. I don't know why. Nothing ever comes of the State of the Union address _ the only exception, I recall, being Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty d eclaration, and you see where that's gotten us, 'lo these 30 years later. President Clinton all but declared a War on Welfare in his speech. (k)  LATHAM-COLUMN _ undated _ I dreamt I was a Republican last night. It was not so much a nightmare for me as it would be for all those out there who are true, blue-blood Republicans. I awoke in the middle of the night with the words of Sen. Bob Dole ringing in my ears. (k)  EZZARD-COLUMN _ undated _ Envision the Oval Office next century _ minus its male legacy. (k)  BORDERS-COLUMN _ NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Four years ago I spent one of the most fascinating months of my life, sitting in a small classroom in the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas. I was a student in a gr aduate seminar taught by Barbara Jordan.

OLY-TRACK _ ATLANTA _ Forget that he is the World's Fastest Man, owner of the world record for the 100-meter dash. Forget that he has won an Olympic relay gold medal.

OLY-HUMMER-COLUMN _ PHOENIX _ What you see in one of America's most explosive swimmers is pretty much typical of any late-blooming, left-brained, motivationally challenged doctor's son. That is to say, you see a pretty good deal. What you see in Gary Hall Jr. is the embodiment of carefree youth. He is a walking summer's day, a 6-foot-6 breeze.  OLY-INSIDER-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ For months, the corner storefront of the graceful white stone building had gradually shown hints of life, beginning with handwritten signs declaring that it was the future home of the Slovenian Olympic Committee.

"48718"	"you"	"recall"	" Symington, you recall, co-chaired Dole's Arizona campaign in 1988. And it was Dole who cut a last-minute but powerful commercial for Symington in 1991 _ the one rebutting Sen. Howard Metzenbaum's implications about Symington wrongdoing at Southwest Savings &AMP; Loan _ that helped Symington come from behind in that gubernatorial race to topple the Democrats' then-Golden Boy, Terry Goddard. Dole even hosted fund-raisers for Symington's 1994 re-election campaign, including a standing-room-only event in the downtown Hyatt Regency ballroom. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"
"63072"	"you"	"recall"	" Mexico's economy, you recall, fell into disrepair after the government devalued the peso in December 1994 to reduce the country's ballooning trade gap. That caused investors, who were concerned Mexico wouldn't be unable to pay back obligations due in the coming year, to balk at extending fresh credit. Emergency care, in the form of a $52.8 billion global rescue package, was required to keep Mexico afloat, though it didn't prevent the country from falling into its deepest recession in six decades. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199606.gz"
"67724"	"I"	"recall"	" One of George Meredith's heros, Richard Feverel, I recall, in the Victorian novel ``The Ordeal of Richard Feverel,'' looks forward happily to laying down some good Burgundy for his newly born son. It's one of the earliest references, literary or journalistic, that I can think of that acknowledges the aging potential of the pinot noir grape. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199608.gz"

"68901"	"you"	"recall"	" Dole, you recall, unveiled a massive $540 billion tax-cut plan the week before the GOP convention.

"69641"	"I"	"recall"	" We walk back through town, breathing the invigoratingly cold mountain air, and snuggle under our fluffy down comforter at the Hotel Belmont. In three trips, I can report with much happiness, nothing at all has changed. Well, nothing but the price (which, I recall, has pretty much doubled each time we've been back.) </P> "	"nyt_eng_199608.gz"
"81986"	"they"	"recall"	" It was, after all, on Christmas Day 1979, they recall, that Ellis and another firefighter assigned to Engine Company 22 in the South End had entered a burning building on West Concord Street and rescued two people unconscious and trapped on the third floor. The following year, Ellis's bravery was honored when his name was placed on the department's Roll of Merit. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"
"115379"	"I"	"recall"	" Twenty years ago, on my first visit to Europe, my wife, Jeri, and I had arrived by train at the Gare de Lyon. We walked straight to the Metro ticket window to buy, on the advice of our guidebook, a money-saving carnet of 10 tickets. At the time, I recall, they sold for 44 francs. I carefully counted out 50 francs, just to be sure I had it covered. When I reached the head of the line I held up 10 fingers, said, ``S'il vous plait'' and slid my money across the counter. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
