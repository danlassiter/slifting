Times News Service  U.N. TRIBUNAL HEARS OF MASS MURDERS  THE HAGUE, Netherlands (NYT) _ The international war crimes tribunal shivered Wednesday with the details of mass murders as court investigators and U.N. troops pieced together in public the role of the Bosnian Serb commander in the widespread killing of civilians in Srebrenica, once designated a city of refuge in Bosnia.  Jean-Rene Ruez, a French police detective in charge of the Srebenica investigations for the prosecution, described events that were planned and executed with great precision as three brigades of the Bosnian Serb army overran the city in July 1995. Once occupied, at least three days of mass murder followed in and around the city. Ruez said that Muslim men and boys and even small children were tortured, mutilated and murdered on such a scale that Srebrenica became an emblem of the evil committed during the Bosnian War.  U.S. PROMISES ARMS SHIPMENTS TO BOSNIA  SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (NYT) _ The Clinton administration promised Wednesday to begin weapons shipments to Bosnia as early as this month if the Bosnian government approves a new defense law that would merge Muslim and Bosnian Croat troops.  But while the offer to the Bosnians of $360 million in military aid may sound tempting, Defense Secretary William Perry was unable to secure a promise that the defense law would be approved, a reflection of the shakiness of the so-called confederation of Muslims and Croats.  ``As soon as the defense law is approved, I will begin full-scale action'' to provide the Bosnian military with weapons and training, Perry told reporters after a meeting here with the Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic. ``Agreement is near on that.''  But not, he conceded, near enough.  HILLARY CLINTON, POLISH WOMEN ACTIVISTS MEET  WARSAW, Poland (NYT) _ Hillary Clinton came to talk with women in Poland Wednesday and surprisingly found, six years after the end of communism, much what she finds at home: issues that range from sexual harassment to credit access, from family violence to politics.  She heard about the low number of women in public office, discrimination in employment and weak laws protecting the rights of women. But Mrs. Clinton, who had come as role model and listening post, ended up being a cheer leader with some practical tactical advice.  At a roundtable discussion with more than a dozen women activists hosted by Jolanta Kwasniewska, the wife of the Polish president, Aleksander Kwasniewski, Mrs. Clinton advised the women to join together in common cause.  ``I sense a lot of energy and good ideas and differences in approach by the organizations,'' Mrs. Clinton said.  NETANYAHU FACES CABINET CRISIS OVER SHARON  JERUSALEM (NYT) _ In a blunt public confrontation with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Foreign Minister David Levy threatened to resign Wednesday if his political ally, Ariel Sharon, is not appointed to the cabinet by the time Netanyahu leaves for Washington on Monday.  The spat before television cameras and microphones at a meeting of Netanyahu's governing coalition exposed the simmering political tensions that have plagued the early days of his new administration.  It also demonstrated how traditional party politics have hamstrung attempts by Netanyahu, Israel's first directly-elected prime minister, to use his enhanced executive powers to govern like an American president.  CHECHENS SEE VOTING AS POINTLESS  GROZNY, Russia (NYT) _ The roads were deserted and the streets where empty in the normally bustling capital of this separatist Caucuses Republic, as people stayed at home to avoid Wednesday's blistering heat.  Many of Chechnya's potential 507,242 voters seemed to be more interested in watching a special triple feature of Mexican soap operas than participating in the Russian presidential elections.  Many feel that voting here is pointless saying that the results are known in advance. A highly placed official in the pro-Moscow Chechen government admitted that the voting was rigged.  ``In abnormal situations, we have to take abnormal measures,'' the official said, referring to the 17-month-old war that has left the capital in ruins and devastated the countryside.  ``We have fixed the elections here because we need to make sure that the Russian elections take place, otherwise the elections could be invalidated if Chechnya didn't participate. The last thing we need in Chechnya is more chaos in Moscow,'' said the official. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960703.0514 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-FINBRIEFS-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> (ATTN: Ohio, Tenn., Ind., Pa., Md., Ark.

"117796"	"he"	"conceded"	" From an early age, he had difficulty living up to the high expectations his family set, he told friends. His father was a professor, his mother was a pediatrician, and his two brothers went on to earn advanced degrees. His own path, he conceded, was more tortured. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"120457"	"he"	"conceded"	" ``I didn't have much competition in the `70s, just Monty Hall giving $5,000 to a woman dressed as a chicken-salad sandwich,'' he recalled. In the '80s, he conceded, his show found it difficult to secure appearances by conservative commentators, who found Donahue's liberal politics anathema. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"
"120757"	"he"	"conceded"	" Dr. Wulf H. Utian, executive director of the North American Menopause Society, said he wants to see the results of that study before he makes a final decision on whether to recommend estrogen use. Still, he conceded, the accumulating evidence warrants that physicians adopt new thinking on hormones. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"
"121517"	"he"	"conceded"	" He is not so strict, however, about Elvis impersonators, who, he conceded, do have the First Amendment right of free speech. ``They're a headache, but we'd miss them if they went away,'' he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"122545"	"he"	"conceded"	" ``The thing I like the most about the show is something happens,'' Mizrahi said. What happens, he conceded, may be as minimal as one of Garofalo's Labradors urinating on the all-white set or Mizrahi shopping with Kristin Davis or singing ``Sweet Lotus Blossom.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"122571"	"he"	"conceded"	" But, he conceded, there might be a benefit to what he called ``an assault on our cultural ecology.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"127446"	"he"	"conceded"	" Technology can be misused, he conceded, citing the Sept. 11 attacks. And some people recoil at the thought of creating cyborgs _ hybrids of man and machine. But people already have implants in their brains to combat conditions like Parkinson's disease, so in Kurzweil's view the question of whether to create cyborgs has already been answered. For him, the issue is how rapidly science and technology move forward. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"128195"	"he"	"conceded"	" Still, he conceded, ``it is insane. Maybe the Giants might do something, but not this year. It's kind of wait till next year already.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"128196"	"he"	"conceded"	" Still, he conceded, ``it is insane. Maybe the Giants might do something, but not this year. It's kind of wait till next year already.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"128199"	"he"	"conceded"	" Still, he conceded, ``it is insane. Maybe the Giants might do something, but not this year. It's kind of wait till next year already.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"128206"	"he"	"conceded"	" French attitudes toward blacks, he conceded, are ambiguous. The cradle of human rights, Paris raised a statue early in the last century to Toussaint-Louverture, the black Haitian liberator. For years, the French have regularly denounced American racism, and the road from Harlem to Paris was wide, inviting talented African-Americans like the singer Josephine Baker, musicians like Sydney Bechet and writers like Richard Wright, Langston Hughes and James Baldwin. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"128241"	"he"	"conceded"	" Still, he conceded, ``it is insane. Maybe the Giants might do something, but not this year. It's kind of wait till next year already.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"128242"	"he"	"conceded"	" Still, he conceded, ``it is insane. Maybe the Giants might do something, but not this year. It's kind of wait till next year already.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"128805"	"he"	"conceded"	" This newer wave of visitors, nevertheless, has caused some controversy. A hint of annoyance is sometimes evident as church members complain that they are on display. One Harlem minister admitted to mixed feelings about visitors who tend to behave like members of an audience rather than as worshipers. Few bow their heads in prayer. Fewer still join in as the congregations sing from their hymnals. But, he conceded, language may be a barrier to participation. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"129498"	"they"	"conceded"	" In a concluding chapter of their book, Steckel and Rose said the study showed that ``the health decline was precipitous with the changes in ecological environments where people lived.'' It is not a new idea in anthropology, they conceded, ``but scholars in general have yet to absorb it.'' </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20021028.0210 type=story > <HEADLINE> FDA VOWS CRACKDOWN ON CONTACT LENSES </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 10-28-02 17:10:00EST (BC-SCI-CONTACT-LENSES-NY) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"129945"	"he"	"conceded"	" ``Let's say you're a successful artist _ your last album sold, say, 1.5 million copies,'' he said. A performer with such a track record might negotiate an advance against royalties of around $1 million. This, he conceded, sounds like a lot of money. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"135377"	"she"	"conceded"	" ``We're convinced once you watch us, you'll continue to come back and watch us,'' Ong said. And yes, she conceded, the New York-area audience, which includes a sizable cadre of decision-makers, advertising executives and business heavyweights, is one whose loyalty she would love to have. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"139106"	"he"	"conceded"	" The education, he conceded, started in 1999. The Colts, who one year earlier had taken Peyton Manning with the No. 1 pick in the draft, had used the fourth choice to select James after his brilliant career with the Hurricanes. He possessed great talent, and there was an equal amount of cockiness, too, but during the course of that first season, James realized he had moved on to a more serious level of football. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200401.gz"
"139224"	"he"	"conceded"	" It would be, he conceded, a ``longshot.'' Longshots, however, sometimes win, said Kucinich, mentioning the race horse Seabiscuit. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200402.gz"
"142648"	"he"	"conceded"	" One month ago, in an essay posted on a progressive Web site, Burkett theorized that Killian would have been a likely person to know more about Bush's service. But, he conceded, I have found no documentation from LTC Killian's hand or staff that indicate that this unit was involved in any complicit way to ... cover for the failures of 1Lt. Bush ..  Burkett went on the say, On the contrary, LTC Killian's remarks are rare. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"144469"	"he"	"conceded"	" Carruth said he never intended the film to mirror his life. But, he conceded, when you're in a garage in the July heat of Dallas, filming a story about a bunch of guys in a garage in the July heat of Dallas, it can start to seem self-referential, rather like his favorite branch of math: nonlinear dynamics. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"145249"	"he"	"conceded"	" BayBio, the trade group representing biotech companies in the Bay area, did not even get around to endorsing Proposition 71 until last Thursday. Matthew M. Gardner, its president, said the organization was waiting for answers to some questions from the measure's backers. But, he conceded, for most of his members Proposition 71 was not the first thing on their mind. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"145655"	"he"	"conceded"	" Chances of a mass reversal in the Democratic ranks are slim to none, Democratic strategist David Axelrod said. I don't think if we opposed a constitutional amendment before, we should support it now, Axelrod said. That would be craven and stupid. But, he conceded, the 11-state sweep did signal a greater truth about the dilemma facing his party. There is a more meaningful question about values that needs to be addressed. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"146152"	"he"	"conceded"	" Albright calls himself an optimist, believing that inspections and persuasion can still prevent wider proliferation, but, he conceded, we've reached a point where if we don't solve some of these problems, it becomes overwhelming. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"149771"	"he"	"conceded"	" We're not top tier in scale and size, said Brian D. Finn, a First Boston veteran who was recently named the firm's sole president. While he said the firm was first tier in businesses it has focused on, such as leveraged finance and private equity, he conceded, that there's a top five and a second five, and we're second five. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"
"150640"	"she"	"conceded"	" Rhimes said she was thrilled to get the chance to inherit the big Housewives audience. Of course, she conceded, it's a little scary -- there's some pressure. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"151124"	"he"	"conceded"	" But, he conceded, he could have sold at other times during the year, and said that fact reduced the sympathy he received from some on Capitol Hill, although he has hopes that Congress may make it possible for people in his position to get their alternative minimum taxes back if the shares collapse before they are sold. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"155192"	"he"	"conceded"	" Even now, Woodruff can't explain why he and his wife, Sharon, took a chance on the ambitious young architect who had never built a house. It is, he conceded, perhaps the craziest thing he has ever done. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"156927"	"he"	"conceded"	" Lynton said he would focus on making only movies we hope will be really good. At Fox, executives said they were looking to limit marketing costs. At Universal, Shmuger said he intended to reassert time and care and passion in movie production. Some of his own summer movies, he conceded, should never have been made. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"157159"	"she"	"conceded"	" Thus began a life of being the youngest in the room. The weird one. The Wunderkind. The Doogie Howser. Many people, she conceded, didn't view her as normal, and she always looked forward to the day when everyone in the room knew her story, why she was there, so they could stop asking their questions. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"159816"	"he"	"conceded"	" Brim says he does not know the full identities of the leakers. Judging by the quality of the copies, which generally arrive as digital images or scanned copies, he suspects they are either from store employees or printing plant workers, neither of whom, he conceded, may be authorized to distribute the circulars. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"161111"	"he"	"conceded"	" That attitude, he conceded, might have cost us the SEC title. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"161636"	"he"	"conceded"	" Bob Baffert, who has trained three Kentucky Derby winners, said he has an especially strong group of 3-year-olds in his barn. But most, he conceded, are unproven. Bob And John has won only once, and others, such as Point of Impact, haven't won. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"163401"	"she"	"conceded"	" The alternative, she conceded, is to try to pay-as-you-go, working through school and dragging out the time to a degree through part-time attendance, raising the cost per credit. The ultimate solution? Low tuition is the best form of financial aid, Moore said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"164186"	"she"	"conceded"	" OK, she conceded, so no one died, and her players initially laughed off the stigma, which she helped them do during the following practice by having them shoot 113 layups apiece from the left side and the right, instead of the customary 100. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164495"	"he"	"conceded"	" The shipment delay, he conceded, was a bit painful, but we're trying to take a leadership role here and do the right thing. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164500"	"he"	"conceded"	" The shipment delay, he conceded, was a bit painful, but we're trying to take a leadership role here and do the right thing. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"169152"	"she"	"conceded"	" That news leaves some parents less than thrilled. It's not OK if kids see something in a magazine and emulate it outright, said Karen DiDonato, Ally Zingarelli's mother. Still, she conceded, a teenager fussing over what to wear is better than if your child simply rolls out of bed and pulls on her sweatshirt and jeans. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060809.0139 type=advis > <HEADLINE> CIRCUITS-BUDGET-NYT </HEADLINE> <TEXT> Circuits stories from The New York Times News Service for Thursday, Aug. 10.  CIR-CIRCUITS-COLUMN (Undated) -- David Pogue's weekly State of the Art column: Canon's new HD camcorder, smallest (tape) HDTV camera in the world, and Sony's newish HC3.  CIR-SWITCHING-TO-MAC (Undated) -- Ten years ago, if you were a Windows user, the idea of switching to a Macintosh might not have seemed enticing. An abundance of new Windows software was arriving on store shelves, while the selection available to Mac users seemed to be falling behind. Today the calculation is different. Apple Computer, through a series of transitions, has reinvented itself. With a new operating system, its own chain of retail stores, the iPod and now a new line of computers that run on Intel processors, this new and more mainstream Apple is catching the attention of Windows users, and many are curious about switching. But is switching a good idea? There are pluses and minuses to consider. By Thomas J. Fitzgerald.

"170023"	"he"	"conceded"	" And how is the business? It came off the rails last year, he conceded, blaming poor technology decisions. But now things are looking up. I feel like a patient coming out of having his knee replaced, he said, adding that he expected to be jogging later this year and sprinting in early 2007. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"170807"	"he"	"conceded"	" Still, he conceded, There was never any question that it was going to be a talky film. Its language is theatrical. It's not going to be of interest to anyone who won't go with that. So, he said, the movie's $3.4 million price tag was calculated to make the movie a sensible proposition for release in Britain, and the BBC, Fox Searchlight Pictures and DNA Films put up the money. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"170813"	"he"	"conceded"	" Many teachers came to see the play in London, he said. It broke their hearts, because they can't teach like that anymore. They can't walk into a classroom and simply transmit their enthusiasms. But, he conceded, You can't organize an education purely along Hector's lines. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171156"	"she"	"conceded"	" The range of offers, she conceded, is reasonable. I just wish it could have been a little bit more. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
