"11389"	"we"	"act"	" ``We're actors, we act, we get out of ourselves,'' Matthau explained. ``I was 27 in my first role on Broadway, playing an 85-year-old English bishop in `Anne of the Thousand Days.' Unfortunately, when you play a New York City sportswriter and it makes $40 million, producers want you to keep playing that kind of thing. Don't dare try to play a rabbi in Hong Kong -- that's wrong, but that's how it is.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"
"14688"	"you"	"act"	" ``It doesn't do any good to blame the system, you act,'' says Cox, sitting in his basement in southwest Atlanta. ``They say racism is rampant in this country, but you can't let that hold you back, and I never did.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199502.gz"

The cast of John Doyle's feverishly inventive reconception of Stephen Sondheim's and Hugh Wheeler's macabre 1977 musical might be subtitled I Am My Own Orchestra. But having a gloriously fine-tuned cast -- including Michael Cerveris as the title razor wielder and Patti LuPone as his partner in cannibalism -- make its own music turned out to be much more than a clever gimmick. The device concentrates narrative control in ways that only enhanced the show's hypnotic hold on its audience. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
