Harris Wofford, D-Pa., who put this issue on the national agenda when he won an upset victory in 1991, now often reminds his colleagues that the 1957 Civil Rights Act, a modest federal entry into the problem of discrimination in voting, was seen by many at the time as woefully inadequate, undeserving of support. But it proved to pave the way to a slightly more confident step in 1960 and then to the historic laws of 1964 and 1965.

"25160"	"he"	"contends"	" Petitioner nevertheless argues that, because the conduct giving rise to the cocaine charges was taken into account during sentencing for the marijuana conviction, he effectively was ``punished'' for that conduct during the first proceeding. As a result, he contends, the Double Jeopardy Clause bars the instant prosecution. This claim is ripe at this stage of the prosecution although petitioner has not yet been convicted of the cocaine offenses because, as we have said, ``courts may not impose more than one punishment for the same offense and prosecutors ordinarily may not attempt to secure that punishment in more than one trial.'' Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161, 165 (1977). See also Ball v. United States, 470 U. S. 856, 861, 864-865 (1985) (explaining that, for purposes of the double jeopardy inquiry, punishment ``must be the equivalent of a criminal conviction and not simply the imposition of sentence''); Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall., at 173. Thus, if petitioner is correct that the present case constitutes a second attempt to punish him criminally for the same cocaine offenses, see Helvering, 303 U. S., at 399, then the prosecution may not proceed. We agree with the Court of Appeals, however, that petitioner's double jeopardy theory that consideration of uncharged conduct in arriving at a sentence within the statutorily authorized punishment range constitutes ``punishment'' for that conduct is not supported by our precedents, which make clear that a defendant in that situation is punished, for double jeopardy purposes, only for the offense of which the defendant is convicted. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"25161"	"he"	"contends"	" JUSTICE STEVENS disagrees with our conclusion because, he contends, ``(u)nder the Guidelines, an offense that is included as `relevant conduct' does not relate to the character of the offender (which is reflected instead by criminal history), but rather measures only the character of the offense.'' Post, at 5. The criminal history section of the Guidelines, however, does not seem to create this bright line distinction; indeed, the difference between ``criminal history'' and ``relevant conduct'' is more temporal than qualitative, with the former referring simply to a defendant's past criminal conduct (as evidenced by convictions and prison terms), see USSG s4A1.1, and the latter covering activity arising out of the same course of criminal conduct as the instant offense, see USSG s1B1.3. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

"49379"	"he"	"contends"	" Second, respondent asserts that appeal of denial of the summary-judgment motion is not available because the denial rested on the ground that ``(m)aterial issues of fact remain.'' This, he contends, renders the denial unappealable under last Term's decision in Johnson v. Jones, 515 U. S., at --- (slip op., at 7-10). That is a misreading of the case. Every denial of summary judgment ultimately rests upon a determination that there are controverted issues of material fact, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56, and Johnson surely does not mean that every denial of summary judgment is nonappealable. Johnson held, simply, that determinations of evidentiary sufficiency at summary judgment are not immediately appealable merely because they happen to arise in a qualified-immunity case; if what is at issue in the sufficiency determination is nothing more than whether the evidence could support a finding that particular conduct occurred, the question decided is not truly ``separable'' from the plaintiff's claim, and hence there is no ``final decision'' under Cohen and Mitchell. See 515 U. S., at--- (slip op., at 7-10). Johnson reaffirmed that summary-judgment determinations are appealable when they resolve a dispute concerning an ``abstract issu(e) of law'' relating to qualified immunity, id., at --- (slip op., at 12) typically, the issue whether the federal right allegedly infringed was ``clearly established,'' see, e.g., Mitchell, supra, at 530-535; Davis v.

"63074"	"he"	"contends"	" Gray's claim is encompassing, but it is fundamental. Under the Due Process Clause, he contends, a capital defendant must be afforded a meaningful opportunity to explain or deny the evidence introduced against him at sentencing. See Brief for Petitioner 45; Reply Brief for Petitioner 5. The District Court concluded that Gray was stripped of any meaningful opportunity to explain or deny the Sorrell murders evidence, for his lawyers were unfairly ``ambushed'' clearly surprised and devastatingly disarmed by the prosecutor's decision, announced on the eve of the penalty trial, to introduce extensive evidence other than Gray's statements. App. 349-351. Gray's counsel reasonably relied on the prosecutor's unequivocal ``statements only'' pledge, see id., at 342, made at the outset of trial; based on the prosecutor's assurances, defense counsel spent no resources tracking down information in police records on the Sorrell murders. The prosecutor's switch, altogether unanticipated by defense counsel, left them with no chance to uncover, through their own investigation, information that could have defused the prosecutor's case, in short, without time to prepare an effective defense.

At any suggestion that his age and experience level might be liabilities, Ford bristles. Moved 1-4.  KLUGE-METROMEDIA-NYT (Undated) _ When John Kluge was a sophomore at Columbia University in 1935, he flirted with the idea of moving to China to start a competitor to the British East India Co. Six decades older and $7 billion richer, Kluge is finally making his foray into China _ bringing wireless telephone service to a country where tea is common but talking on the telephone is not. The venture, he contends, is far more than an aging man's fantasy. By Mark Landler.W/color photo. Moved 1-5.

Moved 1-6.  MOTHER-MOVIE-LADN (Los Angeles) _ As mothers go, she's been much speculated about. After all, daughter Carrie Fisher made her literary debut with a thinly veiled autobiography, ``Postcards From the Edge,'' that described a drug-addicted actress who battles with a spotlight-stealing show-biz mother. So it would seem like a bold move for actress Debbie Reynolds to make a movie called ``Mother'' in which she plays the title role. By Amy Dawes.Moved 1-2.

By Steve Oney.Moved 12-31.  TECHINE-FILM-NYT (Paris) _ Andre Techine is not one for self-promotion. In the world of auteur movies, where the director is often revered like a guru, this shy, ascetic-looking Frenchman does not opine on political issues, rarely appears on television and is not surrounded by a court. Fear of flying even prevents him from attending most film openings or festivals more than a train ride from here. Instead, he allows his movies to speak for him. By Alan Riding.W/photo. Moved 12-26.  SELENA-FILM-ART-NYT (Poteet, Texas) _ Long before the murder that belatedly brought her to the attention of the English-speaking world, Selena had earned the title Queen of Tejano Music and the affection of Mexican-Americans in small towns like this one. So it was only fitting that when a Hollywood production company decided to transform the martyred singer's short life into a movie and to film some of its concert scenes at the county fairgrounds here, the crowd of extras that assembled was full of people who had seen the real Selena perform and adored her.

Just ask the members of the New York Philharmonic, who have toiled in his shadow for the last five and a half years. But in Leipzig, a storied cultural capital, where memories of Bach and Mendelssohn, Goethe and Schiller have been fitfully preserved, Masur is regarded as a peer among giants, and his physical size is only a part of his stature.

By Steve Oney.Moved 12-31.  TECHINE-FILM-NYT (Paris) _ Andre Techine is not one for self-promotion. In the world of auteur movies, where the director is often revered like a guru, this shy, ascetic-looking Frenchman does not opine on political issues, rarely appears on television and is not surrounded by a court. Fear of flying even prevents him from attending most film openings or festivals more than a train ride from here. Instead, he allows his movies to speak for him. By Alan Riding.W/photo. Moved 12-26.  SELENA-FILM-ART-NYT (Poteet, Texas) _ Long before the murder that belatedly brought her to the attention of the English-speaking world, Selena had earned the title Queen of Tejano Music and the affection of Mexican-Americans in small towns like this one. So it was only fitting that when a Hollywood production company decided to transform the martyred singer's short life into a movie and to film some of its concert scenes at the county fairgrounds here, the crowd of extras that assembled was full of people who had seen the real Selena perform and adored her.

The software's Internet-connection features, he contends, makes server computers more susceptible to a Web intrusion known as a distributed denial of service attack, in which attackers remotely commandeer hundreds of personal computers connected to the Internet and use them to release a disabling deluge of data against a Web site.  WELCH APPLIES HIS SKILLS TO A BOOK  John F. Welch Jr., the chairman of General Electric, made his public debut as an author at BookExpo, the annual book industry convention, in Chicago. The book division of AOL Time Warner, which acquired the rights to Welch's book, ``Jack: Straight From the Gut,'' is undertaking one of the biggest campaigns in publishing history. And with good reason. To break even on the $7.1 million advance it paid Welch, the company will have to sell 700,000 copies.

From there we jump to the seventh century and Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, whose martyrdom was strategically adopted by Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran's war with Iraq in the 1980s.

They are, he contends, undercounted, misunderstood, and sadly unappreciated -- an untapped resource for bioprospecting to find drugs among their thousands of venoms. Not many of the venoms have been studied, even though they can play havoc with crucial functions like blood clotting, nerve and muscle activity, blood pressure and heartbeat. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
