William Weld of Massachusetts, a rising star in the Republican Party, was given a ticket for speeding Sunday afternoon on Interstate 84 in New York, The Boston Globe reported Tuesday.   The governor was returning from a vacation in Virginia when he was stopped for going 74 miles per hour in a 55-mile-per-hour zone.   ``I was driving along, had a couple of kids in the car and just was not paying attention,'' he told reporters Monday. ``I think speeding is serious business and I should have been paying more attention.'' A court will determine the fine, which could be up to $200.   Perhaps Weld should consider going elsewhere on trips. The Boston Globe reported that in the early 1980s when he was a federal prosecutor, he attended a wedding in Virginia and was accused of smoking marijuana there. A Justice Department investigation cleared him of the charges.   More recently, he was visiting in the state when a mistake on his income tax return was discovered.

AT TOBY PERLMAN'S SUMMER MUSIC CAMP, HAVING FUN WILL BE MANDATORY WHISTLER'S MOTHER WAS A COOK AS WELL AS A ROCKER (ll) By  c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  NEW YORK _ Itzhak Perlman sat at the back of his living room Monday evening to listen to some gifted young violinists, cellists and pianists, and neither he nor the audience seemed to mind that he was not playing.  The occasion was a sneak preview for friends and supporters of Hamptons Summer Music, a study program being established by Toby Perlman, Perlman's wife. Thirty students from 11 to 18 will attend the first session, from Aug. 12 to Aug. 26, at Boys Harbor in East Hampton, N.Y.  Several of them performed before a dessert and coffee reception.  Though they will have plenty of music lessons and will be introduced to chamber music performance, Mrs. Perlman explained that she is determined to give the young people a dose of normal camp life.  ``There will be time for swimming and hanging out, and there will be enforced recreation,'' she said.  The idea, she continued, ``came from my own experiences as a struggling violin student and my husband's experiences as a struggling genius.''  ``The easiest part of being a musician is playing the concert,'' she said. ``We want to approach the human issues, to talk about all the stuff that people are afraid of talking about, such as stage fright. Everyone is scared when they walk on stage, even stage animals.''  What Hamptons Summer Music won't have, she said, is Hamptons glamour.  ``We're not getting lots of famous people to give master classes,'' she said. ``At least the first summer, we don't want any glitz. If my husband does something, no one will know about it.''  c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  Think Whistler's mother did nothing but sit around in that chair all day?  It turns out that she was quite a formidable cook, and Tuesday, her recipes for muffins and pastries were whipped up for a breakfast to preview ``James McNeill Whistler,'' an exhibition that opens at the National Gallery of Art in Washington on Sunday.  The recipes came from a book with the unsurprising title, ``Whistler's Mother's Cookbook,'' published by Pomegranate Artbooks.  It was edited by Margaret MacDonald, a curator of the show and a co-author of its catalogue.  Mrs. MacDonald, a research fellow at the Center for Whistler Studies at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, used Anna Whistler's handwritten recipes for the book, as well more than 6,000 letters written between mother and son in the university's collection.  Revising the recipes, which include ``collard eels'' and ``federal pudding,'' for the modern kitchen was no easy task, she said at the breakfast, because in some cases Mrs. Whistler had written down only the most rudimentary instruction, as in ``bake.''  ``When I started doing the book, I didn't have much sympathy for Whistler's mother,'' Mrs. MacDonald said. ``Now, I'm 50, and I sympathize. What put me off at first about Anna Whistler was that she was very religious, and everything for her was just God's will.

"26165"	"I"	"continued"	" That being the case, I continued, the question must be whether Iliescu will have the ability to translate his vision into reality. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"26183"	"she"	"continued"	" ``The teacher said he needed more money,'' Ms. Bluestein said. At that point, she continued, Namen began to feel he had done something wrong, and on June 16 he reported the matter to a safety officer at Jamaica High School. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"26299"	"he"	"continued"	" Yet, he continued, those countries ``do not consider it necessary to use a device like our Fifth Amendment, under which an accused person may not be required to testify.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

"27310"	"she"	"continued"	" Still, she continued, after missing the public meeting two school board members did not return phone calls informing them of Monday night's emergency meeting; one said he would attend but did not, and two ``indicated to me that there was no need to call an emergency meeting.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"28336"	"I"	"continued"	" Listen to this. Yesterday, I heard myself explaining, with a perfectly straight face, that every time there's an outage, we have to re-set the buttons on our fax and answering machines. And imagine, I continued, some of these people live like this all year round. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"28644"	"she"	"continued"	" `` Minnesota always felt warm and welcoming, a place where you could be yourself,'' she said. But within months, she continued, she felt she was living in ``a prison made out of windows,'' adding, ``Gossip can be all over town in 15 minutes.'' Branded ``Wild Child`` on the cover of Mpls. St. Paul magazine, she left her job as a reporter at the Twin Cities CBS-TV affiliate and moved back to Los Angeles, where she is now the host of ``Q &AMP; E`` on the E! cable channel. ``Minneapolis still kind of gives me the creeps,'' she said. ``What I love about L.A. is that I can be invisible.'' Repotted adults often build parts of the metropolis into their new lives. Mr. Bolender, who now wears a Yankees cap to Mariner games, lives with his wife in a loft in Seattle and can walk to work, which he said was one of the things he loved about living in Manhattan. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"

"30527"	"he"	"continued"	" Keith Wheeler, writing for the Time-Life World War II history series, gave this account: The old man pointed out that their discussion had shown an unbridgeable divergence of views. So, he continued, ``We have no precedent _ and I find it difficult to do _ but with the greatest reverence, I must now ask the emperor to express his wishes.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"

"31866"	"he"	"continued"	" That movement, he continued, ``has been followed by the AIDS epidemic, and that has been another one that got people looking at their treatment as active participants, active consumers.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"32433"	"he"	"continued"	" National City, he continued, had been interested in acquiring Integra since it merged with Equimark, another Pittsburgh-based banking company, about three years ago. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"32848"	"he"	"continued"	" Yet, he continued, ``Lois &AMP; Clark'' made twice the advertising money for ABC as ``Murder'' made for CBS. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"32923"	"she"	"continued"	" After a moment, she continued, Fuhrman resumed his invective. ``And then he said, `If I had my way, I'd gather _ all the niggers in the world would be gathered together and burned.'' Ms. Bell called the remark ``probably the most horrible thing I had ever heard someone say,'' adding, ``What frightened me even more was that he was a police officer.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"33029"	"he"	"continued"	" ``The only place getting fair value and relative return on investment right now is the short end,'' Roden said. ``Those who run balanced money portfolios, with cash in short maturities and cash in longer maturies are finding it tougher and tougher each day, he continued, and will soon have to decide how to deploy cash that is building up. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"33591"	"he"	"continued"	" Powell, who writes in his autobiography that he turned down offers from President Clinton to become secretary of State, said in the interview that he was ``not a fan of the manner in which foreign policy issues are hammered out in this administration.'' There is, he continued, ``too much tactical judging from day to day and week to week.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"33600"	"he"	"continued"	" ``This was a classic compromise, and every compromise bears the taste of bitterness,'' Izetbegovic wrote. But, he continued, ``haven't we agreed that the war only continues to destroy the being of Bosnia and that the continuation of the war suits the war criminals _ that it feeds them and defends them and that peace will in one way or another destroy them?'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"

"33986"	"he"	"continued"	" He praised the panel for its stamina and attentiveness, particularly after one juror helped label an exhibit. ``I can tell by the expression on your faces every day that you're all tired, almost as tired as I am,'' the judge said. But, he continued, ``You're clearly as much on top of this as some of the lawyers and maybe more so than me. I know it's tough, but hang in there.

"34777"	"he"	"continued"	" ``Big, family-sized condos are so hot you can feel the heat right down to the bottom of your feet,'' said Clark Halstead, head of the brokerage that bears his name. In the '80s, he continued, ``developers _ in their wisdom _ built teeny-weeny chicken coops, because the conventional wisdom was that they'd get more per square foot. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"

"35481"	"he"	"continued"	" Richer countries with an interest in stable markets, he continued, should subscribe to the proposed $50 billion emergency fund that the IMF will use to bail out emerging economies in difficulties. Rubin predicted the new fund would be in place sometime next year. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"35619"	"he"	"continued"	" ``We are trapped and we'll have to get out of this honorably,'' said Denard, adding that he would go quietly, without a fight. France, he continued, has ``given us the works. This could have been avoided perhaps with a bit more flexibility.'' He suggested that he would surrender the following day. ``It's now just a matter of hours.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"36035"	"he"	"continued"	" But, he continued, ``What we can't agree to is price rollbacks that will impact on the quality of care.'' He said the reductions were so severe that they ``will unquestionably cause some physicians to leave Medicare.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"36249"	"he"	"continued"	" ``What's the point of showing people an everyday room?'' Despont said. A show house is worth doing, he continued, ``only if you can be completely fantastic.'' This year, he got his wish. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"

"38927"	"he"	"continued"	" If Israel annexed the West Bank and Gaza, he continued, 35 to 40 percent of Israel's population ``will be Palestinians who don't like to live under our roof, who oppose the destiny of the Jewish state... </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"

"39715"	"she"	"continued"	" She said she was initially ``miffed'' that march organizers did not invite women. ``I don't want to be relegated to frying chicken in a movement for our liberation,'' she said. But in retrospect, she continued, ``there are things that only black men can do for our community.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"
"40428"	"she"	"continued"	" At such festivals, she continued, students are exposed to the three fundamentals of dance education: technical training, watching great performers and participating in good talk. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"

"42563"	"he"	"continued"	" ``If they can be a reporter on a local station, and maybe a weekend anchor, earning very good money, living in decent places to raise families, why should they go overseas and earn less money as a network reporter and cover dangerous stories?'' he asked rhetorically. The answer, he continued, should be that they aspire to be serious journalists, not television celebrities. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
"42631"	"she"	"continued"	" ``I don't have any doubts that in participating in the election, you were guided by principled motives,'' she wrote to the leaders of several minor parties that are widely expected only to siphon votes from more viable groups. But, she continued, ``you are confusing the democratically oriented voters and you are making the victory of Communist and nationalist forces much easier.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
"43170"	"he"	"continued"	" The epidemic, he continued, has ``decimated our audience, who've been so loyal. And, of course, we've lost the performers, the men who've taught me everything I know'' _ Bill Vehr, John Brockmeyer, Ethyl Eichelberger, Georg Osterman and Ludlam. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
"43584"	"he"	"continued"	" ``In a general sense there is nothing wrong with this approach,'' Holland said. ``It has led to tremendous successes.'' But reductionism and the linear mathematics on which it relies, he continued, have hit some serious snags in the last 100 years.

"45211"	"he"	"continued"	" ``She is a unique first lady,'' Miller said. Ever since she led the failed effort at national health care reform, he continued, the White House seems to have been stymied ``not only on how to make her a positive _ but how to not make her a negative.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"
"45847"	"she"	"continued"	" Ms. Huber testified to routinely packing away the billing records last summer in a box destined for her own office, assuming they were left out on the table as part of the usual filing routine. She did not think about them again, she continued, until she discovered them on Jan. 4 in renovating her office, looked at them and realized that the committee was searching for them. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"
"47078"	"he"	"continued"	" ``I shared their concern,'' he said Monday night, speaking from his office in Elysee Palace. ``I know that nuclear tests can inspire fear.'' But, he continued, nuclear weapons served peace by deterring aggression. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"

"49298"	"he"	"continued"	" Over its history, he continued, the people of New Orleans ``fell into a pattern of social interaction in which they knew everything about their neighbor's business but put on elaborate pretenses of not knowing.

"49912"	"he"	"continued"	" ``Why are we going to perennially tolerate this type of activity?'' he asked. The American government's attitude, he continued, was one ``of pure hypocrisy, pure demagoguery.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"

"53531"	"he"	"continued"	" Wednesday's forecast, he continued, also indicates that the company may be preparing for an operating loss of as high as $275 million _ a number suggesting that gross profit margins, which had already plunged to 16.4 percent from 30.1 percent a year ago, are still in freefall. That in turn suggests that the company has continued to move too slowly to reduce its expenses, he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"
"53685"	"he"	"continued"	" ``You have to have a crisis before you can mobilize the system to do anything about it,'' Scowcroft said.

"54249"	"she"	"continued"	" When closer examination of the album's cover revealed a used condom lying in a dirt road, she continued, the event's organizers called the band's record label, Geffen, and not only canceled the concert but also asked for a copy of the press release the label had written and a list of every journalist it was sent to. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"

"55289"	"he"	"continued"	" But, he continued, with a stadium on the West Side of Manhattan, people working in the city could walk to games or take any of a half-dozen buses or subways. They would be near restaurants and shows. The area around the new stadium, now utterly barren, would itself be built up with restaurants, stores, maybe a hotel. ``It'll be the biggest shot in the arm that New York City could ever get!'' he exclaimed. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"

"58236"	"he"	"continued"	" Don Scotto, a utility analyst for Bear, Stearns, said the takeover of Midlands would greatly add to the burden of debt at both GPU and Cinergy.

Times News Service  Most of the more than nine million visitors to the Miami area each year come for the weather, the shopping and the beach. So when an erosion problem threatens a picture-perfect vacation in the sun, officials are ready to wrestle over sand.  ``The beaches have certainly eroded,'' said Mayco Villafana, a spokesman for the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau. ``In some cases, in parts of the beach at high tide there's very little beach.''  The erosion problem is not new: Beaches in Dade County, Miami's metropolitan area, were first declared in need of help in the 1950s, and beach replenishment projects are undertaken every five years in selected areas. Now, though, there is a shortage of sand, and beach erosion is overtaking efforts to forestall it as sources of sand are sought.  The sand used to maintain the beaches had come from mining the ocean, but sources near the beach are almost depleted, partly because manmade inlets along the Eastern seaboard are blocking the natural flow of sand to the area. Going into deeper waters to dredge becomes more expensive.  Visitors have not started complaining yet; their objections still tend to focus on debris in the water and overall beach cleanliness, surveys by the Visitors Bureau show. But hoteliers are pushing to address the problem, saying their beaches are slowly disappearing.  ``I have the ocean hitting seawalls behind our hotel property,'' said William Lone, director of the Sunny Isles Beach Resort Association, which has 40 lodging establishments as members. ``I have playgrounds in danger of being underwater.''  After beach emergency vehicles experienced trouble driving at high tide, and in some areas lifeguard stations had to be moved back, sand from the South Beach section of Miami Beach was hauled to the most eroded sections to the north last May as a stopgap measure.  Earlier this week the Army Corps of Engineers was scheduled to convene representatives from regulatory agencies and the dredging and tourism industries to explore longer-term alternatives.  Brian Flynn, beach and habitat restoration chief for the Dade County Department of Environmental Resource Management, said that environmental concerns have also played a role in delaying plans to nourish beaches. The town of Golden Beach, for instance, filed a lawsuit that held up the dredging of sand 1.5 miles east in the Atlantic Ocean until last month, when a judge lifted an injunction against the project. The dredging, which would produce about 500,000 cubic yards of sand for beaches in Sunny Isles and central Miami Beach, is planned for early next year.  But Judy Cuenca, the mayor of Golden Beach, said the town plans to appeal the judge's decision and cited ``serious environmental risks, like killing the coral reefs'' for the opposition to dredging. She faulted Dade County officials for not addressing the beach erosion problem adequately, noting that the sand off her town would be enough for just one replenishment project.  ``They're going with bandage solutions,'' she said. ``They're busy protecting the developers who built too close to the beaches.''  Flynn said there are also attempts to get sand from the Bahamas but that so far the government of the islands, a competitor in tourism, has said no. Another possibility, trucking sand in from dunes in Central Florida, is ``technologically feasible but it's very costly,'' Flynn said.  Typically, 300,000 to 600,000 cubic yards of sand are needed for any given replenishment project. And even in their predicament, officials say they want only good quality sand. If the granules are too big, Flynn said, the sand feels like rocks. If it is too fine, he continued, ``it will compact and sea turtles won't be able to nest in it.''  Of nearly 800 miles of beaches in Florida, some 350 miles now suffer some level of erosion, said Stan Tait, president of the Florida Shore and Beach Preservation Association. He said beaches in Dade County have on average fared better than others but he called the problem ``pretty serious.''  At stake is South Florida's primary industry, worth $8.4 billion a year. Beaches also provide a buffer for waves and storm damage to coastal property.  ``We sit right on the beach,'' said Philip Dailey, assistant general manager of the Delano Hotel in Miami Beach. ``Anything that affects it would affect us.''  c. 1996 N.Y. Times News Service  A village that housed workers at DuPont powder mills and factories in the 19th century is being converted into one of the more luxurious lodgings in the Brandywine Valley near Wilmington, Del. The Inn at Montchanin Village, which opened 22 of its planned 37 rooms and suites in June, is a cluster of simple structures, as befits their history; but interiors are lavish, with windows draped in elegant fabrics, bathrooms paved with marble. The decor takes some unexpected turns _ in the lobby, zebra-striped pillows are tucked into couches covered in a jungle print, and in the 55-seat restaurant, Krazy Kat's, the feline theme extends to the brocade in the waiters' vests.  The inn, owned by the proprietors of a well-regarded local restaurant, the Back Burner in Hockessin, is a stone's throw from Winterthur, the decorative arts museum, and Hagley Museum and Library, the former DuPont powder works. It is a work in progress, with three major buildings currently being restored to house accommodations and meeting rooms. Two caveats: the sloping six-acre property could pose problems for guests with limited mobility, and it is situated at a well-traveled intersection, with some rooms facing the road. There is a train station dating to 1889 nearby, which has been converted into a food shop, and freight trains come through occasionally.

Times News Service  Visitors to the Doges Palace in Venice can now see the recently restored Apartment of the Doges _ rooms that had previously been open only for special exhibitions. The renovation of the apartment, which opened this summer, is part of a larger project that includes the restoration of several palace frescoes and paintings.  The palace served as the seat of government and residence of the Doges since the beginning of the Venetian Republic in the eighth century until its downfall in 1797. The formerly unfurnished rooms, with their ornate fireplaces and carved ceilings, are now filled with 17th- and 18th-century furniture and paintings of the Venetian School, including works by Giovanni Bellini, Titian and Carpaccio.  Other changes include a new entrance to the palace from the Porta del Frumento, three new bookstores, a cafeteria and the opening of the Museo dell'Opera, which had been closed for 30 years and now contains many of the Gothic capitals and columns that once decorated the ground-level portico and loggia.  Among the other recent restorations in the palace are the frescoes and paintings of the Sala della Quarantia Civil Vecchia, where Venice's highest appeals court once sat, and the 4-by-10-foot fresco of ``The Coronation of the Virgin'' in the adjacent Sala dell'Armamento, painted between 1365 and 1368 by the Paduan artist Guariento.  Tickets to the palace, which is open daily, cost about $9.50 and include entry to the Correr Museum on the other side of Piazza San Marco. Information: (39-41) 5224951.  c. 1996 N.Y.

Times News Service  More than 150 works by five of Belgium's best-known modern artists are on display at the Museum for Modern Art in Ostend through Feb. 2 in an exhibition called ``From Ensor to Delvaux.'' The exhibition is a precursor to retrospectives at the Museum of Fine Arts in Brussels over the next three years marking the 100th anniversary of the birth of Paul Delvaux (1897-1991); the 100th anniversary of the birth of Rene Magritte (1898-1967) and the 50th anniversary of the death of James Ensor (1860-1949). The two other artists whose works are now on display in Ostend are Leon Spilliaert and Constant Permeke. Ensor and Spilliaert were born in Ostend; Permeke painted there, and Magritte and Delvaux painted in Brussels.  Admission to the museum, which is open from 10 a.m.to 6 p.m. every day but Monday, is about $10.

Times News Service  A road can be a destination in itself, according to the federal government, which last month cited that criterion in naming six of the country's thoroughfares All-American Roads. They include the Pacific Coast Highway in California, with its views of Big Sur's dramatic seascapes, and the route from Selma to Montgomery, Ala., taken by the 1965 march for voting rights led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  The designation, by the United States Department of Transportation, recognizes natural, historic, cultural, archeological or recreational qualities of the roads.  In addition, 14 roads, including the Seaway Trail in New York and Eastshore Drive in Nevada, have been named National Scenic Byways. The 20 thoroughfares are the first roads to be awarded the federal designations, which are part of the transportation department's National Scenic Byways program.  The project, the federal version of similar state programs, was established to recognize and enhance the best of the country's roads.  Federal funds for the development of services along scenic roads, such as signs, overlooks, information kiosks and rest rooms are available through the program. Brochures about each route are available through the National Scenic Byways Clearinghouse, (800) 428-9297. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19961008.0253 type=story > <HEADLINE> SUNTRUST 3RD-QTR NET UP 11.1% AS FEE INCOME RISES (UPDATE1) </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> Atlanta, Oct. 8 (Bloomberg) (BC-EARNS-SUNTRUST-UPDATE-BLOOM) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"

Times News Service  NEW YORK _ Tricia Nixon Cox and her husband, Edward Cox, will make one of their rare public appearances Wednesday when they talk to 250 high school students before a rehearsal of ``Nixon in China'' at Alice Tully Hall in Lincoln Center.  The students come from the Student/Sponsor Partnership, a program that places disadvantaged teen-agers in parochial schools and teams them up with sponsors who pay their tuition and serve as mentors. Cox is a director and former chairman of the organization.  The opera, which depicts the breakthrough 1972 meeting between President Richard Nixon and Mao Zedong, is being performed in concert at the final night of a three-day Eos Ensemble festival.  Cox, who accompanied his father-in-law on a trip to China in 1979 and served as his note taker, said he hoped to convey the idea that ``a man who grew up in Yorba Linda, Nowhere, could become president of the United States'' and go on to alter the course of foreign policy.  ``Because of the education he received in simple schools where half the kids were barefoot, he perceived that it was not right that the largest country in the world, China, should not have relations with the strongest and most prosperous country, the United States,'' Cox said.  Connecting that thought to the music, he continued, ``I will tell them that high opera celebrates high events and that this was one that changed the world.''  And should the students ask him or his wife about, say, Watergate or Nixon's exit from public office, Cox responded, ``We will answer any question, but we don't think that is part of this event.''  c.1997 N.Y. Times News Service  NEW YORK _ When Susan Weidman Schneider founded Lilith, a quarterly magazine focused on Jewish women and feminism, in 1976, she didn't give much thought to its longevity.  So it is with some degree of surprise that she is planning for the celebration of the magazine's 20th year on Jan. 28 at the 92nd Street Y.  A panel consisting of Paula Hyman, professor of modern Jewish studies and chairwoman of the program in Judaic studies at Yale University; Nechama Liss-Levinson, a psychologist, and Nessa Rapoport, an author of books on Jewish topics, will discuss ``Jewish Feminism: Evaluating Two Decades of Activism.''  ``Originally I didn't have long-term goals,'' Ms. Schneider said the other day. ``I was only thinking about specific changes that I wanted to see, the ordination of women, some repairs in the relationships between Jewish women and men, ending the stereotypes about Jewish women, spurring change in Israel to have women's issues seen as human and civil rights issues.''  How much of that has come to pass?  ``When I looked at the timeline poster we created for Lilith's 20th anniversary, I saw that there has been an enormous amount of change, both structural and attitudinal,'' Ms. Schneider said. ``But one thing I have learned over 20 years is that it is easier to break down structural barriers than to change people's attitudes. There is lots to celebrate but still plenty to change.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19970119.0225 type=story > <HEADLINE> COURT MARTIAL IN RAPE CASE IS SET TO OPEN AT WEST POINT </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WHITE PLAINS, N.Y.

"88215"	"she"	"continued"	" Ms. Reath recalls how she was frightened by frequent childhood trips to the doctor. ``It was an artillery of unknown things,'' she said, recalling ``the smell of alcohol, the syringes, the knowledge that no germ could live there.'' A medical cabinet in her home, she continued, ``would prove to me I'm no longer a child, that I can take control of something scary and frightening.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"

"92262"	"he"	"continued"	" But in the particular circumstances of this case, he continued, the laws ``disproportionately interfere with media freedom.'' The relevant circumstances included these: that the media neither encouraged nor participated in the interception; that the mere receipt of communications illegally intercepted by a third party is not itself illegal; that the conversation was between two officials who ``voluntarily engaged in a public controversy'' and so had ``subjected themselves to somewhat greater public scrutiny'' than two people discussing private matters; that the public interest in the topic of conversation was ``unusually high''; and most striking, that the intercepted conversation raised ``a significant concern for the safety of others.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"
"92711"	"he"	"continued"	" ``There has been an increased police and judicial heavy-handedness,'' he said. ``We see it in the free speech area, and we see it in the sit-in, demonstration area.'' There is no doubt, he continued, that the access law ``had a chilling effect on civil disobedience'' in front of clinics, he said. ``If the same rules had applied to civil rights sit-ins at lunch counters, on buses, people would probably still be in jail today.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"93308"	"he"	"continued"	" Cohen did not rule out the possibility that the disease could have been transmitted from one infected individual, but suggested that the more likely agents were needles or scopes. ``At this time we can't pinpoint how it happened,'' Cohen said of the eight infections. The procedures, he continued, ``are carried out safely on thousands of New Yorkers weekly, and certainly we wouldn't want people to believe that these procedures are dangerous to them.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"93686"	"he"	"continued"	" ``The concern of the immunity inquiry is to acknowledge that reasonable mistakes can be made as to the legal constraints on particular police conduct,'' Kennedy wrote. Thus, he continued, even police behavior that is objectively unreasonable may be entitled to immunity. ``If the officer's mistake as to what the law requires is reasonable,'' Kennedy ruled, ``the officer is entitled to the immunity defense.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"

"94453"	"he"	"continued"	" It was right where the television is now, he continued, that he married his wife, Eva, 50 years ago. She died in 1997, though he pointed her out in many of the photographs. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"

"97744"	"he"	"continued"	" Herman Bang, a Danish contemporary of Ibsen's, pointed out that most of the dramatist's plays ``had been about egotistical men and selfless women.''

"97752"	"he"	"continued"	" As for the chemical industry, he continued, ``we had planned 132 industry inspections this year, but we've carried out only 61 and we have no money to proceed.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"97799"	"he"	"continued"	" Pataki acknowledged old turf wars with the authority, which reports to both governors yet belongs to neither and has repeatedly been attacked by the mayor, who wanted control of the city's airports. ``I have said, `What's going on at the Port Authority?' And the mayor might have made similar comments,'' Pataki said, to laughter and applause. But, he continued, ``I have always known we have good people at the Port Authority, and now the whole world knows we have good people at the Port Authority.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"97980"	"it"	"continued"	" Referring to the United States, and to Afghan guerrilla fighters known as mujahedeen, or holy warriors, it continued, ``If they call the military installations of the Islamic Emirates `training camps' and dub the mujahedeen as `terrorists,' then this is their mistake.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"97997"	"it"	"continued"	" ``The Islamic Emirates of Afghanistan has not received any evidence against Osama bin Laden for it to examine,'' the statement said.

"98398"	"he"	"continued"	" Chalanset, the lawyer for Mr. Perruche, said the issue had been distorted in the public debate. ``This is not a complex philosophical problem,'' he insisted. ``It is about medical errors and about who must bear the consequences.'' The argument, he continued, ``was that the result of the medical errors was not the birth of the child, but the fact that the child lost the chance to be normal.'' </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20011018.0332 type=story > <HEADLINE> ART REVIEW: GLITTERING PRIZES FROM THE EAST, MELDING METALS AND </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-INDIA-BEJEWELED-EXHIBIT-ART-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"

"117841"	"he"	"continued"	" The Adelphia and Tyco matters have attracted more attention, he continued, ``because of the issues of accountability and transparency that are in the headlines.''

The surplus hit 1.3 trillion yen ($11.1 billion) in June, 71.4 percent above the same month a year ago and almost twice the growth that economists expected. Exports rose 8.9 percent in June, the third consecutive raise, while imports slipped 5.1 percent. Japan's trade surplus with the United States, however, grew just 5.6 percent as the yen's rise during the period made Japanese goods more expensive in dollar terms.   SOUTH KOREA: HYNIX BOARD INSTALLED  A new board representing the creditor institutions that have taken over Hynix Semiconductor was installed at a shareholders meeting at the Hynix headquarters in Ichon, south of Seoul. The meeting was difficult, according to the Yonhap news agency, as small shareholders mounted a successful filibuster. Small shareholders delayed the meeting for 90 minutes but could not prevent the creditors from completing their takeover of the company, which owes them more than $6 billion. Nor could the small shareholders persuade the new board to give favorable terms for recouping part of their losses from the steep drop in the value of Hynix shares, which fell another 9.7 percent Wednesday.   EUROPE   FRANCE: VIVENDI TO OBTAIN CREDIT  Vivendi Universal's new chief executive, Jean-Ren Fourtou, said the company would secure new credit lines from banks by the end of August to eliminate any doubts about the company's ability to meet loan repayments. Even so, he continued, Vivendi would still need to sell assets to reduce its debt. Fourtou said a 1 billion euro credit line that Vivendi negotiated with its banks this month had not been drawn upon and would probably be only partly used by the end of August.   BRITAIN: INSURER RAISES RESERVES  Prudential became the latest insurance company to shore up reserves after experiencing losses incurred by rising corporate bond defaults. The company said it would funnel 300 million pounds ($473 million) into Jackson National, its American subsidiary, to cover losses related to corporate bonds. The Credit Suisse Group and Abbey National both recently raised reserves at their insurance units. Aegon and Fortis warned this week that profit for all of 2002 would fall short of expectations. Prudential, Britain's second-largest insurer, also reported a 15 percent decline in first-half profit.   BRITAIN: BANK'S PROFIT FALLS  The British bank AbbeyNational reported a 35 percent decline in first-half profit, as it set aside more money to cover bad loans. Net income was 457 million pounds ($719 million), or 29.4 pence a share, compared with 703 million pounds, or 47.4 pence a share, the year earlier. The company said it set aside 378 million pounds to cover risky investments. The bank replaced its chief executive last week, after previously warning that first-half earnings would fall below expectations. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020724.0178 type=story > <HEADLINE> `FRAGRANT HARBOR': PERSONAL VIEW OF HONG KONG WRAPPED IN A NOVEL'S </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 07-24-02 17:36:00EDT (BC-HONGKONG-BOOK-REVIEW-) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"

"124210"	"he"	"continued"	" Kersten said on Wednesday that four of his agents were working at FBI headquarters in Washington while a similar number of Americans agents were assigned to his office.

"124421"	"he"	"continued"	" Predictably, the area studies establishment initially resisted a shakeup, said Craig Calhoun, a sociologist and president of the Social Science Research Council, a nonprofit institution that finances the training of the next generation of scholars. Throughout the 1990s, ``area studies often reacted to the challenges of globalization defensively,'' he said, ``failing to make the positive case for why local knowledge and languages remained important.'' By contrast, he continued, the core disciplines ``grabbed the globalization theme by saying it was one process the same all over the world,'' an argument derived from ``views on the global economy that powerfully influenced the business types who sit on foundation boards.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"124756"	"he"	"continued"	" First Trnje was shelled from a hill. Then, as two platoons entered the village, they began shooting at the fleeing people, K-41 said.

"131539"	"he"	"continued"	" Nevertheless, he continued, his government had turned around the declining economy and embarked on broad reforms to ease poverty and devolve power to the regional and district levels, and had brought a return to democracy with general elections in October. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"

"132090"	"he"	"continued"	" ``If I were a reporter, I would have written this story, too,'' he said, ``but as Ronald Reagan used to say, facts are stubborn things.'' The fact is, he continued, that the two Saudi terrorists, Nawaq Alhazmi and Khalid Almidhar, who helped hijack American Flight 77 and crash it into the Pentagon, were on American and Saudi ``watch lists.''

"133080"	"he"	"continued"	" Most of his animation artists did not speak English and did not understand the sophisticated verbal humor of the cartoons, he continued, ``but we made 'em as funny-looking as we could under the circumstances, and I guess something clicked between the writing and the cartooning.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"133129"	"she"	"continued"	" And best, her adored toddler, Kate. ``My name is Kate and I just ate/And now I'm going to stay up late,'' Gorayeb, a single mother, would croon.

"133730"	"they"	"continued"	" The resignation, legal experts said, is in one sense an admission of failure and culpability.

"134410"	"he"	"continued"	" Yet McGovern avoids the issue. He refers to terrorism as ``one of the more vexing problems facing us'' but argues that it does not justify an ``obsession with external threats and internal security.'' Other liberals have been more attentive. Last spring in Dissent magazine, for example, Michael Walzer argued in an essay called ``Can There Be a Decent Left?'' that the overemphasis on civil liberties misses the real nature of the threat. Walzer more broadly accused the American left of having been ``stupid, overwrought, grossly inaccurate'' in its condemnations of the United States. Its rationalist and materialist analyses, he continued, have also led to an inability ``to recognize or acknowledge the power of religion in the modern world.'' The left has thus become alienated from its own country, he said, and unrealistic in its expectations. Comparable arguments have been made by Todd Gitlin in Mother Jones and by Michael Kazin in the current Dissent. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"

Madonna? John asked in profanity-laced remarks at the Q awards, at the Grosvenor House Hotel. He said he objected to Madonna's practice of lip-synching during her concerts. Since when has lip-synching been live? he asked. Anyone who lip-synchs in public on stage, when you pay 75 pounds ($135) to see them, should be shot. As the crowd began laughing, he said his comments would get him off her Christmas card list, But do I give a toss? No.  Madonna was not present, nor did she win the award, which went to the British band Muse. But Liz Rosenberg, a spokeswoman for Madonna, rebutted John's complaint. Madonna does not lip-synch; nor does she spend her time trashing other artists, Rosenberg said. She sang every note of her Reinvention tour live. Rosenberg said that Madonna would still send a Christmas card to John regardless of whether he was nice {hellip} or naughty.  -- SARAH LYALL  A CONTRACT MEANS HARMONY IN CINCINNATI  With major American orchestra contracts under negotiation, can portents be read in the settlement reached Sunday night between the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra trustees and the Cincinnati Musicians Association? Under the new three-year agreement running through Sept. 9, 2007, wages will be frozen in the first two years and rise 2.4 percent in the third. The number of full-time orchestra members will be reduced through attrition to 92, from 99. The musicians will receive an additional week of vacation, bringing the total to eight weeks each year. A renegotiated health plan will raise the musicians' co-payments and deductibles and save the orchestra 11 percent a year in premium costs. The minimum weekly scale for musicians this season, $1,725, will rise to $1,750 and $1,800 in the course of the 2006-07 season. Paavo Jarvi, music director of the orchestra, expressed gratitude to the musicians and management for reaching agreement. Contracts with major orchestras in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and Cleveland have expired.  -- NYT  A NEW 'JUDAS'  Sam Rockwell has been cast in The Last Days of Judas Iscariot, a new play by Stephen Adly Guirgis, scheduled to open at the Public Theater in New York early next year. Rockwell, 35, known for his work in films including Confessions of a Dangerous Mind and Charlie's Angels, will play Judas in a production directed by Philip Seymour Hoffman. According to publicity materials, the play, a production of the Labyrinth Theater Company in collaboration with the Public, tells the story of the New Testament's most infamous and unexplained ultimate sinner, in a time-bending, seriocomically imagined world between heaven and hell. The Public also said Monday that George C. Wolfe, the company's outgoing producer, would direct This Is How It Goes, a new drama by Neil LaBute, which is to open in March. An announcement on Wolfe's successor is expected this month.  -- JESSE McKINLEY  CULTURAL CRACKDOWN  Iranian officials have canceled several concerts organized by foreign embassies after hard-liners warned against the spread of Western corruption. The Culture Ministry refused to give permission for two Italian concerts last week. The Swiss and Spanish embassies put off their concerts after the Culture Ministry made the request. The German Embassy has sold tickets for a concert in Tehran on Friday, and there are no signs yet that the concert will be put off.  Pressure on social and cultural freedoms has increased since May after a hard-line legislature took office. Protesters gathered outside a cultural center in the city of Zanjan last week and forced the authorities to cancel a women's concert, the daily Jomhouri Islami reported Sunday. The paper said demonstrators had protested against immoral behavior at musical concerts. Concerts were banned after the Islamic revolution of 1979, but restrictions were eased after the election of the reformist President Mohammad Khatami in 1997.  -- NAZILA FATHI  DISPUTE OVER ANNE FRANK  Should Anne Frank be granted Dutch citizenship? That was the issue at the heart of a debate in and out of government in the Netherlands on Monday after a television channel listed her among 202 candidates in a popular vote to determine history's greatest Dutch person, The Associated Press reported. Members of Parliament campaigned during the weekend to grant posthumous citizenship to Frank, the German-born World War II diarist who perished as a stateless teenager in the Holocaust after 25 months in hiding in Amsterdam. But Rita Verdonk, the immigration minister, said there was no provision in the law to do so. Some historians and keepers of the Frank legacy argued that making her a citizen would not change her place in history and could denigrate other refugees by depriving them of recognition. Frank, born in Germany in 1929, came to the Netherlands with her family as a Jewish refugee in 1933 and kept her diary before she was captured and died in a concentration camp at 15 just before the end of the war.  LITERARY ACCOLADE  The authors of a banned investigative book on the hardships of Chinese peasants have been given a $60,000 international literary journalism prize in Berlin. The 2004 Lettre Ulysses Award for the Art of Reportage was given to the married couple Chen Guidi and Wu Chuntao for their book A Survey of Chinese Peasants on how farmers endure widespread corruption, violence and illegal taxation by Communist officials. The book was published in China in January and sold more than 150,000 copies before it was banned by officials in March. The authors were also sued for defamation. The second prize, worth $36,000, was awarded to the American author Tracy Kidder for his book Mountains Beyond Mountains, about the anthropologist and physician Paul Farmer. The American journalist and writer Daniel Bergner won the $24,000 third prize for his investigative work Soldiers of Light, about the civil war in Sierra Leone.  -- KIRSTEN GRIESHABER  FOOTNOTES  The German architect and structural engineer Frei Otto, 79, has won this year's Royal Gold Medal for Architecture, The Guardian of London reported.

But all too often when disaster strikes -- from here in Honduras, which suffered through Hurricane Mitch six years ago, to Iran, where the ancient city of Bam was shattered by an earthquake one year ago, to Mozambique, which endured floods in 2000 -- the mission seems to last only as long as the media attention.

His previous three capital convictions were reversed for prosecutorial misconduct, and he goes on trial for a fourth time on Monday. His lawyers say the new prosecution, which seeks a life sentence, is motivated by vindictiveness and fueled by anger at Rideau's prominence as a prison journalist. (He co-directed a documentary nominated for an Oscar, won a Polk Award and was called the most rehabilitated prisoner in America by Life magazine.) His guilt is essentially undisputed, and prosecutors say his brutal crime means he should never taste freedom again.

, they depart,	 This novel is melancholy, surreal and funny all at once. In 1990, something happens to Maple Rock, a working-class suburb of Detroit: Its men begin to disappear. One by one, they depart, quietly and without leaving behind any trail of marital discord or obvious discontent. One man writes a note that says only I'm going to the moon. I took the cash. From then on, that's where teenage narrator Michael Smolij and his friends think all of their fathers are: on the moon. The immediate consequences of this abandonment -- dazed and angry mothers working two jobs to support their families, teenage boys serving as sexual partners for older women -- occupy the early pages of the book, but then it becomes a more conventional coming-of-age story for Michael and his friends, who navigate the waters of maturity with only memories of their flawed fathers to guide them. The story, which is wistful yet surprisingly comic, loses some of its focus in the last 50 pages but is a promising first effort from Bakopoulos, a former bookseller from Wisconsin. </P> 	nyt_eng_200501.gz
, he noted,	 In 1862, after seeing his brother's name on a casualty list from the Battle of Fredericksburg, Walt Whitman set out from New York to search for him. He found his brother alive in Virginia, but he also saw hundreds of wounded or dying soldiers in the field and in hospital wards. Profoundly moved, he stayed in Washington, D.C., and appointed himself Soldier's Missionary. Over three years he wandered camps and hospitals, bringing small gifts, sitting with men who wanted company, writing letters for them (including, he noted, love letters, very tender ones) or giving paper to those who could do it themselves. Through it all he made notes, often on scraps of paper stained with blood. Today, in the jottings of his Memoranda, we find the heart of the Civil War: the horror and valor, the sounds and smells, the words of brave and dying boys, all recorded by Whitman with his poet's eye and his decent heart. Later, he called those years the greatest privilege and satisfaction, and the most profound lesson and reminiscence of my life. </P> 	nyt_eng_200501.gz

'The Sisters Rosensweig' had the largest advance in Broadway history, for a play (not a musical).

Luckily for me, he said, I don't have to, because that's not what this case is about. The case, he continued, was about breaking the law.

"165991"	"he"	"continued"	" Rodney A. Smolla, the dean of the University of Richmond law school, took a middle ground.

However, he continued, the First Amendment may protect newspapers exposing wrongdoing by the government. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"165993"	"they"	"continued"	" Prosecution under the espionage laws of an actual member of the press for publishing classified information leaked to it by a government source would raise legitimate and serious issues and would not be undertaken lightly, the papers said.

"170269"	"she"	"continued"	" When hundreds of patients are given a drug, she continued, some will get no benefit, others will have terrible side effects, and still others will get benefits with tolerable side effects. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"170520"	"he"	"continued"	" There is already evidence of this in the oil industry, he continued, with companies investing in alternative forms of energy like biofuels. And technology companies are already in a strong position to innovate. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"170818"	"he"	"continued"	" Still, the television commercial that may have been the most significant factor in expanding the Broadway audience was not even for a Broadway show. On Feb. 14, 1978, the New York state Department of Commerce introduced a new I Love New York commercial that focused on Broadway as a tourist attraction. The impact was immediate and enormous, said George Wachtel, the founder of Audience Research and Analysis. Before that, Broadway was a little provincial. But afterward, he continued, it was what New Yorkers did, it was what high rollers did when they came to New York. 'I Love New York' made Broadway Everyman's theater. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171816"	"he"	"continued"	" Religious institutions have realized that land-use authorities are vulnerable to the threat of litigation, David Evan Hughes, the deputy county attorney, asserted in the county's court filings. Without greater clarity from the courts, he continued, the new law's reach will expand to the point where religious institutions are effectively dictating their own land-use regulations. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172192"	"she"	"continued"	" Kids, they'll find some other club, Smith insisted during her set. They'll find a place, she continued, that nobody wants, and you got one guy who believes in you, and you just do your thing. And anybody can do that, anywhere in the world, any time. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172508"	"she"	"continued"	" The defendant tobacco companies, she continued, marketed and sold their lethal product with zeal, with deception, with a single-minded focus on their financial success, and without regard for the human tragedy or social costs that success exacted. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"173022"	"he"	"continued"	" At the state level, Republicans similarly argue that local issues are the most decisive. In Ohio, the war is a big issue that is being played out in every race, acknowledged Ohio Republican party spokesman John McClelland. But, he continued, I don't know that it will be the defining issue. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173484"	"he"	"continued"	" But some state standards, he continued, don't teach them until the fifth grade. It is not clear, then, what our teachers are supposed to teach when. </P> 	nyt_eng_200611.gz

, he said,	 DeAlmeida said the state would begin issuing birth certificates without judicial orders for couples registered under the state's domestic partnership law. For same-sex couples who are not registered, he said, the process is less clear because we would have to establish how to determine that they're in a committed relationship. </P> 	nyt_eng_200611.gz
, he says,	 I would never have dreamed 20 years ago that I'd be able to do this on a TV in my lifetime, added Kelly, who grew up in Maud, Okla., with a set that got only CBS. Now he doesn't even like watching games at bars or at friends' houses. Without his newfound powers, he says, it feels like I have a hand cut off. </P> 	nyt_eng_200611.gz
, she strode,	 Strapped into braces like leg irons, waving extended arms, the volunteer rode a hydraulic platform that rose and fell with each step, moved about by three athletic stagehands hidden under a billowing skirt. The figure's proportions were lifelike but gigantic. The physical presence was weighty and in charge. The Witch did not glide, she strode, with power and purpose. </P> 	nyt_eng_200611.gz
, he said,	 Like a maturing athlete, he slowed down a little and smartened up a lot. I don't know if I've gotten better, he said. I think that I've definitely gotten more rounded. What interests him now, he said, is finding the nooks and crannies of a beat. And when he wants to make a point, he deliberately interrupts his flow, adding pauses and unexpected changes in meter, forcing people to pay attention to the words instead of letting them glide by. He does this a lot on Kingdom Come. It is his ninth album, not counting the two CDs he made with R. Kelly, the one he made with Linkin Park or his MTV Unplugged CD. And it is, by design, the most uncomfortable-sounding album of his career. </P> 	nyt_eng_200611.gz
, she estimates,	 Still, with so many festival options already available, Withoutabox members often act like compulsive eaters at a buffet. At the beginning I was reading the festivals' little write-ups, and I thought, 'Ooh, that sounds good,' said Michelle Goetsch, 35, who has spent, she estimates, $2,000 to enter her short, The Pill, into 60 festivals. </P> 	nyt_eng_200611.gz
, he says,	 Sometimes, though, that's all they can get. Out of the 30 festivals he applied to, Sean McKnight was accepted into one: the Big Damn Film Festival, which, he says, literally accepts almost every submission. As long as it meets their quality standards, and it's not porn, you're going to get a slot, he said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200611.gz
, she said,	 Thorpe said the department reviewed the agencies' efforts, expecting to find that some of them fell short. Instead, investigators found that the majority of those who died were not connected to those services, she said. That suggests that the most isolated people were more likely to die, she said, and highlights the importance of neighbors' looking out for each other. </P> 	nyt_eng_200611.gz
, they said,	 In its investigation, the city also looked at the heat wave of July 16-18, during which a blackout struck part of western Queens, lasting until July 24 for many people. Six people died of heat stroke during that heat wave, but officials said the blackout did not appear to have contributed to any deaths. One person died of heat stroke in that part of Queens, they said, and the victim was living in a vehicle. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20061116.0006 type=story > <HEADLINE> BRUINS CORNERBACK BROWN IS ONE QUICK STUDY </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> LOS ANGELES </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200611.gz

, he said,	 Atlanta-based Delta is in federal bankruptcy protection. Gerald Grinstein, the airline's chief executive, said in a statement that Delta will review the US Airways proposal but he reiterated prior comments that Delta is not interested in a merger. Delta's goal, he said, has always been to emerge from bankruptcy in the first half of 2007 as a strong, stand-alone carrier. </P> 	nyt_eng_200611.gz

, he reported,	 Paabo's group calculated a somewhat different time for the split between the two groups of people: The separation, he reported, probably occurred on average about 516,000 years ago. But the difference between the two divergent times was well within the error bars of their calculations, the two team leaders agreed. </P> 	nyt_eng_200611.gz

, I think,	 Jack Murtha is a very close friend of hers. He ran her campaign. And one of Nancy Pelosi's, I think, best qualities is she's a very loyal person, Hoyer acknowledged Wednesday on National Public Radio.

If people don't like me, why do I have to force them to listen to me? And yet, he continued, the real disrespect to the audience came from Lissner by canceling his performances. Those people paid to see me, to hear me, he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
"174310"	"he"	"continued"	" Too soon to tell, he continued, but added, we live in speedy times and, the truth is, after six years in power and barring a couple of miracles, it's safe to bet that Bush will be forever handcuffed to the bottom rungs of the presidential ladder. The reason: Iraq. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
