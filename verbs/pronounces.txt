When he discusses the theories he has developed, he says, it feels similar to teaching the rules of musical composition: what are chords; what is a tonal progression; if you want to get a particular effect, here are codified ways of doing that. </P> 	nyt_eng_200411.gz

But that theory can also have practical applications: foldable structures that can get very small and then very large later on, which can be useful, for example, in deploying a telescopic lens in space or in designing more efficient airbags for cars. In nanomanufacturing, Demaine says, developing efficient ways to fold protein strands could lead to new ways to fight disease. </P> 	nyt_eng_200411.gz

The N.Y. Times News Service night supervisor is Pat Ryan; phone: (888) 346-9867; e-mail: patryannytimes.com.  INTERNATIONAL  (Will move in i news file.)  MIDEAST-ARAFAT (Ramallah, West Bank) -- The Palestinian leadership quickly filled its top posts early Thursday, hours after Yasser Arafat's death, as Palestinians contended with the loss of the erratic, iconic figure who led them from a splintered diaspora to the threshold of a state and left them trapped there, divided over the way ahead and in danger of fragmenting once again. Arafat died at 75 of an undisclosed illness in a Paris hospital, far from the torn land he longed to rule and barred by Israel from the city, Jerusalem, he envisioned as his capital and burial place. As stunned Palestinians absorbed the news that Arafat, the wily survivor, had at last succumbed, the remaining leadership moved to display respect while signaling that the chaos that characterized his decades-long hold on the Palestinian national dream would die with him. By James Bennet and Steven Erlanger.  With  MIDEAST-POLICY (Washington) -- Yasser Arafat's death has thrown the Bush administration into a painfully familiar quandary. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon wants free rein to implement his disengagement plan from Gaza, while European leaders -- led by Prime Minister Tony Blair -- want American help in getting Israeli concessions to strengthen the hand of Palestinian moderates. The United States maintained its low key reaction to the Arafat death on Thursday, indicating that it will send two mid-level envoys to his funeral in Cairo, Egypt, though not to the burial in Ramallah. By Steven R. Weisman and Joel Brinkley.  And  MIDEAST-ASSESS (Ramallah, West Bank) -- Yasser Arafat was both the symbol of the Palestinians' hope for a viable, independent state and the prime obstacle to its realization. His death early Thursday morning presents an enormous set of challenges to his own people, to the Israelis, to a re-elected American president and to the world at large. A news analysis by Steven Erlanger.  IRAQ (Baghdad, Iraq) -- Developments. Insurgents launched attacks in the northern provincial capital of Mosul on Thursday, opening a major new front in the fighting, while American troops in Fallujah pushed into the city's southern warrens, where guerrillas were believed to have barricaded themselves. In Baghdad, a powerful suicide car bomb exploded Thursday morning on a busy commercial street downtown, killing at least 17 people and wounding at least 30, military officials said. In the evening, explosions rippled across the capital with an intensity not seen here since August, when American soldiers fought a Shiite uprising in the south. By Edward Wong. (Eds, subs byline for earlier budget.)  INDIA-KASHMIR (New Delhi, India) -- India's prime minister, Manmohan Singh, announced on Thursday a reduction in the number of Indian troops in the disputed state of Kashmir, a significant gesture that comes less than a week before Singh is scheduled to visit Kashmir. Kashmiri political leaders reacted positively to the announcement, as did Pakistani officials. The move could give new momentum to the peace process with Pakistan, which has long demanded a reduction of troops in Indian-held Kashmir. The Pakistani president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, recently proposed the demilitarization of the territory. By Amy Waldman.  IVORY-COAST (Dakar, Senegal) -- Developments. More than 4,000 inmates of Ivory Coast's largest penitentiary have escaped through the sewers amid massive political violence and are believed to be hiding out in a forest, officials said Thursday. Some of the prisoners -- murderers, robbers and other hard-core offenders among them -- are believed to have made their way into the capital of the country, Abidjan, the officials said. The breakout came from Saturday to Monday, they said, as violent street protests targeting the French in this former French colony overran Abidjan, killing at least 17 people and wounding more than 900.

GAY-RIGHTS-OUTLOOK (Undated) -- Fearing that court victories could backfire and create public disdain, gay rights groups are planning to limit their legal challenges to the constitutional amendments banning gay marriage that were passed by 11 states last week. The groups say that winning the right to marry through the courts, if their efforts are successful, could add fuel to President Bush's efforts to create a federal prohibition on gay marriage. Many of the state amendments passed by overwhelming margins, and Karl Rove, the chief strategist of President Bush's re-election said this week that there was a broad national consensus that marriage is between a man and a woman. By Adam Liptak.  SCIENCE  (Will move in a news file.)  SMALLPOX-GENES (Undated) -- An advisory committee to the World Health Organization has recommended that Russian and American scientists be allowed to manipulate a gene in the smallpox virus for the first time to speed the discovery of drugs for the virus, the agency said Thursday. The proposed laboratory experiments would involve inserting a so-called marker gene into the smallpox virus that glows green under fluorescent light. The technique is a standard test to screen for potential anti-viral drugs, but the manipulation does not change the virulence of the virus, said officials of WHO, a U.N. agency in Geneva.
