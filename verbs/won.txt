(Geewax, Cox News Service)  Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.  WAN: Atlanta, Business, Other  JUDGE _ NEW ORLEANS _ It's a scandal that has startled even the hardened scandal-watchers of Louisiana, a state often viewed as setting the national bar for public corruption. Career-prosecutor and Jefferson County hardline judge Ron Bodenheimer _ who months earlier sentenced an armed robber to 881 years in prison, a court record _ has been charged with planting the drug OxyContin in the car of an FBI informant, who'd complained about nefarious activity associated with a remote marina that Bodenheimer owned. It's a story with all the murky local atmospherics of a James Lee Burke mystery. (Jubera, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 30. WITH PHOTOS.

(John Young is Opinion Page editor of the Waco (Texas) Tribune-Herald.) MOVED.BUSINESS  POPUPS _ So you're lounging at home watching the heartwarming movie ``Father of the Bride Part II'' on TV. Actor Steve Martin is stressing. His wife and daughter are both pregnant. And then _ bam! _ up pops an advertisement superimposed over part of the TV screen. Expecting a baby? the ad asks. Call American Express Financial Services. Within about 10 seconds the ad is gone as the movie rolls on in the background. The experimental ads ran this summer on TNT, and executives at the Atlanta-based cable network don't rule out using more pop-up ads.

On his way to start his fourth year at Georgia's Valdosta State University in the fall, Butrym is making money this summer as he has for each of the last summers: working part time as a temp.

LIFESTYLE  BATH-READING _ A crude but delicious schoolyard put-down was ``you lose IQ points every time you go the bathroom.'' Tee-hee. But, in fact, the opposite may be true.

PET-TRUSTS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Should cat lover Nita Fahey die before her pets do, Jeepers and BC won't miss a single meal of Fancy Feast. That's because Fahey has set up a trust that provides $5,000 for the critters' food, shelter and medical care. Thanks to a new Florida law set to take effect Jan. 1, a dog _ or cat, horse or bird _ can be not only a man's best friend but also his most esteemed heir. (Ostrowski, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

ONLINE-DATE _ ATLANTA _ When the Atlanta Braves scored late in a game to take the lead, 26-year-old Danielle Cohen wildly celebrated, but not over baseball. ``I won, I won, I won,'' Cohen chanted, jumping so high her knees reached her chest. As part of a bet, Cohen would see the man she just met at this organized JDate.com event skinny dip. Cohen wasn't the only one clapping over the potential match in a sea of Jewish singles who gathered here for a possible love connection.

CENTENARIAN _ NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Walter Young celebrated his 100th birthday on June 11, and he did so surrounded by friends and family at the farm he's lived on for more than 70 years.

Pre-Bill Parcells, the franchise was inept for years. With Parcells, they won, but the Jets were unstable, because you never knew when Parcells was going to catch the next train out of town.

He lost again in 1996, with 38 percent, and again in 2001, with 42 percent. Last Sunday, he won, with 38 percent, because of the deal he made in 2000 with Arnoldo Aleman, lame-duck president and leader of the Liberal Party. They divvied up control of the Supreme Court and the Electoral Council and changed the law so that a runoff was no longer required in presidential elections where the leading candidate failed to get a majority. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
