"15773"	"we"	"hold"	" The Eleventh Circuit unquestionably had jurisdiction to review the denial of the individual police officer defendants' motions for summary judgment based on their alleged qualified immunity from suit. But the Circuit Court did not thereby gain authority to review the denial of the Chambers County Commission's motion for summary judgment. The Commission's appeal, we hold, does not fit within the ``collateral order'' doctrine, nor is there ``pendent party'' appellate authority to take up the Commission's case. We therefore vacate the relevant portion of the Eleventh Circuit's judgment and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"
"41245"	"we"	"hold"	" The ultimate ``in custody'' determination for Miranda purposes, we are persuaded, fits within the latter class of cases. Two discrete inquiries are essential to the determination: first, what were the circumstances surrounding the interrogation; and second, given those circumstances, (footnote 11) would a reasonable person have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave. Once the scene is set and the players' lines and actions are reconstructed, the court must apply an objective test to resolve ``the ultimate inquiry'': ``(was) there a `formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement' of the degree associated with a formal arrest.'' California v. Beheler, 463 U. S. 1121, 1125 (1983) (per curiam) (quoting Mathiason, 429 U. S., at 495). The first inquiry, all agree, is distinctly factual. Statecourt findings on these scene- and action-setting questions attract a presumption of correctness under 28 U. S. C. s2254(d). The second inquiry, however, calls for application of the controlling legal standard to the historical facts. This ultimate determination, we hold, presents a ``mixed question of law and fact'' qualifying for independent review. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"
"78162"	"they"	"hold"	" Not even the specter of trials that could last for the next 50 years has swayed many Rwandans from the belief that justice can be served only if all those responsible are punished. Swift, harsh punishment, they hold, would ensure that the cycle of violence and hate between Hutu and Tutsi does not spiral once more into genocide. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"
