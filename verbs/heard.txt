"18494"	"they"	"heard"	" During most of the six-year administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, which ended in December, Mexicans were told repeatedly by effusive admirers, including even the staid old Wall Street Journal, that they had the world on a string. Their embrace of free-market economics and the politics of self-denial, they heard, would pry open a national horn of plenty. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"20203"	"she"	"heard"	" The first call came from the Red Cross late on the day of the bombing. Lanny Scroggins was alive, she heard, and being taken to Presybterian Hospital. Exultant with relief, Scroggins telephoned the hospital. But officials said they had no record of the 46-year-old HUD auditor. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"25320"	"he"	"heard"	" To accompany its music, the gallery also provides lyrics. As the 55-year-old four-time Open champion walked to the 10th tee, he heard, ``You can win another one, Jack.'' When he swung his driver and the ball rose above the fairway, he heard, ``Oh beautiful.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"35781"	"I"	"heard"	" Just a few days before the verdict, some of us contemplated our evident separation from the mainstream meandering through our country. All of America followed the trial, hooked as firmly as your dream trout to a mayfly, the media said, but we knew of only one, a retired lawyer, who habitually tuned into the proceedings. He, I heard, watched every televised minute; he was even taping it all. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"

"68124"	"we"	"heard"	" ``Superlatives faded as the descriptions mounted: a floating city, a buoyant skyscraper, a seaborne heaven. The pomp of her First Class compartments, we heard, made Versailles look like Calcutta; the food would match Maxim's; the service, Delmonico's; the wines, those served at the court of the greatest king. The stairways were marble; the panels the finest oak. Even the blankets were praised; even the plumbing. She was the single most lavish creation on earth, though her home was the sea.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199608.gz"
"75487"	"I"	"heard"	" On one of fall's warmest days, an errand took me past the frozen-yogurt shop on Lexington Avenue near 86th Street. I was tempted, but resisted. Didn't need the calories. Probably no good for my retirement-age body. Came the return trip: who could resist twice in one day? I savored a vanilla cone as I strolled down the avenue. Waiting for a light to change, I heard, ``Mmm, that looks good.'' The speaker: a woman sharing the moment. Resisting a strong urge to offer her some, I confessed: ``It is. I decided I deserved it.'' She smiled. ``If not now, when?'' she said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"

BILL'S WORLD  By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star  Jack Kemp says the only thing he didn't break playing football ``was my hair.'' A half-truth? How about hairline fractures?  A drawback to an Eastern time zone World Series: Between games the Midwest doesn't even get flown over by the teams.  ``On Nov. 6,'' says Bob Dole, ``Bill Clinton is going to be the most surprised man in America.'' Oh, we doubt the president will win by that much.  At least when Dole says we've got ``the worst economy in a century,'' you know he's talking mostly from personal experience.  There's tension between Bob Dole and Jack Kemp, reports say. Well, then, if Dole wants another debate before the election, why not have it out with his running mate?  Dole says his campaign is catching on and ``people are beginning to listen.'' Unless they're simply ear-synching.  ``The world is getting smaller,'' says Mr. Clinton. Maybe, but aren't you glad you don't have to inventory it?  ``I believe politics should be more about what to do than who to blame,'' the president says. Or whether you know the difference between who and whom.  Overheard on our bus: ``Sometimes people get so confused and angry about public referendums that what should be a plebiscite becomes a plebicide.''  ``We do not need a war,'' says Russia's prime minister. And if they do, no doubt they can mail-order one and get it before Christmas.  DAVID LETTERMAN ``LATE SHOW'' TOP TEN  ``Ways Bob Dole Could Still Win the Election''  10.

Convince the boys in Van Halen to put aside their differences and start crankin' out some more bitchin' tunes.  7. Work around the clock to win endorsement from that hilarious ``Kramer'' guy.  6. Release DNA test proving that he fathered Madonna's baby.  5. At each campaign stop, strip down, oil up and shoot a few Mr. Universe poses.  4. Replace Jack Kemp with the lovely Yasmine Bleeth of ``Baywatch.''  3. Brag to newspapers, ``Hey, at least I'm not as bad as the Jets!''  2. Act more presidential by stuffing his face with french fries and nailing Barbra Streisand.  1. Two words: mass hypnosis.  CITY STREETS  `Dear Diary'  My daughter _ a high school senior _ was cast as the nurse in ``Romeo and Juliet.'' Wanting to mark the occasion, I nipped into the local Toys ``R'' Us for a doll dressed as a nurse, to which I could attach the note: ``To my favorite nurse, love, Mom.''  I headed toward a floor-to-ceiling display of dolls. Alas, no nurse. Alert to a customer's bewilderment, an employee approached me. I asked if the store carried any nurse dolls.  ``It's a present for my daughter,'' I explained.  He walked me to a ``Dr. Barbie'' doll.  ``I want a nurse, not a doctor,'' I said. ``Aren't there any dolls dressed as nurses?''  ``Lady,'' he said, miffed, ``this is 1996. They're all doctors.''  ``But I want a nurse.''  ``Lady,'' he said again, more annoyed than before. ``You got to have higher aspirations for your daughter. You shouldn't want her to be a nurse when she can be a doctor.''  I thought it best not to explain about Shakespeare or, for that matter, my high regard for the nursing profession.

BILL'S WORLD  By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star  Jack Kemp says the only thing he didn't break playing football ``was my hair.'' A half-truth? How about hairline fractures?  A drawback to an Eastern time zone World Series: Between games the Midwest doesn't even get flown over by the teams.  ``On Nov. 6,'' says Bob Dole, ``Bill Clinton is going to be the most surprised man in America.'' Oh, we doubt the president will win by that much.  At least when Dole says we've got ``the worst economy in a century,'' you know he's talking mostly from personal experience.  There's tension between Bob Dole and Jack Kemp, reports say. Well, then, if Dole wants another debate before the election, why not have it out with his running mate?  Dole says his campaign is catching on and ``people are beginning to listen.'' Unless they're simply ear-synching.  ``The world is getting smaller,'' says Mr. Clinton. Maybe, but aren't you glad you don't have to inventory it?  ``I believe politics should be more about what to do than who to blame,'' the president says. Or whether you know the difference between who and whom.  Overheard on our bus: ``Sometimes people get so confused and angry about public referendums that what should be a plebiscite becomes a plebicide.''  ``We do not need a war,'' says Russia's prime minister. And if they do, no doubt they can mail-order one and get it before Christmas.  DAVID LETTERMAN ``LATE SHOW'' TOP TEN  ``Ways Bob Dole Could Still Win the Election''  10. New slogan: ``Vote for Dole, Get a Free Blueberry Muffin.''  9. Challenge Clinton to a winner-take-all game of ``Yahtzee.''  8. Convince the boys in Van Halen to put aside their differences and start crankin' out some more bitchin' tunes.  7. Work around the clock to win endorsement from that hilarious ``Kramer'' guy.  6. Release DNA test proving that he fathered Madonna's baby.  5. At each campaign stop, strip down, oil up and shoot a few Mr. Universe poses.  4. Replace Jack Kemp with the lovely Yasmine Bleeth of ``Baywatch.''  3. Brag to newspapers, ``Hey, at least I'm not as bad as the Jets!''  2. Act more presidential by stuffing his face with french fries and nailing Barbra Streisand.  1. Two words: mass hypnosis.  CITY STREETS  `Dear Diary'  My daughter _ a high school senior _ was cast as the nurse in ``Romeo and Juliet.'' Wanting to mark the occasion, I nipped into the local Toys ``R'' Us for a doll dressed as a nurse, to which I could attach the note: ``To my favorite nurse, love, Mom.''  I headed toward a floor-to-ceiling display of dolls. Alas, no nurse. Alert to a customer's bewilderment, an employee approached me. I asked if the store carried any nurse dolls.  ``It's a present for my daughter,'' I explained.  He walked me to a ``Dr. Barbie'' doll.  ``I want a nurse, not a doctor,'' I said. ``Aren't there any dolls dressed as nurses?''  ``Lady,'' he said, miffed, ``this is 1996. They're all doctors.''  ``But I want a nurse.''  ``Lady,'' he said again, more annoyed than before. ``You got to have higher aspirations for your daughter. You shouldn't want her to be a nurse when she can be a doctor.''  I thought it best not to explain about Shakespeare or, for that matter, my high regard for the nursing profession.

NEW YORK _  Dear Diary:  I overheard my 6-year-old son telling my 7-year-old daughter, ``You know, Mommy has eyes in the back of her head.''  She replied, ``I know.''  Then he said, ``Well, you're a girl, why don't you have eyes in the back of your head?''  She replied, ``Oh, I will _ when I grow up.''  _ SHEILA SPIEZIO  LIVING OR TRAINING?  The bus, the subway, the cab _  Point A to Point B has two routes:  32 versus 37 minutes _  A cup of coffee will cost you 5 more  A bagged lunch saves 10 bucks,  but the price is a trip to the grocery store.  Wear your coat now, you'll be carrying it later.  One of fall's little dilemmas.  And that's how time passes around here _  A season goes by like a day at work.  Just about anything's worth the price  if it saves you time.  On the sidewalk,  your mind is preoccupied with calculations.  How much time is lost  to thoughts of efficiency?  In the city,  living life is like managing a business  But none of it feels like the real thing.  The better you get at living  the more you feel like you're training  for something else.  So what comes next?  What is life in New York  preparing you for?  NICOLE L. CARNEVALE  Dear Diary:  While browsing through the Housing Works thrift shop on the Upper West Side, I spotted a used toy fire engine. It was 3 feet long, motorized and battery operated. As I was looking at it, a handsome young woman saw me admiring my find and politely asked whether I wanted it for my grandchildren.  ``No way,'' I said. ``It's mine.''  She said: ``Well, I'm sure you've been a good boy. Enjoy your toy.''  I thanked her for the compliment and left with my reward.  _ FRANK MIATA  Dear Diary:  On a recent Saturday's round of errands, I stopped at a department store to pick up a few items. My shopping list directed me first to lingerie, where I made several purchases from crowded racks, then to designer shoes where I refrained when asked if I would like to try any on. Instead, I zigzagged across floors teeming with shoppers and eager salespeople en route to the exit, where guards thanked me for shopping with them.  Outside, I checked my list for the next destination and decided to walk, since it was a beautiful day. Along the way, I browsed in several stores not on my list, drawn by the tempting scents and samples. Continuing, I had a lovely stroll down Park Avenue where friendly doormen nodded, also enjoying the day.  Then, at a dramatic pitch that broke through my reverie, I heard, ``Miss, miss!'' and sensed someone running up behind me. ``Miss, you have something on you.''  ``Do you mean me?'' I asked.  ``Yes, yes, there's something on you, something attached to you.''  ``What on earth?'' I answered. I looked down and, unbelievably, found a pair of blue cotton bikini panties, still on the little plastic hanger, price tag and all, attached to the hem of my jacket. I must have had them since my very first stop, an hour, five blocks and six stores earlier. My ``savior'' and I burst out laughing.  ``I thought you'd want to know,'' she said.  I replied, ``Obviously, everyone else I passed disagrees!''  _ BETH LEMASURIER  Dear Diary:  While shopping in a department store one evening, I noticed two unattended children _ a boy and a girl, about 5 and 7 _ hanging around the sales desk. Out of kindness or boredom, or to keep the kids out of trouble, the sales associate engaged them in a conversation about all of the pretty things for sale.  At this the boy belted out, ``I want a bra!''  ``Boys don't wear bras,'' the sales associate said.  ``My uncle does!'' came the very loud reply.  _ ROBIN COREY  Dear Diary:  During my visit with my friend and her precocious 3-year-old daughter, Julia, we played restaurant.  Julia played the waitress; I played the customer. With pad and pen in hand, Julia asked, ``What is your order?''  ``I'll have the steak and fries,'' I answered.  To which she replied, ``We're out of fries.''  _ DINA WERFEL  Setting: Montague Street, Brooklyn Heights, early morning on a school day. The sidewalk is crisscrossed by a drooping yellow banner that reads: ``Caution. Do Not Cross.''  Cast of Characters: Young mother and her youngish daughter.  Mother: (stepping over the ankle-high tape) ``Come on, honey.''  Daughter: (eyeing the banner) ``But it says, `Do not cross.'''  Mother: (holding out her hand) ``Sweetheart, you don't always have to do what the sign says. Learn to think like a New Yorker. Just step over it.''  Daughter: (reluctantly stepping over the tape to join her mother) ``But what if we get arrested?''  Mother: (amused) ``Are we getting arrested?''  Daughter: (hesitant, looking around) ``Nooo.''  (They walk a few paces in silence.)  Mother: ``Anyway, if we did get arrested, remember, Daddy's a criminal defense attorney.''  _ MELISSA KANTOR  Three-year-old Ava Pearlman was visiting the American Museum of Natural History with her parents and cousins. They stopped to visit the display of life-size stuffed gorillas in the Great Hall. Ava pointed to the three large ones and the one smaller animal and explained to the group, ``That's the mommy, the daddy, the baby and the baby sitter.''  _ LISA ROSENSTEIN  Dear Diary:  Recently when going through files, I came across a 1997 statement from the person who was my lawyer then. A cover sheet itemized documents that he was returning.  No. 8 indicated, ``A bill for professional services rendered on 1/7/97 marked PAIN IN FULL.''  Perfect description.  _ CYNTHIA MINTZER  Dear Diary:  I recently attended the Joan Mitchell retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art. As I stood by the elevator admiring a painting, the elevator doors opened and two women walked onto the exhibition floor.  After a brief moment, one said to the other, ``You'd think that they'd be playing her music.''  _ SUSAN A.
