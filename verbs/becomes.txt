"19355"	"he"	"becomes"	" With a remarkably pared-down vocabulary of movements (an expostulating flick of the wrist, a baroque dabbing of his hairline with his fingers) and an expression of open-eyed, ravenous amusement, he becomes, as he should be, the play's real engine.

"140332"	"he"	"becomes"	" Clearly, Democrats like Kerry believe the votes labor can deliver are worth any bad publicity. From the perspective of immediate candidate self-interest, that conclusion is probably correct. But privately, even loyal Democrats admit what they won't say out loud: long-standing assumptions about negotiating with public unions -- that they always yield a wage increase, that police are entitled to whatever firefighters negotiate -- lead to spiraling municipal payrolls that no one knows how to control. The candidate who makes his stand with the unions and wins their support becomes the elected official who can't say no to labor costs. If he does, he becomes, like Menino, the target of union anger. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"149528"	"it"	"becomes"	" He points at Psalm 1, which begins, Blessed is the man. In the TNIV, it becomes, Blessed are those. Stinson agrees the verse refers to men and women. But losing the image of one person standing alone against a plethora of sinners diminishes the passage's power, he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"
