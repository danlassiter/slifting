"21180"	"it"	"isn't"	" William Kristol does not appear on People's 1995 list of ``The 50 Most Beautiful People in the World'' (May 8). But editors of political publications set to debut in September need not despair. John F. Kennedy Jr., whose magazine, George, is scheduled to come out around Labor Day, upholds the group's honor by e reads his entry he might be one of ``The 50 Most Embarrassed People in the World'': ``In `A River Runs Through It,' at just about every sun-dappled close-up, your pulse stopped with a noise like the flavor-lock on a Tupperware lid. In `Interview with the Vampire,' you wanted to ride bareback down the slopes of his hair.'' After that, even the matter-of-fact egotism of TV actor Scott Wolf (``I was always considered cute'') looks good by comparison. We learn that T-Boz, of the singing group TLC, once used Kool-Aid to dye her hair (``it came out purple-burgundy'') and that Sweden's Queen Silvia _ did you know Sweden had a Queen Silvia? _ altered her gowns to be less revealing when she married her husband, Carl Gustaf, in 1976 (``What would my people think if I went around showing my bosom?''). With stuff like that, it's no wonder this is the second-largest regular issue in People's history (the champ is the 15th anniversary number in 1989). While it's impossible to say which of the fabulous 50 boasts the most memorable face, the most memorable name unquestionably belongs to actress Yasmine Bleeth. That's right, Yasmine Bleeth, who also can lay claim to the uckiest quote. The 5-foot-5 ``Bay Watch'' star laments, ``Tall, skinny women can get breast implants, and they become perfect. But women who are small and curvy can't get leg extensions. That isn't fair.'' No, it isn't, Yasmine. Biology is destiny. But perhaps if you keep in mind Jeremy Bentham's phrase ``nonsense on stilts'' you'll find the unfairness easier to bear. Who knows, there may be hope for you yet. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
