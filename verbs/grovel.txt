As gleaned by the Washington Post:  ``She has two domestics ... somebody from France who she brought over 22 years ago to help babysit, and a black woman who has two college graduate children. (Walters) says the two of them argue every day. (One) will say it is her fault, she didn't help me. The other woman will say I had no idea we were going to have this many and she didn't tell me. Ten years ago, (Walters) said, `I'm going to fire both of you. I can't stand it.' That stopped them arguing for two days.  ``We had juice in the living room, and then a full brunch, concluded with wonderful baked apples. In between, she interspersed conversations about her background, how she'd graduated from Sarah Lawrence really equipped to do nothing.''  (Note to prurient readers: If you're waiting for a denouement in the boudoir, forget it. Packwood mentions that at least one other person was present.)  P.S. When the Post asked editor Hillel Black of Carol Publishing _ which is responsible for entertaining books on O.J. Simpson and the Chappaquiddick swim meet _ about publishing the diaries, Black said heck, no. ``He's a sleazebag. Who cares about his peccadilloes?''  THERE'S NO BUSINESS LIKE MAKING MOVIES  A two-page ad for the movie version of ``The Scarlet Letter'' that ran in Sunday's New York Times pictured Demi Moore as Hester Prynne in the throes of passion, and touted the fact that the story had come from ``an acclaimed and controversial novel.'' Nowhere mentioned was the name of that great dirty book writer, Nathaniel Hawthorne.  Meanwhile, Elizabeth Berkley struts her stuff in the forthcoming ``Showgirls,'' but turned down an invitation to pose nude for Playboy. She didn't want to give away the goods because ``you can pay $7.50 and see enough of me in the movie,'' she tells ``Extra.''  NEW YORKER WRITERS GRUMBLE OVER ROSEANNE  There's a whole lotta shaking going on at Tina Brown's New Yorker over the editor's recent announcement that she would make Roseanne guest editor of a forthcoming issue about women.  Ian Frazier, a staff member for 21 years, faxed Brown his resignation last week. ``The New Yorker is about writing,'' Frazier told Time magazine. ``Is writing sitting in a room pitching ideas to some tyrannical TV star?''  Fiction writer Jamaica Kincaid, daughter-in-law of former editor William Shawn, told the New York Times she had threatened to quit.  ``Put me in a room with a great writer, I grovel,'' she said. ``Put me in with Roseanne, I throw up.''  Ken Auletta told the New York Observer that he would tell Roseanne to ``shove it'' if she tried to edit his copy but told the Post later that Brown had assured him she is only `` `picking Roseanne's brain.' All of us as journalists pick people's brains all the time.''  Brown is calm. ``New Yorker writers all come back,'' she told the Times. ``And keeping with tradition, they'll be back too.''  A NEW YORK COP'S FOND REMEMBRANCE OF KUNSTLER  In a letter to the editor of Monday's New York Times, New York City police Lieutenant Michael Gorman describes the late radical lawyer William Kunstler, ``the guy we cops loved to hate. We called him everything from revolutionary to evil genius. However, those of us who got to know him realized that he was a bundle of contradictions, and he actually wanted the cops he met to like and respect him.''  Gorman is a lawyer as well as a police officer. Some of Kunstler's legal victories, he writes, ``were nothing short of miraculous. Mr. Kunstler didn't just win cases; he shocked and embarrassed his adversaries.''  In addition to being principled, Gorman writes, Kunstler was ``entertaining and funny, and made those around him feel as if they were making history with him. He will be missed, even by some of us cops.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950911.0548 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-LEAH-PERSONALS-SFCHRON) </DATELINE> <TEXT> (Eds: This story also moved in the ``l'' lifestyle file) By LEAH GARCHIK c.1995 San Francisco Chronicle  BARBARA WALTERS' TERRIFIC APPLES  A juicy tidbit from the diary of that gregarious ladies' man Bob Packwood about brunch chez Barbara Walters reveals the high level of discourse among the nation's movers and shakers.
