"2682"	"he"	"sang"	" Rundgren counseled his young listeners to try ``Proactivity''; as if speaking for his generation, he sang, ``I had a dream but refused to trust it.''

"25759"	"he"	"sang"	" Vedder' narrators ``cannot find the comfort in this world''; they doubt themselves, they re-examine old wounds, they seethe against any temptation to compromise. In one of two new songs in the two-hour set, he sang, ``I have questions I don't know how to ask.'' The stage set was dominated by a chandelier shaped like an oblong crown of thorns. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"28505"	"she"	"sang"	" A hallmark of Ms. Nilsson's artistry was her way of attacking a high note with instantaneous tonal impact and absolute precision of pitch. ``One shouldn't reach for it but stand over it,'' she explained. While passing out dessert, she sang, without any forewarning, a high C that began as cleanly as though cut by a diamond. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"31402"	"he"	"sang"	" Grohl's lyrics are oblique: sometimes mournful, sometimes angry, perhaps including some references to his previous band. In the steady drone of ``X-Static,'' more subdued than it is on the band's self-titled album, he sang, ``Where have all the wishes gone/Now that all of that is done/Wish I would have felt I won.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"32329"	"he"	"sang"	" The rock singer at the Palladium on Saturday evening was dressed in grunge wear: a plaid shirt with its sleeves ripped away and a pair of cutoff denim shorts. In a gruff, desperate voice, he sang, ``I have nothing,'' and the fans who filled the club shouted along, their arms in the air. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"43725"	"they"	"sang"	" ``By gosh, they sang,'' said Moses, remembering the moment. ``And it wasn't that bad.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
"50198"	"she"	"sang"	" The answer to the question you all want to know: Yes, Alanis Morrissette was most definitely bleeped during the Grammy performance of ``You Oughta Know.'' But that was no surprise. What was surprising was that she sat sedately on a stool through the whole song ... and was accompanied by a piano, acoustic guitars and a violin section. Plus, she sang, rather than screamed, it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"

"89240"	"she"	"sang"	" Joe Louis was still relatively new on the national scene and would not be the world's heavyweight boxing champion for nearly two more years when Memphis Minnie sang of the man and his arms in August 1935. Louis' left and right, she belted out in her husky, lusty voice, were like ``a kick from a Texas mule'' and a ``jolt of dy-nee-mite.'' Films of a recent Louis fight were playing at the local theater, she sang, and she told everyone not to miss them. ``If you ain't got no money,'' she declared, ``honey, go tomorrow night.'' She then told of betting all her money, the ``ten hundred dollars'' she'd laid up on her shelf, that Louis' latest victim wouldn't last a round. Then she explained why. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200102.gz"
"90990"	"he"	"sang"	" Byrne also acted as inadvertent prophet when he tapped into the ugly Americanism behind the song ``Listening Wind.'' Looking through the eyes of an African villager, he sang, ``He sees the foreigners in growing numbers. He sees the foreigners in fancy houses,'' before asking ``the wind in my heart'' to ``drive them away, drive them away.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"92220"	"he"	"sang"	" During one meandering, apparently improvised song, he sang, ``I don't know if I can go on anymore/This whole (expletive) business is really starting to get to me/This may be the last tour of the U.S. I ever do/I never wanted to be on a stage/I'm turning into something I didn't plan on turning into and it's getting me down.'' And then, he turned the whole thing into a joke, riffing on U2's Bono, Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"
"92949"	"they"	"sang"	" The chant is just one cut on the educational soundtrack at the nascent Bronx Preparatory Charter School, whose 100 fifth- and sixth-graders rhapsodize about their readiness to read and rap their multiplication tables. Preparing for last month's standardized assessments, they sang, ``We're gonna bust that test in a major way.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"105724"	"he"	"sang"	" In 1997, he was hospitalized with a serious heart infection. Soon after he was released came ``Time Out of Mind,'' a dark, blues-drenched intimation of mortality that went on to win the Grammy as best album. ``I'm walkin' through streets that are dead,'' he sang, and ``I've been walking through the middle of nowhere.'' His feet were tired, and his eyes were beginning to bleed, he sang, but he was up and about. When everyone else in our speed-fueled society was driving and flying and hustling, he was walking. And as he walked, he was able to take note of the view, and the details. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"109258"	"he"	"sang"	" While the drugs were administered, he sang, but the words were not audible. As the drugs took effect, he gasped and snorted. After several minutes, his chest stopped moving. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"129744"	"they"	"sang"	" Mizell himself was a subject of many of the band's rhymes.

"143600"	"he"	"sang"	" Biblical allusions were scant in the 1970s when Waits was dishing up Beat rants and crashing at the Tropicana motor lodge on the Sunset Strip. But there was the occasional aside. On the 1973 song Ol' 55, later covered by the Eagles, he sang, As I drove away slowly, feeling so holy, God knows I was feeling alive. By 1980, he teased the blurry line between sinners and saints, singing Don't you know there's no devil, just God when he's drunk on Heartattack and Vine. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"168980"	"she"	"sang"	" Snapping her fingers and swaying her arms, she sang, Bad boys, bad boys/Whatcha gonna do. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"
