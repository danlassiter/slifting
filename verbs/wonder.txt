After all, we've all occasionally succumbed to the fashionably insane. Still, those of us who first entered adulthood wearing precarious heels of similar style were so relieved finally to push the 3-inchers out of sight that I doubt we'll be tempted by those towering now at 4 inches. And the next generation? They grew up an era of flats, athletic shoes, Keds and a variety of boots, some ugly, all comfortable. Surely, they won't stand for the pain, will they? I'm afraid I know that answer, too. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199408.gz"

When we divorced, my former wife and I agreed -- without a court order -- on an amount for monthly support from me. Since then, I've voluntarily increased that amount as my income grew.

"9966"	"I"	"wonder"	" Many third-car passengers spent months in group counseling, and those encounters led to new alliances. Seven commuters who attended six months of therapy in Garden City continue to find solace in the meandering conversation of monthly dinner meetings. ``It's comforting when someone is feeling the same thing,'' said Tina Franzese, 31, an administrative manager for the Seagram Co. ``Like the others, I still have paranoia.

"26724"	"I"	"wonder"	" Having spent a lifetime in the law, writing largely at night and on the weekends, Mortimer naturally has a few modest proposals to offer. Rather surprisingly, he's a champagne socialist, and at all times reflects a hearty loathing for Margaret Thatcher and her illegitimate progeny in the long-lost colonies: ``It seems to me that what we fear most are the criminal tendencies in ourselves. We are terrified, no doubt with good cause, of our baser instincts. Fear leads to a passionate belief in the righteousness of punishment . . .

Stories are moving in category shown at end of each budget item.  Lifestyle, Entertainment  TVRATE-2takes _ undated _ A LOOK AT THE TV RATINGS DEBATE: Seems like a simple solution, doesn't it? Slap a PG-13 rating on ``Roseanne,'' flip the V-chip to block PG-13 fare, and Mr. and Mrs. Doe won't have to worry about little Janie stu mbling onto crude language, dope-smoking and sexual situations. At least not for that half- hour. But nothing about the debate over television's negative impact on children is simple. (e)  NETWATCH-LIPSTICK _ undated _ You can go to the Internet for depth (say, the complete works of Dante). You can go for breadth (golf jokes of the world). Or you can go for cheerfully, blissfully shallow _ and that will lead you straight to The Lipstick Page. (l)  National  MORALES-800&AMP;add _ PLEASANTON, Texas _ Victor Morales might be the political version of the American dream, reassuring proof that in the land of opportunity a schoolteacher with good intentions, a ready smile and a reliable pickup truck can run for the U.S. Senate. At age 46, motoring around the state in the Nissan pickup that serves as his campaign headquarters, Morales is convinced he will run in the top two in the March 12 Democratic primary in step one of his mission to run Republican Phil Gramm out of the Senate. TEXAS POINTS. (a)  Business  BLACK-CONSUMERS _ ATLANTA _ Million Man March spurs new economic consciousness for black consumers. (f)  TECH-REPORT _ undated _ TECH REPORT: Bosses' e-mail snooping hurts morale. (f)  GEEWAX-COLUMN _ undated _ Most longtime Republicans are astonished by the sudden emergence of Pat Buchanan as a leading candidate for the presidential nomination. Contrary to the GOP position on free trade, Buchanan wants to build high walls around this country to block foreign trade. Buchanan's ideas get zero support from mainstream economists who know that increased trade has revived U.S. manufacturing, driven down the cost of consumer goods and let the world more know Americ a is its leading power. Protectionism would wipe out millions of American jobs, spur inflation and allow other countries, such as Japan and China, to surge ahead. MOVING TO BOTH COMMENTARY (K) AND BUSINESS (F) QUEUES.  DOUGLAS-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ From atop the Okeelanta Cogeneration Plant, about an hour's drive from the urban South Florida coast, you can look in any direction and see sugar cane fields stretching to the horizon. How can a la nd so vast, you wonder, be too small to contain the competing interests who lay claim to its future? (f)  KOMPUTER-KLINIC _ undated _ THE KOMPUTER KLINIC: Playing in the Internet MUDs. (f)  Sports  CAR-ROCK-NOTEBOOK _ ROCKINGHAM, N.C. _ Rick Hendrick took stock of the day's work of Jeff Gordon, Ken Schrader and Terry Labonte, and placed the woeful results into proper prespective. ``I've got an old saying that goes, `It ain't life- threatening, and there's another race next week,' '' he said. ``It's tough to take, but you have to take it.'' And the Hendrick teams took quite a few hard knocks at Nor th Carolina Motor Speedway. Following a year of glorious results, the three-car team can't get off the ground. (s)  VOISIN-COLUMN _ CHICAGO _ The dressing down was so complete, so convincing, that only one question remained answered: Who tried to swipe Shaq's shorts? (s)  BISHER-COLUMN _ undated _ Georgia Tech moved into the conference part of its basketball schedule looking like the the guys at the rear of a circus parade, broom and shovel in hand. The Yellow Jackets had lost seven of their 13 games. They had finished last in something called the Cable Car Classic and come home dragging their morale behind them. Then came a total personality change. (s)  OLY-MICHAEL-JOHNSON _ undated _ Johnson under constant pressure as sprinting world's No. 1 target. (s)  DAVEGEORGE _ MIAMI _ Nice, notching win amid Heat's freshman orientation. (s)  Commentary  GEEWAX-COLUMN _ undated _ Most longtime Republicans are astonished by the sudden emergence of Pat Buchanan as a leading candidate for the presidential nomination. Contrary to the GOP position on free trade, Buchanan wants to build high walls around this country to block foreign trade. Buchanan's ideas get zero support from mainstream economists who know that increased trade has revived U.S. manufacturing, driven down the cost of consumer goods and let the world more know Americ a is its leading power. Protectionism would wipe out millions of American jobs, spur inflation and allow other countries, such as Japan and China, to surge ahead. MOVING TO BOTH COMMENTARY (K) AND BUSINESS (F) QUEUES.  SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ There were two headlines in this morning's paper that caught my eye. The first because somebody was having fun with the readers and the second _ well, you'll see. (k)  WEBB-COLUMN _ MART, Texas _ My representative in Austin, State Rep. Barbara Rusling, recently came to Mart in her elderly motorhome and propped a sign against the bumper saying, ``Come in and talk to me.'' And people did. It was nothing l ike the TV ghost images coming out of Washington that never touch anything real. (k)  MORGAN-COLUMN _ NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Don't ask me how I got in or how I got out. Someone else was pushing the buttons and pulling up the screens. I was only looking over her shoulder. But the other night I ended up on an Internet page called ``All Politics.''

Now Allie returns (she has ``eyes like ocean waves,'' and if you know what that means, please tell us), and their passion reignites. It's an old story, and so is this: Unknown author writes terrible novel and makes millions. There's no kitsch value here (as with The Bridges of Madison County) or heft (as with The Horse Whisperer), but its publisher did send a packet of tissues with the review copy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"

Times News Service  NEW YORK _ It's difficult to imagine that Lena Horne could be unnerved by a public appearance. But on Wednesday she is facing one with some apprehension.  The elegant, sultry singer will be at the Waldorf-Astoria for a screening of ``Lena Horne: In Her Own Voice,'' a one-hour biographical documentary that will be shown on Channel 13 on Nov. 25. It will begin the new season of the PBS ``American Masters'' series.  Ms. Horne, 79, sat for several lengthy interviews with Susan Lacy, co-director of the production, tracing her career from the Cotton Club of the 1930s to Hollywood and great success. Of the screening, she said Monday: ``It has me full of anticipation and fright. I haven't seen the finished product. I don't like to look at myself or hear myself sing. I would love to sing like Aretha Franklin, so I don't listen to myself.''  She has wanted to do something for PBS for a long while, she said, explaining: ``I only watch cartoons or PBS. This year they came very quietly to me and did a couple of interviews. I had no idea they would be for this series, and I was astounded by the research they did. They even had a picture of me in rehearsal at the Cotton Club in 1934. I had no idea that such a picture existed.''  c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service  NEW YORK _ The normally reticent Mia Farrow was eloquent Monday about a man to whom she will pay tribute on Wednesday: Shimon Peres. Ms. Farrow will present the former prime minister of Israel with a special award at the opening of the 13th Israel Film Festival at the Angelika 57 Theater on West 57th Street.  Peres, who was defeated for re-election in May, will be honored for his support of the arts in general and of film in particular. ``It is wonderful when a political leader shows interest in the arts,'' Ms. Farrow said. ``I was heartbroken that he didn't win the election, and I wish I had had a few thousand votes to give him.

His opinions and conclusions are his own. His address is Public Editor, The New York Times, 229 West 43rd Street, New York 10036-3959; or e-mail publicnytimes.com. Telephone messages: (212) 556-7652. The public editor's column appears at least twice monthly, and both his Web journal and links to articles mentioned in the column can be found at nytimes.com/danielokrent. In my Oct. 31 column, I took a crude hatchet to The New York Times' wimpy reliance on experts, analysts and other commentators whose words may decorate a given article but often provide neither coherence nor much more than the illusion of balance.  Surprisingly, I didn't hear from any experts determined to defend their positions in the address books of Times reporters. Maybe that's because some of them have established impregnable beachheads: Professor Stephen Gillers of NYU has made 24 appearances in The Times so far this year (five under his own name, the rest in pieces by Times writers); Tom Wolzien of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. has shown up 28 times; and the inevitable Gene Russianoff has appeared fully 46 times, in pieces by 23 different writers. Russianoff is a staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a transit advocacy group, a label The Times has slapped on him the way Homer glued gray-eyed goddess to Athena.  Russianoff has been the Oracle of the Subways since well, almost since there were straps for straphangers. (New to the city 35 years ago, I thought the word was pronounced straffengers, with a soft g.)  Times reporters assure me that he is reliable, honest and well informed. I believe this to be true, as I'm confident it is of Gillers and Wolzien as well, and maybe even of Hall of Famer Norman Quotestein, aka Ornstein, of the American Enterprise Institute.  But if I believe these experts are all good and wise, it's because I believe the reporters who tell me so. Why, I wonder, do I need the analysis of an expert or the expertise of the analyst, when it's the writer I'm finally compelled to rely upon in any case?  In fact, there are often good reasons to turn to experts -- for instance, when the desk dumps an assignment in your lap three hours before deadline, on a subject you know little about. But there's also the need to protect that precious piece of the journalistic ethos, objectivity -- in the words of one deputy news editor, Philip Corbett, not only a worthy goal, but probably our most important one: the goal that underpins most of our other ideals, like fairness and accuracy. And reporters think that getting an expert to comment adds the aura of objectivity.  In recent years, though, the concept of objectivity has taken a bit of a beating. Some journalists (and critics of journalists) argue that it is in fact unachievable; we all bring our experiences, sensibilities and innate prejudices to the door, and even the act of attempting to leave them on the stoop will alter our approach.  Besides, you can't police objectivity simply by scouring an article for evidences of bias, imbalance or other taints. Try starting with the headline writer, who is inherently constrained by space yet charged with distilling essences from what is often an extremely complex stew -- a necessarily reductive act that can't help but deform nuances. Then there's the editor who determines placement: Ex-CIA Chief Nets $500,000 On Talk Circuit would have been interesting on A26 on Nov. 11, on A1, it carried a suggestion of scandal.  And before an article finds its way into the paper -- sometimes long before -- the decision to assign it is itself influenced by personal predisposition. In Health Care, Gap Between Rich and Poor Persists, WHO Says, also in the Nov. 11 paper, was a discretionary choice. It made it into print on one desk editor's watch, but could have been just as plausibly ignored had someone else, with even a slightly different worldview, been sitting in the same chair that day. As for major investigative pieces, they generally start not because they are propelled by a piece of news but because a reporter or an editor determines -- often out of white-hot passion -- that This is important. This is something we must do. Most investigations, by nature, carry a point a view.  When it comes to objectivity, then, the determinative factor is who's doing the determining. In any enterprise, there are few decisions as important as whom you hire and promote; in a newspaper, where every choice has meaning, it's virtually the only thing that matters.  The historical roots of objectivity as a journalistic ideal suggest there's more to it than parking one's opinions at the curb. Before it was applied specifically to journalism, the idea of objectivity grew out of a variety of early 20th century intellectual movements recognizing that somewhere in the swamps of conscious and unconscious thought, people could be biased without knowing it. By the 1920s Walter Lippmann and others were arguing that reporters could combat unconscious bias by applying scientific method and its sense of evidence to journalistic inquiry. Only by the rigorous testing of hypotheses could the investigator -- the journalist -- reach reliable, bias-free conclusions. The key word, and the one that has disappeared from the definition over several generations, is conclusions. Fairness requires the consideration of all sides of an issue; it doesn't require the uncritical reporting of any. Yet even the best reporters will sometimes display a disappointing reluctance to set things straight.  That's why I was so exasperated last June, shortly after Ronald Reagan's death, to see a classic balancing statement pop up and sit there unchallenged, in an article by Robin Toner and Robert Pear. Critics See a Reagan Legacy Tainted by AIDS, Civil Rights and Union Policies (June 9) included this: Gary Bauer, Reagan's domestic policy adviser for the last two years of his administration, countered that spending on AIDS research rose under Reagan. Bauer's comment may have balanced what Reagan's detractors had to say, but the writers' failure to challenge it denied readers an objective truth: AIDS funding couldn't help but rise under Reagan, because there was no AIDS funding before Reagan -- in fact, there was no AIDS before Reagan.  I suspect that when writers don't comment on specious statements, it's usually because they worry that any challenge might itself seem tendentious. And it's true that many readers do find conclusive statements objectionable. Reporter Jodi Wilgoren provoked a flood of complaints when she described John Kerry in April as a social loner without attributing her characterization to anyone -- as if her own experience covering the senator, and discussing him with scores of his friends and associates, were not evidence enough. Similarly, readers complained when Neil Lewis, in Mixed Results for Bush in Battles Over Judges (Oct. 22), followed a description of the president's early judicial appointments with this: There could have been no clearer signal that Bush intended to follow the pattern set by his father and President Ronald Reagan of shifting the courts rightward and reaping the political benefit of pleasing social conservatives. Those who objected argued that it was the writer's opinion, and improper -- even though, as one acknowledged, it was undeniably true.  But haven't we reached the point where denying the reader what a writer knows to be true is far more unfair than including it? I was delighted when, in After 6 Months, Tyco Prosecutors Close Case Against Ex-Officials (March 18), Alex Berenson described the prosecutor's case as bewildering, tedious and having rarely been presented in a straightforward way -- a vision of the trial that would have been utterly unavailable had Berenson not dared to offer conclusive characterizations based on his own observations. On a much larger scale, I was dismayed when a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in a letter to friends (later passed around the Internet) described the horrors of life in Baghdad, and was criticized in some quarters for thereby jeopardizing her impartiality. But what she described was based on indisputable first-hand experience. If there was a journalistic offense here, it was that readers of The Journal had been denied knowledge of what this reporter knew to be true. Whom did that serve?  I shouldn't knock The Journal, which admirably allows its reporters far more authority to make assertions in their own voices than most American dailies, and which hasn't asked me to be its public editor. My beat's here on West 43rd Street, where some of the very best journalists in the country keep what they know off the page because they've been tied up by an imprecise definition of objectivity. I'm not calling for unsupported opinion, but for a flowering of facts -- not just those recorded stenographically or uttered by experts, but the sort that arise from experience, knowledge and a brave willingness to stand behind what you know to be true. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20041113.0097 type=story > <HEADLINE> CHRISTIAN COALITION LEADER'S SURPRISING PATH TO POLITICS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> ATLANTA </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
