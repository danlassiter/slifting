Orders for durable goods moved up 0.1 percent, buoyed by strength in shipbuilding and tanks that more than offset declines in automobiles and aircraft, the Commerce Department's monthly tabulation showed. Although the gain was relatively meager, analysts said they were impressed by its breadth and by the fact that nonmilitary capital goods other than aircraft advanced a smart 1.3 percent.   ``You do see evidence of continuing momentum'' in the economic expansion, said David J. Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley, who called the report a bit better than expected. He cited in particular the second straight gain for capital goods, up 1.9 percent in August, a gauge of future production plans at the nation's factories.   BOSTON (NYT) -- After one widely watched debate with Senator Edward M. Kennedy that did not appear to have helped him narrow the gap, his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney spent Wednesday in seclusion preparing for a second debate Thursday that may be his last chance.   Kennedy, whose 32 years in the Senate has been one of his foe's main issues, hardly campaigned Wednesday also, but told reporters he hoped that Romney would be clearer Thursday in Holyoke about his views of national health insurance than he was Tuesday night in Faneuil Hall.   More than two million residents of the Boston area -- and mnany more in the west -- were believed to have watched Tuesday night's combative debate, in which the candidates clashed over health care, negative campaign advertising, abortion and the economy.   And the general political sense here was that while Romney was a smoother debater -- looking at the camera for example, when Kennedy usually looked away -- that had scored no real breakthroughs, and looked weak when he was unable to discuss his health insurance proposal in any detail or to estimate its cost.   WASHINGTON (NYT) -- One of the Navy's first female fighter pilots was killed in a training accident off the southern California coast on Tuesday, the Navy said Wednesday.   The Navy said the aviator, Lt. Kara Hultgreen, an F-14 pilot assigned to the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln, crashed into the ocean during her landing approach. The plane's navigator ejected and was rescued. Hultgreen is in the first class of female pilots allowed to fly Navy combat planes since Congress lifted a ban and the Navy began assigning women to warships earlier this year.   (NYT) -- Gov. Pete Wilson has injected a hot new element of controversy into the already raging debate over immigration control in Califoria, suggesting that every state resident be required to obtain an official identity card to present when seeking a job, entering school or applying for non-emergency health care.   The proposal was among the most far reaching yet offered in the immigration debate, which in recent days has spread well beyond California's pourous borders and now involves many national politicans, including President Clinton. In an interview in Wednesday's issue of The San Francisco Chronicle, Wilson said proof of citizenship would have to be displayed in order to enroll children in school or to receive nonemergency health care if the ballot issue, Proposition 187, passes on Nov. 8.   (NYT) -- The most accurate measurement yet of the distance to a remote galaxy has yielded a refined estimate of the rate at which the universe is expanding, bringing scientists much closer to determining one of the most fundamental and elusive numbers in cosmic theory: the age of the universe.   Astronomers who made the measurement, announced Wednesday, called it a critical milestone in establishing a scale for calculating cosmic distances. While they cautioned that it would take more observations to be sure, their findings provided persuasive support for earlier studies that, taken together, suggest that the answer may already be at hand. The age of the universe, they estimate, is 8 billion to 12 billion years.   (NYT) -- Two scientific experts who have been on opposite sides in the battle over the use of DNA analysis in court say in a jointly written article that their disputes have been resolved and the technique should now be regarded as a generally acceptable forensic tool.   The two experts are Dr. Eric S. Lander, a molecular biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has testified against the use of DNA typing, also known as DNA fingerprinting, and Dr. Bruce Budowle, a chief scientist for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who has argued the technique is reliable enough for courtroom use. The two former opponents now write that ``the DNA fingerprinting wars are over.''   In a paper published Thursday in Nature, a British science journal, the two experts note the uncertainty as to whether DNA evidence will be admitted at the forthcoming trial of O. J. Simpson and say that because the discussion is being framed by lawyers for the prosecution and defense, ``the likely result is confusion.'' Yet as scientists, they add, they ``could identify no remaining problem that should prevent the full use of DNA evidence in any court.''   LOS ANGELES (NYT) -- Judge Lance A. Ito and the lawyers in the O.J. Simpson case continued questioning prospective jurors Wednesday. But the process has come to a crawl as candidates Ito deems contaminated by media coverage fall by the wayside, and as holidays approach and prolonged haggling over DNA evidence looms, opening arguments may not begin until after New Year's.   Several more weeks will probably pass before there are enough candidates to yield the 12 jurors and 8 alternates needed. Then Judge Ito must decide the admissibility of crucial DNA evidence in the case -- a process which, one defense lawyer told the judge today, could take four or five weeks to complete. With court in recess for five days around Thanksgiving and ten around Christmas, even a January 4 starting date may be optimistic.   Facing the usual media gauntlet, Robert L. Shapiro, the chief defense lawyer, said Simpson was ``very depressed'' at what is shaping up to be a six-month trial. ``Initially, when we talked about a speedy trial, he was hopeful that he would be trick or treating with his kids, and then having Thanksgiving Dinner, and then spending Christmas with them,'' he said.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941026.0185 type=story > <HEADLINE> GOBLINS, FAMILIES, TRADITIONS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-HALLOWEEN-HOOPLA-700(2TAKES)-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199410.gz"

While underwater, they marked growth patterns of bacterial mats, measured reproduction and metabolism rates, and brought up samples of water and microorganisms. Some of the bacterial mats they investigated are up to 100 years old, they estimate, and the scientists were careful not to disturb anything in the lake unnecessarily. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"
