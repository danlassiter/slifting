"17541"	"he"	"observes"	" Says Williams, ``You look stupid asking for one if the studio won't pay one, like Disney. You pick your spots.'' It's all part of the big banquet, he observes, la grande bouffe. The game. Studio lawyers expect to eat Boston agents alive. Boston agents who know their entertainment law bite back. Afterward, everyone does lunch. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"
"19142"	"he"	"observes"	" Referring to California's proposed ballot initiative to dismantle affirmative action, he observes, ``California is the institution forcing a re-examination.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"19986"	"he"	"observes"	" Plus, he observes, we're a similar distance from the sea, a short drive to the Etruscan Riviera for his relatives, about the same to Bodega Bay and the North Coast beaches from Sonoma. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"22868"	"he"	"observes"	" This latter principle, he observes, was invoked by the United States in three recent situations involving real or threatened military action: in Somalia, in Serbia and in Haiti. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"26843"	"he"	"observes"	" Peanut butter, he observes, is a cheap source of protein for needy families. And federal nutrition programs -- on the chopping block by GOP deficit hawks -- could save money if peanut prices decline. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"31046"	"he"	"observes"	" The effects of family size on grades, he observes, ``are consistent but not tremendous'': where an only child achieves a B-plus, children with five siblings average a B. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"

"32998"	"she"	"observes"	" Factor in current concerns about AIDS, promiscuity and gay rights, Garber suggests, and we see a culture at war with its own instincts, sexual and otherwise. On the one hand, she observes, society is bombarded with images and messages that target both sides of the sexual equation at once. Calvin Klein jeans ads, David Bowie rock videos and the life histories (often reconstructed posthumously) of flawed geniuses like Leonard Bernstein and John Cheever are all prime examples. Michael Jackson, the biggest pop star on the planet, exudes a sexuality that may not be only bi- but, given his public image as a child molestor, bye-bye. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"38257"	"he"	"observes"	" Animal-rights activists have denounced French bullfighting, he observes, ``but nothing encourages the French so much as disapproval, especially from aliens.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"

"38756"	"he"	"observes"	" The retired general isn't talking. But deep into his autobiography, ``My America Journey'' (Random House), he offers a clue. In making decisions, he observes, timing is crucial. Act too quickly and you may lack sufficient information, too slowly, and opportunity may pass you by. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"

"47268"	"he"	"observes"	" Barkley on chain gangs: ``I think they're great. ... I think that every prisoner should be made to work eight hours a day.'' Four questions later, he observes, ``Hey, I'm only 32. I could care less about working. I've never had a job, and I don't really ever want to have one.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"
"48361"	"he"	"observes"	" Chugani determined this by measuring the brain's consumption of its chief energy source, glucose. (The more glucose it uses, the more active the brain.) Children's brains, he observes, gobble up glucose at twice the adult rate from the age of 4 to puberty. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"

"49181"	"he"	"observes"	" The bang was big indeed, he observes, ``but not so powerful that hydrogen and helium would not gravitationally settle back to give this universe light and life.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"
"49366"	"she"	"observes"	" In her book, ``The African-American Kitchen'' (Dutton), she observes, ``My African ancestors are an invisible but strong presence in my kitchen. Part of their legacy to me and to America can be found in the simmering pot of spicy okra gumbo, in a delicious handful of peanuts, in a steaming bowl of black-eyed peas and rice on a cold New Year's Day, and in freshly baked rolls, warm from the oven and covered with sesame seeds.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"
"52387"	"he"	"observes"	" Following the sexual revolution of the 1960s and women's movement of the '70s, he observes, women began taking control of their own sexuality in a much more aggressive fashion. For many men, this change in attitude poses a threat. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"

"58849"	"he"	"observes"	" It is obvious what Winston in ``1984'' thinks of the uniforms in Oceania.

"61711"	"he"	"observes"	" At one point, Casson watches a vast freight train loaded with German armaments. ``His heart fell _ what could he, what could any of them do against these people?''

"65723"	"she"	"observes"	" Occasionally, Ms. Friday makes a point so full of truth that it is a real loss when she fails to develop it. Women are taught not to compete with one another, much less with men, she observes, and suggests that girls should be taught about healthy competition. How? In her gushy way she suggests that women accept beauty, eradicate envy and be honest about mother-daughter competition from birth. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"

"68210"	"he"	"observes"	" Fishel correctly notes that ``good intelligence does not necessarily win battles,'' a fact underscored by Pope's and Hooker's spectacular defeats. No general in the Virginia theater, he observes, demonstrated equal facility at gathering, interpreting and applying intelligence. Hooker excelled at the first; his successor, George G. Meade, at the second, and Lee outshone all others in the third. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199608.gz"

"71106"	"he"	"observes"	" Lewis modeled the National Center on New York's Lincoln Center, Gaither says, combining the school, the museum and a variety of professional programs under one administrative umbrella. As Lewis began to withdraw from day-to-day managerial duties, he observes, ``We often struggled between the ideal and the possible.'' And yet through the 1980s, he says, when arts institutions everywhere suffered severe funding cuts, Lewis refused to compromise her sense of mission. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"
"72646"	"he"	"observes"	" In America these days, he observes, it is assumed that a guardian angel is something ``like a dog or a cat'': ``you acquire an angel in the expectation that this addition to your household will give you perpetual and unconditional love.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"
"74061"	"she"	"observes"	" Her humor ranges from the self-deprecating (``I really feel like I've suffered for my music, and now it's your turn'') to the typical (tenor jokes) and the topical (invoking Dr. Ruth Westheimer and ``wild and crazy guys''). Noting that 8 of 12 Puccini heroines get to die dramatically, she observes, ``That's a 66 percent death rate, a record even Dr. Kevorkian would envy.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"

"113363"	"she"	"observes"	" There's worse. Suzy Parker dies in a fall, after an affair with her director collapses. Diane Baker is saved though, probably because she refuses to get an abortion; she does, however, lose the baby in an accident. Duly humiliated, she is then redeemed: Her doctor falls for her, even though, she observes, he knows the truth about her. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"118808"	"he"	"observes"	" Ted Dintersmith, a general partner at Charles River Ventures in Waltham, Mass., similarly sees nearer-term hope in selling products to companies that make consumer goods. Whether it's the Blackberry or technology to make home electronics work better, he observes, consumers seem to be spending money while companies are holding back. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"131314"	"she"	"observes"	" There's a reason Dowler is particularly conscious of the absence of women heroes from the Sept. 11 narrative: She was doing research on women firefighters before the attacks on Washington and New York. And just as she was struck by the ubiquity of the widow (specifically, she observes, the white, Christian widow), she was struck by the invisibility of the female rescue worker. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"

"153110"	"he"	"observes"	" It's surprising how much of the movie is flat and how predictable the gags are. Actually, the director is Peter Segal, who made Sandler's Anger Management and 50 First Dates, so maybe surprise is too strong a word. But in those films, Segal got Jack Nicholson and Drew Barrymore, respectively, to enjoy themselves. Here, not even Cloris Leachman, as the warden's sexed up secretary, or the usually infallible Terry Crews, as the dealer of contraband cheeseburgers, made me laugh. Rock feels particularly gratuitous, employing his race-first stylings to mixed effect. Of Nelly's barefoot running back, he observes, That boy got slave feet! His sidekick role is a lot like Wanda Sykes's in Monster-in-Law: a racialized accessory whose jokes are on the fritz. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"

"159753"	"she"	"observes"	" We see the process by which folk life becomes the stuff of myth and art. But Hurston never insists that this progression goes from simple to complex. The gospel hymns sung in a Southern church, she observes, are likely to be far more rhythmically complex than those arranged for a choir with classical training. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
