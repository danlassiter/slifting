First the colonial powers established the practice of ethnic social engineering, playing tribe against tribe. Then, he charges, the United Nations, under the leadership of the ambitious idealist Dag Hammarskjold, pandered to Third World delegates by promoting ``a characteristic U.N. double standard: that whereas the killing of Africans by whites (as at Sharpeville in South Africa on 21 March 1960) was of international concern and a threat to peace, the killing of Africans by Africans (or of whites by Africans, or of Asians by Africans or all three races by Africans) was a purely internal matter outside the purview of the U.N.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199408.gz"

Worse, he charges, they stressed a connection between Buddhist compassion and the acceptance of death in a way that justified collective martyrdom and killing one's enemies. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"

But what happens when an inventor comes up with something so revolutionary that he can't resist commercializing it himself? That's the story of Dean Kamen's Segway Human Transporter, and Kemper, a journalist, records the blow-by-blow as Kamen's company struggled with product practicalities.  Kamen's heroic social vision and engineering brilliance were intertwined with serious business flaws: a stinginess and a paranoia about control that led to repeated delays and staff confusion. Only the sheer wonderfulness of the technology kept his people around and his minority investors on board.  Kemper's focus on the intricacies of Segway's product development, rather than on larger thoughts about innovation, means that business readers will have to do some legwork to draw lessons from this idiosyncratic story. Yet it's a well-written, sharply observed narrative with a reassuring message for corporate managers: Even the most appealing products still need you.  ``The Change Makers: From Carnegie to Gates, How the Great Entrepreneurs Tra investors have become rightly cautious about efforts to remake industries. Yet one of the glories of American business has been its relentless entrepreneurial drive. In a wide-ranging series of vignettes, Klein, a history professor, describes the lives of 26 change makers in the 19th and 20th centuries.  Many of us fear failure, but they feared a boring smallness. After achieving great success, most of them tenaciously dove right into questionable new ventures _ Thomas Edison squandered a decade and most of his light bulb fortune in a misconceived ore separation enterprise, while telephone mogul Theodore Vail's ostrich farm laid an egg. Or they continued to follow their own notions in ways that weakened their supreme creations, as Henry Ford did when he stubbornly stuck to his black Model Ts after his competitors began offering customers more choice. This chatty book delivers no surprising generalizations, but its colorful stories make inspiring reading for our conservative mood.  ``The New Chinese Empire and What It Means for the United States,'' by Ross Terrill (Basic Books, 2003)  Is China a tottering socialist dinosaur or an adaptable chameleon that ingeniously blends tradition and modernity? Will China succeed in combining Leninist autocracy with the openness required by its emerging market-based economy?  This Australian researcher offers a mixed answer. He finds that, for now, the communist elite has a stronger grip on the country than it might appear because it has replaced Marxism with a new mandate: Chinese nationalism. And a confident nationalist identity does indeed run deep among the ethnic Han majority of the population.  Nevertheless, Terrill still plausibly predicts the party's eventual downfall. Even with cultural unity, he charges, balancing authoritarianism with the long-term stresses of capitalist development requires political skills beyond the capability of the still highly insular party. Western readers may find this rambling survey of China's past, present and future frustrating at points, yet it perhaps appropriately mirrors the country's own incongruities.  ``Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game,'' by Michael Lewis (Norton, 2003)  Why do so many chief executives chase after growth for its own sake, when profits should be their foremost concern? Pundits often blame executives' obsession with empire building. But we might also blame the irresistible power of business tradition. Just look at the U.S. industry whose organizations are arguably the best measured and most competitive around: professional baseball.  As journalist Michael Lewis explains, team managers actually hold fast to several irrational principles. They glorify a player's batting average, for example, when simple statistical analyses show that the on-base percentage (which includes walks) is what really matters in winning games.  Over the years, outsiders had noted these discrepancies, yet managers dismissed these observers as statistics nerds who lacked a feel for the game. Nothing changed until the Oakland A's, finding itself with a suddenly shrunken payroll, took the nerds' advice out of desperation and started winning. Lewis makes only a few zdferences to business, but he offers an engaging parable of managers stuck in the traditional wisdom and suckered by upstarts with basic smarts.  (John T.
