The tete-a-tete _ actually, with translators present, a tete-a-tete-a-tete-a-tete _ took place in Geneva. Organizers thought it would take 15 minutes, recalled former Secretary of State George Shultz, reminiscing at the library this week. When the conversation went on for 75 minutes, the president's aides became restless.  After about a half hour, Shultz recalled, an aide asked him about interrupting. ``If you're stupid enough to go in and break up that meeting,'' Shultz told him, ``then you don't deserve the job you have.''  Shultz called the occasion ``a momentous day and a momentous meeting. When they came out, they were both smiling. They clicked.''  WRONGDOING  _ While admitting no wrongdoing, Infinity Broadcasting Corp., which is responsible for Howard Stern, has paid $1 million to the federal government. The money is the first installment of a settlement of indecency charges filed by federal regulators.  _ Admitting wrongdoing, we wish, at the request of Countess Morelos of San Francisco, to set things straight:  The Athletic Club mentioned in Tuesday's column as a formerly gay-oriented gym is the Athletic Club of West Hollywood, not the Los Angeles Athletic Club.  In 1948, when the Countess was Brenda Helser, she wore the initials of the venerable LAAC during tryouts for the U.S. Olympic swimming team. At the games in London, Helser won a gold medal and the heart of the Count.  ANGELOU SAYS `JEOPARDY!' IS WRONG  In an interview with David Frost quoted in the newsletter Dispatches, poet Maya Angelou complained about racism on TV.  ``I turn on a program like `Jeopardy!' '' she said, ``where quite often I am featured, or my name or some book I've written or some music I've written is the answer.  ``And I see no black people on it. I mean, I haven't seen a black person for two years on `Jeopardy!' ... so I'm boycotting it, although I love it.''  Producer George Vosburgh told Dispatches that he would ``love to see more members of minority groups appear'' and is ``disappointed'' that not many apply.  HURLEY THINKING ABOUT GODLINESS  Elizabeth Hurley, whose belief in the good Lord must have been tested when her boyfriend, Hugh Grant, was arrested for vehicular hanky-panky, is thinking of converting to Roman Catholicism.  William Cash, who interviewed her recently for the British magazine Harper's &AMP; Queen, told New York magazine, ``It's something she's wanted to do for years. She's always been obsessed with Graham Greene and other famous people who have converted, so I don't subscribe to the Divine Brown atonement theory.''  WHO SAID WHAT  ``Basically I thought (all the existing tattoo magazines) sucked and I thought I could do something more intelligent. The only problem with that is I found that you're basically casting your pearls before swine. I know I'm going to make a lot of people made by saying that but ... sadly, I found that most people who get tattooed really only buy the magazines to cut the pictures out so they can take it to their local scab vendor and have a handy set of references.''  _ Jonathan Shaw, disappointed creator of Tattoo International magazine, in the periodical Seconds.  THE LYCRA LOOK  Health magazine ranks the appeal of male athletes to women (from most appealing to least):  Skiers, runners, tennis players, motorcycle racers and golfers.
