NOW?  A survey of 500 American school kids has determined that more than half (53 percent) think that summer is more boring than the school year.  Furthermore, while 51 percent of the parents said that family trips are ``lots of fun,'' only one in three kids agreed.  This survey, not surprisingly, was taken for Sega, a manufacturer of portable electronic games that are supposed to keep the children in the back seat from tearing each other's hair out.  EDUCATION-MEISTER RECALLS HIS PAST  U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley talks about his preparation for his job _ some of his personal experiences in education _ in the latest issue of the children's magazine Nickelodeon.  Asked whether he was ever in a school play, the secretary recalls the end of the first grade, when he played a red light in a production about traffic safety. ``My mother made me a little black suit with a little red dot in the middle. I was very nervous. My line was this: `I'm a red light/ As you can see/ And you better stop/ When you see me.'  ``I was so nervous, I walked off the stage and threw up. It's true. I was terribly embarrassed. That was my introduction to public life.''  Asked whether he doodles in cabinet meetings, Riley starts out modestly and then waxes poetic about his accomplishments:  ``Yes, I do,'' he says. ``Actually, I usually write down ideas, rather than doodle. But I'm good at stars. And I draw people, smiling people usually. Sometimes I draw muscle-bound people. And I can really draw a good airplane, wings and all. ...

MICKEY AND BART SQUARE OFF FOR GRAND PRIZE  In a series of stories about the Disney takeover of Capital Cities/ABC, Advertising Age describes the global fight for domination of the children's media market: ``Worldwide struggle pits a brat and rodent.''

YM MAKES BEST OF OPPORTUNITY  Nikki Taylor was slated to be the cover girl for the September issue of YM, a magazine for teenagers, but just as the magazine was going to press, the model's younger sister, 17-year-old Krissy, died of asthma.  The cover actually was shot in June, editor Sally Lee said, to go with a ``12-page hair booklet on Nikki Taylor's supermodel hair secrets.'' The death of the supermodel's sister made the hair cover line seem ``incredibly disrespectful.''  The cover line ``Why did Krissy have to die?'' was substituted and Lee wrote a 700-word tribute to Krissy in her editor's note. ``In fact,'' she said, to emphasize the seriousness of her intentions, ``the tribute was longer than (the text for) Nikki's supermodel hair secrets.''

They move weekly to clients of the New York Times News Service.  G: General audiences. Nothing that would offend parents if viewed by children.  PG: Parental guidance suggested. May contain some material parents consider inappropriate for young children.  PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for preteens.  R: Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking children.  NC-17: No one under 17 admitted. Replaces the X rating.  NR: Not rated.  The American President PG-13  In Rob Reiner's tangy romantic comedy, Michael Douglas plays widowed President Andrew Shepherd, who woos environmental lobbyist Sydney Wade (Annette Bening). Unfortunately, election year is looming. And Senator Rumson (Richard Dreyfuss) grabs their romance as fodder for his own mudslinging campaign. Regaining his magic touch, Reiner keeps his film balanced between its smarter agenda and its Hollywood fairy-tale touches. Rated PG-13 for language. _ Steve Murray  Assassins R  Sylvester Stallone plays Rath, a professional hit man facing a rival for his position as No. 1 with a bullet. That's Miguel (Antonio Banderas), a cocky enigma who's modeled his moves on Rath. And who wants to eliminate the competition. The standard cloak-and-dagger is pumped by director Richard Donner's cinematic firepower. The movie's first half has a sleek energy, fine action and real tension. But the movie crawls to a halt and goes over the top in a drawn-out finale inside an empty hotel. It's a big letdown. _ Steve Murray  Babe G  Pig out on this delightfully screwball movie about a piglet who thinks he's a sheepdog. Real-life animals carry the bulk of the story, but they get some high-tech help from computer graphics and superbly lifelike animatronic stand-ins created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Voice talent Christine Cavanaugh as Babe and Miriam Margolyes (``The Age of Innocence'') as Fly, Babe's adopted border collie mom.  Balto G  A beautifully executed, edge-of-your-seat exciting animated adventure. The full- mush story is based on the true-life journey of a heroic sled dog named Balto who brought the anti-diphtheria serum to Nome, Alaska, in 1925, thus saving the lives of hundreds of children. A tale of perseverance, courage, tolerance and puppy love, the movie's all-star cast of voices includes Kevin Bacon, Bridget Fonda, Bob Hoskins and Phil Collins.  Bed of Roses PG  This romance set in New York City looks like prime date-night fare. Mary Stuart Masterson stars as a workaholic corporate executive who is baffled, and delighted, by a succession of gifts from a secret admirer. Christian Slater co-stars.  Big Bully PG  Rick Moranis plays a novelist who returns to his old grade school to teach a class and discovers that his childhood tormentor, a former schoolyard tough named ``Fang,'' is teaching there as well. Tom Arnold plays the grown-up bully.  The Big Green PG  Bad title. Cute movie. The Mighty Ducks _ or the Bad News Bears, depending on your generation _ play soccer. A pert British teacher (Olivia d'Abo) comes to a tired-out Texas town and turns things around by introducing her students to soccer. Yes, it's as formulaic as you might expect, but funny thing about formulas _ sometimes they work. And about the uninviting title, it refers to the town's overgrown football field that gets a second life as a soccer field. Think: between the hedges meets the World Cup. Rated PG for language.  Bio-Dome PG-13  Dumb Pauly Shore and dumber Stephen Baldwin get locked inside the environmentally controlled bio-dome, with the scientists committed to living there a year. This movie wants to be a ``Dumb and Dumbest,'' but it's really ``Dull and Dullest.'' See the dudes wreck the rain forest! Watch them swing on vines! Dumb can be fun, but Shore and Baldwin aren't Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. Most of the humor consists of watching Shore crack himself up with his own Valley garble. It's good to know he's having a great time. Steve Murray  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960124.0113 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(2ndtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Casino R  The ``GoodFellas'' duo _ director Martin Scorsese and writer Nicholas Pileggi _ roll the dice a second time and come up craps. Robert De Niro plays Sam ``Ace'' Rothstein, a professional gambler who operates a Las Vegas casino from behind the scenes; Joe Pesci is a hothead hit man, and both were better in ``GoodFellas.'' Finally there's Ginger (Sharon Stone, who proves once and for all that she can act), a former hooker who becomes Sam's reluctant wife and dives into the bottle. If the movie focused more clearly on these three, ``Casino'' might hold our interest. But the whole thing feels like a retread. _ Steve Murray  Copycat R  A cat-and-mouse thriller that'll have you on the edge of your seat from the opening scene until the closing credits. Holly Hunter is a San Francisco cop on the trail of a killer. She enlists the help of psychiatrist/author Sigourney Weaver, an expert on serial killers. Smartly directed by Jon Amiel, with fine supporting turns by Dermot Mulroney and Harry Connick Jr., the movie reminds us that _ to invert the Police song ``Murder By Numbers'' _ murder doesn't have to be an art, but it can be the basis for one heck of a suspense movie. Rated R for language, violence and nudity.  Cutthroat Island PG- 13  The audience walks the plank in this clumsy new pirate movie. Directed by husband Renny Harlin (``Cliffhanger''), Geena Davis plays 17th-century swashbucklette Morgan, who races evil uncle Dawg (Frank Langella) for buried treasure on the titular island. She's aided by a scalawag named Shaw (Matthew Modine), and it's a draw as to who's more out of depth, Modine or Davis. They're like a suburban couple playing dress up, yammering lame lines. The fault goes equally to Harlin, who continues the chaos-over-coherence style of filmmaking he began with ``Die Hard 2.'' People yell and run around. Things explode, a lot. If anybody thought ``Cutthroat Island'' would usher in a new wave of pirate movies, don't count on it. This baby doesn't have sea legs. Rated PG-13 for action and brief sensuality. _ Steve Murray  Dangerous Minds R  Michelle Pfeiffer gets an A for effort in her role as a former Marine trying to teach poetry to some hardened inner-city kids, but everyone else _ from the cliched teen cast to director John N. Smith and writer Ronald Bass _ flunks out. Rated R for language and adult themes.  Dead Man Walking R  In Tim Robbins' deadly earnest, intermittently powerful death-row drama, a nun (Susan Sarandon) becomes involved with a convicted murderer (Sean Penn). Both give riveting portrayals (though Penn's arrogant, racist redneck is getting most of the attention). The problem is the movie isn't really about either character. It's about an issue _ the pros and cons of the death penalty _ which means it often lapses into the message-conscious style of a '50s TV drama. Still, Robbins manages a shatteringly effective final half hour simply by showing us how capital punishment works in every gruesome and dehumanizing detail.  Dead Presidents R  A searingly fine sophomore effort by the Hughes brothers (``Menace II Society''). Like an African-Americanized ``The Deer Hunter,'' the movie follows some pals from the Bronx before, during and after their tour of duty in Vietnam. Larenz Tate is the film's indispensable anchor, but he gets fine support from Keith David, N'Bushe Wright and Bokeem Wodbine, among others. The film isn't perfect; by trying to cover so much ground, it skims certain issues, skimps on certain characters. But it's a vital and passionate look at a nation so caught up in the macho-angst of losing a war abroad that it ignored a far more important war at home. Rated R for sex, violence, nudity and language.  Devil in a Blue Dress R  An exercise in retro cool and a richly textured homage to cinematic flatfoots. Denzel Washington plays accidental private eye Easy Rawlins. The year is 1948, and he's approached by a tough (Tom Sizemore) who claims he's working for a mayoral candidate whose fiancee Daphne (Jennifer Beals) has gone missing. But this turns out to be much more than a missing persons case. The interesting part of ``Devil'' isn't its convoluted plot (which gets less interesting as it becomes clearer), but the smaller observations that constantly remind us of Easy's double trouble as a black man in '40s L.A. Rated R for sex, language and violence. _ Steve Murray  Don't Be a Menace  to South Central While Drinking  Your Juice in the Hood R  A vehicle for Shawn and Marlon Wayans, the two youngest members of the comic family that includes brothers Damon and Keenen Ivory. This ``Airplane!''-style parody takes broad, juvenile jabs at such urban ``message'' movies as ``Menace II Society'' and ``Boyz N the Hood.'' If not all the jokes here work, many of the ones that do have extra weight. When two characters are busted for ``being black on a Friday night'' and taken to a police station equipped with a Rodney King punch-and-kick video game, the movie turns from goofy fun to comedy that tickles and stings. _ Doug Hamilton  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960124.0114 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(3rdtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Dunston Checks In PG  Kids will probably go bananas over this family-friendly monkey movie. ``Seinfeld's'' Jason Alexander stars as a single father who manages a swanky New York hotel. His youngest son discovers that one of the guests, a thief masquerading as a British lord (Rupert Everett), has smuggled in an orangutan. Named Dunston, this hairy partner in crime is trained to break into rooms while his master is hobnobbing at the bar, establishing an alibi. If the movie is a bit derivative, it's solid entertainment, sparked by witty performances by Alexander, Everett and Faye Dunaway, who gives her role as the hotel owner's exacting wife just the right Leona Helmsley spin. Rated PG for language. _ Doug Hamilton  Eye for an Eye R  Sally Field stars in this taut, emotionally charged thriller about a mother seeking vengeance on the psychopath who raped and murdered her daughter. But this is more than a distaff ``Death Wish''; it's also an exploration of the toxic aftershocks of violence _ its malignant effect on a person or a family. You can tell the care director John Schlesinger (``Midnight Cowboy'') has put into the film simply by the care he's put into the casting: Ed Harris in what could have been the vanilla role of Field's husband; Joe Mantegna as the homicide detective on the case; and Kiefer Sutherland as the sneering scum who may have tangled with the wrong mom.  Father of the Bride, Part II PG  Steve Martin's father of the bride becomes a father-to-be and a grandfather-to-be in this dumbed-down diversion that's not half as enjoyable as its 1991 predecessor. The funny parts, all of which have been revealed in the trailer (the dual pregnancies of wife Diane Keaton and daughter Kimberly Williams, Martin's midlife crisis, the return of Martin Short's egregiously effeminate party planner), just aren't that funny. However, the schmaltzy parts, near the end, work like a charm. My advice: Go with someone who is pregnant and enjoy her enjoyment. Somehow, even the dumbest pregnancy cliches seem appealing in your second trimester. Rated PG for mild adult themes and language.  Four Rooms R  A quartet of short films set in the same hotel on New Year's Eve; the omnibus is a roster of hip young directors: Allison Anders, Alexandre Rockwell, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. All four seem to be vying for the least credibility. Anders' ``The Missing Ingredient'' is a silly, smirky tale of a witch coven (including Valeria Golino and Madonna) trying to summon a petrified goddess back to life. In ``The Wrong Man,'' Rockwell directs his real wife, Jennifer Beals, in a mean- spirited skit about sexual obsession. The best segment is Rodriguez's ``The Misbehavers,'' concerning two kids (Lana McKissack and Danny Verduzco) and some neatly orchestrated mayhem, which includes bloodshed, fire and a prostitute's corpse. Finally, Tarantino shows up in his own film, ``The Man From Hollywood,'' trying to top his own high quotient of obscenities with endless rants. As bad as Tarantino is, it's Tim Roth who walks away with the worst actor award as the hotel's beleaguered bellboy; his performance is a compendium of jittery flourishes and grimaces that would make Crispin Glover proud. _ Steve Murray  From Dusk Till Dawn R  Robert Rodriguez's hyperviolent vampire flick stars scripter Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney (in a dynamic big-screen crossover) as killer bank robbers who take hostage a retired minister (a beautifully subdued Harvey Keitel) and his kids (including Juliette Lewis, also acting saner than she has in years). Bad luck for them, these anti-heroes stop at a Mexican bar _ catering to bikers and bloodsuckers. The long opening setup is vintage Tarantino, full of bloody shocks and sick humor. But once the saloon's staff morph into vampires, ``Dusk'' heads into Sam Raimi's ``Evil Dead'' territory, complete with spewing eyeballs and severed limbs (The movie also owes a lot to ``Night of the Living Dead.''). For all the bloodshed, the second half is less genuinely tense than the first. You feel yourself relaxing: Hey, it's only a vampire movie. It's an excuse for a couple of way- talented filmmakers to have gruesome fun. And for most of the time, we do, too. But the squeamish, beware. _ Steve Murray  Georgia R  A daring downer of a film about two sisters. One sings; the other doesn't. But that doesn't mean that she doesn't want to sing, with every desperate, self-destructive nerve in her drug-addled body. Mare Winningham is the title character, a centered superstar with a golden voice; Jennifer Jason Leigh is her sister, Sadie. Sort of Sid Vicious' psychic twin, she burns with neediness and ambition. Ulu Grosbard directed from a script by Barbara Turner. The strong supporting cast includes John Doe (of X) and Ted Levine. A movie for people who take their movies seriously.  Get Shorty R  Barry Sonnenfeld's lively adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel follows the exploits of a Miami loan shark named Chili Palmer (John Travolta) who finds out that show biz isn't all that different from shylocking when he goes to pick up a debt from a B-movie producer (Gene Hackman). Anchoring the most complicated plot since ``The Usual Suspects,'' the charming Travolta proves he's no ``Pulp Fiction'' flash in the pan. _ Steve Murray  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960124.0115 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(4thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  GoldenEye PG-13  Reality never intrudes on the babes and bombs, gags and gadgets in this guilty pleasure introducing Pierce Brosnan as the new 007. Despite some P.C. lip service, it's the old things that work best, including villains left over from the Cold War (Sean Bean as a disgruntled Cossack, Famke Janssen as masochistic femme fatale Xenia Onatopp). Pitched between the no-nonsense Timothy Dalton and the inimitably courtly Sean Connery, Brosnan deserves a few more spins in the Aston-Martin. _ Steve Murray  Grumpier Old Men PG-13  They aren't really any grumpier. But stars Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are richer, thanks to the first film's success. Most of the original team is back, including Ann-Margret as Lemmon's sex-kitten wife and Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's drinking, smoking, oversexed dad. The main newcomer is Sophia Loren as the bombshell Maria who sets the men's pacemakers ticking. As far as retreads go, ``Grumpier'' is faithful to the first one's mix of slapstick, senior-level smut and schmaltz. But if the first film was Lemmon's movie, this one is Matthau's. There's a lovely sweetness in his courtship with Loren; he has the puppyish bafflement of a fellow in love for the very first time. He makes even wine in a box seem romantic. But after an hour, the movie runs out of its already meager steam. Whether you want to meander along with it depends on how you respond to Lemmon's and Matthau's patented slow burns. _ Steve Murray  Heat R  Looks hot on paper (Al Pacino and Robert De Niro together again for the first time!), but on screen, this incoherent, overlong action flick never sputters above a pseudo-simmer. Pacino is a workaholic L.A. cop obsessed with catching De Niro, a career criminal who masterminds complex heists. The movie lasts almost three hours and the two stars spend around 10 minutes together. Maybe writer/director Michael Mann thought he was creating an existential male menopause movie masquerading as a cops and robbers drama. But watching two great actors run, jump and shoot their way through roles they would have laughed at in their Young Turk days is ultimately kind of painful. Rated R for violence, language and brief sex.  It Takes Two PG  Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen of TV's ``Full House'' (they shared the role of Michelle Tanner) play identical strangers _ one a streetwise New York orphan, the other a billionaire's daughter _ who scheme to switch places and get their single guardians together. Sure, it's ``The Prince and the Pauper'' meets ``The Parent Trap,'' but director Andy Tennant does absolutely the best job one can with borrowed ideas, and the Olsens are _ surprise! _ a delight, far more expressive than on ``Full House'' and very natural in their parts. Rated PG for mild adult themes. _ Doug Hamilton  Jumanji PG  Robin Williams shows us where the wild things are in this effects-laden family fantasy about a mysterious board game that can bring rhinos into your living room or turn a house into a primeval swamp. Director Joe Johnstone (``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'') knows how to thrill an audience with outsized insects or a stampede down Main Street. But the movie goes on a roll of the dice or two too long. And in-between ``plays,'' things get frankly boring. Bottom line: If you've seen the trailer, you've already seen all the best parts. And those ``best parts'' may be a little scary for littler kids. Johnston does nothing to up the ante; it's like playing Candyland instead of Monopoly. Rated PG for violence.  Lawnmower Man 2 PG-13  A frenetic, clueless sequel to the 1992 sci-fi flick, it stars Matt Frewer as Jobe, a techno-god of virtual reality. Hooked up to cyberspace via headset, he's building a new ramp on the information superhighway that will give him access to every bit of information (credit card numbers, top-secret data, etc.) in the world. That is, unless a reclusive scientist (Patrick Bergin) can stop him. Not a lick of it makes sense, starting with the futuristic L.A. setting. The characters spend their time spouting cyber-jumbo, tapping computer keyboards and competing with highly cheesy computer FX. Frewer (``Max Headroom'') probably won't be making new fans with this performance _ a weird hybrid of ``Hellraiser's'' Pinhead and Jim Carrey Lite. Unplug, unplug. _ Steve Murray  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960124.0116 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(5thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Leaving Las Vegas R  ``Viva Las Vegas'' on two dozen downers and a case of Jack Black. Nicolas Cage is an alcoholic Hollywood screenwriter who pockets his severance check and heads to Vegas to drink himself to death. Elisabeth Shue is a Vegas hooker who gets hooked on his devil-may-care despair. The movie is a bit of a drunk itself _ given to self-indulgent poses and poetic pretentiousness. But Cage and Shue are willing _ and able _ to do director Mike Figgis' dirty work for him. Their terrific performances leave you feeling unclean and sober. Rated R for sex, language, nudity and drug abuse.  Mr. Holland's Opus PG  The corn is as high as an elephant's eye in this unabashedly sentimental melodrama. And guess what? The cornier it gets, the better the picture works. Richard Dreyfuss stars as a would-be composer who devotes 30 years of his life to teaching high school music students. Director Stephen Herek has shaped the film into easily absorbed TV-size chunks that are given focus and humor thanks to a solid cast and Dreyfuss' energized, razor- sharp performance. Goodbye, Mr. Chips; hello, Mr. Holland.  Money Train R  Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson attempt to work the same buddy magic that made their 1992 basketball comedy, ``White Men Can't Jump,'' such a hit. Here, their interplay is again easy and amusing, but the movie around them is a cliched jumble. The two play New York subway cops who also are foster brothers. Snipes is the responsible one; Harrelson's the habitual gambler with the Mom-always-liked-you-best chip on his shoulder. When Harrelson's fortunes take a downward turn (due to a laughable series of plot contrivances), he decides to reverse his loser status by robbing the subway's revenue train. Rated R for violence, language and nudity. _ Doug Hamilton  Mortal Kombat PG-13  Three humans kick butt to save the universe; they should have saved the movie first. A lot of money was spent on the flick, but it went into the computer graphics, neo-Hammer Horror sets and the occasional four-armed monster. Martial-arts champs Liu Kang (Robin Shou), Sonya (Bridgette Wilson) Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby) have been tapped to fight The Tournament, and if they don't win, the whole dang Earth will be enslaved by some muckety-muck intergalactic emperor with really bad acne. The movie gets to its mysterious combat island with a cool buildup and a sense of wonder. But once the battles start, it's all special effects wrapped inside one giant yawn. _ Steve Murray  Nixon R  Oliver Stone's compassionate, intricate, hugely ambitious character study of the only man in history to resign the presidency. The movie follows Nixon (Anthony Hopkins) from his dirt-poor childhood to his dirty-politics downfall with Watergate. A vast, talented cast, headed by Joan Allen as Pat Nixon and Paul Sorvino as Kissinger, flesh out all the president's men (and women). Even at three-hours-plus, the movie is never less than fascinating and, at heart, it's one of the saddest stories you'll ever hear. The one about the man who got everything he wanted . . . and then it got him back. Rated R for language and adult themes.  Now and Then PG-13  This sticky-sweet female ``Stand by Me'' begins and ends with brief scenes of four friends _ played by Demi Moore, Rosie O'Donnell, Melanie Griffith and Rita Wilson _ reuniting as one of them prepares to give birth. In the middle, we get an extended flashback of the four as girls in the summer of 1970. Director Lesli Linka Glatter establishes a wistful, knowing tone here, and Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffman as the preteen O'Donnell and Moore give delightful performances. Too bad screenwriter I. Marlene King has loaded this nostalgia trip down with cliches and mawkish dialogue. Rated PG-13 for adolescent sex discussions. _ Doug Hamilton  Othello R  Though handsomely shot and cleanly spoken, the new film of ``Othello'' is more like ``The Iago Show.'' Kenneth Branagh plays the fellow, who connives to convince his employer, the noble Othello (a strong but distant Laurence Fishburne), that his new wife, Desdemona (Irene Jacob), is unfaithful. In a plot fueled by Iago's machinations, Othello already runs the risk of being upstaged. In director Oliver Parker's piecemeal adaptation, this imbalance is emphasized, with the terrific Branagh delivering his juicy monologues directly to the camera. Parker rigs the tale for a '90s audience with several wordless bedroom scenes (thus the R rating). But for all the heavy breathing and MTV-speed cuts, this ``Othello'' loses steam the closer it gets to its denouement. The finale feels merely unfortunate, not devastating. And that's a real tragedy. _ Steve Murray  Persuasion PG  An awesome Jane Austen adaptation, courtesy of director Roger Michell, writer Nick Dear and a splendid cast. Set in the early 19th century, the movie is both a superbly nuanced social comedy and a yearningly openhearted romantic drama. At the ripe old age of 27, Anne Elliott (Amanda Root) is facing _ gasp _ spinsterhood. Then the man she wrongly rejected years ago (a family friend insisted he lacked family and finances) comes back into her life. But can true romance overcome the idiot clutter of society's expectations and repressed emotions? Gloriously romantic yet giddily hilarious, this movie gives you a ruefully knowing smile as it sides with the wise heart. You leave the theater feeling better about everything. Rated PG for mild adult themes.  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960124.0117 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(6thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  The Postman NR  Set in the early '50s, this bittersweet tale of the unlikely friendship between the world-famous poet Pablo Neruda and Mario, an unworldly fisherman's son, is a deceptively simple film that sneaks up on you. English director Michael Radford (``White Mischief'') brings an outsider's intrigued eye to his Italian setting. But his ultimate focus is on the collision of poet and peasant and how each affects the other.  Powder PG-13  A synthetic fable. Sean Patrick Flanery plays Powder, a brilliant albino what's-it found in a basement. Taken in by the local orphanage, he runs into the predictable: tough older boys, giggling schoolgirls, angry parents. Trudging toward the inevitable plot points (Powder teaches that hunting isn't nice, that big boys shouldn't pick on smaller ones), the movie wastes Mary Steenburgen as the orphanage's concerned director. Flanery plays Powder with a sparrowlike gentleness, but he's playing a concept, not a character; Powder's talents are hopelessly vague, a mix of megawatts and telekinesis. And director Victor Salva is so busy being ``sensitive,'' he saps any life out of the premise. _ Steve Murray  Restoration R  Robert Downey Jr. leads a large cast of notables, including Hugh Grant, Sam Neill and Meg Ryan, in this lavish costume drama set in 17th-century England. Downey plays a randy physician who gets a rather bizarre proposal from King Charles II (Neill).  Richard III R  There's talk of an Oscar nomination for Sir Ian McKellen's performance in this daring adaptation of Shakespeare's play. The acclaimed British actor plays the title role, one of the bard's most ruthless creations, but as a fascist dictator in 1930s Europe. Doug Hamilton  Sabrina PG  The difference between the original ``Sabrina,'' a minor Billy Wilder film meant as a shameless showcase for Audrey Hepburn, and Sydney Pollack's remake isn't a matter of Hepburn vs. her replacement, Julia Ormond. It's a matter of Hepburn vs. Harrison Ford. He takes the Humphrey Bogart role of a sour tycoon who steps in when the chauffeur's daughter (Ormond) threatens to distract his easily distracted younger brother (a funny Greg Kinnear) from his impending marriage/corporate merger. The first film was about Hepburn's transformation; this one is about Ford's. It gives it a more serious tone, but it also makes it more satisfying.  Screamers R  Futuristic thriller set on a distant planet called Sirius B, where a military experiment has gone fatally out of control. Manmade killing machines called Screamers, which resemble huge metallic armadillos, have developed a will, and a deadly agenda, of their own. Peter Weller stars.  Sense and Sensibility PG  This dazzling Jane Austen adaptation is one of the year's best and a sure-fire Oscar contender. Emma Thompson (who wrote the script) and Kate Winslet (``Heavenly Creatures'') co- star as penniless sisters trying to make their way among the sensible and the senseless in late 18th-century England. Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant and Greg Wise are suitors (of varying and changeable degrees of suitability). The unlikely director is Ang Lee (``Eat Drink Man Woman''), who has delivered a gorgeous film brimming with humor, romance and intelligence _ one that, on its own terms, is as fraught with peril and incident as a Spielberg thrill-flick. Score one for the good guys (and good gals). And get your Oscar score card ready. Rated PG for mild adult themes.  Seven R  The creative serial killer in this self-conscious gibberish models his gruesome murders after each of the seven deadly sins. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are the cops out to stop him, but there's not much they can do to rescue this one-gimmick movie from quickly wearing out its one gimmick. Rated R for violence and language.  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960124.0118 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(7thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Sudden Death R  Suddenly Christmas doesn't seem so ho-ho hum anymore for action fans. In this dumb-and-dumber knockoff of ``Die Hard'' (that's meant as a compliment), Jean-Claude Van Damme is the one-man cavalry who must save a stadium full of hockey fans from a madman (Powers Boothe) who's wired the place to blow up if he doesn't get a zillion-billion dollars. The movie is nonstop, state-of-the- art, over-the-top Hollywood hokum. And that's meant as a compliment, too. Rated R for violence and language.  To Die For R  Nicole Kidman gives a breakthrough performance as a psychopathic Jane Pauley wannabe in this wickedly hilarious look at TV-spawned celebrity obsession. Gus Van Sant's direction is pitch perfect, as are his actors, led by Matt Dillon as Kidman's lunkhead hubby and Wayne Knight as the manager of the cable TV station where she's employed as an, um, weatherperson. The movie isn't profound, but it catches, with uncanny accuracy, a startling moment in our nation's Geraldo-ized psyche. Like some '90s Norma Desmond, Kidman's ready for her close-up, Mr. Bochco. Rated R for sex and language.  To Wong Foo,  Thanks for Everything!  Julie Newmar PG-13  Perhaps the most shocking thing about this drag-queen comedy is how very unshocking it is. When their car breaks down en route to Hollywood, a trio of Manhattan transvestites _ twinkly, maternal Vida (Patrick Swayze), sassy, smart-mouthed Noxema (Wesley Snipes), and hot-to-trot Chi Chi (John Leguizama) _ give a mega-make-over to residents of a drab town. This whole movie could use a make-over.  Tom and Huck G  A straightforward, well-played adaptation of Mark Twain's classic ``The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.'' Director Peter Hewitt doesn't do much to capture Twain's tone, but he wisely stays out of the way of the story. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is initially too TV-cute as Tom, and Brad Renfro's Huck has been sanitized into a 19th-century homeless boy who just needs to be loved. But they both grow on you. One nice touch: This film's Becky Thatcher is a full head taller than Tom.  Toy Story G  A knockout. The first feature to be fully computer-generated, the all-ages comedy taps our childhood fantasies about the lives toys lead when the bedroom door closes. And it injects grown-up humor by making these Mr. Potato Heads and Slinky Dogs as psychologically diverse as any human. As neurotic as they are nice, the toys fret about their young owner Andy's birthday party, worried about getting edged out by a super-duper new toy. Longtime fave cowboy Woody (voice by Tom Hanks) gets upstaged by newcomer Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), a gleaming plastic hero. In this mock epic, Woody and Buzz go out into the ``real world,'' where they scamper beneath 18-wheelers, flee a toothy canine and survive the sadistic antics of the kid next door. Four years in the making, the film is a jaw-dropping spectacle, with one bravura sequence topping the one before. Give it five minutes, and this laugh-out-loud delight can turn the scroogiest Scrooge into a happy kid. _ Steve Murray  12 Monkeys R  Terry Gilliam's despair-laced fantasy gets under your skin _ even when you don't exactly know what's going on. Bruce Willis stars as Cole, who claims to be a time traveler from the year 2035. He's sent back to 1996 to discover the cause of a plague that has wiped out 5 billion people. Is he really from the future, or is he insane _ as one psychiatrist (Madeleine Stowe) thinks? As in Gilliam's other films (``Time Bandits,'' ``The Fisher King''), story and emotion come second to visual design and mood, and at times the movie could use a stronger sense of drama and momentum. Still, there's nothing else like it on screen right now. For its strange, spooky visual poetry, ``Monkeys'' is a barrel of glum fun. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  Two If by Sea R  A negligible, slightly amusing caper comedy that proves Sandra Bullock's first-rate charm can prop up second-rate material. She and Denis Leary play a bickering blue-collar couple who've stolen a painting. Arriving at Cape Cod a few days before their scheduled rendezvous with the mysterious buyer, they decide to enjoy the good life and ``house-sit'' a seaside mansion. Leary wrote the script, which includes flashes of his acerbic, off-kilter wit, but mostly the movie doesn't have enough heft, comedic or romantic. A good rentable.  The Usual Suspects R  A crafty crime thriller you'll want to watch twice. Told mainly in flashbacks, it unravels the tale of five crooks (including Kevin Spacey, Stephen Baldwin and Gabriel Byrne) and a messed-up drug deal that left all but one of them dead. But solving this mystery isn't nearly as simple as it looks. Part hard-boiled ``Rashomon,'' part cinematic con game, ``Suspects'' keeps pulling the rug out from under you. It demands (and rewards) close attention. Don't be surprised if you feel like watching it a second time _ not because you're confused, but just to savor the screenplay's twists and red herrings. It's anything but usual. Rated R for language and violence. _ Steve Murray  Vampire in Brooklyn R  An anemic hybrid of laughs and jolts, Wes Craven's movie stars Eddie Murphy as the vampire Maximillian, who comes to New York with an unplaceable accent and a wardrobe somewhere between Vincent Price and Sunset Boulevard pimp. He's seeking Rita (Angela Bassett), a cop who doesn't realize she's got vampire blood in her veins. Mixing gross-out humor, some sex, some violence, the movie never decides whether it's a comedy, a thriller, a romance _ what? Likewise, Murphy (the hero? the villain?) is stranded, posing in his threads like an International Male model. He also plays a couple of minor characters, and his scene as a Sharpton-like preacher who convinces his flock that ``evil is good'' is one of the few moments when the movie comes alive. Otherwise, it's undead all the way. _ Steve Murray  Waiting to Exhale R  A breath of fresh air. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon play friends in this glossy, well-acted adaptation of Terry McMillan's best seller. Forest Whitaker, better known for his acting in ``Bird'' and ``The Crying Game,'' provides the expert direction. And as for the reported ``male bashing,'' before you take your man, simply ask yourself, is he man enough to take it? Whitaker is. And he's man enough to dish it out, too. Rated R for sex, language and adult themes. .

They move weekly to clients of the New York Times News Service.  G: General audiences. Nothing that would offend parents if viewed by children.  PG: Parental guidance suggested. May contain some material parents consider inappropriate for young children.  PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for preteens.  R: Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking children.  NC-17: No one under 17 admitted. Replaces the X rating.  NR: Not rated.  The American President PG-13  In Rob Reiner's tangy romantic comedy, Michael Douglas plays widowed President Andrew Shepherd, who woos environmental lobbyist Sydney Wade (Annette Bening). Unfortunately, election year is looming. And Senator Rumson (Richard Dreyfuss) grabs their romance as fodder for his own mudslinging campaign. Regaining his magic touch, Reiner keeps his film balanced between its smarter agenda and its Hollywood fairy-tale touches. Rated PG-13 for language. _ Steve Murray  Babe G  Pig out on this delightfully screwball movie about a piglet who thinks he's a sheepdog. Real-life animals carry the bulk of the story, but they get some high-tech help from computer graphics and superbly lifelike animatronic stand-ins created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Voice talent Christine Cavanaugh as Babe and Miriam Margolyes (``The Age of Innocence'') as Fly, Babe's adopted border collie mom.  Balto G  A beautifully executed , edge- of-your-seat exciting animated adventure. The full-mush story is based on the true-life journey of a heroic sled dog named Balto who brought the anti- diphtheria serum to Nome, Alaska, in 1925, thus saving the lives of hundreds of children. A tale of perseverance, courage, tolerance and puppy love, the movie's all-star cast of voices includes Kevin Bacon, Bridget Fonda, Bob Hoskins and Phil Collins.  Bed of Roses PG  A small hooray to Christian Slater and Mary Stuart Masterson for lending their star power to this slight modern romance about a career woman who needs to stop and smell the (bed of) roses and the Prince Charming who wants to show her how. Unfortunately, writer- director Michael Goldenberg sets up his two attracted opposites and then really doesn't know what to do with them. We're left with a sweet nothing of a movie that promises more than it delivers.  The Big Green PG  Bad title. Cute movie. The Mighty Ducks _ or the Bad News Bears, depending on your generation _ play soccer. A pert British teacher (Olivia d'Abo) comes to a tired-out Texas town and turns things around by introducing her students to soccer. Yes, it's as formulaic as you might expect, but funny thing about formulas _ sometimes they work. And about the uninviting title, it refers to the town's overgrown football field that gets a second life as a soccer field. Think: between the hedges meets the World Cup. Rated PG for language.  Bio-Dome PG-13  Dumb Pauly Shore and dumber Stephen Baldwin get locked inside the environmentally controlled bio-dome, with the scientists committed to living there a year. This movie wants to be a ``Dumb and Dumbest,'' but it's really ``Dull and Dullest.'' See the dudes wreck the rain forest! Watch them swing on vines! Dumb can be fun, but Shore and Baldwin aren't Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. Most of the humor consists of watching Shore crack himself up with his own Valley garble. It's good to know he's having a great time. Steve Murray  Black Sheep PG- 13  ``Saturday Night Live'' alumni Chris Farley and David Spade, co-stars of the 1995 semi-hit ``Tommy Boy,'' reteam for this slapstick comedy. Farley plays the slovenly brother of a Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate, while Spade plays a fussy aide charged with keeping him out of the media's reach.  Casino R  The ``GoodFellas'' duo _ director Martin Scorsese and writer Nicholas Pileggi _ roll the dice a second time and come up craps. Robert De Niro plays Sam ``Ace'' Rothstein, a professional gambler who operates a Las Vegas casino from behind the scenes; Joe Pesci is a hothead hit man, and both were better in ``GoodFellas.'' Finally there's Ginger (Sharon Stone, who proves once and for all that she can act), a former hooker who becomes Sam's reluctant wife and dives into the bottle. If the movie focused more clearly on these three, ``Casino'' might hold our interest. But the whole thing feels like a retread. _ Steve Murray  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960131.0209 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(2ndtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Copycat R  A cat-and-mouse thriller that'll have you on the edge of your seat from the opening scene until the closing credits. Holly Hunter is a San Francisco cop on the trail of a killer. She enlists the help of psychiatrist/author Sigourney Weaver, an expert on serial killers. Smartly directed by Jon Amiel, with fine supporting turns by Dermot Mulroney and Harry Connick Jr., the movie reminds us that _ to invert the Police song ``Murder By Numbers'' _ murder doesn't have to be an art, but it can be the basis for one heck of a suspense movie. Rated R for language, violence and nudity.  Cutthroat Island PG-13  The audience walks the plank in this clumsy new pirate movie. Directed by husband Renny Harlin (``Cliffhanger''), Geena Davis plays 17th-century swashbucklette Morgan, who races evil uncle Dawg (Frank Langella) for buried treasure on the titular island. She's aided by a scalawag named Shaw (Matthew Modine), and it's a draw as to who's more out of depth, Modine or Davis. They're like a suburban couple playing dress up, yammering lame lines. The fault goes equally to Harlin, who continues the chaos-over-coherence style of filmmaking he began with ``Die Hard 2.'' People yell and run around. Things explode, a lot. If anybody thought ``Cutthroat Island'' would usher in a new wave of pirate movies, don't count on it. This baby doesn't have sea legs. Rated PG-13 for action and brief sensuality. _ Steve Murray  Dangerous Minds R  Michelle Pfeiffer gets an A for effort in her role as a former Marine trying to teach poetry to some hardened inner-city kids, but everyone else _ from the cliched teen cast to director John N. Smith and writer Ronald Bass _ flunks out. Rated R for language and adult themes.  Dead Man Walking R  In Tim Robbins' deadly earnest, intermittently powerful death-row drama, a nun (Susan Sarandon) becomes involved with a convicted murderer (Sean Penn). Both give riveting portrayals (though Penn's arrogant, racist redneck is getting most of the attention). The problem is the movie isn't really about either character. It's about an issue _ the pros and cons of the death penalty _ which means it often lapses into the message-conscious style of a '50s TV drama. Still, Robbins manages a shatteringly effective final half hour simply by showing us how capital punishment works in every gruesome and dehumanizing detail.  Dead Presidents R  A searingly fine sophomore effort by the Hughes brothers (``Menace II Society''). Like an African-Americanized ``The Deer Hunter,'' the movie follows some pals from the Bronx before, during and after their tour of duty in Vietnam. Larenz Tate is the film's indispensable anchor, but he gets fine support from Keith David, N'Bushe Wright and Bokeem Wodbine, among others. The film isn't perfect; by trying to cover so much ground, it skims certain issues, skimps on certain characters. But it's a vital and passionate look at a nation so caught up in the macho-angst of losing a war abroad that it ignored a far more important war at home. Rated R for sex, violence, nudity and language.  Devil in a Blue Dress R  An exercise in retro cool and a richly textured homage to cinematic flatfoots. Denzel Washington plays accidental private eye Easy Rawlins. The year is 1948, and he's approached by a tough (Tom Sizemore) who claims he's working for a mayoral candidate whose fiancee Daphne (Jennifer Beals) has gone missing. But this turns out to be much more than a missing persons case. The interesting part of ``Devil'' isn't its convoluted plot (which gets less interesting as it becomes clearer), but the smaller observations that constantly remind us of Easy's double trouble as a black man in '40s L.A. Rated R for sex, language and violence. _ Steve Murray  Don't Be a Menace  to South Central While Drinking  Your Juice in the Hood R  A vehicle for Shawn and Marlon Wayans, the two youngest members of the comic family that includes brothers Damon and Keenen Ivory. This ``Airplane!''-style parody takes broad, juvenile jabs at such urban ``message'' movies as ``Menace II Society'' and ``Boyz N the Hood.'' If not all the jokes here work, many of the ones that do have extra weight. When two characters are busted for ``being black on a Friday night'' and taken to a police station equipped with a Rodney King punch-and-kick video game, the movie turns from goofy fun to comedy that tickles and stings. _ Doug Hamilton  Dunston Checks In PG  Kids will probably go bananas over this family-friendly monkey movie. ``Seinfeld's'' Jason Alexander stars as a single father who manages a swanky New York hotel. His youngest son discovers that one of the guests, a thief masquerading as a British lord (Rupert Everett), has smuggled in an orangutan. Named Dunston, this hairy partner in crime is trained to break into rooms while his master is hobnobbing at the bar, establishing an alibi. If the movie is a bit derivative, it's solid entertainment, sparked by witty performances by Alexander, Everett and Faye Dunaway, who gives her role as the hotel owner's exacting wife just the right Leona Helmsley spin. Rated PG for language. _ Doug Hamilton  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960131.0210 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(3rdtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Eye for an Eye R  Sally Field stars in this taut, emotionally charged thriller about a mother seeking vengeance on the psychopath who raped and murdered her daughter. But this is more than a distaff ``Death Wish''; it's also an exploration of the toxic aftershocks of violence _ its malignant effect on a person or a family. You can tell the care director John Schlesinger (``Midnight Cowboy'') has put into the film simply by the care he's put into the casting: Ed Harris in what could have been the vanilla role of Field's husband; Joe Mantegna as the homicide detective on the case; and Kiefer Sutherland as the sneering scum who may have tangled with the wrong mom.  Father of the Bride,  Part II PG  Steve Martin's father of the bride becomes a father- to-be and a grandfather-to-be in this dumbed-down diversion that's not half as enjoyable as its 1991 predecessor. The funny parts, all of which have been revealed in the trailer (the dual pregnancies of wife Diane Keaton and daughter Kimberly Williams, Martin's midlife crisis, the return of Martin Short's egregiously effeminate party planner), just aren't that funny. However, the schmaltzy parts, near the end, work like a charm. My advice: Go with someone who is pregnant and enjoy her enjoyment. Somehow, even the dumbest pregnancy cliches seem appealing in your second trimester. Rated PG for mild adult themes and language.  From Dusk Till Dawn R  Robert Rodriguez's hyperviolent vampire flick stars scripter Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney (in a dynamic big-screen crossover) as killer bank robbers who take hostage a retired minister (Harvey Keitel) and his kids (including Juliette Lewis). Bad luck for them, these anti-heroes stop at a Mexican bar _ catering to bikers and bloodsuckers. The long opening setup is vintage Tarantino, full of bloody shocks and sick humor. But once the saloon's staff morph into vampires, ``Dusk'' heads into Sam Raimi's ``Evil Dead'' territory, complete with spewing eyeballs and severed limbs. It's an excuse for a couple of way-talented filmmakers to have gruesome fun. And for most of the time, we do, too. But the squeamish, beware. Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity. _ Steve Murray  Georgia R  A daring downer of a film about two sisters. One sings; the other doesn't. But that doesn't mean that she doesn't want to sing, with every desperate, self-destructive nerve in her drug-addled body. Mare Winningham is the title character, a centered superstar with a golden voice; Jennifer Jason Leigh is her sister, Sadie. Sort of Sid Vicious' psychic twin, she burns with neediness and ambition. Ulu Grosbard directed from a script by Barbara Turner. The strong supporting cast includes John Doe (of X) and Ted Levine. A movie for people who take their movies seriously.  Get Shorty R  Barry Sonnenfeld's lively adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel follows the exploits of a Miami loan shark named Chili Palmer (John Travolta) who finds out that show biz isn't all that different from shylocking when he goes to pick up a debt from a B-movie producer (Gene Hackman). Anchoring the most complicated plot since ``The Usual Suspects,'' the charming Travolta proves he's no ``Pulp Fiction'' flash in the pan. _ Steve Murray  GoldenEye PG-13  Reality never intrudes on the babes and bombs, gags and gadg ets in this guilty pleasure introducing Pierce Brosnan as the new 007. Despite some P.C. lip service, it's the old things that work best, including villains left over from the Cold War (Sean Bean as a disgruntled Cossack, Famke Janssen as masochistic femme fatale Xenia Onatopp). Pitched between the no-nonsense Timothy Dalton and the inimitably courtly Sean Connery, Brosnan deserves a few more spins in the Aston-Martin. _ Steve Murray  Grumpier Old Men PG-13  They aren't really any grumpier. But stars Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are richer, thanks to the first film's success. Most of the original team is back, including Ann-Margret as Lemmon's sex-kitten wife and Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's drinking, smoking, oversexed dad. The main newcomer is Sophia Loren as the bombshell Maria who sets the men's pacemakers ticking. As far as retreads go, ``Grumpier'' is faithful to the first one's mix of slapstick, senior-level smut and schmaltz. But if the first film was Lemmon's movie, this one is Matthau's. There's a lovely sweetness in his courtship with Loren; he has the puppyish bafflement of a fellow in love for the very first time. He makes even wine in a box seem romantic. But after an hour, the movie runs out of its already meager steam. Whether you want to meander along with it depends on how you respond to Lemmon's and Matthau's patented slow burns. _ Steve Murray  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960131.0211 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(4thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Heat R  Looks hot on paper (Al Pacino and Robert De Niro together again for the first time!), but on screen, this incoherent, overlong action flick never sputters above a pseudo-simmer. Pacino is a workaholic L.A. cop obsessed with catching De Niro, a career criminal who masterminds complex heists. The movie lasts almost three hours and the two stars spend around 10 minutes together. Maybe writer/director Michael Mann thought he was creating an existential male menopause movie masquerading as a cops and robbers drama. But watching two great actors run, jump and shoot their way through roles they would have laughed at in their Young Turk days is ultimately kind of painful. Rated R for violence, language and brief sex.  It Takes Two PG  Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen of TV's ``Full House'' (they shared the role of Michelle Tanner) play identical strangers _ one a streetwise New York orphan, the other a billionaire's daughter _ who scheme to switch places and get their single guardians together. Sure, it's ``The Prince and the Pauper'' meets ``The Parent Trap,'' but director Andy Tennant does absolutely the best job one can with borrowed ideas, and the Olsens are _ surprise! _ a delight, far more expressive than on ``Full House'' and very natural in their parts. Rated PG for mild adult themes. _ Doug Hamilton  Jumanji PG  Robin Williams shows us where the wild things are in this effects-laden family fantasy about a mysterious board game that can bring rhinos into your living room or turn a house into a primeval swamp. Director Joe Johnstone (``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'') knows how to thrill an audience with outsized insects or a stampede down Main Street. But the movie goes on a roll of the dice or two too long. And in-between ``plays,'' things get frankly boring. Bottom line: If you've seen the trailer, you've already seen all the best parts. And those ``best parts'' may be a little scary for littler kids. Johnston does nothing to up the ante; it's like playing Candyland instead of Monopoly. Rated PG for violence.  The Juror R  Demi Moore stars as a single mother picked as a juror in the trial of a notorious mobster. Alec Baldwin co-stars as a mob fixer who tries to influence Moore's verdict. If the story sounds familiar, it's because the 1994 thriller ``Trial by Jury,'' starring Joanne Whalley-Kilmer, had exactly the same plot.  Lawnmower Man 2 PG-13  A frenetic, clueless sequel to the 1992 sci-fi flick, it stars Matt Frewer as Jobe, a techno-god of virtual reality. Hooked up to cyberspace via headset, he's building a new ramp on the information superhighway that will give him access to every bit of information (credit card numbers, top-secret data, etc.) in the world. That is, unless a reclusive scientist (Patrick Bergin) can stop him. Not a lick of it makes sense, starting with the futuristic L.A. setting. The characters spend their time spouting cyber-jumbo, tapping computer keyboards and competing with highly cheesy computer FX. Frewer (``Max Headroom'') probably won't be making new fans with this performance _ a weird hybrid of ``Hellraiser's'' Pinhead and Jim Carrey Lite. Unplug, unplug. _ Steve Murray  Leaving Las Vegas R  ``Viva Las Vegas'' on two dozen downers and a case of Jack Black. Nicolas Cage is an alcoholic Hollywood screenwriter who pockets his severance check and heads to Vegas to drink himself to death. Elisabeth Shue is a Vegas hooker who gets hooked on his devil-may-care despair. The movie is a bit of a drunk itself _ given to self-indulgent poses and poetic pretentiousness. But Cage and Shue are willing _ and able _ to do director Mike Figgis' dirty work for him. Their terrific performances leave you feeling unclean and sober. Rated R for sex, language, nudity and drug abuse.  Mr. Holland's Opus PG  The corn is as high as an elephant's eye in this unabashedly sentimental melodrama. And guess what? The cornier it gets, the better the picture works. Richard Dreyfuss stars as a would-be composer who devotes 30 years of his life to teaching high school music students. Director Stephen Herek has shaped the film into easily absorbed TV-size chunks that are given focus and humor thanks to a solid cast and Dreyfuss' energized, razor-sharp performance. Goodbye, Mr. Chips; hello, Mr. Holland. Rated PG for mild language.  Money Train R  Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson attempt to work the same buddy magic that made their 1992 basketball comedy, ``White Men Can't Jump,'' such a hit. Here, their interplay is again easy and amusing, but the movie around them is a cliched jumble. The two play New York subway cops who also are foster brothers. Snipes is the responsible one; Harrelson's the habitual gambler with the Mom-always-liked-you- best chip on his shoulder. When Harrelson's fortunes take a downward turn (due to a laughable series of plot contrivances), he decides to reverse his loser status by robbing the subway's revenue train. Rated R for violence, language and nudity. _ Doug Hamilton  Nixon R  Oliver Stone's compassionate, intricate, hugely ambitious character study of the only man in history to resign the presidency. The movie follows Nixon (Anthony Hopkins) from his dirt- poor childhood to his dirty-politics downfall with Watergate. A vast, talented cast, headed by Joan Allen as Pat Nixon and Paul Sorvino as Kissinger, flesh out all the president's men (and women). Even at three-hours-plus, the movie is never less than fascinating and, at heart, it's one of the saddest stories you'll ever hear. The one about the man who got everything he wanted . . . and then it got him back. Rated R for language and adult themes.  Now and Then PG-13  This sticky-sweet female ``Stand by Me'' begins and ends with brief scenes of four friends _ played by Demi Moore, Rosie O'Donnell, Melanie Griffith and Rita Wilson _ reuniting as one of them prepares to give birth. In the middle, we get an extended flashback of the four as girls in the summer of 1970. Director Lesli Linka Glatter establishes a wistful, knowing tone here, and Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffman as the preteen O'Donnell and Moore give delightful performances. Too bad screenwriter I. Marlene King has loaded this nostalgia trip down with cliches and mawkish dialogue. Rated PG-13 for adolescent sex discussions. _ Doug Hamilton  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960131.0212 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(5thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Once Upon a Time . . . When We Were Colored PG  Tim Reid directs a talented cast (headed by Al Freeman Jr. and Phylicia Rashad) in a tender, evocative film set in the postwar segregated South. Based on Clifton Taulbart's coming-of-age memoir, the movie spans three decades, celebrating the triumph of the spirit of a generation of African-Americans _ the generation after slavery and before lunch-counter sit- ins _ who never got a break coming or going. An honorable, heartfelt picture that implores us to never forget our country's past so that we may be better prepared to shape its future.  Othello R  Though handsomely shot and cleanly spoken, the new film of ``Othello'' is more like ``The Iago Show.'' Kenneth Branagh plays the fellow, who connives to convince his employer, the noble Othello (a strong but distant Laurence Fishburne), that his new wife, Desdemona (Irene Jacob), is unfaithful. In a plot fueled by Iago's machinations, Othello already runs the risk of being upstaged. In director Oliver Parker's piecemeal adaptation, this imbalance is emphasized, with the terrific Branagh delivering his juicy monologues directly to the camera. Parker rigs the tale for a '90s audience with several wordless bedroom scenes (thus the R rating). But for all the heavy breathing and MTV-speed cuts, this ``Othello'' loses steam the closer it gets to its denouement. The finale feels merely unfortunate, not devastating. And that's a real tragedy. _ Steve Murray  Persuasion PG  An awesome Jane Austen adaptation, courtesy of director Roger Michell, writer Nick Dear and a splendid cast. Set in the early 19th century, the movie is both a superbly nuanced social comedy and a yearningly openhearted romantic drama. At the ripe old age of 27, Anne Elliott (Amanda Root) is facing _ gasp _ spinsterhood. Then the man she wrongly rejected years ago (a family friend insisted he lacked family and finances) comes back into her life. But can true romance overcome the idiot clutter of society's expectations and repressed emotions? Gloriously romantic yet giddily hilarious, this movie gives you a ruefully knowing smile as it sides with the wise heart. You leave the theater feeling better about everything. Rated PG for mild adult themes.  The Postman NR  Set in the early '50s, this bittersweet tale of the unlikely friendship between the world-famous poet Pablo Neruda and Mario, an unworldly fisherman's son, is a deceptively simple film that sneaks up on you. English director Michael Radford (``White Mischief'') brings an outsider's intrigued eye to his Italian setting. But his ultimate focus is on the collision of poet and peasant and how each affects the other.  Powder PG-13  A synthetic fable. Sean Patrick Flanery plays Powder, a brilliant albino what's-it found in a basement. Taken in by the local orphanage, he runs into the predictable: tough older boys, giggling schoolgirls, angry parents. Trudging toward the inevitable plot points (Powder teaches that hunting isn't nice, that big boys shouldn't pick on smaller ones), the movie wastes Mary Steenburgen as the orphanage's concerned director. Flanery plays Powder with a sparrowlike gentleness, but he's playing a concept, not a character; Powder's talents are hopelessly vague, a mix of megawatts and telekinesis. And director Victor Salva is so busy being ``sensitive,'' he saps any life out of the premise. _ Steve Murray  Restoration R  Robert Downey Jr. leads a cast of notables, including Hugh Grant, Sam Neill and Meg Ryan, in this lavish costume drama set in 17th-century England. Downey plays a randy physician who gets a rather bizarre proposal from King Charles II (Neill).  Richard III R  There's talk of an Oscar nomination for Sir Ian McKellen's performance in this daring adaptation of Shakespeare's play. The acclaimed British actor plays the title role, one of the bard's most ruthless creations, but as a fascist dictator in 1930s Europe.  Sabrina PG  The difference between the original ``Sabrina,'' a minor Billy Wilder film meant as a shameless showcase for Audrey Hepburn, and Sydney Pollack's remake isn't a matter of Hepburn vs. her replacement, Julia Ormond. It's a matter of Hepburn vs. Harrison Ford. He takes the Humphrey Bogart role of a sour tycoon who steps in when the chauffeur's daughter (Ormond) threatens to distract his easily distracted younger brother (a funny Greg Kinnear) from his impending marriage/ corporate merger. The first film was about Hepburn's transformation; this one is about Ford's. It gives it a more serious tone, but it also makes it more satisfying.  Screamers R  ``Howlers'' is more like it. Set on a remote mining planet in 2078, the sci-fi would-be-thriller pits human residents (including Peter Weller and Jennifer Rubin) against killer, saw- armed robots named Screamers; they burrow underground, kill anything that moves, and have learned how to reproduce. It's a cool idea. But the movie is mired in cliches and swipes from better movies (``Tremors,'' ``Aliens,'' ``The Thing,'' etc.). The movie's truly unique moments are memorable for their stupidity. You know you're in trouble when the moments meant to provoke gasps get giggles instead. _ Steve Murray  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960131.0213 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(6thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Sense and Sensibility PG  This dazzling Jane Austen adaptation is one of the year's best and a sure-fire Oscar contender. Emma Thompson (who wrote the script) and Kate Winslet (``Heavenly Creatures'') co-star as penniless sisters trying to make their way among the sensible and the senseless in late 18th-century England. Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant and Greg Wise are suitors (of varying and changeable degrees of suitability). The unlikely director is Ang Lee (``Eat Drink Man Woman''), who has delivered a gorgeous film brimming with humor, romance and intelligence _ one that, on its own terms, is as fraught with peril and incident as a Spielberg thrill-flick. Score one for the good guys (and good gals.) And get your Oscar score card ready. Rated PG for mild adult themes.  Seven R  The creative serial killer in this self-conscious gibberish models his gruesome murders after each of the seven deadly sins. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are the cops out to stop him, but there's not much they can do to rescue this one- gimmick movie from quickly wearing out its one gimmick. Rated R for violence and language.  To Die For R  Nicole Kidman gives a breakthrough performance as a psychopathic Jane Pauley wannabe in this wickedly hilarious look at TV-spawned celebrity obsession. Gus Van Sant's direction is pitch perfect, as are his actors, led by Matt Dillon as Kidman's lunkhead hubby and Wayne Knight as the manager of the cable TV station where she's employed as an, um, weatherperson. The movie isn't profound, but it catches, with uncanny accuracy, a startling moment in our nation's Geraldo-ized psyche. Like some '90s Norma Desmond, Kidman's ready for her close-up, Mr. Bochco. Rated R for sex and language.  To Wong Foo,  Thanks for Everything!  Julie Newmar PG-13  Perhaps the most shocking thing about this drag-queen comedy is how very unshocking it is. When their car breaks down en route to Hollywood, a trio of Manhattan transvestites _ twinkly, maternal Vida (Patrick Swayze), sassy, smart-mouthed Noxema (Wesley Snipes), and hot-to-trot Chi Chi (John Leguizama) _ give a mega-make-over to residents of a drab town. This whole movie could use a make-over.  Tom and Huck G  A straightforward, well-played adaptation of Mark Twain's classic ``The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.'' Director Peter Hewitt doesn't do much to capture Twain's tone, but he wisely stays out of the way of the story. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is initially too TV-cute as Tom, and Brad Renfro's Huck has been sanitized into a 19th-century homeless boy who just needs to be loved. But they both grow on you. One nice touch: This film's Becky Thatcher is a full head taller than Tom.  Toy Story G  A knockout. The first feature to be fully computer-generated, the all-ages comedy taps our childhood fantasies about the lives toys lead when the bedroom door closes. And it injects grown-up humor by making these Mr. Potato Heads and Slinky Dogs as psychologically diverse as any human. As neurotic as they are nice, the toys fret about their young owner Andy's birthday party, worried about getting edged out by a super-duper new toy. Longtime fave cowboy Woody (voice by Tom Hanks) gets upstaged by newcomer Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), a gleaming plastic hero. In this mock epic, Woody and Buzz go out into the ``real world,'' where they scamper beneath 18-wheelers, flee a toothy canine and survive the sadistic antics of the kid next door. Four years in the making, the film is a jaw-dropping spectacle, with one bravura sequence topping the one before. Give it five minutes, and this laugh-out-loud delight can turn the scroogiest Scrooge into a happy kid. _ Steve Murray  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960131.0214 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(7thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  12 Monkeys R  Terry Gilliam's despair-laced fantasy gets under your skin _ even when you don't exactly know what's going on. Bruce Willis stars as Cole, who claims to be a time traveler from the year 2035. He's sent back to 1996 to discover the cause of a plague that has wiped out 5 billion people. Is he really from the future, or is he insane _ as one psychiatrist (Madeleine Stowe) thinks? As in Gilliam's other films (``Time Bandits,'' ``The Fisher King''), story and emotion come second to visual design and mood, and at times the movie could use a stronger sense of drama and momentum. Still, there's nothing else like it on screen right now. For its strange, spooky visual poetry, ``Monkeys'' is a barrel of glum fun. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  Two If by Sea R  A negligible, slightly amusing caper comedy that proves Sandra Bullock's first-rate charm can prop up second-rate material. She and Denis Leary play a bickering blue-collar couple who've stolen a painting. Arriving at Cape Cod a few days before their scheduled rendezvous with the mysterious buyer, they decide to enjoy the good life and ``house-sit'' a seaside mansion. Leary wrote the script, which includes flashes of his acerbic, off-kilter wit, but mostly the movie doesn't have enough heft, comedic or romantic. A good rentable.  The Usual Suspects R  A crafty crime thriller you'll want to watch twice. Told mainly in flashbacks, it unravels the tale of five crooks (including Kevin Spacey, Stephen Baldwin and Gabriel Byrne) and a messed-up drug deal that left all but one of them dead. But solving this mystery isn't nearly as simple as it looks. Part hard-boiled ``Rashomon,'' part cinematic con game, ``Suspects'' keeps pulling the rug out from under you. It demands (and rewards) close attention. Don't be surprised if you feel like watching it a second time _ not because you're confused, but just to savor the screenplay's twists and red herrings. It's anything but usual. Rated R for language and violence. _ Steve Murray  Vampire in Brooklyn R  An anemic hybrid of laughs and jolts, Wes Craven's movie stars Eddie Murphy as the vampire Maximillian, who comes to New York with an unplaceable accent and a wardrobe somewhere between Vincent Price and Sunset Boulevard pimp. He's seeking Rita (Angela Bassett), a cop who doesn't realize she's got vampire blood in her veins. Mixing gross-out humor, some sex, some violence, the movie never decides whether it's a comedy, a thriller, a romance _ what? Likewise, Murphy (the hero? the villain?) is stranded, posing in his threads like an International Male model. He also plays a couple of minor characters, and his scene as a Sharpton-like preacher who convinces his flock that ``evil is good'' is one of the few moments when the movie comes alive. Otherwise, it's undead all the way. _ Steve Murray  Waiting to Exhale R A breath of fresh air. An gela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon play friends in this glossy, well-acted adaptation of Terry McMillan's best seller. Forest Whitaker, better known for his acting in ``Bird'' and ``The Crying Game,'' provides the expert direction. And as for the reported ``male bashing,'' before you take your man, simply ask yourself, is he man enough to take it? Whitaker is. And he's man enough to dish it out, too. Rated R for sex, language and adult themes.  White Squall R Ridley Scott, director of the sci-fi classics ``Alien'' and ``Blade Runner,'' brings his formidable skills to this story of a training skipper at a boating school for young men.

They move weekly to clients of the New York Times News Service.  G: General audiences. Nothing that would offend parents if viewed by children.  PG: Parental guidance suggested. May contain some material parents consider inappropriate for young children.  PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for preteens.  R: Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking children.  NC-17: No one under 17 admitted. Replaces the X rating.  NR: Not rated.  The American President PG-13  In Rob Reiner's tangy romantic comedy, Michael Douglas plays widowed President Andrew Shepherd, who woos environmental lobbyist Sydney Wade (Annette Bening). Unfortunately, election year is looming. And Senator Rumson (Richard Dreyfuss) grabs their romance as fodder for his own mudslinging campaign. Regaining his magic touch, Reiner keeps his film balanced between its smarter agenda and its Hollywood fairy-tale touches. Rated PG-13 for language. _ Steve Murray  Babe G  Pig out on this delightfully screwball movie about a piglet who thinks he's a sheepdog. Real-life animals carry the bulk of the story, but they get some high-tech help from computer graphics and superbly lifelike animatronic stand-ins created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Voice talent Christine Cavanaugh as Babe and Miriam Margolyes (``The Age of Innocence'') as Fly, Babe's adopted border collie mom.  Balto G  A beautifully executed , edge- of-your-seat exciting animated adventure. The full-mush story is based on the true-life journey of a heroic sled dog named Balto who brought the anti- diphtheria serum to Nome, Alaska, in 1925, thus saving the lives of hundreds of children. A tale of perseverance, courage, tolerance and puppy love, the movie's all-star cast of voices includes Kevin Bacon, Bridget Fonda, Bob Hoskins and Phil Collins.  Bed of Roses PG  A small hooray to Christian Slater and Mary Stuart Masterson for lending their star power to this slight modern romance about a career woman who needs to stop and smell the (bed of) roses and the Prince Charming who wants to show her how. Unfortunately, writer- director Michael Goldenberg sets up his two attracted opposites and then really doesn't know what to do with them. We're left with a sweet nothing of a movie that promises more than it delivers.  The Big Green PG  Bad title. Cute movie. The Mighty Ducks _ or the Bad News Bears, depending on your generation _ play soccer. A pert British teacher (Olivia d'Abo) comes to a tired-out Texas town and turns things around by introducing her students to soccer. Yes, it's as formulaic as you might expect, but funny thing about formulas _ sometimes they work. And about the uninviting title, it refers to the town's overgrown football field that gets a second life as a soccer field. Think: between the hedges meets the World Cup. Rated PG for language.  Bio-Dome PG-13  Dumb Pauly Shore and dumber Stephen Baldwin get locked inside the environmentally controlled bio-dome, with the scientists committed to living there a year. This movie wants to be a ``Dumb and Dumbest,'' but it's really ``Dull and Dullest.'' See the dudes wreck the rain forest! Watch them swing on vines! Dumb can be fun, but Shore and Baldwin aren't Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. Most of the humor consists of watching Shore crack himself up with his own Valley garble. It's good to know he's having a great time. Steve Murray  Black Sheep PG- 13  ``Saturday Night Live'' alumni Chris Farley and David Spade, co-stars of the 1995 semi-hit ``Tommy Boy,'' reteam for this slapstick comedy. Farley plays the slovenly brother of a Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate, while Spade plays a fussy aide charged with keeping him out of the media's reach.  Casino R  The ``GoodFellas'' duo _ director Martin Scorsese and writer Nicholas Pileggi _ roll the dice a second time and come up craps. Robert De Niro plays Sam ``Ace'' Rothstein, a professional gambler who operates a Las Vegas casino from behind the scenes; Joe Pesci is a hothead hit man, and both were better in ``GoodFellas.'' Finally there's Ginger (Sharon Stone, who proves once and for all that she can act), a former hooker who becomes Sam's reluctant wife and dives into the bottle. If the movie focused more clearly on these three, ``Casino'' might hold our interest. But the whole thing feels like a retread. _ Steve Murray  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960207.0154 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(2ndtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Copycat R  A cat-and-mouse thriller that'll have you on the edge of your seat from the opening scene until the closing credits. Holly Hunter is a San Francisco cop on the trail of a killer. She enlists the help of psychiatrist/author Sigourney Weaver, an expert on serial killers. Smartly directed by Jon Amiel, with fine supporting turns by Dermot Mulroney and Harry Connick Jr., the movie reminds us that _ to invert the Police song ``Murder By Numbers'' _ murder doesn't have to be an art, but it can be the basis for one heck of a suspense movie. Rated R for language, violence and nudity.  Cutthroat Island PG-13  The audience walks the plank in this clumsy new pirate movie. Directed by husband Renny Harlin (``Cliffhanger''), Geena Davis plays 17th-century swashbucklette Morgan, who races evil uncle Dawg (Frank Langella) for buried treasure on the titular island. She's aided by a scalawag named Shaw (Matthew Modine), and it's a draw as to who's more out of depth, Modine or Davis. They're like a suburban couple playing dress up, yammering lame lines. The fault goes equally to Harlin, who continues the chaos-over-coherence style of filmmaking he began with ``Die Hard 2.'' People yell and run around. Things explode, a lot. If anybody thought ``Cutthroat Island'' would usher in a new wave of pirate movies, don't count on it. This baby doesn't have sea legs. Rated PG-13 for action and brief sensuality. _ Steve Murray  Dangerous Minds R  Michelle Pfeiffer gets an A for effort in her role as a former Marine trying to teach poetry to some hardened inner-city kids, but everyone else _ from the cliched teen cast to director John N. Smith and writer Ronald Bass _ flunks out. Rated R for language and adult themes.  Dead Man Walking R  In Tim Robbins' deadly earnest, intermittently powerful death-row drama, a nun (Susan Sarandon) becomes involved with a convicted murderer (Sean Penn). Both give riveting portrayals (though Penn's arrogant, racist redneck is getting most of the attention). The problem is the movie isn't really about either character. It's about an issue _ the pros and cons of the death penalty _ which means it often lapses into the message-conscious style of a '50s TV drama. Still, Robbins manages a shatteringly effective final half hour simply by showing us how capital punishment works in every gruesome and dehumanizing detail.  Dead Presidents R  A searingly fine sophomore effort by the Hughes brothers (``Menace II Society''). Like an African-Americanized ``The Deer Hunter,'' the movie follows some pals from the Bronx before, during and after their tour of duty in Vietnam. Larenz Tate is the film's indispensable anchor, but he gets fine support from Keith David, N'Bushe Wright and Bokeem Wodbine, among others. The film isn't perfect; by trying to cover so much ground, it skims certain issues, skimps on certain characters. But it's a vital and passionate look at a nation so caught up in the macho-angst of losing a war abroad that it ignored a far more important war at home. Rated R for sex, violence, nudity and language.  Devil in a Blue Dress R  An exercise in retro cool and a richly textured homage to cinematic flatfoots. Denzel Washington plays accidental private eye Easy Rawlins. The year is 1948, and he's approached by a tough (Tom Sizemore) who claims he's working for a mayoral candidate whose fiancee Daphne (Jennifer Beals) has gone missing. But this turns out to be much more than a missing persons case. The interesting part of ``Devil'' isn't its convoluted plot (which gets less interesting as it becomes clearer), but the smaller observations that constantly remind us of Easy's double trouble as a black man in '40s L.A. Rated R for sex, language and violence. _ Steve Murray  Don't Be a Menace  to South Central While Drinking  Your Juice in the Hood R  A vehicle for Shawn and Marlon Wayans, the two youngest members of the comic family that includes brothers Damon and Keenen Ivory. This ``Airplane!''-style parody takes broad, juvenile jabs at such urban ``message'' movies as ``Menace II Society'' and ``Boyz N the Hood.'' If not all the jokes here work, many of the ones that do have extra weight. When two characters are busted for ``being black on a Friday night'' and taken to a police station equipped with a Rodney King punch-and-kick video game, the movie turns from goofy fun to comedy that tickles and stings. _ Doug Hamilton  Dunston Checks In PG  Kids will probably go bananas over this family-friendly monkey movie. ``Seinfeld's'' Jason Alexander stars as a single father who manages a swanky New York hotel. His youngest son discovers that one of the guests, a thief masquerading as a British lord (Rupert Everett), has smuggled in an orangutan. Named Dunston, this hairy partner in crime is trained to break into rooms while his master is hobnobbing at the bar, establishing an alibi. If the movie is a bit derivative, it's solid entertainment, sparked by witty performances by Alexander, Everett and Faye Dunaway, who gives her role as the hotel owner's exacting wife just the right Leona Helmsley spin. Rated PG for language. _ Doug Hamilton  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960207.0155 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(3rdtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Eye for an Eye R  Sally Field stars in this taut, emotionally charged thriller about a mother seeking vengeance on the psychopath who raped and murdered her daughter. But this is more than a distaff ``Death Wish''; it's also an exploration of the toxic aftershocks of violence _ its malignant effect on a person or a family. You can tell the care director John Schlesinger (``Midnight Cowboy'') has put into the film simply by the care he's put into the casting: Ed Harris in what could have been the vanilla role of Field's husband; Joe Mantegna as the homicide detective on the case; and Kiefer Sutherland as the sneering scum who may have tangled with the wrong mom.  Father of the Bride,  Part II PG  Steve Martin's father of the bride becomes a father- to-be and a grandfather-to-be in this dumbed-down diversion that's not half as enjoyable as its 1991 predecessor. The funny parts, all of which have been revealed in the trailer (the dual pregnancies of wife Diane Keaton and daughter Kimberly Williams, Martin's midlife crisis, the return of Martin Short's egregiously effeminate party planner), just aren't that funny. However, the schmaltzy parts, near the end, work like a charm. My advice: Go with someone who is pregnant and enjoy her enjoyment. Somehow, even the dumbest pregnancy cliches seem appealing in your second trimester. Rated PG for mild adult themes and language.  From Dusk Till Dawn R  Robert Rodriguez's hyperviolent vampire flick stars scripter Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney (in a dynamic big-screen crossover) as killer bank robbers who take hostage a retired minister (Harvey Keitel) and his kids (including Juliette Lewis). Bad luck for them, these anti-heroes stop at a Mexican bar _ catering to bikers and bloodsuckers. The long opening setup is vintage Tarantino, full of bloody shocks and sick humor. But once the saloon's staff morph into vampires, ``Dusk'' heads into Sam Raimi's ``Evil Dead'' territory, complete with spewing eyeballs and severed limbs. It's an excuse for a couple of way-talented filmmakers to have gruesome fun. And for most of the time, we do, too. But the squeamish, beware. Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity. _ Steve Murray  Georgia R  A daring downer of a film about two sisters. One sings; the other doesn't. But that doesn't mean that she doesn't want to sing, with every desperate, self-destructive nerve in her drug-addled body. Mare Winningham is the title character, a centered superstar with a golden voice; Jennifer Jason Leigh is her sister, Sadie. Sort of Sid Vicious' psychic twin, she burns with neediness and ambition. Ulu Grosbard directed from a script by Barbara Turner. The strong supporting cast includes John Doe (of X) and Ted Levine. A movie for people who take their movies seriously.  Get Shorty R  Barry Sonnenfeld's lively adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel follows the exploits of a Miami loan shark named Chili Palmer (John Travolta) who finds out that show biz isn't all that different from shylocking when he goes to pick up a debt from a B-movie producer (Gene Hackman). Anchoring the most complicated plot since ``The Usual Suspects,'' the charming Travolta proves he's no ``Pulp Fiction'' flash in the pan. _ Steve Murray  GoldenEye PG-13  Reality never intrudes on the babes and bombs, gags and gadg ets in this guilty pleasure introducing Pierce Brosnan as the new 007. Despite some P.C. lip service, it's the old things that work best, including villains left over from the Cold War (Sean Bean as a disgruntled Cossack, Famke Janssen as masochistic femme fatale Xenia Onatopp). Pitched between the no-nonsense Timothy Dalton and the inimitably courtly Sean Connery, Brosnan deserves a few more spins in the Aston-Martin. _ Steve Murray  Grumpier Old Men PG-13  They aren't really any grumpier. But stars Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are richer, thanks to the first film's success. Most of the original team is back, including Ann-Margret as Lemmon's sex-kitten wife and Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's drinking, smoking, oversexed dad. The main newcomer is Sophia Loren as the bombshell Maria who sets the men's pacemakers ticking. As far as retreads go, ``Grumpier'' is faithful to the first one's mix of slapstick, senior-level smut and schmaltz. But if the first film was Lemmon's movie, this one is Matthau's. There's a lovely sweetness in his courtship with Loren; he has the puppyish bafflement of a fellow in love for the very first time. He makes even wine in a box seem romantic. But after an hour, the movie runs out of its already meager steam. Whether you want to meander along with it depends on how you respond to Lemmon's and Matthau's patented slow burns. _ Steve Murray  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960207.0156 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(4thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Heat R  Looks hot on paper (Al Pacino and Robert De Niro together again for the first time!), but on screen, this incoherent, overlong action flick never sputters above a pseudo-simmer. Pacino is a workaholic L.A. cop obsessed with catching De Niro, a career criminal who masterminds complex heists. The movie lasts almost three hours and the two stars spend around 10 minutes together. Maybe writer/director Michael Mann thought he was creating an existential male menopause movie masquerading as a cops and robbers drama. But watching two great actors run, jump and shoot their way through roles they would have laughed at in their Young Turk days is ultimately kind of painful. Rated R for violence, language and brief sex.  It Takes Two PG  Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen of TV's ``Full House'' (they shared the role of Michelle Tanner) play identical strangers _ one a streetwise New York orphan, the other a billionaire's daughter _ who scheme to switch places and get their single guardians together. Sure, it's ``The Prince and the Pauper'' meets ``The Parent Trap,'' but director Andy Tennant does absolutely the best job one can with borrowed ideas, and the Olsens are _ surprise! _ a delight, far more expressive than on ``Full House'' and very natural in their parts. Rated PG for mild adult themes. _ Doug Hamilton  Jumanji PG  Robin Williams shows us where the wild things are in this effects-laden family fantasy about a mysterious board game that can bring rhinos into your living room or turn a house into a primeval swamp. Director Joe Johnstone (``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'') knows how to thrill an audience with outsized insects or a stampede down Main Street. But the movie goes on a roll of the dice or two too long. And in-between ``plays,'' things get frankly boring. Bottom line: If you've seen the trailer, you've already seen all the best parts. And those ``best parts'' may be a little scary for littler kids. Johnston does nothing to up the ante; it's like playing Candyland instead of Monopoly. Rated PG for violence.  The Juror R  Demi Moore stars as a single mother picked as a juror in the trial of a notorious mobster. Alec Baldwin co-stars as a mob fixer who tries to influence Moore's verdict. If the story sounds familiar, it's because the 1994 thriller ``Trial by Jury,'' starring Joanne Whalley-Kilmer, had exactly the same plot.  Lawnmower Man 2 PG-13  A frenetic, clueless sequel to the 1992 sci-fi flick, it stars Matt Frewer as Jobe, a techno-god of virtual reality. Hooked up to cyberspace via headset, he's building a new ramp on the information superhighway that will give him access to every bit of information (credit card numbers, top-secret data, etc.) in the world. That is, unless a reclusive scientist (Patrick Bergin) can stop him. Not a lick of it makes sense, starting with the futuristic L.A. setting. The characters spend their time spouting cyber-jumbo, tapping computer keyboards and competing with highly cheesy computer FX. Frewer (``Max Headroom'') probably won't be making new fans with this performance _ a weird hybrid of ``Hellraiser's'' Pinhead and Jim Carrey Lite. Unplug, unplug. _ Steve Murray  Leaving Las Vegas R  ``Viva Las Vegas'' on two dozen downers and a case of Jack Black. Nicolas Cage is an alcoholic Hollywood screenwriter who pockets his severance check and heads to Vegas to drink himself to death. Elisabeth Shue is a Vegas hooker who gets hooked on his devil-may-care despair. The movie is a bit of a drunk itself _ given to self-indulgent poses and poetic pretentiousness. But Cage and Shue are willing _ and able _ to do director Mike Figgis' dirty work for him. Their terrific performances leave you feeling unclean and sober. Rated R for sex, language, nudity and drug abuse.  Mr. Holland's Opus PG  The corn is as high as an elephant's eye in this unabashedly sentimental melodrama. And guess what? The cornier it gets, the better the picture works. Richard Dreyfuss stars as a would-be composer who devotes 30 years of his life to teaching high school music students. Director Stephen Herek has shaped the film into easily absorbed TV-size chunks that are given focus and humor thanks to a solid cast and Dreyfuss' energized, razor-sharp performance. Goodbye, Mr. Chips; hello, Mr. Holland. Rated PG for mild language.  Money Train R  Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson attempt to work the same buddy magic that made their 1992 basketball comedy, ``White Men Can't Jump,'' such a hit. Here, their interplay is again easy and amusing, but the movie around them is a cliched jumble. The two play New York subway cops who also are foster brothers. Snipes is the responsible one; Harrelson's the habitual gambler with the Mom-always-liked-you- best chip on his shoulder. When Harrelson's fortunes take a downward turn (due to a laughable series of plot contrivances), he decides to reverse his loser status by robbing the subway's revenue train. Rated R for violence, language and nudity. _ Doug Hamilton  Nixon R  Oliver Stone's compassionate, intricate, hugely ambitious character study of the only man in history to resign the presidency. The movie follows Nixon (Anthony Hopkins) from his dirt- poor childhood to his dirty-politics downfall with Watergate. A vast, talented cast, headed by Joan Allen as Pat Nixon and Paul Sorvino as Kissinger, flesh out all the president's men (and women). Even at three-hours-plus, the movie is never less than fascinating and, at heart, it's one of the saddest stories you'll ever hear. The one about the man who got everything he wanted . . . and then it got him back. Rated R for language and adult themes.  Now and Then PG-13  This sticky-sweet female ``Stand by Me'' begins and ends with brief scenes of four friends _ played by Demi Moore, Rosie O'Donnell, Melanie Griffith and Rita Wilson _ reuniting as one of them prepares to give birth. In the middle, we get an extended flashback of the four as girls in the summer of 1970. Director Lesli Linka Glatter establishes a wistful, knowing tone here, and Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffman as the preteen O'Donnell and Moore give delightful performances. Too bad screenwriter I. Marlene King has loaded this nostalgia trip down with cliches and mawkish dialogue. Rated PG-13 for adolescent sex discussions. _ Doug Hamilton  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960207.0157 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(5thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Once Upon a Time . . . When We Were Colored PG  Tim Reid directs a talented cast (headed by Al Freeman Jr. and Phylicia Rashad) in a tender, evocative film set in the postwar segregated South. Based on Clifton Taulbart's coming-of-age memoir, the movie spans three decades, celebrating the triumph of the spirit of a generation of African-Americans _ the generation after slavery and before lunch-counter sit- ins _ who never got a break coming or going. An honorable, heartfelt picture that implores us to never forget our country's past so that we may be better prepared to shape its future.  Othello R  Though handsomely shot and cleanly spoken, the new film of ``Othello'' is more like ``The Iago Show.'' Kenneth Branagh plays the fellow, who connives to convince his employer, the noble Othello (a strong but distant Laurence Fishburne), that his new wife, Desdemona (Irene Jacob), is unfaithful. In a plot fueled by Iago's machinations, Othello already runs the risk of being upstaged. In director Oliver Parker's piecemeal adaptation, this imbalance is emphasized, with the terrific Branagh delivering his juicy monologues directly to the camera. Parker rigs the tale for a '90s audience with several wordless bedroom scenes (thus the R rating). But for all the heavy breathing and MTV-speed cuts, this ``Othello'' loses steam the closer it gets to its denouement. The finale feels merely unfortunate, not devastating. And that's a real tragedy. _ Steve Murray  Persuasion PG  An awesome Jane Austen adaptation, courtesy of director Roger Michell, writer Nick Dear and a splendid cast. Set in the early 19th century, the movie is both a superbly nuanced social comedy and a yearningly openhearted romantic drama. At the ripe old age of 27, Anne Elliott (Amanda Root) is facing _ gasp _ spinsterhood. Then the man she wrongly rejected years ago (a family friend insisted he lacked family and finances) comes back into her life. But can true romance overcome the idiot clutter of society's expectations and repressed emotions? Gloriously romantic yet giddily hilarious, this movie gives you a ruefully knowing smile as it sides with the wise heart. You leave the theater feeling better about everything. Rated PG for mild adult themes.  The Postman NR  Set in the early '50s, this bittersweet tale of the unlikely friendship between the world-famous poet Pablo Neruda and Mario, an unworldly fisherman's son, is a deceptively simple film that sneaks up on you. English director Michael Radford (``White Mischief'') brings an outsider's intrigued eye to his Italian setting. But his ultimate focus is on the collision of poet and peasant and how each affects the other.  Powder PG-13  A synthetic fable. Sean Patrick Flanery plays Powder, a brilliant albino what's-it found in a basement. Taken in by the local orphanage, he runs into the predictable: tough older boys, giggling schoolgirls, angry parents. Trudging toward the inevitable plot points (Powder teaches that hunting isn't nice, that big boys shouldn't pick on smaller ones), the movie wastes Mary Steenburgen as the orphanage's concerned director. Flanery plays Powder with a sparrowlike gentleness, but he's playing a concept, not a character; Powder's talents are hopelessly vague, a mix of megawatts and telekinesis. And director Victor Salva is so busy being ``sensitive,'' he saps any life out of the premise. _ Steve Murray  Restoration R  Robert Downey Jr. leads a cast of notables, including Hugh Grant, Sam Neill and Meg Ryan, in this lavish costume drama set in 17th-century England. Downey plays a randy physician who gets a rather bizarre proposal from King Charles II (Neill).  Richard III R  There's talk of an Oscar nomination for Sir Ian McKellen's performance in this daring adaptation of Shakespeare's play. The acclaimed British actor plays the title role, one of the bard's most ruthless creations, but as a fascist dictator in 1930s Europe.  Sabrina PG  The difference between the original ``Sabrina,'' a minor Billy Wilder film meant as a shameless showcase for Audrey Hepburn, and Sydney Pollack's remake isn't a matter of Hepburn vs. her replacement, Julia Ormond. It's a matter of Hepburn vs. Harrison Ford. He takes the Humphrey Bogart role of a sour tycoon who steps in when the chauffeur's daughter (Ormond) threatens to distract his easily distracted younger brother (a funny Greg Kinnear) from his impending marriage/ corporate merger. The first film was about Hepburn's transformation; this one is about Ford's. It gives it a more serious tone, but it also makes it more satisfying.  Screamers R  ``Howlers'' is more like it. Set on a remote mining planet in 2078, the sci-fi would-be-thriller pits human residents (including Peter Weller and Jennifer Rubin) against killer, saw- armed robots named Screamers; they burrow underground, kill anything that moves, and have learned how to reproduce. It's a cool idea. But the movie is mired in cliches and swipes from better movies (``Tremors,'' ``Aliens,'' ``The Thing,'' etc.). The movie's truly unique moments are memorable for their stupidity. You know you're in trouble when the moments meant to provoke gasps get giggles instead. _ Steve Murray  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960207.0158 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(6thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Sense and Sensibility PG  This dazzling Jane Austen adaptation is one of the year's best and a sure-fire Oscar contender. Emma Thompson (who wrote the script) and Kate Winslet (``Heavenly Creatures'') co-star as penniless sisters trying to make their way among the sensible and the senseless in late 18th-century England. Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant and Greg Wise are suitors (of varying and changeable degrees of suitability). The unlikely director is Ang Lee (``Eat Drink Man Woman''), who has delivered a gorgeous film brimming with humor, romance and intelligence _ one that, on its own terms, is as fraught with peril and incident as a Spielberg thrill-flick. Score one for the good guys (and good gals.) And get your Oscar score card ready. Rated PG for mild adult themes.  Seven R  The creative serial killer in this self-conscious gibberish models his gruesome murders after each of the seven deadly sins. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are the cops out to stop him, but there's not much they can do to rescue this one- gimmick movie from quickly wearing out its one gimmick. Rated R for violence and language.  To Die For R  Nicole Kidman gives a breakthrough performance as a psychopathic Jane Pauley wannabe in this wickedly hilarious look at TV-spawned celebrity obsession. Gus Van Sant's direction is pitch perfect, as are his actors, led by Matt Dillon as Kidman's lunkhead hubby and Wayne Knight as the manager of the cable TV station where she's employed as an, um, weatherperson. The movie isn't profound, but it catches, with uncanny accuracy, a startling moment in our nation's Geraldo-ized psyche. Like some '90s Norma Desmond, Kidman's ready for her close-up, Mr. Bochco. Rated R for sex and language.  To Wong Foo,  Thanks for Everything!  Julie Newmar PG-13  Perhaps the most shocking thing about this drag-queen comedy is how very unshocking it is. When their car breaks down en route to Hollywood, a trio of Manhattan transvestites _ twinkly, maternal Vida (Patrick Swayze), sassy, smart-mouthed Noxema (Wesley Snipes), and hot-to-trot Chi Chi (John Leguizama) _ give a mega-make-over to residents of a drab town. This whole movie could use a make-over.  Tom and Huck G  A straightforward, well-played adaptation of Mark Twain's classic ``The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.'' Director Peter Hewitt doesn't do much to capture Twain's tone, but he wisely stays out of the way of the story. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is initially too TV-cute as Tom, and Brad Renfro's Huck has been sanitized into a 19th-century homeless boy who just needs to be loved. But they both grow on you. One nice touch: This film's Becky Thatcher is a full head taller than Tom.  Toy Story G  A knockout. The first feature to be fully computer-generated, the all-ages comedy taps our childhood fantasies about the lives toys lead when the bedroom door closes. And it injects grown-up humor by making these Mr. Potato Heads and Slinky Dogs as psychologically diverse as any human. As neurotic as they are nice, the toys fret about their young owner Andy's birthday party, worried about getting edged out by a super-duper new toy. Longtime fave cowboy Woody (voice by Tom Hanks) gets upstaged by newcomer Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), a gleaming plastic hero. In this mock epic, Woody and Buzz go out into the ``real world,'' where they scamper beneath 18-wheelers, flee a toothy canine and survive the sadistic antics of the kid next door. Four years in the making, the film is a jaw-dropping spectacle, with one bravura sequence topping the one before. Give it five minutes, and this laugh-out-loud delight can turn the scroogiest Scrooge into a happy kid. _ Steve Murray  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960207.0159 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(7thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  12 Monkeys R  Terry Gilliam's despair-laced fantasy gets under your skin _ even when you don't exactly know what's going on. Bruce Willis stars as Cole, who claims to be a time traveler from the year 2035. He's sent back to 1996 to discover the cause of a plague that has wiped out 5 billion people. Is he really from the future, or is he insane _ as one psychiatrist (Madeleine Stowe) thinks? As in Gilliam's other films (``Time Bandits,'' ``The Fisher King''), story and emotion come second to visual design and mood, and at times the movie could use a stronger sense of drama and momentum. Still, there's nothing else like it on screen right now. For its strange, spooky visual poetry, ``Monkeys'' is a barrel of glum fun. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  Two If by Sea R  A negligible, slightly amusing caper comedy that proves Sandra Bullock's first-rate charm can prop up second-rate material. She and Denis Leary play a bickering blue-collar couple who've stolen a painting. Arriving at Cape Cod a few days before their scheduled rendezvous with the mysterious buyer, they decide to enjoy the good life and ``house-sit'' a seaside mansion. Leary wrote the script, which includes flashes of his acerbic, off-kilter wit, but mostly the movie doesn't have enough heft, comedic or romantic. A good rentable.  The Usual Suspects R  A crafty crime thriller you'll want to watch twice. Told mainly in flashbacks, it unravels the tale of five crooks (including Kevin Spacey, Stephen Baldwin and Gabriel Byrne) and a messed-up drug deal that left all but one of them dead. But solving this mystery isn't nearly as simple as it looks. Part hard-boiled ``Rashomon,'' part cinematic con game, ``Suspects'' keeps pulling the rug out from under you. It demands (and rewards) close attention. Don't be surprised if you feel like watching it a second time _ not because you're confused, but just to savor the screenplay's twists and red herrings. It's anything but usual. Rated R for language and violence. _ Steve Murray  Vampire in Brooklyn R  An anemic hybrid of laughs and jolts, Wes Craven's movie stars Eddie Murphy as the vampire Maximillian, who comes to New York with an unplaceable accent and a wardrobe somewhere between Vincent Price and Sunset Boulevard pimp. He's seeking Rita (Angela Bassett), a cop who doesn't realize she's got vampire blood in her veins. Mixing gross-out humor, some sex, some violence, the movie never decides whether it's a comedy, a thriller, a romance _ what? Likewise, Murphy (the hero? the villain?) is stranded, posing in his threads like an International Male model. He also plays a couple of minor characters, and his scene as a Sharpton-like preacher who convinces his flock that ``evil is good'' is one of the few moments when the movie comes alive. Otherwise, it's undead all the way. _ Steve Murray  Waiting to Exhale R A breath of fresh air. An gela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon play friends in this glossy, well-acted adaptation of Terry McMillan's best seller. Forest Whitaker, better known for his acting in ``Bird'' and ``The Crying Game,'' provides the expert direction. And as for the reported ``male bashing,'' before you take your man, simply ask yourself, is he man enough to take it? Whitaker is. And he's man enough to dish it out, too. Rated R for sex, language and adult themes.  White Squall R Ridley Scott, director of the sci-fi classics ``Alien'' and ``Blade Runner,'' brings his formidable skills to this story of a training skipper at a boating school for young men. He faces a Coast Guard inquest after some of his students are swept overboard during a freak storm. Jeff Bridges stars. _ Doug Hamilton  For use by clients of the New York Times News Service </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960207.0160 type=story > <HEADLINE> COCA-COLA SEES A MAJOR GROWTH OPPORTUNITY AT THE MOVIES </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> ATLANTA (BC-COKE-MOVIES-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"

They move weekly to clients of the New York Times News Service.  G: General audiences. Nothing that would offend parents if viewed by children.  PG: Parental guidance suggested. May contain some material parents consider inappropriate for young children.  PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for preteens.  R: Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking children.  NC-17: No one under 17 admitted. Replaces the X rating.  NR: Not rated.  Ace Ventura: When  Nature Calls PG-13  All- l-l- RIIIGHTY then. An Ace Ventura sequel was inevitable. Hence this `` . . . and dumber'' follow-up to Jim Carrey's supremely dumb ``Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.'' This time, our intrepid sleuth and animal lover is in deepest, darkest Africa, trying to locate a missing sacred animal and thus prevent tribal warfare. Yes, it's vulgar. Yes, it's idiotic. But what were you expecting? Ace Ventura in ``Schindler's List II''? As purely silly movies go, this one is aces. Rated PG-13 for vulgarity, language and sexual innuendo.  The American President  PG-13  In Rob Reiner's tangy romantic comedy, Michael Douglas plays widowed President Andrew Shepherd, who woos environmental lobbyist Sydney Wade (Annette Bening). Unfortunately, election year is looming. And Senator Rumson (Richard Dreyfuss) grabs their romance as fodder for his own mudslinging campaign. Regaining his magic touch, Reiner keeps his film balanced between its smarter agenda and its Hollywood fairy-tale touches. Rated PG-13 for language. _ Steve Murray  Angels &AMP; Insects Not Rated  Based on the acclaimed A.S. Byatt novella, this British drama is already receiving high marks for its intriguing dissection of Victorian society. Mark Rylance plays an entomologist who returns to England following an extended period of research in South America. He begins to notice striking similarities between the British aristocracy and the insect world.  Babe G  Pig out on this delightfully screwball movie ab out a piglet who thinks he's a sheepdog. Real-life animals carry the bulk of the story, but they get some high-tech help from computer graphics and superbly lifelike animatronic stand-ins created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Voice talent Christine Cavanaugh as Babe and Miriam Margolyes (``The Age of Innocence'') as Fly, Babe's adopted border collie mom.  Balto G  A beautifully executed, edge-of-your-seat exciting animated adventure. The full- mush story is based on the true-life journey of a heroic sled dog named Balto who brought the anti-diphtheria serum to Nome, Alaska, in 1925, thus saving the lives of hundreds of children. A tale of perseverance, courage, tolerance and puppy love, the movie's all-star cast of voices includes Kevin Bacon, Bridget Fonda, Bob Hoskins and Phil Collins.  Beautiful Girls R  A perceptive, humorous look at relationships and the late-20s blues in a working-class town in western Massachusetts. Timothy Hutton heads a strong ensemble cast as a Manhattan pianist who returns home for his high school reunion. Matt Dillon, Michael Rapaport, Max Perlich and Noah Emmerich are his pals; Mira Sorvino, Annabeth Gish, Lauren Holly, Rosie O'Donnell, Uma Thurman and a scene-stealing Natalie Portman are the girls in and out of their lives. The movie doesn't accomplish everything it sets out to, but if it misses ``The Big Chill,'' it still delivers some salient shivers about growing up.  Bed of Roses PG  A small hooray to Christian Slater and Mary Stuart Masterson for lending their star power to this slight modern romance about a career woman who needs to stop and smell the (bed of) roses and the Prince Charming who wants to show her how. Unfortunately, writer-director Michael Goldenberg sets up his two attracted opposites and then really doesn't know what to do with them. We're left with a sweet nothing of a movie that promises more than it delivers. Rated PG for mild adult themes.  Big Bully PG-13  This bland smile inducer will neither help nor hinder Tom Arnold's erratic career, though it does give Roseanne's former hubby the chance to briefly display his nasty side. He plays Roscoe Bigger a mild-mannered shop teacher who was a schoolyard terror, nicknamed Fang, during his formative years. Rick Moranis is David Leary, in his youth Fang's victim, in adulthood a semi-famous author. The pair re-encounter each other when Leary comes to teach at Bigger's school, and they soon revert to their childhood roles of bully and bullied. Aside from an jarring horror-movie climax, this is an entirely oomphless outing. Rated PG-13 for language and violence. _ Doug Hamilton .  Bio-Dome PG-13  Dumb Pauly Shore and dumber Stephen Baldwin get locked inside the environmentally controlled bio-dome, with the scientists committed to living there a year. This movie wants to be a ``Dumb and Dumbest,'' but it's really ``Dull and Dullest.'' See the dudes wreck the rain forest! Watch them swing on vines! Dumb can be fun, but Shore and Baldwin aren't Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. Most of the humor consists of watching Shore crack himself up with his own Valley garble. It's good to know he's having a great time. _ Steve Murray  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960215.0390 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(2ndtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Black Sheep PG-13  It appears that David Spade and Chris Farley are aiming to be the Abbott and Costello of the '90s. In this, their second big-screen vehicle together (following the amusing 1995 hit ``Tommy Boy''), the pair continue to chase a classic comedy team formula. At times, they evoke the spirit of Bud and Lou, superficially at least, but their shtick just ain't classic yet, and ``Black Sheep's'' negligible plot leaves them grasping for gags. _ Doug Hamilton  The Bridges  of Madison County PG-13  Probably the only thing wrong with Clint Eastwood's radiantly romantic movie is Robert James Waller's relentlessly excessive book. And even then, it's no contest. Director/star Eastwood (as the National Geographic photographer) and co-star Meryl Streep (as the unfulfilled farm wife) perform alchemy here; while adhering to whatever it was in Waller's best seller that sold all those copies, they've transformed the material into something far, far better. Rated PG-13 for sexual and adult themes.  Broken Arrow R  Air Force pilot Christian Slater goes up against his buddy John Travolta, who steals two nuclear warheads from their Stealth bomber with a plan to ransom an entire city. Basically, the movie is one long chase in the desert, as Slater teams with perky park ranger Samantha Mathis _ and tracks the bad guys on foot (that must be a small desert). Packed with implausibility, the movie should be a lot of dumb fun. But it can't decide if it's ``Indiana Jones'' or ``Fail-Safe.'' Directed by Hong Kong action czar John Woo, it's played too broadly to make us genuinely tense, but it's not over-the-top enough to make us giddy with thrills. _ Steve Murray  Casino R  The ``GoodFellas'' duo _ director Martin Scorsese and writer Nicholas Pileggi _ roll the dice a second time and come up craps. Robert De Niro plays Sam ``Ace'' Rothstein, a professional gambler who operates a Las Vegas casino from behind the scenes; Joe Pesci is a hothead hit man, and both were better in ``GoodFellas.'' Finally there's Ginger (Sharon Stone, who proves once and for all that she can act), a former hooker who becomes Sam's reluctant wife and dives into the bottle. If the movie focused more clearly on these three, ``Casino'' might hold our interest. But the whole thing feels like a retread. _ Steve Murray  City Hall R  Al Pacino reunites with ``Sea of Love'' director Harold Becker for this drama about a big city mayor juggling various civic crises and a corruption conspiracy to boot. John Cusack plays the idealistic deputy mayor.  Dead Man Walking R  In Tim Robbins' deadly earnest, intermittently powerful death-row drama, a nun (Susan Sarandon) becomes involved with a convicted murderer (Sean Penn). Both give riveting portrayals (though Penn's arrogant, racist redneck is getting most of the attention). The problem is the movie isn't really about either character. It's about an issue _ the pros and cons of the death penalty _ which means it often lapses into the message-conscious style of a '50s TV drama. Still, Robbins manages a shatteringly effective final half hour simply by showing us how capital punishment works in every gruesome and dehumanizing detail.  Dead Presidents R  A searingly fine sophomore effort by the Hughes brothers (``Menace II Society''). Like an African-Americanized ``The Deer Hunter,'' the movie follows some pals from the Bronx before, during and after their tour of duty in Vietnam. Larenz Tate is the film's indispensable anchor, but he gets fine support from Keith David, N'Bushe Wright and Bokeem Wodbine, among others. The film isn't perfect; by trying to cover so much ground, it skims certain issues, skimps on certain characters. But it's a vital and passionate look at a nation so caught up in the macho-angst of losing a war abroad that it ignored a far more important war at home. Rated R for sex, violence, nudity and language.

Denzel Washington plays accidental private eye Easy Rawlins. The year is 1948, and he's approached by a tough (Tom Sizemore) who claims he's working for a mayoral candidate whose fiancee Daphne (Jennifer Beals) has gone missing. But this turns out to be much more than a missing persons case. The interesting part of ``Devil'' isn't its convoluted plot (which gets less interesting as it becomes clearer), but the smaller observations that constantly remind us of Easy's double trouble as a black man in '40s L.A. Rated R for sex, language and violence. _ Steve Murray  Don't Be a Menace  to South Central While Drinking  Your Juice in the Hood R  A vehicle for Shawn and Marlon Wayans, the two youngest members of the comic family that includes brothers Damon and Keenen Ivory. This ``Airplane!''-style parody takes broad, juvenile jabs at such urban ``message'' movies as ``Menace II Society'' and ``Boyz N the Hood.'' If not all the jokes here work, many of the ones that do have extra weight. When two characters are busted for ``being black on a Friday night'' and taken to a police station equipped with a Rodney King punch-and-kick video game, the movie turns from goofy fun to comedy that tickles and stings. _ Doug Hamilton  Dracula: Dead  and Loving It PG-13  This mildly amusing spoof of Bram Stoker's famous vampire story dies after about half an hour. Leslie Nielsen makes a commanding count in his cape and Liberace pompadour and Peter MacNicol swipes scenes as the cackling bug-eater Renfield. But there's something missing here, something that suggests writer/director Mel Brooks is either stuck in a '70s sense of outrageousness or simply lost interest somewhere in the middle of his movie. ``Dracula'' makes you worry that Mel's career may be dead and he's not loving it. Rated PG-13 for language, sex and nudity.  Dunston Checks In PG  Kids will probably go bananas over this family-friendly monkey movie. ``Seinfeld's'' Jason Alexander stars as a single father who manages a swanky New York hotel. His youngest son discovers that one of the guests, a thief masquerading as a British lord (Rupert Everett), has smuggled in an orangutan. Named Dunston, this hairy partner in crime is trained to break into rooms while his master is hobnobbing at the bar, establishing an alibi. If the movie is a bit derivative, it's solid entertainment, sparked by witty performances by Alexander, Everett and Faye Dunaway, who gives her role as the hotel owner's exacting wife just the right Leona Helmsley spin. Rated PG for language. _ Doug Hamilton  Eye for an Eye R  Sally Field stars in this taut, emotionally charged thriller about a mother seeking vengeance on the psychopath who raped and murdered her daughter. But this is more than a distaff ``Death Wish''; it's also an exploration of the toxic aftershocks of violence _ its malignant effect on a person or a family. You can tell the care director John Schlesinger (``Midnight Cowboy'') has put into the film simply by the care he's put into the casting: Ed Harris in what could have been the vanilla role of Field's husband; Joe Mantegna as the homicide detective on the case; and Kiefer Sutherland as the sneering scum who may have tangled with the wrong mom.  Father of the Bride,  Part II PG  Steve Martin's father of the bride becomes a father-to-be and a grandfather-to-be in this dumbed-down diversion that's not half as enjoyable as its 1991 predecessor. The funny parts, all of which have been revealed in the trailer (the dual pregnancies of wife Diane Keaton and daughter Kimberly Williams, Martin's midlife crisis, the return of Martin Short's egregiously effeminate party planner), just aren't that funny. However, the schmaltzy parts, near the end, work like a charm. My advice: Go with someone who is pregnant and enjoy her enjoyment. Somehow, even the dumbest pregnancy cliches seem appealing in your second trimester. Rated PG for mild adult themes and language.  From Dusk Till Dawn R  Robert Rodriguez's hyperviolent vampire flick stars scripter Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney (in a dynamic big- screen crossover) as killer bank robbers who take hostage a retired minister (Harvey Keitel) and his kids (including Juliette Lewis). Bad luck for them, these anti-heroes stop at a Mexican bar _ catering to bikers and bloodsuckers. The long opening setup is vintage Tarantino, full of bloody shocks and sick humor. But once the saloon's staff morph into vampires, ``Dusk'' heads into Sam Raimi's ``Evil Dead'' territory, complete with spewing eyeballs and severed limbs. It's an excuse for a couple of way-talented filmmakers to have gruesome fun. And for most of the time, we do, too. But the squeamish, beware. Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity. _ Steve Murray  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960215.0392 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(4thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Get Shorty R  Barry Sonnenfeld's lively adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel follows the exploits of a Miami loan shark named Chili Palmer (John Travolta) who finds out that show biz isn't all that different from shylocking when he goes to pick up a debt from a B-movie producer (Gene Hackman). Anchoring the most complicated plot since ``The Usual Suspects,'' the charming Travolta proves he's no ``Pulp Fiction'' flash in the pan. _ Steve Murray  GoldenEye PG-13  Reality never intrudes on the babes and bombs, gags and gadgets in this guilty pleasure introducing Pierce Brosnan as the new 007. Despite some P.C. lip service, it's the old things that work best, including villains left over from the Cold War (Sean Bean as a disgruntled Cossack, Famke Janssen as masochistic femme fatale Xenia Onatopp). Pitched between the no-nonsense Timothy Dalton and the inimitably courtly Sean Connery, Brosnan deserves a few more spins in the Aston-Martin. _ Steve Murray  Grumpier Old Men PG-13  They aren't really any grumpier. But stars Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are richer, thanks to the first film's success. Most of the original team is back, including Ann-Margret as Lemmon's sex-kitten wife and Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's drinking, smoking, oversexed dad. The main newcomer is Sophia Loren as the bombshell Maria who sets the men's pacemakers ticking. As far as retreads go, ``Grumpier'' is faithful to the first one's mix of slapstick, senior-level smut and schmaltz. But if the first film was Lemmon's movie, this one is Matthau's. There's a lovely sweetness in his courtship with Loren; he has the puppyish bafflement of a fellow in love for the very first time. He makes even wine in a box seem romantic. But after an hour, the movie runs out of its already meager steam. Whether you want to meander along with it depends on how you respond to Lemmon's and Matthau's patented slow burns._ Steve Murray  Happy Gilmore PG-13  ``Saturday Night Live'' alum Adam Sandler played an idiot slacker in last year's dumb-and-dumber comedy ``Billy Madison.'' In this one, he plays an idiot golfer. Is there no limit to the man's range? Bob Barker and Lee Trevino make cameos. _ Doug Hamilton  Heat R  Looks hot on paper (Al Pacino and Robert De Niro together again for the first time!), but on screen, this incoherent, overlong action flick never sputters above a pseudo- simmer. Pacino is a workaholic L.A. cop obsessed with catching De Niro, a career criminal who masterminds complex heists. The movie lasts almost three hours and the two stars spend around 10 minutes together. Maybe writer/director Michael Mann thought he was creating an existential male menopause movie masquerading as a cops and robbers drama. But watching two great actors run, jump and shoot their way through roles they would have laughed at in their Young Turk days is ultimately kind of painful. Rated R for violence, language and brief sex.  Home for the Holidays PG-13  For the holidays, there's no place like Jodie Foster's deliciously well-observed, warm-hearted comedy about one family's long day's journey into Thanksgiving night. Director Foster and her deft ensemble (headed by Holly Hunter, Anne Bancroft, Robert Downey Jr. and Charles Durning) remind us there's no one like your own flesh and blood to knock the stuffing out of you . . . and still, somehow, have you coming back for seconds. Here's one family reunion you won't want to miss. Rated PG-13 for language and adult themes.  It Takes Two PG  Mary- Kate and Ashley Olsen of TV's ``Full House'' (they shared the role of Michelle Tanner) play identical strangers _ one a streetwise New York orphan, the other a billionaire's daughter _ who scheme to switch places and get their single guardians together. Sure, it's ``The Prince and the Pauper'' meets ``The Parent Trap,'' but director Andy Tennant does absolutely the best job one can with borrowed ideas, and the Olsens are _ surprise! _ a delight, far more expressive than on ``Full House'' and very natural in their parts. Rated PG for mild adult themes. _ Doug Hamilton  Jumanji PG  Robin Williams shows us where the wild things are in this effects-laden family fantasy about a mysterious board game that can bring rhinos into your living room or turn a house into a primeval swamp. Director Joe Johnstone (``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'') knows how to thrill an audience with outsized insects or a stampede down Main Street. But the movie goes on a roll of the dice or two too long. And in-between ``plays,'' things get frankly boring. Bottom line: If you've seen the trailer, you've already seen all the best parts. And those ``best parts'' may be a little scary for littler kids. Johnston does nothing to up the ante; it's like playing Candyland instead of Monopoly. Rated PG for violence.  The Juror R  In this drab legal thriller Demi Moore is a single mom whose life becomes hell when jury duty lands her in the hands of a mob operative, who threatens her life unless she gets his boss acquitted. It's a two-hour string of implausibilities. Of course, we don't go to a thriller expecting to believe every plot twist; half the fun is seeing how outrageous the action can get while still keeping us hooked. But director Brian Gibson can't make us suspend our disbelief, and there's not a scary moment in the movie. Though he's verging on typecasting (see ``Malice''), Baldwin is a pro at playing these sexy psychopaths. But forget about Moore, who blunders through with her usual mix of plucky squared jaw and perfectly timed teardrop. She's a big drag. _ Steve Murray  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960215.0393 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(5thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Leaving Las Vegas R  ``Viva Las Vegas'' on two dozen downers and a case of Jack Black. Nicolas Cage is an alcoholic Hollywood screenwriter who pockets his severance check and heads to Vegas to drink himself to death. Elisabeth Shue is a Vegas hooker who gets hooked on his devil-may-care despair. The movie is a bit of a drunk itself _ given to self-indulgent poses and poetic pretentiousness. But Cage and Shue are willing _ and able _ to do director Mike Figgis' dirty work for him. Their terrific performances leave you feeling unclean and sober. Rated R for sex, language, nudity and drug abuse.  Mr. Holland's Opus PG  The corn is as high as an elephant's eye in this unabashedly sentimental melodrama. And guess what? The cornier it gets, the better the picture works. Richard Dreyfuss stars as a would-be composer who devotes 30 years of his life to teaching high school music students. Director Stephen Herek has shaped the film into easily absorbed TV-size chunks that are given focus and humor thanks to a solid cast and Dreyfuss' energized, razor- sharp performance. Goodbye, Mr. Chips; hello, Mr. Holland. Rated PG for mild language.  Money Train R  Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson attempt to work the same buddy magic that made their 1992 basketball comedy, ``White Men Can't Jump,'' such a hit. Here, their interplay is again easy and amusing, but the movie around them is a cliched jumble. The two play New York subway cops who also are foster brothers. Snipes is the responsible one; Harrelson's the habitual gambler with the Mom-always-liked-you-best chip on his shoulder. When Harrelson's fortunes take a downward turn (due to a laughable series of plot contrivances), he decides to reverse his loser status by robbing the subway's revenue train. Rated R for violence, language and nudity._ Doug Hamilton  Muppet Treasure Island G Kermit the Frog mans the helm of a puppet- infested frigate in this high seas sendup of the Robert Lewis Stevenson classic. On a quest for buried treasure with his stitched-together crew, including pals Fozzie and Gonzo, Kermie encounters the treacherous pirate Long John Silver (Tim Curry) as well as an island of warthogs ruled by an alluring queen (you guessed it _ Miss Piggy).  Once Upon a Time . . . When We Were Colored PG  Tim Reid directs a talented cast (headed by Al Freeman Jr. and Phylicia Rashad) in a tender, evocative film set in the postwar segregated South. Based on Clifton Taulbart's coming-of-age memoir, the movie spans three decades, celebrating the triumph of the spirit of a generation of African- Americans _ the generation after slavery and before lunch-counter sit-ins _ who never got a break coming or going. An honorable, heartfelt picture that implores us to never forget our country's past so that we may be better prepared to shape its future. Rated PG for adult themes.  Othello R  Though handsomely shot and cleanly spoken, the new film of ``Othello'' is more like ``The Iago Show.'' Kenneth Branagh plays the fellow, who connives to convince his employer, the noble Othello (a strong but distant Laurence Fishburne), that his new wife, Desdemona (Irene Jacob), is unfaithful. In a plot fueled by Iago's machinations, Othello already runs the risk of being upstaged. In director Oliver Parker's piecemeal adaptation, this imbalance is emphasized, with the terrific Branagh delivering his juicy monologues directly to the camera. Parker rigs the tale for a '90s audience with several wordless bedroom scenes (thus the R rating). But for all the heavy breathing and MTV- speed cuts, this ``Othello'' loses steam the closer it gets to its denouement. The finale feels merely unfortunate, not devastating. And that's a real tragedy. _ Steve Murray  Persuasion PG  An awesome Jane Austen adaptation, courtesy of director Roger Michell, writer Nick Dear and a splendid cast. Set in the early 19th century, the movie is both a superbly nuanced social comedy and a yearningly openhearted romantic drama. At the ripe old age of 27, Anne Elliott (Amanda Root) is facing _ gasp _ spinsterhood. Then the man she wrongly rejected years ago (a family friend insisted he lacked family and finances) comes back into her life. But can true romance overcome the idiot clutter of society's expectations and repressed emotions? Gloriously romantic yet giddily hilarious, this movie gives you a ruefully knowing smile as it sides with the wise heart. You leave the theater feeling better about everything. Rated PG for mild adult themes.  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960215.0394 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(6thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  The Postman NR  Set in the early '50s, this bittersweet tale of the unlikely friendship between the world- famous poet Pablo Neruda and Mario, an unworldly fisherman's son, is a deceptively simple film that sneaks up on you. English director Michael Radford (``White Mischief'') brings an outsider's intrigued eye to his Italian setting. But his ultimate focus is on the collision of poet and peasant and how each affects the other.  Restoration R  The Rake's Progress. Robert Downey Jr. stars in this visually sumptuous tale, set in the 1660s, when King Charles II was restored to the throne after years of Puritan austerity. Downey plays a doctor _ one more interested in whoring than healing _ who's summoned by the King (Sam Neill) to be the royal physician to the royal pooches. Things get tricky when he's told to marry the King's favorite mistress (Polly Walker) on the condition he not fall in love with her. Director Michael Hoffman has created a lavishly adorned historical pageant _ almost like a court masque commissioned by Charles _ without losing the essential simplicity and moral force of his story.  Richard III R  Bloody as hell and bloody good fun. Sir Ian McKellen and director Richard Loncraine have transferred Shakespeare's tale of unruly royals doing rotten things to one another to 1930s England. The cast is a who's who of Britain's best (along with Americans Annette Bening and Robert Downey Jr.), but the crown jewel is Richard himself, played by McKellan as a magnificent media-savvy monster, as unctuous as he is unrepentant. This is a dazzling film, vividly imagined and breathtakingly performed. Everyone involved has done themselves proud, creating a ``Richard'' for the 1990s and the 1590s. If only all movies, Shakespeare adaptations or not, could be this self-confidently full-of-themselves in both concept and content.  Sabrina PG  The difference between the original ``Sabrina,'' a minor Billy Wilder film meant as a shameless showcase for Audrey Hepburn, and Sydney Pollack's remake isn't a matter of Hepburn vs. her replacement, Julia Ormond. It's a matter of Hepburn vs. Harrison Ford. He takes the Humphrey Bogart role of a sour tycoon who steps in when the chauffeur's daughter (Ormond) threatens to distract his easily distracted younger brother (a funny Greg Kinnear) from his impending marriage/corporate merger. The first film was about Hepburn's transformation; this one is about Ford's. It gives it a more serious tone, but it also makes it more satisfying.  Screamers R  ``Howlers'' is more like it. Set on a remote mining planet in 2078, the sci-fi would-be-thriller pits human residents (including Peter Weller and Jennifer Rubin) against killer, saw- armed robots named Screamers; they burrow underground, kill anything that moves, and have learned how to reproduce. It's a cool idea. But the movie is mired in cliches and swipes from better movies (``Tremors,'' ``Aliens,'' ``The Thing,'' etc.). The movie's truly unique moments are memorable for their stupidity. You know you're in trouble when the moments meant to provoke gasps get giggles instead. Rated R for violence, language and brief nudity. _ Steve Murray  Sense and Sensibility PG  This dazzling Jane Austen adaptation is one of the year's best and a sure-fire Oscar contender. Emma Thompson (who wrote the script) and Kate Winslet (``Heavenly Creatures'') co- star as penniless sisters trying to make their way among the sensible and the senseless in late 18th-century England. Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant and Greg Wise are suitors (of varying and changeable degrees of suitability). The unlikely director is Ang Lee (``Eat Drink Man Woman''), who has delivered a gorgeous film brimming with humor, romance and intelligence _ one that, on its own terms, is as fraught with peril and incident as a Spielberg thrill-flick. Score one for the good guys (and good gals.) And get your Oscar score card ready. Rated PG for mild adult themes.  Seven R  The creative serial killer in this self-conscious gibberish models his gruesome murders after each of the seven deadly sins. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are the cops out to stop him, but there's not much they can do to rescue this one-gimmick movie from quickly wearing out its one gimmick. Rated R for violence and language.  Sudden Death R  In this dumb-and-dumber knockoff of ``Die Hard'' (that's meant as a compliment), Jean-Claude Van Damme is the one-man cavalry who must save a stadium full of hockey fans from a madman (Powers Boothe) who's wired the place to blow up if he doesn't get a zillion-billion dollars. The movie is nonstop, state-of-the-art, over-the-top Hollywood hokum. And that's meant as a compliment, too. Rated R for violence and language.  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960215.0395 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(7thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Things to Do in Denver  When You're Dead R  Reportedly, this bizarrely titled crime flick suffers from acute Tarantino-itis. A reformed mobster (Andy Garcia) brings his old crew back together to pull one last job for his ex-boss (Christopher Walken).  Tom and Huck G  A straightforward, well-played adaptation of Mark Twain's classic ``The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.'' Director Peter Hewitt doesn't do much to capture Twain's tone, but he wisely stays out of the way of the story. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is initially too TV-cute as Tom, and Brad Renfro's Huck has been sanitized into a 19th-century homeless boy who just needs to be loved. But they both grow on you. One nice touch: This film's Becky Thatcher is a full head taller than Tom.  Toy Story G  A knockout. The first feature to be fully computer-generated, the all-ages comedy taps our childhood fantasies about the lives toys lead when the bedroom door closes. And it injects grown-up humor by making these Mr. Potato Heads and Slinky Dogs as psychologically diverse as any human. As neurotic as they are nice, the toys fret about their young owner Andy's birthday party, worried about getting edged out by a super-duper new toy. Longtime fave cowboy Woody (voice by Tom Hanks) gets upstaged by newcomer Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), a gleaming plastic hero. In this mock epic, Woody and Buzz go out into the ``real world,'' where they scamper beneath 18-wheelers, flee a toothy canine and survive the sadistic antics of the kid next door. Four years in the making, the film is a jaw- dropping spectacle, with one bravura sequence topping the one before. Give it five minutes, and this laugh-out-loud delight can turn the scroogiest Scrooge into a happy kid. _ Steve Murray  12 Monkeys R  Terry Gilliam's despair- laced fantasy gets under your skin _ even when you don't exactly know what's going on. Bruce Willis stars as Cole, who claims to be a time traveler from the year 2035. He's sent back to 1996 to discover the cause of a plague that has wiped out 5 billion people. Is he really from the future, or is he insane _ as one psychiatrist (Madeleine Stowe) thinks? As in Gilliam's other films (``Time Bandits,'' ``The Fisher King''), story and emotion come second to visual design and mood, and at times the movie could use a stronger sense of drama and momentum. Still, there's nothing else like it on screen right now. For its strange, spooky visual poetry, ``Monkeys'' is a barrel of glum fun. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  Two If by Sea R  A negligible, slightly amusing caper comedy that proves Sandra Bullock's first-rate charm can prop up second-rate material. She and Denis Leary play a bickering blue-collar couple who've stolen a painting. Arriving at Cape Cod a few days before their scheduled rendezvous with the mysterious buyer, they decide to enjoy the good life and ``house-sit'' a seaside mansion. Leary wrote the script, which includes flashes of his acerbic, off-kilter wit, but mostly the movie doesn't have enough heft, comedic or romantic. A good rentable.  Vampire in Brooklyn R  An anemic hybrid of laughs and jolts, Wes Craven's movie stars Eddie Murphy as the vampire Maximillian, who comes to New York with an unplaceable accent and a wardrobe somewhere between Vincent Price and Sunset Boulevard pimp. He's seeking Rita (Angela Bassett), a cop who doesn't realize she's got vampire blood in her veins. Mixing gross-out humor, some sex, some violence, the movie never decides whether it's a comedy, a thriller, a romance _ what? Likewise, Murphy (the hero? the villain?) is stranded, posing in his threads like an International Male model. He also plays a couple of minor characters, and his scene as a Sharpton-like preacher who convinces his flock that ``evil is good'' is one of the few moments when the movie comes alive. Otherwise, it's undead all the way. _ Steve Murray  Waiting to Exhale R  A breath of fresh air. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon play friends in this glossy, well-acted adaptation of Terry McMillan's best seller. Forest Whitaker, better known for his acting in ``Bird'' and ``The Crying Game,'' provides the expert direction. And as for the reported ``male bashing,'' before you take your man, simply ask yourself, is he man enough to take it? Whitaker is. And he's man enough to dish it out, too. Rated R for sex, language and adult themes.  White Squall R  To get to the title storm (and it's a doozy) you have to wade through 90 minutes of a by-the-numbers script that wants to be ``Dead Poets Society'' on water. Based on a true story, ``Squall'' follows 13 high school boys in 1960, sailing for a year in the Albatross. They're skippered by gruff Christopher Sheldon (Jeff Bridges), a sort of growling surfer-Ahab. At first, the film conjures the muscle-stretching sense of hard work, raw sunlight, sweat and brine, and director Ridley Scott captures the menacing beauty of the ocean. But then the script kicks in and drowns in cliche, including the usual rites-of-passage (in exotic ports, the boys get drunk, get laid, get the clap). When the title storm finally hits, you'll be glad for the special effects _ but left unmoved by the fate of those who die. _ Steve Murray .

They move weekly to clients of the New York Times News Service.  G: General audiences. Nothing that would offend parents if viewed by children.  PG: Parental guidance suggested. May contain some material parents consider inappropriate for young children.  PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for preteens.  R: Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking children.  NC-17: No one under 17 admitted. Replaces the X rating.  NR: Not rated.  Ace Ventura: When  Nature Calls PG-13  All- l-l- RIIIGHTY then. An Ace Ventura sequel was inevitable. Hence this `` . . . and dumber'' follow-up to Jim Carrey's supremely dumb ``Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.'' This time, our intrepid sleuth and animal lover is in deepest, darkest Africa, trying to locate a missing sacred animal and thus prevent tribal warfare. Yes, it's vulgar. Yes, it's idiotic. But what were you expecting? Ace Ventura in ``Schindler's List II''? As purely silly movies go, this one is aces. Rated PG-13 for vulgarity, language and sexual innuendo.  The American President  PG-13  In Rob Reiner's tangy romantic comedy, Michael Douglas plays widowed President Andrew Shepherd, who woos environmental lobbyist Sydney Wade (Annette Bening). Unfortunately, election year is looming. And Senator Rumson (Richard Dreyfuss) grabs their romance as fodder for his own mudslinging campaign. Regaining his magic touch, Reiner keeps his film balanced between its smarter agenda and its Hollywood fairy-tale touches. Rated PG-13 for language. _ Steve Murray  Angels &AMP; Insects Not Rated  Based on the acclaimed A.S. Byatt novella, this British drama is already receiving high marks for its intriguing dissection of Victorian society. Mark Rylance plays an entomologist who returns to England following an extended period of research in South America. He begins to notice striking similarities between the British aristocracy and the insect world.  Babe G  Pig out on this delightfully screwball movie ab out a piglet who thinks he's a sheepdog. Real-life animals carry the bulk of the story, but they get some high-tech help from computer graphics and superbly lifelike animatronic stand-ins created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Voice talent Christine Cavanaugh as Babe and Miriam Margolyes (``The Age of Innocence'') as Fly, Babe's adopted border collie mom.  Balto G  A beautifully executed, edge-of-your-seat exciting animated adventure. The full- mush story is based on the true-life journey of a heroic sled dog named Balto who brought the anti-diphtheria serum to Nome, Alaska, in 1925, thus saving the lives of hundreds of children. A tale of perseverance, courage, tolerance and puppy love, the movie's all-star cast of voices includes Kevin Bacon, Bridget Fonda, Bob Hoskins and Phil Collins.  Beautiful Girls R  A perceptive, humorous look at relationships and the late-20s blues in a working-class town in western Massachusetts. Timothy Hutton heads a strong ensemble cast as a Manhattan pianist who returns home for his high school reunion. Matt Dillon, Michael Rapaport, Max Perlich and Noah Emmerich are his pals; Mira Sorvino, Annabeth Gish, Lauren Holly, Rosie O'Donnell, Uma Thurman and a scene-stealing Natalie Portman are the girls in and out of their lives. The movie doesn't accomplish everything it sets out to, but if it misses ``The Big Chill,'' it still delivers some salient shivers about growing up.  Bed of Roses PG  A small hooray to Christian Slater and Mary Stuart Masterson for lending their star power to this slight modern romance about a career woman who needs to stop and smell the (bed of) roses and the Prince Charming who wants to show her how. Unfortunately, writer-director Michael Goldenberg sets up his two attracted opposites and then really doesn't know what to do with them. We're left with a sweet nothing of a movie that promises more than it delivers. Rated PG for mild adult themes.  Big Bully PG-13  This bland smile inducer will neither help nor hinder Tom Arnold's erratic career, though it does give Roseanne's former hubby the chance to briefly display his nasty side. He plays Roscoe Bigger a mild-mannered shop teacher who was a schoolyard terror, nicknamed Fang, during his formative years. Rick Moranis is David Leary, in his youth Fang's victim, in adulthood a semi-famous author. The pair re-encounter each other when Leary comes to teach at Bigger's school, and they soon revert to their childhood roles of bully and bullied. Aside from an jarring horror-movie climax, this is an entirely oomphless outing. Rated PG-13 for language and violence. _ Doug Hamilton .  Bio-Dome PG-13  Dumb Pauly Shore and dumber Stephen Baldwin get locked inside the environmentally controlled bio-dome, with the scientists committed to living there a year. This movie wants to be a ``Dumb and Dumbest,'' but it's really ``Dull and Dullest.'' See the dudes wreck the rain forest! Watch them swing on vines! Dumb can be fun, but Shore and Baldwin aren't Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. Most of the humor consists of watching Shore crack himself up with his own Valley garble. It's good to know he's having a great time. _ Steve Murray  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960222.0161 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(2ndtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Black Sheep PG-13  It appears that David Spade and Chris Farley are aiming to be the Abbott and Costello of the '90s. In this, their second big-screen vehicle together (following the amusing 1995 hit ``Tommy Boy''), the pair continue to chase a classic comedy team formula. At times, they evoke the spirit of Bud and Lou, superficially at least, but their shtick just ain't classic yet, and ``Black Sheep's'' negligible plot leaves them grasping for gags. _ Doug Hamilton  The Bridges  of Madison County PG-13  Probably the only thing wrong with Clint Eastwood's radiantly romantic movie is Robert James Waller's relentlessly excessive book. And even then, it's no contest. Director/star Eastwood (as the National Geographic photographer) and co-star Meryl Streep (as the unfulfilled farm wife) perform alchemy here; while adhering to whatever it was in Waller's best seller that sold all those copies, they've transformed the material into something far, far better. Rated PG-13 for sexual and adult themes.  Broken Arrow R  Air Force pilot Christian Slater goes up against his buddy John Travolta, who steals two nuclear warheads from their Stealth bomber with a plan to ransom an entire city. Basically, the movie is one long chase in the desert, as Slater teams with perky park ranger Samantha Mathis _ and tracks the bad guys on foot (that must be a small desert). Packed with implausibility, the movie should be a lot of dumb fun. But it can't decide if it's ``Indiana Jones'' or ``Fail-Safe.'' Directed by Hong Kong action czar John Woo, it's played too broadly to make us genuinely tense, but it's not over-the-top enough to make us giddy with thrills. _ Steve Murray  Casino R  The ``GoodFellas'' duo _ director Martin Scorsese and writer Nicholas Pileggi _ roll the dice a second time and come up craps. Robert De Niro plays Sam ``Ace'' Rothstein, a professional gambler who operates a Las Vegas casino from behind the scenes; Joe Pesci is a hothead hit man, and both were better in ``GoodFellas.'' Finally there's Ginger (Sharon Stone, who proves once and for all that she can act), a former hooker who becomes Sam's reluctant wife and dives into the bottle. If the movie focused more clearly on these three, ``Casino'' might hold our interest. But the whole thing feels like a retread. _ Steve Murray  City Hall R  Al Pacino reunites with ``Sea of Love'' director Harold Becker for this drama about a big city mayor juggling various civic crises and a corruption conspiracy to boot. John Cusack plays the idealistic deputy mayor.  Dead Man Walking R  In Tim Robbins' deadly earnest, intermittently powerful death-row drama, a nun (Susan Sarandon) becomes involved with a convicted murderer (Sean Penn). Both give riveting portrayals (though Penn's arrogant, racist redneck is getting most of the attention). The problem is the movie isn't really about either character. It's about an issue _ the pros and cons of the death penalty _ which means it often lapses into the message-conscious style of a '50s TV drama. Still, Robbins manages a shatteringly effective final half hour simply by showing us how capital punishment works in every gruesome and dehumanizing detail.  Dead Presidents R  A searingly fine sophomore effort by the Hughes brothers (``Menace II Society''). Like an African-Americanized ``The Deer Hunter,'' the movie follows some pals from the Bronx before, during and after their tour of duty in Vietnam. Larenz Tate is the film's indispensable anchor, but he gets fine support from Keith David, N'Bushe Wright and Bokeem Wodbine, among others. The film isn't perfect; by trying to cover so much ground, it skims certain issues, skimps on certain characters. But it's a vital and passionate look at a nation so caught up in the macho-angst of losing a war abroad that it ignored a far more important war at home. Rated R for sex, violence, nudity and language.  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960222.0162 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(3rdtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Devil in a Blue Dress R  An exercise in retro cool and a richly textured homage to cinematic flatfoots. Denzel Washington plays accidental private eye Easy Rawlins. The year is 1948, and he's approached by a tough (Tom Sizemore) who claims he's working for a mayoral candidate whose fiancee Daphne (Jennifer Beals) has gone missing. But this turns out to be much more than a missing persons case. The interesting part of ``Devil'' isn't its convoluted plot (which gets less interesting as it becomes clearer), but the smaller observations that constantly remind us of Easy's double trouble as a black man in '40s L.A. Rated R for sex, language and violence. _ Steve Murray  Don't Be a Menace  to South Central While Drinking  Your Juice in the Hood R  A vehicle for Shawn and Marlon Wayans, the two youngest members of the comic family that includes brothers Damon and Keenen Ivory. This ``Airplane!''-style parody takes broad, juvenile jabs at such urban ``message'' movies as ``Menace II Society'' and ``Boyz N the Hood.'' If not all the jokes here work, many of the ones that do have extra weight. When two characters are busted for ``being black on a Friday night'' and taken to a police station equipped with a Rodney King punch-and-kick video game, the movie turns from goofy fun to comedy that tickles and stings. _ Doug Hamilton  Dracula: Dead  and Loving It PG-13  This mildly amusing spoof of Bram Stoker's famous vampire story dies after about half an hour. Leslie Nielsen makes a commanding count in his cape and Liberace pompadour and Peter MacNicol swipes scenes as the cackling bug-eater Renfield. But there's something missing here, something that suggests writer/director Mel Brooks is either stuck in a '70s sense of outrageousness or simply lost interest somewhere in the middle of his movie. ``Dracula'' makes you worry that Mel's career may be dead and he's not loving it. Rated PG-13 for language, sex and nudity.  Dunston Checks In PG  Kids will probably go bananas over this family-friendly monkey movie. ``Seinfeld's'' Jason Alexander stars as a single father who manages a swanky New York hotel. His youngest son discovers that one of the guests, a thief masquerading as a British lord (Rupert Everett), has smuggled in an orangutan. Named Dunston, this hairy partner in crime is trained to break into rooms while his master is hobnobbing at the bar, establishing an alibi. If the movie is a bit derivative, it's solid entertainment, sparked by witty performances by Alexander, Everett and Faye Dunaway, who gives her role as the hotel owner's exacting wife just the right Leona Helmsley spin. Rated PG for language. _ Doug Hamilton  Eye for an Eye R  Sally Field stars in this taut, emotionally charged thriller about a mother seeking vengeance on the psychopath who raped and murdered her daughter. But this is more than a distaff ``Death Wish''; it's also an exploration of the toxic aftershocks of violence _ its malignant effect on a person or a family. You can tell the care director John Schlesinger (``Midnight Cowboy'') has put into the film simply by the care he's put into the casting: Ed Harris in what could have been the vanilla role of Field's husband; Joe Mantegna as the homicide detective on the case; and Kiefer Sutherland as the sneering scum who may have tangled with the wrong mom.  Father of the Bride,  Part II PG  Steve Martin's father of the bride becomes a father-to-be and a grandfather-to-be in this dumbed-down diversion that's not half as enjoyable as its 1991 predecessor. The funny parts, all of which have been revealed in the trailer (the dual pregnancies of wife Diane Keaton and daughter Kimberly Williams, Martin's midlife crisis, the return of Martin Short's egregiously effeminate party planner), just aren't that funny. However, the schmaltzy parts, near the end, work like a charm. My advice: Go with someone who is pregnant and enjoy her enjoyment. Somehow, even the dumbest pregnancy cliches seem appealing in your second trimester. Rated PG for mild adult themes and language.  From Dusk Till Dawn R  Robert Rodriguez's hyperviolent vampire flick stars scripter Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney (in a dynamic big- screen crossover) as killer bank robbers who take hostage a retired minister (Harvey Keitel) and his kids (including Juliette Lewis). Bad luck for them, these anti-heroes stop at a Mexican bar _ catering to bikers and bloodsuckers. The long opening setup is vintage Tarantino, full of bloody shocks and sick humor. But once the saloon's staff morph into vampires, ``Dusk'' heads into Sam Raimi's ``Evil Dead'' territory, complete with spewing eyeballs and severed limbs. It's an excuse for a couple of way-talented filmmakers to have gruesome fun. And for most of the time, we do, too. But the squeamish, beware. Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity. _ Steve Murray  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960222.0163 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(4thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Get Shorty R  Barry Sonnenfeld's lively adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel follows the exploits of a Miami loan shark named Chili Palmer (John Travolta) who finds out that show biz isn't all that different from shylocking when he goes to pick up a debt from a B-movie producer (Gene Hackman). Anchoring the most complicated plot since ``The Usual Suspects,'' the charming Travolta proves he's no ``Pulp Fiction'' flash in the pan. _ Steve Murray  GoldenEye PG-13  Reality never intrudes on the babes and bombs, gags and gadgets in this guilty pleasure introducing Pierce Brosnan as the new 007. Despite some P.C. lip service, it's the old things that work best, including villains left over from the Cold War (Sean Bean as a disgruntled Cossack, Famke Janssen as masochistic femme fatale Xenia Onatopp). Pitched between the no-nonsense Timothy Dalton and the inimitably courtly Sean Connery, Brosnan deserves a few more spins in the Aston-Martin. _ Steve Murray  Grumpier Old Men PG-13  They aren't really any grumpier. But stars Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are richer, thanks to the first film's success. Most of the original team is back, including Ann-Margret as Lemmon's sex-kitten wife and Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's drinking, smoking, oversexed dad. The main newcomer is Sophia Loren as the bombshell Maria who sets the men's pacemakers ticking. As far as retreads go, ``Grumpier'' is faithful to the first one's mix of slapstick, senior-level smut and schmaltz. But if the first film was Lemmon's movie, this one is Matthau's. There's a lovely sweetness in his courtship with Loren; he has the puppyish bafflement of a fellow in love for the very first time. He makes even wine in a box seem romantic. But after an hour, the movie runs out of its already meager steam. Whether you want to meander along with it depends on how you respond to Lemmon's and Matthau's patented slow burns._ Steve Murray  Happy Gilmore PG-13  ``Saturday Night Live'' alum Adam Sandler played an idiot slacker in last year's dumb-and-dumber comedy ``Billy Madison.'' In this one, he plays an idiot golfer. Is there no limit to the man's range? Bob Barker and Lee Trevino make cameos. _ Doug Hamilton  Heat R  Looks hot on paper (Al Pacino and Robert De Niro together again for the first time!), but on screen, this incoherent, overlong action flick never sputters above a pseudo- simmer. Pacino is a workaholic L.A. cop obsessed with catching De Niro, a career criminal who masterminds complex heists. The movie lasts almost three hours and the two stars spend around 10 minutes together. Maybe writer/director Michael Mann thought he was creating an existential male menopause movie masquerading as a cops and robbers drama. But watching two great actors run, jump and shoot their way through roles they would have laughed at in their Young Turk days is ultimately kind of painful. Rated R for violence, language and brief sex.  Home for the Holidays PG-13  For the holidays, there's no place like Jodie Foster's deliciously well-observed, warm-hearted comedy about one family's long day's journey into Thanksgiving night. Director Foster and her deft ensemble (headed by Holly Hunter, Anne Bancroft, Robert Downey Jr. and Charles Durning) remind us there's no one like your own flesh and blood to knock the stuffing out of you . . . and still, somehow, have you coming back for seconds. Here's one family reunion you won't want to miss. Rated PG-13 for language and adult themes.  It Takes Two PG  Mary- Kate and Ashley Olsen of TV's ``Full House'' (they shared the role of Michelle Tanner) play identical strangers _ one a streetwise New York orphan, the other a billionaire's daughter _ who scheme to switch places and get their single guardians together. Sure, it's ``The Prince and the Pauper'' meets ``The Parent Trap,'' but director Andy Tennant does absolutely the best job one can with borrowed ideas, and the Olsens are _ surprise! _ a delight, far more expressive than on ``Full House'' and very natural in their parts. Rated PG for mild adult themes. _ Doug Hamilton  Jumanji PG  Robin Williams shows us where the wild things are in this effects-laden family fantasy about a mysterious board game that can bring rhinos into your living room or turn a house into a primeval swamp. Director Joe Johnstone (``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'') knows how to thrill an audience with outsized insects or a stampede down Main Street. But the movie goes on a roll of the dice or two too long. And in-between ``plays,'' things get frankly boring. Bottom line: If you've seen the trailer, you've already seen all the best parts. And those ``best parts'' may be a little scary for littler kids. Johnston does nothing to up the ante; it's like playing Candyland instead of Monopoly. Rated PG for violence.  The Juror R  In this drab legal thriller Demi Moore is a single mom whose life becomes hell when jury duty lands her in the hands of a mob operative, who threatens her life unless she gets his boss acquitted. It's a two-hour string of implausibilities. Of course, we don't go to a thriller expecting to believe every plot twist; half the fun is seeing how outrageous the action can get while still keeping us hooked. But director Brian Gibson can't make us suspend our disbelief, and there's not a scary moment in the movie. Though he's verging on typecasting (see ``Malice''), Baldwin is a pro at playing these sexy psychopaths. But forget about Moore, who blunders through with her usual mix of plucky squared jaw and perfectly timed teardrop. She's a big drag. _ Steve Murray  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960222.0164 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(5thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Leaving Las Vegas R  ``Viva Las Vegas'' on two dozen downers and a case of Jack Black. Nicolas Cage is an alcoholic Hollywood screenwriter who pockets his severance check and heads to Vegas to drink himself to death. Elisabeth Shue is a Vegas hooker who gets hooked on his devil-may-care despair. The movie is a bit of a drunk itself _ given to self-indulgent poses and poetic pretentiousness. But Cage and Shue are willing _ and able _ to do director Mike Figgis' dirty work for him. Their terrific performances leave you feeling unclean and sober. Rated R for sex, language, nudity and drug abuse.  Mr. Holland's Opus PG  The corn is as high as an elephant's eye in this unabashedly sentimental melodrama. And guess what? The cornier it gets, the better the picture works. Richard Dreyfuss stars as a would-be composer who devotes 30 years of his life to teaching high school music students. Director Stephen Herek has shaped the film into easily absorbed TV-size chunks that are given focus and humor thanks to a solid cast and Dreyfuss' energized, razor- sharp performance. Goodbye, Mr. Chips; hello, Mr. Holland. Rated PG for mild language.  Money Train R  Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson attempt to work the same buddy magic that made their 1992 basketball comedy, ``White Men Can't Jump,'' such a hit. Here, their interplay is again easy and amusing, but the movie around them is a cliched jumble. The two play New York subway cops who also are foster brothers. Snipes is the responsible one; Harrelson's the habitual gambler with the Mom-always-liked-you-best chip on his shoulder. When Harrelson's fortunes take a downward turn (due to a laughable series of plot contrivances), he decides to reverse his loser status by robbing the subway's revenue train. Rated R for violence, language and nudity._ Doug Hamilton  Muppet Treasure Island G Kermit the Frog mans the helm of a puppet- infested frigate in this high seas sendup of the Robert Lewis Stevenson classic. On a quest for buried treasure with his stitched-together crew, including pals Fozzie and Gonzo, Kermie encounters the treacherous pirate Long John Silver (Tim Curry) as well as an island of warthogs ruled by an alluring queen (you guessed it _ Miss Piggy).  Once Upon a Time . . . When We Were Colored PG  Tim Reid directs a talented cast (headed by Al Freeman Jr. and Phylicia Rashad) in a tender, evocative film set in the postwar segregated South. Based on Clifton Taulbart's coming-of-age memoir, the movie spans three decades, celebrating the triumph of the spirit of a generation of African- Americans _ the generation after slavery and before lunch-counter sit-ins _ who never got a break coming or going. An honorable, heartfelt picture that implores us to never forget our country's past so that we may be better prepared to shape its future. Rated PG for adult themes.  Othello R  Though handsomely shot and cleanly spoken, the new film of ``Othello'' is more like ``The Iago Show.'' Kenneth Branagh plays the fellow, who connives to convince his employer, the noble Othello (a strong but distant Laurence Fishburne), that his new wife, Desdemona (Irene Jacob), is unfaithful. In a plot fueled by Iago's machinations, Othello already runs the risk of being upstaged. In director Oliver Parker's piecemeal adaptation, this imbalance is emphasized, with the terrific Branagh delivering his juicy monologues directly to the camera. Parker rigs the tale for a '90s audience with several wordless bedroom scenes (thus the R rating). But for all the heavy breathing and MTV- speed cuts, this ``Othello'' loses steam the closer it gets to its denouement. The finale feels merely unfortunate, not devastating. And that's a real tragedy. _ Steve Murray  Persuasion PG  An awesome Jane Austen adaptation, courtesy of director Roger Michell, writer Nick Dear and a splendid cast. Set in the early 19th century, the movie is both a superbly nuanced social comedy and a yearningly openhearted romantic drama. At the ripe old age of 27, Anne Elliott (Amanda Root) is facing _ gasp _ spinsterhood. Then the man she wrongly rejected years ago (a family friend insisted he lacked family and finances) comes back into her life. But can true romance overcome the idiot clutter of society's expectations and repressed emotions? Gloriously romantic yet giddily hilarious, this movie gives you a ruefully knowing smile as it sides with the wise heart. You leave the theater feeling better about everything. Rated PG for mild adult themes.  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960222.0165 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(6thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  The Postman NR  Set in the early '50s, this bittersweet tale of the unlikely friendship between the world- famous poet Pablo Neruda and Mario, an unworldly fisherman's son, is a deceptively simple film that sneaks up on you. English director Michael Radford (``White Mischief'') brings an outsider's intrigued eye to his Italian setting. But his ultimate focus is on the collision of poet and peasant and how each affects the other.  Restoration R  The Rake's Progress. Robert Downey Jr. stars in this visually sumptuous tale, set in the 1660s, when King Charles II was restored to the throne after years of Puritan austerity. Downey plays a doctor _ one more interested in whoring than healing _ who's summoned by the King (Sam Neill) to be the royal physician to the royal pooches. Things get tricky when he's told to marry the King's favorite mistress (Polly Walker) on the condition he not fall in love with her. Director Michael Hoffman has created a lavishly adorned historical pageant _ almost like a court masque commissioned by Charles _ without losing the essential simplicity and moral force of his story.  Richard III R  Bloody as hell and bloody good fun. Sir Ian McKellen and director Richard Loncraine have transferred Shakespeare's tale of unruly royals doing rotten things to one another to 1930s England. The cast is a who's who of Britain's best (along with Americans Annette Bening and Robert Downey Jr.), but the crown jewel is Richard himself, played by McKellan as a magnificent media-savvy monster, as unctuous as he is unrepentant. This is a dazzling film, vividly imagined and breathtakingly performed. Everyone involved has done themselves proud, creating a ``Richard'' for the 1990s and the 1590s. If only all movies, Shakespeare adaptations or not, could be this self-confidently full-of-themselves in both concept and content.  Sabrina PG  The difference between the original ``Sabrina,'' a minor Billy Wilder film meant as a shameless showcase for Audrey Hepburn, and Sydney Pollack's remake isn't a matter of Hepburn vs. her replacement, Julia Ormond. It's a matter of Hepburn vs. Harrison Ford. He takes the Humphrey Bogart role of a sour tycoon who steps in when the chauffeur's daughter (Ormond) threatens to distract his easily distracted younger brother (a funny Greg Kinnear) from his impending marriage/corporate merger. The first film was about Hepburn's transformation; this one is about Ford's. It gives it a more serious tone, but it also makes it more satisfying.  Screamers R  ``Howlers'' is more like it. Set on a remote mining planet in 2078, the sci-fi would-be-thriller pits human residents (including Peter Weller and Jennifer Rubin) against killer, saw- armed robots named Screamers; they burrow underground, kill anything that moves, and have learned how to reproduce. It's a cool idea. But the movie is mired in cliches and swipes from better movies (``Tremors,'' ``Aliens,'' ``The Thing,'' etc.). The movie's truly unique moments are memorable for their stupidity. You know you're in trouble when the moments meant to provoke gasps get giggles instead. Rated R for violence, language and brief nudity. _ Steve Murray  Sense and Sensibility PG  This dazzling Jane Austen adaptation is one of the year's best and a sure-fire Oscar contender. Emma Thompson (who wrote the script) and Kate Winslet (``Heavenly Creatures'') co- star as penniless sisters trying to make their way among the sensible and the senseless in late 18th-century England. Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant and Greg Wise are suitors (of varying and changeable degrees of suitability). The unlikely director is Ang Lee (``Eat Drink Man Woman''), who has delivered a gorgeous film brimming with humor, romance and intelligence _ one that, on its own terms, is as fraught with peril and incident as a Spielberg thrill-flick. Score one for the good guys (and good gals.) And get your Oscar score card ready. Rated PG for mild adult themes.  Seven R  The creative serial killer in this self-conscious gibberish models his gruesome murders after each of the seven deadly sins. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are the cops out to stop him, but there's not much they can do to rescue this one-gimmick movie from quickly wearing out its one gimmick. Rated R for violence and language.  Sudden Death R  In this dumb-and-dumber knockoff of ``Die Hard'' (that's meant as a compliment), Jean-Claude Van Damme is the one-man cavalry who must save a stadium full of hockey fans from a madman (Powers Boothe) who's wired the place to blow up if he doesn't get a zillion-billion dollars. The movie is nonstop, state-of-the-art, over-the-top Hollywood hokum. And that's meant as a compliment, too. Rated R for violence and language.

A reformed mobster (Andy Garcia) brings his old crew back together to pull one last job for his ex-boss (Christopher Walken).  Tom and Huck G  A straightforward, well-played adaptation of Mark Twain's classic ``The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.'' Director Peter Hewitt doesn't do much to capture Twain's tone, but he wisely stays out of the way of the story. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is initially too TV-cute as Tom, and Brad Renfro's Huck has been sanitized into a 19th-century homeless boy who just needs to be loved. But they both grow on you. One nice touch: This film's Becky Thatcher is a full head taller than Tom.  Toy Story G  A knockout. The first feature to be fully computer-generated, the all-ages comedy taps our childhood fantasies about the lives toys lead when the bedroom door closes. And it injects grown-up humor by making these Mr. Potato Heads and Slinky Dogs as psychologically diverse as any human. As neurotic as they are nice, the toys fret about their young owner Andy's birthday party, worried about getting edged out by a super-duper new toy. Longtime fave cowboy Woody (voice by Tom Hanks) gets upstaged by newcomer Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), a gleaming plastic hero. In this mock epic, Woody and Buzz go out into the ``real world,'' where they scamper beneath 18-wheelers, flee a toothy canine and survive the sadistic antics of the kid next door. Four years in the making, the film is a jaw- dropping spectacle, with one bravura sequence topping the one before. Give it five minutes, and this laugh-out-loud delight can turn the scroogiest Scrooge into a happy kid. _ Steve Murray  12 Monkeys R  Terry Gilliam's despair- laced fantasy gets under your skin _ even when you don't exactly know what's going on. Bruce Willis stars as Cole, who claims to be a time traveler from the year 2035. He's sent back to 1996 to discover the cause of a plague that has wiped out 5 billion people. Is he really from the future, or is he insane _ as one psychiatrist (Madeleine Stowe) thinks? As in Gilliam's other films (``Time Bandits,'' ``The Fisher King''), story and emotion come second to visual design and mood, and at times the movie could use a stronger sense of drama and momentum. Still, there's nothing else like it on screen right now. For its strange, spooky visual poetry, ``Monkeys'' is a barrel of glum fun. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  Two If by Sea R  A negligible, slightly amusing caper comedy that proves Sandra Bullock's first-rate charm can prop up second-rate material. She and Denis Leary play a bickering blue-collar couple who've stolen a painting. Arriving at Cape Cod a few days before their scheduled rendezvous with the mysterious buyer, they decide to enjoy the good life and ``house-sit'' a seaside mansion. Leary wrote the script, which includes flashes of his acerbic, off-kilter wit, but mostly the movie doesn't have enough heft, comedic or romantic. A good rentable.  Vampire in Brooklyn R  An anemic hybrid of laughs and jolts, Wes Craven's movie stars Eddie Murphy as the vampire Maximillian, who comes to New York with an unplaceable accent and a wardrobe somewhere between Vincent Price and Sunset Boulevard pimp. He's seeking Rita (Angela Bassett), a cop who doesn't realize she's got vampire blood in her veins. Mixing gross-out humor, some sex, some violence, the movie never decides whether it's a comedy, a thriller, a romance _ what? Likewise, Murphy (the hero? the villain?) is stranded, posing in his threads like an International Male model. He also plays a couple of minor characters, and his scene as a Sharpton-like preacher who convinces his flock that ``evil is good'' is one of the few moments when the movie comes alive. Otherwise, it's undead all the way. _ Steve Murray  Waiting to Exhale R  A breath of fresh air. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon play friends in this glossy, well-acted adaptation of Terry McMillan's best seller. Forest Whitaker, better known for his acting in ``Bird'' and ``The Crying Game,'' provides the expert direction. And as for the reported ``male bashing,'' before you take your man, simply ask yourself, is he man enough to take it? Whitaker is. And he's man enough to dish it out, too. Rated R for sex, language and adult themes.  White Squall R  To get to the title storm (and it's a doozy) you have to wade through 90 minutes of a by-the-numbers script that wants to be ``Dead Poets Society'' on water. Based on a true story, ``Squall'' follows 13 high school boys in 1960, sailing for a year in the Albatross. They're skippered by gruff Christopher Sheldon (Jeff Bridges), a sort of growling surfer-Ahab. At first, the film conjures the muscle-stretching sense of hard work, raw sunlight, sweat and brine, and director Ridley Scott captures the menacing beauty of the ocean. But then the script kicks in and drowns in cliche, including the usual rites-of-passage (in exotic ports, the boys get drunk, get laid, get the clap). When the title storm finally hits, you'll be glad for the special effects _ but left unmoved by the fate of those who die. _ Steve Murray .

He plays the commander of a nuclear submarine who must deal with a woefully undisciplined crew. Lauren Holly and Rob Schneider co-star.  Dunston Checks In PG  Kids will probably go bananas over this family-friendly monkey movie. ``Seinfeld's'' Jason Alexander stars as a single father who manages a swanky New York hotel. His youngest son discovers that one of the guests, a thief masquerading as a British lord (Rupert Everett), has smuggled in an orangutan. Named Dunston, this hairy partner in crime is trained to break into rooms while his master is hobnobbing at the bar, establishing an alibi. If the movie is a bit derivative, it's solid entertainment, sparked by witty performances by Alexander, Everett and Faye Dunaway, who gives her role as the hotel owner's exacting wife just the right Leona Helmsley spin. Rated PG for language. _ Doug Hamilton  Father of the Bride,  Part II PG  Steve Martin's father of the bride becomes a father-to-be and a grandfather-to-be in this dumbed-down diversion that's not half as enjoyable as its 1991 predecessor. The funny parts, all of which have been revealed in the trailer (the dual pregnancies of wife Diane Keaton and daughter Kimberly Williams, Martin's midlife crisis, the return of Martin Short's egregiously effeminate party planner), just aren't that funny. However, the schmaltzy parts, near the end, work like a charm. My advice: Go with someone who is pregnant and enjoy her enjoyment. Somehow, even the dumbest pregnancy cliches seem appealing in your second trimester. Rated PG for mild adult themes and language.  French Twist R  A harmless sex farce that winds down into dreary political correctness. Chief asset: luminous Victoria Abril as Loli, a housewife whose husband Laurent (Alain Chabat) cheats on her left and right. So Loli falls for a handsome plumber. The twist? The plumber is Marijo, and she's a lesbian (played by writer-director Josiane Balasko). Slapstick one minute, melodrama the next, the movie never finds a consistent tone. It exhausts itself trying to prove its thesis that sexual attraction and pure love have nothing to do with gender. Rated R for nudity and Sexual situations. In French with subtitles. _ Steve Murray  From Dusk Till Dawn R  Robert Rodriguez's hyperviolent vampire flick stars scripter Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney (in a dynamic big-screen crossover) as killer bank robbers who take hostage a retired minister (Harvey Keitel) and his kids (including Juliette Lewis).

Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity. _ Steve Murray  Get Shorty R  Barry Sonnenfeld's lively adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel follows the exploits of a Miami loan shark named Chili Palmer (John Travolta) who finds out that show biz isn't all that different from shylocking when he goes to pick up a debt from a B-movie producer (Gene Hackman).

When his grandmother's house is repossessed by the IRS, he joins the pro golf circuit to make money to buy it back.

When Harrelson's fortunes take a downward turn (due to a laughable series of plot contrivances), he decides to reverse his loser status by robbing the subway's revenue train. Rated R for violence, language and nudity._ Doug Hamilton  Once Upon a Time . . . When We Were Colored PG  Tim Reid directs a talented cast (headed by Al Freeman Jr. and Phylicia Rashad) in a tender, evocative film set in the postwar segregated South. Based on Clifton Taulbart's coming-of-age memoir, the movie spans three decades, celebrating the triumph of the spirit of a generation of African-Americans _ the generation after slavery and before lunch-counter sit-ins _ who never got a break coming or going. An honorable, heartfelt picture that implores us to never forget our country's past so that we may be better prepared to shape its future. Rated PG for adult themes.  Othello R  Though handsomely shot and cleanly spoken, the new film of ``Othello'' is more like ``The Iago Show.'' Kenneth Branagh plays the fellow, who connives to convince his employer, the noble Othello (a strong but distant Laurence Fishburne), that his new wife, Desdemona (Irene Jacob), is unfaithful. In a plot fueled by Iago's machinations, Othello already runs the risk of being upstaged. In director Oliver Parker's piecemeal adaptation, this imbalance is emphasized, with the terrific Branagh delivering his juicy monologues directly to the camera. Parker rigs the tale for a '90s audience with several wordless bedroom scenes (thus the R rating). But for all the heavy breathing and MTV-speed cuts, this ``Othello'' loses steam the closer it gets to its denouement. The finale feels merely unfortunate, not devastating. And that's a real tragedy. _ Steve Murray  Persuasion PG  An awesome Jane Austen adaptation, courtesy of director Roger Michell, writer Nick Dear and a splendid cast. Set in the early 19th century, the movie is both a superbly nuanced social comedy and a yearningly openhearted romantic drama. At the ripe old age of 27, Anne Elliott (Amanda Root) is facing _ gasp - - spinsterhood. Then the man she wrongly rejected years ago (a family friend insisted he lacked family and finances) comes back into her life. But can true romance overcome the idiot clutter of society's expectations and repressed emotions? Gloriously romantic yet giddily hilarious, this movie gives you a ruefully knowing smile as it sides with the wise heart. You leave the theater feeling better about everything. Rated PG for mild adult themes.  The Postman NR  Set in the early '50s, this bittersweet tale of the unlikely friendship between the world-famous poet Pablo Neruda and Mario, an unworldly fisherman's son, is a deceptively simple film that sneaks up on you. English director Michael Radford (``White Mischief'') brings an outsider's intrigued eye to his Italian setting. But his ultimate focus is on the collision of poet and peasant and how each affects the other.  Powder PG-13  A synthetic fable. Sean Patrick Flanery plays Powder, a brilliant albino what's-it found in a basement. Taken in by the local orphanage, he runs into the predictable: tough older boys, giggling schoolgirls, angry parents. Trudging toward the inevitable plot points (Powder teaches that hunting isn't nice, that big boys shouldn't pick on smaller ones), the movie wastes Mary Steenburgen as the orphanage's concerned director. Flanery plays Powder with a sparrowlike gentleness, but he's playing a concept, not a character; Powder's talents are hopelessly vague, a mix of megawatts and telekinesis. And director Victor Salva is so busy being ``sensitive,'' he saps any life out of the premise. _ Steve Murray  Restoration R  The Rake's Progress. Robert Downey Jr. stars in this visually sumptuous tale, set in the 1660s, when King Charles II was restored to the throne after years of Puritan austerity. Downey plays a doctor _ one more interested in whoring than healing _ who's summoned by the King (Sam Neill) to be the royal physician to the royal pooches. Things get tricky when he's told to marry the King's favorite mistress (Polly Walker) on the condition he not fall in love with her. Director Michael Hoffman has created a lavishly adorned historical pageant _ almost like a court masque commissioned by Charles _ without losing the essential simplicity and moral force of his story.  Richard III R  Bloody as hell and bloody good fun. Sir Ian McKellen and director Richard Loncraine have transferred Shakespeare's tale of unruly royals doing rotten things to one another to 1930s England. The cast is a who's who of Britain's best (along with Americans Annette Bening and Robert Downey Jr.), but the crown jewel is Richard himself, played by McKellan as a magnificent media-savvy monster, as unctuous as he is unrepentant. This is a dazzling film, vividly imagined and breathtakingly performed. Everyone involved has done themselves proud, creating a ``Richard'' for the 1990s and the 1590s. If only all movies, Shakespeare adaptations or not, could be this self- confidently full-of-themselves in both concept and content.

It's a matter of Hepburn vs. Harrison Ford. He takes the Humphrey Bogart role of a sour tycoon who steps in when the chauffeur's daughter (Ormond) threatens to distract his easily distracted younger brother (a funny Greg Kinnear) from his impending marriage/ corporate merger. The first film was about Hepburn's transformation; this one is about Ford's. It gives it a more serious tone, but it also makes it more satisfying.  Screamers R  ``Howlers'' is more like it. Set on a remote mining planet in 2078, the sci-fi would-be-thriller pits human residents (including Peter Weller and Jennifer Rubin) against killer, saw- armed robots named Screamers; they burrow underground, kill anything that moves, and have learned how to reproduce. It's a cool idea. But the movie is mired in cliches and swipes from better movies (``Tremors,'' ``Aliens,'' ``The Thing,'' etc.). The movie's truly unique moments are memorable for their stupidity. You know you're in trouble when the moments meant to provoke gasps get giggles instead. Rated R for violence, language and brief nudity. _ Steve Murray  Sense and Sensibility PG  This dazzling Jane Austen adaptation is one of the year's best and a sure-fire Oscar contender. Emma Thompson (who wrote the script) and Kate Winslet (``Heavenly Creatures'') co- star as penniless sisters trying to make their way among the sensible and the senseless in late 18th-century England. Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant and Greg Wise are suitors (of varying and changeable degrees of suitability). The unlikely director is Ang Lee (``Eat Drink Man Woman''), who has delivered a gorgeous film brimming with humor, romance and intelligence _ one that, on its own terms, is as fraught with peril and incident as a Spielberg thrill-flick. Score one for the good guys (and good gals.) And get your Oscar score card ready. Rated PG for mild adult themes.  Seven R  The creative serial killer in this self-conscious gibberish models his gruesome murders after each of the seven deadly sins. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are the cops out to stop him, but there's not much they can do to rescue this one-gimmick movie from quickly wearing out its one gimmick. Rated R for violence and language.  Sudden Death R  In this dumb-and-dumber knockoff of ``Die Hard'' (that's meant as a compliment), Jean-Claude Van Damme is the one-man cavalry who must save a stadium full of hockey fans from a madman (Powers Boothe) who's wired the place to blow up if he doesn't get a zillion-billion dollars. The movie is nonstop, state-of-the-art, over-the-top Hollywood hokum. And that's meant as a compliment, too. Rated R for violence and language.  Things to Do in Denver  When You're Dead R  Reportedly, this bizarrely titled crime flick suffers from acute Tarantino-itis. A reformed mobster (Andy Garcia) brings his old crew back together to pull one last job for his ex-boss (Christopher Walken).  To Die For R  Nicole Kidman gives a breakthrough performance as a psychopathic Jane Pauley wannabe in this wickedly hilarious look at TV- spawned celebrity obsession. Gus Van Sant's direction is pitch perfect, as are his actors, led by Matt Dillon as Kidman's lunkhead hubby and Wayne Knight as the manager of the cable TV station where she's employed as an, um, weatherperson. The movie isn't profound, but it catches, with uncanny accuracy, a startling moment in our nation's Geraldo-ized psyche. Like some '90s Norma Desmond, Kidman's ready for her close-up, Mr. Bochco. Rated R for sex and language.

Julie Newmar PG-13  Perhaps the most shocking thing about this drag-queen comedy is how very unshocking it is. When their car breaks down en route to Hollywood, a trio of Manhattan transvestites _ twinkly, maternal Vida (Patrick Swayze), sassy, smart-mouthed Noxema (Wesley Snipes), and hot-to-trot Chi Chi (John Leguizama) _ give a mega-make-over to residents of a drab town. This whole movie could use a make-over.  Tom and Huck G  A straightforward, well-played adaptation of Mark Twain's classic ``The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.'' Director Peter Hewitt doesn't do much to capture Twain's tone, but he wisely stays out of the way of the story. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is initially too TV-cute as Tom, and Brad Renfro's Huck has been sanitized into a 19th-century homeless boy who just needs to be loved. But they both grow on you. One nice touch: This film's Becky Thatcher is a full head taller than Tom.  Toy Story G  A knockout. The first feature to be fully computer-generated, the all-ages comedy taps our childhood fantasies about the lives toys lead when the bedroom door closes. And it injects grown-up humor by making these Mr. Potato Heads and Slinky Dogs as psychologically diverse as any human. As neurotic as they are nice, the toys fret about their young owner Andy's birthday party, worried about getting edged out by a super-duper new toy. Longtime fave cowboy Woody (voice by Tom Hanks) gets upstaged by newcomer Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), a gleaming plastic hero. In this mock epic, Woody and Buzz go out into the ``real world,'' where they scamper beneath 18-wheelers, flee a toothy canine and survive the sadistic antics of the kid next door. Four years in the making, the film is a jaw-dropping spectacle, with one bravura sequence topping the one before. Give it five minutes, and this laugh-out-loud delight can turn the scroogiest Scrooge into a happy kid. _ Steve Murray  12 Monkeys R  Terry Gilliam's despair-laced fantasy gets under your skin _ even when you don't exactly know what's going on. Bruce Willis stars as Cole, who claims to be a time traveler from the year 2035. He's sent back to 1996 to discover the cause of a plague that has wiped out 5 billion people. Is he really from the future, or is he insane _ as one psychiatrist (Madeleine Stowe) thinks? As in Gilliam's other films (``Time Bandits,'' ``The Fisher King''), story and emotion come second to visual design and mood, and at times the movie could use a stronger sense of drama and momentum. Still, there's nothing else like it on screen right now. For its strange, spooky visual poetry, ``Monkeys'' is a barrel of glum fun. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  Two Bits PG-13  Two bits is about all this picture is worth _ and these days, 25 cents doesn't buy you a whole of movie. In Depression-era South Philly, the movie focuses on the relationship between young Gennaro (Jerry Barone) and his dying grandfather (a latex-laden Al Pacino). Meant as an affectionate nostalgia piece, the movie gets so choked up on its own chiaroscuro-drenched reveries that the audience feels shut out.  Two If by Sea R  A negligible, slightly amusing caper comedy that proves Sandra Bullock's first-rate charm can prop up second-rate material. She and Denis Leary play a bickering blue-collar couple who've stolen a painting. Arriving at Cape Cod a few days before their scheduled rendezvous with the mysterious buyer, they decide to enjoy the good life and ``house-sit'' a seaside mansion. Leary wrote the script, which includes flashes of his acerbic, off-kilter wit, but mostly the movie doesn't have enough heft, comedic or romantic. A good rentable.  The Usual Suspects R  A crafty crime thriller you'll want to watch twice. Told mainly in flashbacks, it unravels the tale of five crooks (including Kevin Spacey, Stephen Baldwin and Gabriel Byrne) and a messed-up drug deal that left all but one of them dead. But solving this mystery isn't nearly as simple as it looks. Part hard-boiled ``Rashomon,'' part cinematic con game, ``Suspects'' keeps pulling the rug out from under you. It demands (and rewards) close attention. Don't be surprised if you feel like watching it a second time _ not because you're confused, but just to savor the screenplay's twists and red herrings. It's anything but usual. Rated R for language and violence. _ Steve Murray  Vampire in Brooklyn R  An anemic hybrid of laughs and jolts, Wes Craven's movie stars Eddie Murphy as the vampire Maximillian, who comes to New York with an unplaceable accent and a wardrobe somewhere between Vincent Price and Sunset Boulevard pimp. He's seeking Rita (Angela Bassett), a cop who doesn't realize she's got vampire blood in her veins. Mixing gross-out humor, some sex, some violence, the movie never decides whether it's a comedy, a thriller, a romance _ what? Likewise, Murphy (the hero? the villain?) is stranded, posing in his threads like an International Male model. He also plays a couple of minor characters, and his scene as a Sharpton-like preacher who convinces his flock that ``evil is good'' is one of the few moments when the movie comes alive. Otherwise, it's undead all the way. _ Steve Murray  Waiting to Exhale R  A breath of fresh air. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon play friends in this glossy, well-acted adaptation of Terry McMillan's best seller. Forest Whitaker, better known for his acting in ``Bird'' and ``The Crying Game,'' provides the expert direction. And as for the reported ``male bashing,'' before you take your man, simply ask yourself, is he man enough to take it? Whitaker is. And he's man enough to dish it out, too. Rated R for sex, language and adult themes.  White Squall R  To get to the title storm (and it's a doozy) you have to wade through 90 minutes of a by-the-numbers script that wants to be ``Dead Poets Society'' on water. Based on a true story, ``Squall'' follows 13 high school boys in 1960, sailing for a year in the Albatross. They're skippered by gruff Christopher Sheldon (Jeff Bridges), a sort of growling surfer-Ahab. At first, the film conjures the muscle-stretching sense of hard work, raw sunlight, sweat and brine, and director Ridley Scott captures the menacing beauty of the ocean. But then the script kicks in and drowns in cliche, including the usual rites- of-passage (in exotic ports, the boys get drunk, get laid, get the clap). When the title storm finally hits, you'll be glad for the special effects _ but left unmoved by the fate of those who die. _ Steve Murray .

They move weekly to clients of the New York Times News Service.  G: General audiences. Nothing that would offend parents if viewed by children.  PG: Parental guidance suggested. May contain some material parents consider inappropriate for young children.  PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for preteens.  R: Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking children.  NC-17: No one under 17 admitted. Replaces the X rating.  NR: Not rated.  Ace Ventura: When  Nature Calls PG-13  All-l-l-RIIIGHTY then. An Ace Ventura sequel was inevitable. Hence this `` . . . and dumber'' follow-up to Jim Carrey's supremely dumb ``Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.'' This time, our intrepid sleuth and animal lover is in deepest, darkest Africa, trying to locate a missing sacred animal and thus prevent tribal warfare. Yes, it's vulgar. Yes, it's idiotic. But what were you expecting? Ace Ventura in ``Schindler's List II''? As purely silly movies go, this one is aces. Rated PG-13 for vulgarity, language and sexual innuendo.  Angels &AMP; Insects R  Sins and sensibility form the core of this mordant bit of inner-rot Victoriana. Based on a novel by A.S. Byatt, this elegant and subversive film is set on an English country estate in 1862, belonging to the aristocratic Alabasters. A poor naturalist is invited there by the family patriarch (he dabbles in Darwin) and falls for their eldest daughter. Director Philip Haas and his fine cast (headed by Mark Rylance, Patsy Kensit and Kristin Scott Thomas) adapt a tone of wicked fastidiousness while Paul Brown's costumes suggest something out of an entomological opera. A film that floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. Not rated, but there is graphic sex, nudity and adult themes.  Babe G  A best picture Oscar nominee. Pig out on this delightfully screwball movie about a piglet who thinks he's a sheepdog. Real-life animals carry the bulk of the story, but they get some high-tech help from computer graphics and superbly lifelike animatronic stand-ins created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Voice talent Christine Cavanaugh as Babe and Miriam Margolyes (``The Age of Innocence'') as Fly, Babe's adopted border collie mom.  The Birdcage PG-13  Incorrigible cutups Robin Williams and Nathan Lane mug their way through this American adaptation of the French farce ``La Cage aux Folles.'' They play a gay couple who masquerade as man and wife to fool their son's future in-laws. Lane dons the dress.  Balto G  A beautifully executed, edge-of-your-seat exciting animated adventure. The full-mush story is based on the true-life journey of a heroic sled dog named Balto who brought the anti-diphtheria serum to Nome, Alaska, in 1925, thus saving the lives of hundreds of children. A tale of perseverance, courage, tolerance and puppy love, the movie's all-star cast of voices includes Kevin Bacon, Bridget Fonda, Bob Hoskins and Phil Collins.  Beautiful Girls R  A perceptive, humorous look at relationships and the late-20s blues in a working-class town in western Massachusetts. Timothy Hutton heads a strong ensemble cast as a Manhattan pianist who returns home for his high school reunion. Matt Dillon, Michael Rapaport, Max Perlich and Noah Emmerich are his pals; Mira Sorvino, Annabeth Gish, Lauren Holly, Rosie O'Donnell, Uma Thurman and a scene-stealing Natalie Portman are the girls in and out of their lives. The movie doesn't accomplish everything it sets out to, but if it misses ``The Big Chill,'' it still delivers some salient shivers about growing up. Rated R for language and adult themes.  Bed of Roses PG  A small hooray to Christian Slater and Mary Stuart Masterson for lending their star power to this slight modern romance about a career woman who needs to stop and smell the (bed of) roses and the Prince Charming who wants to show her how. Unfortunately, writer-director Michael Goldenberg sets up his two attracted opposites and then really doesn't know what to do with them. We're left with a sweet nothing of a movie that promises more than it delivers. Rated PG for mild adult themes.  Before and After PG-13  Before their teenage son (Edward Furlong) is accused of murder, the Ryans (Meryl Streep and Liam Neeson) are a well-heeled, respectable New England couple. After the accusation, they are worried-sick parents, small-town pariahs, amateur lawyers, sometime sleuths, etc. Barbet Schroeder (``Reversal of Fortune'') has made a solid, intelligent film that is less about a murder mystery than about a marriage on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Alas, his careful pacing and the stars' restrained performances are undermined by a tell-all trailer and an uneven script. Still, Streep and Neeson are wonderful to watch as they show us how easily normality can slip into a nightmare. Rated PG-13 for violence, language and adult themes.  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960306.0114 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(2ndtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Black Sheep PG-13  It appears that David Spade and Chris Farley are aiming to be the Abbott and Costello of the '90s. In this, their second big-screen vehicle together (following the amusing 1995 hit ``Tommy Boy''), the pair continue to chase a classic comedy team formula. At times, they evoke the spirit of Bud and Lou, superficially at least, but their shtick just ain't classic yet, and ``Black Sheep's'' negligible plot leaves them grasping for gags. _ Doug Hamilton  Bottle Rocket R  Low-budget comedy about three buddies _ played by Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson and Bob Musgrave _ who decide they want to be thieves. James Caan plays a shady character whom the trio considers a role model.  Braveheart R  As did ``Spartacus'' and ``Dances With Wolves,'' Mel Gibson's tumultuously entertaining epic extols such old-fashioned virtues as honor, freedom, principle, loyalty and romantic love. Gibson, who also directed, plays William Wallace, a bonnie 13th-century Scotsman who gave the English hell for the hash they tried to make out of his homeland. Rated R for brief nudity and extreme violence. Nominated for 10 Academy Awards.  Broken Arrow R  Air Force pilot Christian Slater goes up against his buddy John Travolta, who steals two nuclear warheads from their Stealth bomber with a plan to ransom an entire city. Basically, the movie is one long chase in the desert, as Slater teams with perky park ranger Samantha Mathis _ and tracks the bad guys on foot (that must be a small desert). Packed with implausibility, the movie should be a lot of dumb fun. But it can't decide if it's ``Indiana Jones'' or ``Fail-Safe.'' Directed by Hong Kong action czar John Woo, it's played too broadly to make us genuinely tense, but it's not over- the-top enough to make us giddy with thrills. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  Casino R  The ``GoodFellas'' duo _ director Martin Scorsese and writer Nicholas Pileggi _ roll the dice a second time and come up craps. Robert De Niro plays Sam ``Ace'' Rothstein, a professional gambler who operates a Las Vegas casino from behind the scenes; Joe Pesci is a hothead hit man, and both were better in ``GoodFellas.'' Finally there's Ginger (Golden Globe winner Sharon Stone, who proves once and for all that she can act), a former hooker who becomes Sam's reluctant wife and dives into the bottle. If the movie focused more clearly on these three, ``Casino'' might hold our interest. But the whole thing feels like a retread. _ Steve Murray  City Hall R  The killing of a 6-year-old boy in a shootout between a cop and a drug dealer kicks off this urban expose of civic corruption. John Cusack plays deputy to New York mayor Al Pacino, but all his spin-doctoring can't cease the public outcry when word leaks that the cop may be crooked and the crook may have gotten a suspiciously lax probation. The movie cooks as it shows how political deals go down in greasy spoons and Broadway lobbies. But as Kevin's investigation leads him toward the courtroom of a venerable judge (Martin Landau), gritty verisimilitude gives way to standard thriller cliche. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  Dead Man Walking R  In Tim Robbins' deadly earnest, intermittently powerful death-row drama, a nun (Susan Sarandon) becomes involved with a convicted murderer (Sean Penn). Both give riveting portrayals (though Penn's arrogant, racist redneck is getting most of the attention). The problem is the movie isn't really about either character. It's about an issue _ the pros and cons of the death penalty _ which means it often lapses into the message-conscious style of a '50s TV drama. Still, Robbins manages a shatteringly effective final half hour simply by showing us how capital punishment works in every gruesome and dehumanizing detail. Robbins, Sarandon and Penn are all nominated for Oscars.  Dead Presidents R  A searingly fine sophomore effort by the Hughes brothers (``Menace II Society''). Like an African-Americanized ``The Deer Hunter,'' the movie follows some pals from the Bronx before, during and after their tour of duty in Vietnam. Larenz Tate is the film's indispensable anchor, but he gets fine support from Keith David, N'Bushe Wright and Bokeem Wodbine, among others. The film isn't perfect; by trying to cover so much ground, it skims certain issues, skimps on certain characters. But it's a vital and passionate look at a nation so caught up in the macho-angst of losing a war abroad that it ignored a far more important war at home. Rated R for sex, violence, nudity and language.  Don't Be a Menace  to South Central While Drinking  Your Juice in the Hood R  A vehicle for Shawn and Marlon Wayans, the two youngest members of the comic family that includes brothers Damon and Keenen Ivory. This ``Airplane!''-style parody takes broad, juvenile jabs at such urban ``message'' movies as ``Menace II Society'' and ``Boyz N the Hood.'' If not all the jokes here work, many of the ones that do have extra weight. When two characters are busted for ``being black on a Friday night'' and taken to a police station equipped with a Rodney King punch-and-kick video game, the movie turns from goofy fun to comedy that tickles and stings. _ Doug Hamilton  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960306.0115 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(3rdtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Down Periscope PG-13  ``Police Academy'' on a submarine. A very un-``Frasier''-like Kelsey Grammer stars as a subversive sub commander who pulls the requisite group of misfits together into a shipshape team and beats a crazed Bruce Dern at his own war game. Fans of ``Frasier'' may be dismayed by the wanton waste of Grammer's talents _ he coasts through wearing a fixed, avuncular smile _ but he doesn't disgrace himself and there are worse ways to break into movies. Think of it as a good movie for 12-year-olds of all ages.  Fargo R  The Coen brothers' latest exercise in quirkiness, this crime dramedy is said to be similar in tone to their brilliant debut, ``Blood Simple.'' Frances McDormand plays a very pregnant North Dakota police detective investigating a kidnapping that turned lethal. William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi co-star. Doug Hamilton  Father of the Bride,  Part II PG  Steve Martin's father of the bride becomes a father-to-be and a grandfather-to-be in this dumbed-down diversion that's not half as enjoyable as its 1991 predecessor. The funny parts, all of which have been revealed in the trailer (the dual pregnancies of wife Diane Keaton and daughter Kimberly Williams, Martin's midlife crisis, the return of Martin Short's egregiously effeminate party planner), just aren't that funny. However, the schmaltzy parts, near the end, work like a charm. My advice: Go with someone who is pregnant and enjoy her enjoyment. Somehow, even the dumbest pregnancy cliches seem appealing in your second trimester. Rated PG for mild adult themes and language.  French Twist R  A harmless sex farce that winds down into dreary political correctness. Chief asset: luminous Victoria Abril as Loli, a housewife whose husband Laurent (Alain Chabat) cheats on her left and right. So Loli falls for a handsome plumber. The twist? The plumber is Marijo, and she's a lesbian (played by writer-director Josiane Balasko). Slapstick one minute, melodrama the next, the movie never finds a consistent tone. It exhausts itself trying to prove its thesis that sexual attraction and pure love have nothing to do with gender. Rated R for nudity and Sexual situations. In French with subtitles. _ Steve Murray  From Dusk Till Dawn R  Robert Rodriguez's hyperviolent vampire flick stars scripter Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney (in a dynamic big-screen crossover) as killer bank robbers who take hostage a retired minister (Harvey Keitel) and his kids (including Juliette Lewis). Bad luck for them, these anti-heroes stop at a Mexican bar _ catering to bikers and bloodsuckers. The long opening setup is vintage Tarantino, full of bloody shocks and sick humor. But once the saloon's staff morph into vampires, ``Dusk'' heads into Sam Raimi's ``Evil Dead'' territory, complete with spewing eyeballs and severed limbs. It's an excuse for a couple of way-talented filmmakers to have gruesome fun. And for most of the time, we do, too. But the squeamish, beware. Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity. _ Steve Murray  Get Shorty R  Barry Sonnenfeld's lively adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel follows the exploits of a Miami loan shark named Chili Palmer (John Travolta) who finds out that show biz isn't all that different from shylocking when he goes to pick up a debt from a B-movie producer (Gene Hackman). Anchoring the most complicated plot since ``The Usual Suspects,'' the charming Travolta proves he's no ``Pulp Fiction'' flash in the pan. _ Steve Murray  GoldenEye PG-13  Reality never intrudes on the babes and bombs, gags and gadgets in this guilty pleasure introducing Pierce Brosnan as the new 007. Despite some P.C. lip service, it's the old things that work best, including villains left over from the Cold War (Sean Bean as a disgruntled Cossack, Famke Janssen as masochistic femme fatale Xenia Onatopp). Pitched between the no-nonsense Timothy Dalton and the inimitably courtly Sean Connery, Brosnan deserves a few more spins in the Aston- Martin. _ Steve Murray  Grumpier Old Men PG-13  They aren't really any grumpier. But stars Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are richer, thanks to the first film's success. Most of the original team is back, including Ann-Margret as Lemmon's sex-kitten wife and Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's drinking, smoking, oversexed dad. The main newcomer is Sophia Loren as the bombshell Maria who sets the men's pacemakers ticking. As far as retreads go, ``Grumpier'' is faithful to the first one's mix of slapstick, senior-level smut and schmaltz. But if the first film was Lemmon's movie, this one is Matthau's. There's a lovely sweetness in his courtship with Loren; he has the puppyish bafflement of a fellow in love for the very first time. He makes even wine in a box seem romantic. But after an hour, the movie runs out of its already meager steam. Whether you want to meander along with it depends on how you respond to Lemmon's and Matthau's patented slow burns._ Steve Murray  Happy Gilmore PG-13  Adam Sandler goes for the green in this slap-happy golf comedy. He plays the title role, a failed hockey player who discovers his slap shot training has given him a killer golf swing. When his grandmother's house is repossessed by the IRS, he joins the pro golf circuit to make money to buy it back. After last year's mean-spirited ``Billy Madison,'' it's nice to see Sandler display a sweet side. Too bad the movie degenerates into a by-the- numbers rewrite of ``Caddyshack.'' Rated PG-13 for language. _ Doug Hamilton  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960306.0116 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(4thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Heavy Metal R  A midnight movie hit since its release in 1981, this animated fantasy is being reissued with new prints and a digitally remastered soundtrack. The better to see all those big-breasted warrior women flying around on pterodactyls, and to hear all those moldy metal tunes by such dinosaurs as Blue Oyster Cult and Nazareth.  Home for the Holidays PG-13  For the holidays, there's no place like Jodie Foster's deliciously well- observed, warm-hearted comedy about one family's long day's journey into Thanksgiving night. Director Foster and her deft ensemble (headed by Holly Hunter, Anne Bancroft, Robert Downey Jr. and Charles Durning) remind us there's no one like your own flesh and blood to knock the stuffing out of you . . . and still, somehow, have you coming back for seconds. Here's one family reunion you won't want to miss. Rated PG-13 for language and adult themes.  If Lucy Fell R  Eric Schaeffer (``My Life's in Turnaround'') wrote and directed this romantic comedy about two friends who vow to jump from the Brooklyn Bridge if neither has found love by age 30. Starring Sarah Jessica Parker and supermodel Elle Macpherson.  It Takes Two PG  Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen of TV's ``Full House'' (they shared the role of Michelle Tanner) play identical strangers _ one a streetwise New York orphan, the other a billionaire's daughter _ who scheme to switch places and get their single guardians together. Sure, it's ``The Prince and the Pauper'' meets ``The Parent Trap,'' but director Andy Tennant does absolutely the best job one can with borrowed ideas, and the Olsens are _ surprise! _ a delight, far more expressive than on ``Full House'' and very natural in their parts. Rated PG for mild adult themes. _ Doug Hamilton  Jumanji PG  Robin Williams shows us where the wild things are in this effects-laden family fantasy about a mysterious board game that can bring rhinos into your living room or turn a house into a primeval swamp. Director Joe Johnstone (``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'') knows how to thrill an audience with outsized insects or a stampede down Main Street. But the movie goes on a roll of the dice or two too long. And in-between ``plays,'' things get frankly boring. Bottom line: If you've seen the trailer, you've already seen all the best parts. And those ``best parts'' may be a little scary for littler kids. Johnston does nothing to up the ante; it's like playing Candyland instead of Monopoly. Rated PG for violence.  The Juror R  In this drab legal thriller Demi Moore is a single mom whose life becomes hell when jury duty lands her in the hands of a mob operative, who threatens her life unless she gets his boss acquitted. It's a two-hour string of implausibilities. Of course, we don't go to a thriller expecting to believe every plot twist; half the fun is seeing how outrageous the action can get while still keeping us hooked. But director Brian Gibson can't make us suspend our disbelief, and there's not a scary moment in the movie. Though he's verging on typecasting (see ``Malice''), Baldwin is a pro at playing these sexy psychopaths. But forget about Moore, who blunders through with her usual mix of plucky squared jaw and perfectly timed teardrop. She's a big drag. _ Steve Murray  Leaving Las Vegas R  ``Viva Las Vegas'' on two dozen downers and a case of Jack Black. Oscar nominee Nicolas Cage is an alcoholic Hollywood screenwriter who pockets his severance check and heads to Vegas to drink himself to death. Oscar nominee Elisabeth Shue is a Vegas hooker who gets hooked on his devil-may-care despair. The movie is a bit of a drunk itself _ given to self-indulgent poses and poetic pretentiousness. But Cage and Shue are willing _ and able _ to do director Mike Figgis' dirty work for him. Their terrific performances leave you feeling unclean and sober. Rated R for sex, language, nudity and drug abuse.  Mary Reilly R  Julia Roberts shines despite some drab duds in this chilly reworking of the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde tale. As the title character, a housemaid for that king of mood swings, Dr. Henry Jekyll (John Malkovich), she skulks about in Victorian skirts, her complexion pasty, her beloved smile clamped into a tight frown. It's worlds away from ``Pretty Woman's'' unflappable hooker, and Roberts scores points for taking a career risk. Though Reilly was written as sort of a one-note mouse, the actress does wonders with the role, imbuing her with a heartbreaking fragility that draws us in even as the movie fights to keep us at arm's length. Rated R for violence and gore. _ Doug Hamilton  Mr. Holland's Opus PG  The corn is as high as an elephant's eye in this unabashedly sentimental melodrama. And guess what? The cornier it gets, the better the picture works. Oscar nominee Richard Dreyfuss stars as a would-be composer who devotes 30 years of his life to teaching high school music students. Director Stephen Herek has shaped the film into easily absorbed TV-size chunks that are given focus and humor thanks to a solid cast and Dreyfuss' energized, razor-sharp performance. Goodbye, Mr. Chips; hello, Mr. Holland. Rated PG for mild language.  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960306.0117 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(5thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Money Train R  Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson attempt to work the same buddy magic that made their 1992 basketball comedy, ``White Men Can't Jump,'' a hit. Here, their interplay is again easy and amusing, but the movie around them is a cliched jumble. The two play New York subway cops who also are foster brothers. Snipes is the responsible one; Harrelson's the habitual gambler with the Mom-always-liked-you- best chip on his shoulder. When Harrelson's fortunes take a downward turn (due to a laughable series of plot contrivances), he decides to reverse his loser status by robbing the subway's revenue train. Rated R for violence, language and nudity._ Doug Hamilton  Mr. Wrong PG-13  The good news: Ellen DeGeneres moves to the big screen with her angsty charms intact. The bad news: Her movie stinks. Alone on Valentine's night, she runs into a handsome investor (Bill Pullman) who seems heaven sent. Though it soon turns out to be hell. Pullman turns into a crazed, REO Speedwagon-listening, shoplifting clown, determined to wed her at any cost. But the character's about-face has no bearing on reality; it's a gimmick. The only thing worth watching is DeGeneres, drawing on her patented regimen of wary glances and nervous reactions. But instead of getting the sort of lift you get from screwball runaway-bride films of the '30s, ``Mr. Wrong'' only gives you a headache. _ Steve Murray  Muppet Treasure Island G  Yo! Ho! Ho! and a barrel of fun! The Muppets take to the high seas in this loose musical adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic adventure about pirates, buried treasure and a brave lad named Jim Hawkins (Kevin Bishop). Tim Curry co-stars as Long John Silver; he's convincing, though a bit upstaged by his felt colleagues. Kudos all 'round to the usual Mupport support team: director Brian Henson and his hands-on puppeteers, Frank Oz (Miss Piggy), former Atlantan Steve Whitmire (Kermit the Frog), David Goelz (the Great Gonzo) and Jerry Nelson and Kevin Clash as just about everyone else.  Once Upon a Time . . . When We Were Colored PG  Tim Reid directs a talented cast (headed by Al Freeman Jr. and Phylicia Rashad) in a tender, evocative film set in the postwar segregated South. Based on Clifton Taulbert's coming-of-age memoir, the movie spans three decades, celebrating the triumph of the spirit of a generation of African-Americans _ the generation after slavery and before lunch counter sit-ins _ who never got a break coming or going. An honorable, heartfelt picture that implores us to never forget our country's past so that we may be better prepared to shape its future. Rated PG for adult themes.  The Postman NR  A best picture Oscar contender. Set in the early '50s, this bittersweet tale of the unlikely friendship between the world-famous poet Pablo Neruda and Mario, an unworldly fisherman's son, is a deceptively simple film that sneaks up on you. English director Michael Radford (``White Mischief'') brings an outsider's intrigued eye to his Italian setting. But his ultimate focus is on the collision of poet and peasant and how each affects the other.  Restoration R  The Rake's Progress. Robert Downey Jr. stars in this visually sumptuous tale, set in the 1660s, when King Charles II was restored to the throne after years of Puritan austerity. Downey plays a doctor _ one more interested in whoring than healing _ who's summoned by the King (Sam Neill) to be the royal physician to the royal pooches. Things get tricky when he's told to marry the King's favorite mistress (Polly Walker) on the condition he not fall in love with her. Director Michael Hoffman has created a lavishly adorned historical pageant _ almost like a court masque commissioned by Charles _ without losing the essential simplicity and moral force of his story.  Richard III R  Bloody as hell and bloody good fun. Sir Ian McKellen and director Richard Loncraine have transferred Shakespeare's tale of unruly royals doing rotten things to one another to 1930s England. The cast is a who's who of Britain's best (along with Americans Annette Bening and Robert Downey Jr.), but the crown jewel is Richard himself, played by McKellan as a magnificent media-savvy monster, as unctuous as he is unrepentant. This is a dazzling film, vividly imagined and breathtakingly performed. Everyone involved has done themselves proud, creating a ``Richard'' for the 1990s and the 1590s. If only all movies, Shakespeare adaptations or not, could be this self-confidently full-of-themselves in both concept and content.  Rumble in the Bronx R  If you haven't seen a Jackie Chan movie, you don't kow what you've been missing. Oh boy, as Buddy Holly would say. Part Bruce Lee, part Buster Keaton, Chan flips, kicks and leaps through his films with an exuberant kung-fu foolishness that's both death-defying and comic. In this English-dubbed action romp, he plays a Hong Kong cop on vacation in the Bronx (actually, Vancouver, British Columbia) who finds himself at odds with both the local gang and some international jewel thieves. But forget the plot and dialogue and focus on the almost nonstop action. Nimble, daring and pratfall funny, Chan and his movies aren't an acquired taste; they're an instant addiction. Rated R for violence.  Sabrina PG  The difference between the original ``Sabrina,'' a minor Billy Wilder film meant as a shameless showcase for Audrey Hepburn, and Sydney Pollack's remake isn't a matter of Hepburn vs. her replacement, Julia Ormond. It's a matter of Hepburn vs. Harrison Ford. He takes the Humphrey Bogart role of a sour tycoon who steps in when the chauffeur's daughter (Ormond) threatens to distract his easily distracted younger brother (a funny Greg Kinnear) from his impending marriage/ corporate merger. The first film was about Hepburn's transformation; this one is about Ford's. It gives it a more serious tone, but it also makes it more satisfying.  Sense and Sensibility PG  This dazzling Jane Austen adaptation is one of the year's best and a contender for a best picture Oscar. Double Oscar nominee (best actress and screenplay) Emma Thompson (who wrote the script) and Kate Winslet (``Heavenly Creatures'') co-star as penniless sisters trying to make their way among the sensible and the senseless in late 18th-century England. Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant and Greg Wise are suitors (of varying and changeable degrees of suitability). The unlikely director is Ang Lee (``Eat Drink Man Woman''), who has delivered a gorgeous film brimming with humor, romance and intelligence _ one that, on its own terms, is as fraught with peril and incident as a Spielberg thrill-flick. Score one for the good guys (and good gals.) And get your Oscar score card ready. Rated PG for mild adult themes.  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960306.0118 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(6thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Seven R  The creative serial killer in this self-conscious gibberish models his gruesome murders after each of the seven deadly sins. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are the cops out to stop him, but there's not much they can do to rescue this one-gimmick movie from quickly wearing out its one gimmick. Rated R for violence and language.  Shanghai Triad R  Zhang Yimou, the world-class director of ``Raise the Red Lantern'' and ``To Live,'' has turned his astonishing talent to a rip-roaring, stylized gangster melodrama. Set in '30s Shanghai, it's the story of a gangster's moll, Bijou (Gong Li, Zhang's muse), her powerful lover and the before and after of a bloody gang war. Zhang shows us these characters and events through the wide- open eyes of a 14-year-old country kid who's been brought to the city to be trained as Bijou's personal servant. Though not as complex as some of his other films, it's still a mesmerizing exploration of innocence, corruption and the true nature of power.  Sudden Death R  In this dumb-and-dumber knockoff of ``Die Hard'' (that's meant as a compliment), Jean-Claude Van Damme is the one- man cavalry who must save a stadium full of hockey fans from a madman (Powers Boothe) who's wired the place to blow up if he doesn't get a zillion-billion dollars. The movie is nonstop, state-of-the-art, over-the-top Hollywood hokum. And that's meant as a compliment, too. Rated R for violence and language.  Tom and Huck G  A straightforward, well-played adaptation of Mark Twain's classic ``The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.'' Director Peter Hewitt doesn't do much to capture Twain's tone, but he wisely stays out of the way of the story. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is initially too TV-cute as Tom, and Brad Renfro's Huck has been sanitized into a 19th-century homeless boy who just needs to be loved. But they both grow on you. One nice touch: This film's Becky Thatcher is a full head taller than Tom.  Toy Story G  A knockout. The first feature to be fully computer-generated, the all-ages comedy taps our childhood fantasies about the lives toys lead when the bedroom door closes. And it injects grown-up humor by making these Mr. Potato Heads and Slinky Dogs as psychologically diverse as any human. As neurotic as they are nice, the toys fret about their young owner Andy's birthday party, worried about getting edged out by a super- duper new toy. Longtime fave cowboy Woody (voice by Tom Hanks) gets upstaged by newcomer Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), a gleaming plastic hero. In this mock epic, Woody and Buzz go out into the ``real world,'' where they scamper beneath 18-wheelers, flee a toothy canine and survive the sadistic antics of the kid next door. Four years in the making, the film is a jaw-dropping spectacle, with one bravura sequence topping the one before. Give it five minutes, and this laugh-out-loud delight can turn the scroogiest Scrooge into a happy kid. ``Toy Story' will receive an Oscar for special achievement. _ Steve Murray  12 Monkeys R  Terry Gilliam's despair-laced fantasy gets under your skin _ even when you don't exactly know what's going on. Bruce Willis stars as Cole, who claims to be a time traveler from the year 2035. He's sent back to 1996 to discover the cause of a plague that has wiped out 5 billion people. Is he really from the future, or is he insane _ as one psychiatrist (Madeleine Stowe) thinks? As in Gilliam's other films (``Time Bandits,'' ``The Fisher King''), story and emotion come second to visual design and mood, and at times the movie could use a stronger sense of drama and momentum. Still, there's nothing else like it on screen right now. For its strange, spooky visual poetry, ``Monkeys'' is a barrel of glum fun. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  Two If by Sea R  A negligible, slightly amusing caper comedy that proves Sandra Bullock's first-rate charm can prop up second-rate material. She and Denis Leary play a bickering blue-collar couple who've stolen a painting. Arriving at Cape Cod a few days before their scheduled rendezvous with the mysterious buyer, they decide to enjoy the good life and ``house-sit'' a seaside mansion. Leary wrote the script, which includes flashes of his acerbic, off-kilter wit, but mostly the movie doesn't have enough heft, comedic or romantic. A good rentable.  Unforgettable R  The latest from ``Last Seduction'' director John Dahl is a sci-fi film noir whodunit. Haunted by the unsolved murder of his wife, medical examiner Ray Liotta nabs a memory- retrieval formula from nerdy neurobiologist Linda Fiorentino _ and shoots up with his wife's spinal fluid to experience her last minutes (and thus unmask her killer). As Krane experiences flashbacks of his wife's last night, ``Unforgettable'' enters ``Strange Days'' territory with its visceral, first- person views of the murder. But unlike ``Days,'' it doesn't tip the scale into queasy voyeurism. His experimental bender keeps the audience as unbalanced as the doctor, but beneath the chemical gimmick the script is standard hokum, an FX-ed rehash of the wrong-man formula. A mousy Fiorentino tries to change her image but doesn't have much to play, but Liotta's obsessive performance is terrific. _ Steve Murray  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960306.0119 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(7thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Up Close and Personal PG-13  Score one for golden guy Robert Redford and golden gal Michelle Pfeiffer, who show us what star power is really about in this glossy, high-profile romance with a TV news backdrop. Pfeiffer is the raw youngster who rises from weather girl to network star; Redford is the crusty news director, oozing with integrity, who acts as her mentor (``She eats the lens'') and falls in love with her. Director Jon Avnet and writers Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne have crossed ``A Star Is Born'' with ``Broadcast News'' and come up with a movie that's not as tough or complex as it could be. But with accomplished ``lens-eaters'' like Redford and Pfeiffer on hand, it's the kind of old-fashioned love story that's infatuated audiences for decades.  Vampire in Brooklyn R  An anemic hybrid of laughs and jolts, Wes Craven's movie stars Eddie Murphy as the vampire Maximillian, who comes to New York with an unplaceable accent and a wardrobe somewhere between Vincent Price and Sunset Boulevard pimp. He's seeking Rita (Angela Bassett), a cop who doesn't realize she's got vampire blood in her veins. Mixing gross-out humor, some sex, some violence, the movie never decides whether it's a comedy, a thriller, a romance _ what? Likewise, Murphy (the hero? the villain?) is stranded, posing in his threads like an International Male model. He also plays a couple of minor characters, and his scene as a Sharpton-like preacher who convinces his flock that ``evil is good'' is one of the few moments when the movie comes alive. Otherwise, it's undead all the way. _ Steve Murray  Waiting to Exhale R  A breath of fresh air. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon play friends in this glossy, well-acted adaptation of Terry McMillan's best seller. Forest Whitaker, better known for his acting in ``Bird'' and ``The Crying Game,'' provides the expert direction. And as for the reported ``male bashing,'' before you take your man, simply ask yourself, is he man enough to take it? Whitaker is. And he's man enough to dish it out, too. Rated R for sex, language and adult themes.  White Squall R  To get to the title storm (and it's a doozy) you have to wade through 90 minutes of a by-the-numbers script that wants to be ``Dead Poets Society'' on water. Based on a true story, ``Squall'' follows 13 high school boys in 1960, sailing for a year in the Albatross. They're skippered by gruff Christopher Sheldon (Jeff Bridges), a sort of growling surfer-Ahab. At first, the film conjures the muscle-stretching sense of hard work, raw sunlight, sweat and brine, and director Ridley Scott captures the menacing beauty of the ocean. But then the script kicks in and drowns in cliche, including the usual rites-of-passage (in exotic ports, the boys get drunk, get laid, get the clap). When the title storm finally hits, you'll be glad for the special effects _ but left unmoved by the fate of those who die. _ Steve Murray .

In this, their second big-screen vehicle together (following the amusing 1995 hit ``Tommy Boy''), the pair continue to chase a classic comedy team formula. At times, they evoke the spirit of Bud and Lou, superficially at least, but their shtick just ain't classic yet, and ``Black Sheep's'' negligible plot leaves them grasping for gags. _ Doug Hamilton  Bottle Rocket R  Low-budget comedy about three buddies _ played by Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson and Bob Musgrave _ who decide they want to be thieves. James Caan plays a shady character whom the trio considers a role model.  Braveheart R  As did ``Spartacus'' and ``Dances With Wolves,'' Mel Gibson's tumultuously entertaining epic extols such old-fashioned virtues as honor, freedom, principle, loyalty and romantic love. Gibson, who also directed, plays William Wallace, a bonnie 13th-century Scotsman who gave the English hell for the hash they tried to make out of his homeland. Rated R for brief nudity and extreme violence. Nominated for 10 Academy Awards.  Broken Arrow R  Air Force pilot Christian Slater goes up against his buddy John Travolta, who steals two nuclear warheads from their Stealth bomber with a plan to ransom an entire city. Basically, the movie is one long chase in the desert, as Slater teams with perky park ranger Samantha Mathis _ and tracks the bad guys on foot (that must be a small desert). Packed with implausibility, the movie should be a lot of dumb fun. But it can't decide if it's ``Indiana Jones'' or ``Fail-Safe.'' Directed by Hong Kong action czar John Woo, it's played too broadly to make us genuinely tense, but it's not over- the-top enough to make us giddy with thrills. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  Casino R  The ``GoodFellas'' duo _ director Martin Scorsese and writer Nicholas Pileggi _ roll the dice a second time and come up craps. Robert De Niro plays Sam ``Ace'' Rothstein, a professional gambler who operates a Las Vegas casino from behind the scenes; Joe Pesci is a hothead hit man, and both were better in ``GoodFellas.'' Finally there's Ginger (Golden Globe winner Sharon Stone, who proves once and for all that she can act), a former hooker who becomes Sam's reluctant wife and dives into the bottle. If the movie focused more clearly on these three, ``Casino'' might hold our interest. But the whole thing feels like a retread. _ Steve Murray  City Hall R  The killing of a 6-year-old boy in a shootout between a cop and a drug dealer kicks off this urban expose of civic corruption. John Cusack plays deputy to New York mayor Al Pacino, but all his spin-doctoring can't cease the public outcry when word leaks that the cop may be crooked and the crook may have gotten a suspiciously lax probation. The movie cooks as it shows how political deals go down in greasy spoons and Broadway lobbies. But as Kevin's investigation leads him toward the courtroom of a venerable judge (Martin Landau), gritty verisimilitude gives way to standard thriller cliche. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  Dead Man Walking R  In Tim Robbins' deadly earnest, intermittently powerful death-row drama, a nun (Susan Sarandon) becomes involved with a convicted murderer (Sean Penn). Both give riveting portrayals (though Penn's arrogant, racist redneck is getting most of the attention). The problem is the movie isn't really about either character. It's about an issue _ the pros and cons of the death penalty _ which means it often lapses into the message-conscious style of a '50s TV drama. Still, Robbins manages a shatteringly effective final half hour simply by showing us how capital punishment works in every gruesome and dehumanizing detail. Robbins, Sarandon and Penn are all nominated for Oscars.  Dead Presidents R  A searingly fine sophomore effort by the Hughes brothers (``Menace II Society''). Like an African-Americanized ``The Deer Hunter,'' the movie follows some pals from the Bronx before, during and after their tour of duty in Vietnam. Larenz Tate is the film's indispensable anchor, but he gets fine support from Keith David, N'Bushe Wright and Bokeem Wodbine, among others. The film isn't perfect; by trying to cover so much ground, it skims certain issues, skimps on certain characters. But it's a vital and passionate look at a nation so caught up in the macho-angst of losing a war abroad that it ignored a far more important war at home. Rated R for sex, violence, nudity and language.  Don't Be a Menace  to South Central While Drinking  Your Juice in the Hood R  A vehicle for Shawn and Marlon Wayans, the two youngest members of the comic family that includes brothers Damon and Keenen Ivory. This ``Airplane!''-style parody takes broad, juvenile jabs at such urban ``message'' movies as ``Menace II Society'' and ``Boyz N the Hood.'' If not all the jokes here work, many of the ones that do have extra weight. When two characters are busted for ``being black on a Friday night'' and taken to a police station equipped with a Rodney King punch-and-kick video game, the movie turns from goofy fun to comedy that tickles and stings. _ Doug Hamilton  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960314.0186 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(3rdtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Down Periscope PG-13  ``Police Academy'' on a submarine. A very un-``Frasier''-like Kelsey Grammer stars as a subversive sub commander who pulls the requisite group of misfits together into a shipshape team and beats a crazed Bruce Dern at his own war game. Fans of ``Frasier'' may be dismayed by the wanton waste of Grammer's talents _ he coasts through wearing a fixed, avuncular smile _ but he doesn't disgrace himself and there are worse ways to break into movies. Think of it as a good movie for 12-year-olds of all ages.  Fargo R  The Coen brothers' latest exercise in quirkiness, this crime dramedy is said to be similar in tone to their brilliant debut, ``Blood Simple.'' Frances McDormand plays a very pregnant North Dakota police detective investigating a kidnapping that turned lethal. William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi co-star. Doug Hamilton  Father of the Bride,  Part II PG  Steve Martin's father of the bride becomes a father-to-be and a grandfather-to-be in this dumbed-down diversion that's not half as enjoyable as its 1991 predecessor. The funny parts, all of which have been revealed in the trailer (the dual pregnancies of wife Diane Keaton and daughter Kimberly Williams, Martin's midlife crisis, the return of Martin Short's egregiously effeminate party planner), just aren't that funny. However, the schmaltzy parts, near the end, work like a charm. My advice: Go with someone who is pregnant and enjoy her enjoyment. Somehow, even the dumbest pregnancy cliches seem appealing in your second trimester. Rated PG for mild adult themes and language.  French Twist R  A harmless sex farce that winds down into dreary political correctness. Chief asset: luminous Victoria Abril as Loli, a housewife whose husband Laurent (Alain Chabat) cheats on her left and right. So Loli falls for a handsome plumber. The twist? The plumber is Marijo, and she's a lesbian (played by writer-director Josiane Balasko). Slapstick one minute, melodrama the next, the movie never finds a consistent tone. It exhausts itself trying to prove its thesis that sexual attraction and pure love have nothing to do with gender. Rated R for nudity and Sexual situations. In French with subtitles. _ Steve Murray  From Dusk Till Dawn R  Robert Rodriguez's hyperviolent vampire flick stars scripter Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney (in a dynamic big-screen crossover) as killer bank robbers who take hostage a retired minister (Harvey Keitel) and his kids (including Juliette Lewis). Bad luck for them, these anti-heroes stop at a Mexican bar _ catering to bikers and bloodsuckers. The long opening setup is vintage Tarantino, full of bloody shocks and sick humor. But once the saloon's staff morph into vampires, ``Dusk'' heads into Sam Raimi's ``Evil Dead'' territory, complete with spewing eyeballs and severed limbs. It's an excuse for a couple of way-talented filmmakers to have gruesome fun. And for most of the time, we do, too. But the squeamish, beware. Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity. _ Steve Murray  Get Shorty R  Barry Sonnenfeld's lively adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel follows the exploits of a Miami loan shark named Chili Palmer (John Travolta) who finds out that show biz isn't all that different from shylocking when he goes to pick up a debt from a B-movie producer (Gene Hackman). Anchoring the most complicated plot since ``The Usual Suspects,'' the charming Travolta proves he's no ``Pulp Fiction'' flash in the pan. _ Steve Murray  GoldenEye PG-13  Reality never intrudes on the babes and bombs, gags and gadgets in this guilty pleasure introducing Pierce Brosnan as the new 007. Despite some P.C. lip service, it's the old things that work best, including villains left over from the Cold War (Sean Bean as a disgruntled Cossack, Famke Janssen as masochistic femme fatale Xenia Onatopp). Pitched between the no-nonsense Timothy Dalton and the inimitably courtly Sean Connery, Brosnan deserves a few more spins in the Aston- Martin. _ Steve Murray  Grumpier Old Men PG-13  They aren't really any grumpier. But stars Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are richer, thanks to the first film's success. Most of the original team is back, including Ann-Margret as Lemmon's sex-kitten wife and Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's drinking, smoking, oversexed dad. The main newcomer is Sophia Loren as the bombshell Maria who sets the men's pacemakers ticking. As far as retreads go, ``Grumpier'' is faithful to the first one's mix of slapstick, senior-level smut and schmaltz. But if the first film was Lemmon's movie, this one is Matthau's. There's a lovely sweetness in his courtship with Loren; he has the puppyish bafflement of a fellow in love for the very first time. He makes even wine in a box seem romantic. But after an hour, the movie runs out of its already meager steam. Whether you want to meander along with it depends on how you respond to Lemmon's and Matthau's patented slow burns._ Steve Murray  Happy Gilmore PG-13  Adam Sandler goes for the green in this slap-happy golf comedy. He plays the title role, a failed hockey player who discovers his slap shot training has given him a killer golf swing. When his grandmother's house is repossessed by the IRS, he joins the pro golf circuit to make money to buy it back. After last year's mean-spirited ``Billy Madison,'' it's nice to see Sandler display a sweet side. Too bad the movie degenerates into a by-the- numbers rewrite of ``Caddyshack.'' Rated PG-13 for language. _ Doug Hamilton  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960314.0187 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(4thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Heavy Metal R  A midnight movie hit since its release in 1981, this animated fantasy is being reissued with new prints and a digitally remastered soundtrack. The better to see all those big-breasted warrior women flying around on pterodactyls, and to hear all those moldy metal tunes by such dinosaurs as Blue Oyster Cult and Nazareth.  Home for the Holidays PG-13  For the holidays, there's no place like Jodie Foster's deliciously well- observed, warm-hearted comedy about one family's long day's journey into Thanksgiving night. Director Foster and her deft ensemble (headed by Holly Hunter, Anne Bancroft, Robert Downey Jr. and Charles Durning) remind us there's no one like your own flesh and blood to knock the stuffing out of you . . . and still, somehow, have you coming back for seconds. Here's one family reunion you won't want to miss. Rated PG-13 for language and adult themes.  If Lucy Fell R  Eric Schaeffer (``My Life's in Turnaround'') wrote and directed this romantic comedy about two friends who vow to jump from the Brooklyn Bridge if neither has found love by age 30. Starring Sarah Jessica Parker and supermodel Elle Macpherson.  It Takes Two PG  Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen of TV's ``Full House'' (they shared the role of Michelle Tanner) play identical strangers _ one a streetwise New York orphan, the other a billionaire's daughter _ who scheme to switch places and get their single guardians together. Sure, it's ``The Prince and the Pauper'' meets ``The Parent Trap,'' but director Andy Tennant does absolutely the best job one can with borrowed ideas, and the Olsens are _ surprise! _ a delight, far more expressive than on ``Full House'' and very natural in their parts. Rated PG for mild adult themes. _ Doug Hamilton  Jumanji PG  Robin Williams shows us where the wild things are in this effects-laden family fantasy about a mysterious board game that can bring rhinos into your living room or turn a house into a primeval swamp. Director Joe Johnstone (``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'') knows how to thrill an audience with outsized insects or a stampede down Main Street. But the movie goes on a roll of the dice or two too long. And in-between ``plays,'' things get frankly boring. Bottom line: If you've seen the trailer, you've already seen all the best parts. And those ``best parts'' may be a little scary for littler kids. Johnston does nothing to up the ante; it's like playing Candyland instead of Monopoly. Rated PG for violence.  The Juror R  In this drab legal thriller Demi Moore is a single mom whose life becomes hell when jury duty lands her in the hands of a mob operative, who threatens her life unless she gets his boss acquitted. It's a two-hour string of implausibilities. Of course, we don't go to a thriller expecting to believe every plot twist; half the fun is seeing how outrageous the action can get while still keeping us hooked. But director Brian Gibson can't make us suspend our disbelief, and there's not a scary moment in the movie. Though he's verging on typecasting (see ``Malice''), Baldwin is a pro at playing these sexy psychopaths. But forget about Moore, who blunders through with her usual mix of plucky squared jaw and perfectly timed teardrop. She's a big drag. _ Steve Murray  Leaving Las Vegas R  ``Viva Las Vegas'' on two dozen downers and a case of Jack Black. Oscar nominee Nicolas Cage is an alcoholic Hollywood screenwriter who pockets his severance check and heads to Vegas to drink himself to death. Oscar nominee Elisabeth Shue is a Vegas hooker who gets hooked on his devil-may-care despair. The movie is a bit of a drunk itself _ given to self-indulgent poses and poetic pretentiousness. But Cage and Shue are willing _ and able _ to do director Mike Figgis' dirty work for him. Their terrific performances leave you feeling unclean and sober. Rated R for sex, language, nudity and drug abuse.  Mary Reilly R  Julia Roberts shines despite some drab duds in this chilly reworking of the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde tale. As the title character, a housemaid for that king of mood swings, Dr. Henry Jekyll (John Malkovich), she skulks about in Victorian skirts, her complexion pasty, her beloved smile clamped into a tight frown. It's worlds away from ``Pretty Woman's'' unflappable hooker, and Roberts scores points for taking a career risk. Though Reilly was written as sort of a one-note mouse, the actress does wonders with the role, imbuing her with a heartbreaking fragility that draws us in even as the movie fights to keep us at arm's length. Rated R for violence and gore. _ Doug Hamilton  Mr. Holland's Opus PG  The corn is as high as an elephant's eye in this unabashedly sentimental melodrama. And guess what? The cornier it gets, the better the picture works. Oscar nominee Richard Dreyfuss stars as a would-be composer who devotes 30 years of his life to teaching high school music students. Director Stephen Herek has shaped the film into easily absorbed TV-size chunks that are given focus and humor thanks to a solid cast and Dreyfuss' energized, razor-sharp performance. Goodbye, Mr. Chips; hello, Mr. Holland. Rated PG for mild language.  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960314.0188 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(5thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Money Train R  Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson attempt to work the same buddy magic that made their 1992 basketball comedy, ``White Men Can't Jump,'' a hit. Here, their interplay is again easy and amusing, but the movie around them is a cliched jumble. The two play New York subway cops who also are foster brothers. Snipes is the responsible one; Harrelson's the habitual gambler with the Mom-always-liked-you- best chip on his shoulder. When Harrelson's fortunes take a downward turn (due to a laughable series of plot contrivances), he decides to reverse his loser status by robbing the subway's revenue train. Rated R for violence, language and nudity._ Doug Hamilton  Mr. Wrong PG-13  The good news: Ellen DeGeneres moves to the big screen with her angsty charms intact. The bad news: Her movie stinks. Alone on Valentine's night, she runs into a handsome investor (Bill Pullman) who seems heaven sent. Though it soon turns out to be hell. Pullman turns into a crazed, REO Speedwagon-listening, shoplifting clown, determined to wed her at any cost. But the character's about-face has no bearing on reality; it's a gimmick. The only thing worth watching is DeGeneres, drawing on her patented regimen of wary glances and nervous reactions. But instead of getting the sort of lift you get from screwball runaway-bride films of the '30s, ``Mr. Wrong'' only gives you a headache. _ Steve Murray  Muppet Treasure Island G  Yo! Ho! Ho! and a barrel of fun! The Muppets take to the high seas in this loose musical adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic adventure about pirates, buried treasure and a brave lad named Jim Hawkins (Kevin Bishop). Tim Curry co-stars as Long John Silver; he's convincing, though a bit upstaged by his felt colleagues. Kudos all 'round to the usual Mupport support team: director Brian Henson and his hands-on puppeteers, Frank Oz (Miss Piggy), former Atlantan Steve Whitmire (Kermit the Frog), David Goelz (the Great Gonzo) and Jerry Nelson and Kevin Clash as just about everyone else.  Once Upon a Time . . . When We Were Colored PG  Tim Reid directs a talented cast (headed by Al Freeman Jr. and Phylicia Rashad) in a tender, evocative film set in the postwar segregated South. Based on Clifton Taulbert's coming-of-age memoir, the movie spans three decades, celebrating the triumph of the spirit of a generation of African-Americans _ the generation after slavery and before lunch counter sit-ins _ who never got a break coming or going. An honorable, heartfelt picture that implores us to never forget our country's past so that we may be better prepared to shape its future. Rated PG for adult themes.  The Postman NR  A best picture Oscar contender. Set in the early '50s, this bittersweet tale of the unlikely friendship between the world-famous poet Pablo Neruda and Mario, an unworldly fisherman's son, is a deceptively simple film that sneaks up on you. English director Michael Radford (``White Mischief'') brings an outsider's intrigued eye to his Italian setting. But his ultimate focus is on the collision of poet and peasant and how each affects the other.  Restoration R  The Rake's Progress. Robert Downey Jr. stars in this visually sumptuous tale, set in the 1660s, when King Charles II was restored to the throne after years of Puritan austerity. Downey plays a doctor _ one more interested in whoring than healing _ who's summoned by the King (Sam Neill) to be the royal physician to the royal pooches. Things get tricky when he's told to marry the King's favorite mistress (Polly Walker) on the condition he not fall in love with her. Director Michael Hoffman has created a lavishly adorned historical pageant _ almost like a court masque commissioned by Charles _ without losing the essential simplicity and moral force of his story.  Richard III R  Bloody as hell and bloody good fun. Sir Ian McKellen and director Richard Loncraine have transferred Shakespeare's tale of unruly royals doing rotten things to one another to 1930s England. The cast is a who's who of Britain's best (along with Americans Annette Bening and Robert Downey Jr.), but the crown jewel is Richard himself, played by McKellan as a magnificent media-savvy monster, as unctuous as he is unrepentant. This is a dazzling film, vividly imagined and breathtakingly performed. Everyone involved has done themselves proud, creating a ``Richard'' for the 1990s and the 1590s. If only all movies, Shakespeare adaptations or not, could be this self-confidently full-of-themselves in both concept and content.  Rumble in the Bronx R  If you haven't seen a Jackie Chan movie, you don't kow what you've been missing. Oh boy, as Buddy Holly would say. Part Bruce Lee, part Buster Keaton, Chan flips, kicks and leaps through his films with an exuberant kung-fu foolishness that's both death-defying and comic. In this English-dubbed action romp, he plays a Hong Kong cop on vacation in the Bronx (actually, Vancouver, British Columbia) who finds himself at odds with both the local gang and some international jewel thieves. But forget the plot and dialogue and focus on the almost nonstop action. Nimble, daring and pratfall funny, Chan and his movies aren't an acquired taste; they're an instant addiction. Rated R for violence.  Sabrina PG  The difference between the original ``Sabrina,'' a minor Billy Wilder film meant as a shameless showcase for Audrey Hepburn, and Sydney Pollack's remake isn't a matter of Hepburn vs. her replacement, Julia Ormond. It's a matter of Hepburn vs. Harrison Ford. He takes the Humphrey Bogart role of a sour tycoon who steps in when the chauffeur's daughter (Ormond) threatens to distract his easily distracted younger brother (a funny Greg Kinnear) from his impending marriage/ corporate merger. The first film was about Hepburn's transformation; this one is about Ford's. It gives it a more serious tone, but it also makes it more satisfying.  Sense and Sensibility PG  This dazzling Jane Austen adaptation is one of the year's best and a contender for a best picture Oscar. Double Oscar nominee (best actress and screenplay) Emma Thompson (who wrote the script) and Kate Winslet (``Heavenly Creatures'') co-star as penniless sisters trying to make their way among the sensible and the senseless in late 18th-century England. Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant and Greg Wise are suitors (of varying and changeable degrees of suitability). The unlikely director is Ang Lee (``Eat Drink Man Woman''), who has delivered a gorgeous film brimming with humor, romance and intelligence _ one that, on its own terms, is as fraught with peril and incident as a Spielberg thrill-flick. Score one for the good guys (and good gals.) And get your Oscar score card ready. Rated PG for mild adult themes.  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960314.0189 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(6thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Seven R  The creative serial killer in this self-conscious gibberish models his gruesome murders after each of the seven deadly sins. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are the cops out to stop him, but there's not much they can do to rescue this one-gimmick movie from quickly wearing out its one gimmick. Rated R for violence and language.  Shanghai Triad R  Zhang Yimou, the world-class director of ``Raise the Red Lantern'' and ``To Live,'' has turned his astonishing talent to a rip-roaring, stylized gangster melodrama. Set in '30s Shanghai, it's the story of a gangster's moll, Bijou (Gong Li, Zhang's muse), her powerful lover and the before and after of a bloody gang war. Zhang shows us these characters and events through the wide- open eyes of a 14-year-old country kid who's been brought to the city to be trained as Bijou's personal servant. Though not as complex as some of his other films, it's still a mesmerizing exploration of innocence, corruption and the true nature of power.  Sudden Death R  In this dumb-and-dumber knockoff of ``Die Hard'' (that's meant as a compliment), Jean-Claude Van Damme is the one- man cavalry who must save a stadium full of hockey fans from a madman (Powers Boothe) who's wired the place to blow up if he doesn't get a zillion-billion dollars. The movie is nonstop, state-of-the-art, over-the-top Hollywood hokum. And that's meant as a compliment, too. Rated R for violence and language.  Tom and Huck G  A straightforward, well-played adaptation of Mark Twain's classic ``The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.'' Director Peter Hewitt doesn't do much to capture Twain's tone, but he wisely stays out of the way of the story. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is initially too TV-cute as Tom, and Brad Renfro's Huck has been sanitized into a 19th-century homeless boy who just needs to be loved. But they both grow on you. One nice touch: This film's Becky Thatcher is a full head taller than Tom.  Toy Story G  A knockout. The first feature to be fully computer-generated, the all-ages comedy taps our childhood fantasies about the lives toys lead when the bedroom door closes. And it injects grown-up humor by making these Mr. Potato Heads and Slinky Dogs as psychologically diverse as any human. As neurotic as they are nice, the toys fret about their young owner Andy's birthday party, worried about getting edged out by a super- duper new toy. Longtime fave cowboy Woody (voice by Tom Hanks) gets upstaged by newcomer Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), a gleaming plastic hero. In this mock epic, Woody and Buzz go out into the ``real world,'' where they scamper beneath 18-wheelers, flee a toothy canine and survive the sadistic antics of the kid next door. Four years in the making, the film is a jaw-dropping spectacle, with one bravura sequence topping the one before. Give it five minutes, and this laugh-out-loud delight can turn the scroogiest Scrooge into a happy kid. ``Toy Story' will receive an Oscar for special achievement. _ Steve Murray  12 Monkeys R  Terry Gilliam's despair-laced fantasy gets under your skin _ even when you don't exactly know what's going on. Bruce Willis stars as Cole, who claims to be a time traveler from the year 2035. He's sent back to 1996 to discover the cause of a plague that has wiped out 5 billion people. Is he really from the future, or is he insane _ as one psychiatrist (Madeleine Stowe) thinks? As in Gilliam's other films (``Time Bandits,'' ``The Fisher King''), story and emotion come second to visual design and mood, and at times the movie could use a stronger sense of drama and momentum. Still, there's nothing else like it on screen right now. For its strange, spooky visual poetry, ``Monkeys'' is a barrel of glum fun. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  Two If by Sea R  A negligible, slightly amusing caper comedy that proves Sandra Bullock's first-rate charm can prop up second-rate material. She and Denis Leary play a bickering blue-collar couple who've stolen a painting. Arriving at Cape Cod a few days before their scheduled rendezvous with the mysterious buyer, they decide to enjoy the good life and ``house-sit'' a seaside mansion. Leary wrote the script, which includes flashes of his acerbic, off-kilter wit, but mostly the movie doesn't have enough heft, comedic or romantic. A good rentable.  Unforgettable R  The latest from ``Last Seduction'' director John Dahl is a sci-fi film noir whodunit. Haunted by the unsolved murder of his wife, medical examiner Ray Liotta nabs a memory- retrieval formula from nerdy neurobiologist Linda Fiorentino _ and shoots up with his wife's spinal fluid to experience her last minutes (and thus unmask her killer). As Krane experiences flashbacks of his wife's last night, ``Unforgettable'' enters ``Strange Days'' territory with its visceral, first- person views of the murder. But unlike ``Days,'' it doesn't tip the scale into queasy voyeurism. His experimental bender keeps the audience as unbalanced as the doctor, but beneath the chemical gimmick the script is standard hokum, an FX-ed rehash of the wrong-man formula. A mousy Fiorentino tries to change her image but doesn't have much to play, but Liotta's obsessive performance is terrific. _ Steve Murray  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960314.0190 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(7thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Up Close and Personal PG-13  Score one for golden guy Robert Redford and golden gal Michelle Pfeiffer, who show us what star power is really about in this glossy, high-profile romance with a TV news backdrop. Pfeiffer is the raw youngster who rises from weather girl to network star; Redford is the crusty news director, oozing with integrity, who acts as her mentor (``She eats the lens'') and falls in love with her. Director Jon Avnet and writers Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne have crossed ``A Star Is Born'' with ``Broadcast News'' and come up with a movie that's not as tough or complex as it could be. But with accomplished ``lens-eaters'' like Redford and Pfeiffer on hand, it's the kind of old-fashioned love story that's infatuated audiences for decades.  Vampire in Brooklyn R  An anemic hybrid of laughs and jolts, Wes Craven's movie stars Eddie Murphy as the vampire Maximillian, who comes to New York with an unplaceable accent and a wardrobe somewhere between Vincent Price and Sunset Boulevard pimp. He's seeking Rita (Angela Bassett), a cop who doesn't realize she's got vampire blood in her veins. Mixing gross-out humor, some sex, some violence, the movie never decides whether it's a comedy, a thriller, a romance _ what? Likewise, Murphy (the hero? the villain?) is stranded, posing in his threads like an International Male model. He also plays a couple of minor characters, and his scene as a Sharpton-like preacher who convinces his flock that ``evil is good'' is one of the few moments when the movie comes alive. Otherwise, it's undead all the way. _ Steve Murray  Waiting to Exhale R  A breath of fresh air. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon play friends in this glossy, well-acted adaptation of Terry McMillan's best seller. Forest Whitaker, better known for his acting in ``Bird'' and ``The Crying Game,'' provides the expert direction. And as for the reported ``male bashing,'' before you take your man, simply ask yourself, is he man enough to take it? Whitaker is. And he's man enough to dish it out, too. Rated R for sex, language and adult themes.  White Squall R  To get to the title storm (and it's a doozy) you have to wade through 90 minutes of a by-the-numbers script that wants to be ``Dead Poets Society'' on water. Based on a true story, ``Squall'' follows 13 high school boys in 1960, sailing for a year in the Albatross. They're skippered by gruff Christopher Sheldon (Jeff Bridges), a sort of growling surfer-Ahab. At first, the film conjures the muscle-stretching sense of hard work, raw sunlight, sweat and brine, and director Ridley Scott captures the menacing beauty of the ocean. But then the script kicks in and drowns in cliche, including the usual rites-of-passage (in exotic ports, the boys get drunk, get laid, get the clap). When the title storm finally hits, you'll be glad for the special effects _ but left unmoved by the fate of those who die. _ Steve Murray .

They move weekly to clients of the New York Times News Service.  G: General audiences. Nothing that would offend parents if viewed by children.  PG: Parental guidance suggested. May contain some material parents consider inappropriate for young children.  PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for preteens.  R: Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking children.  NC-17: No one under 17 admitted. Replaces the X rating.  NR: Not rated.  A Midwinter's Tale R  Following the excesses of his mega- budget take on Mary Shelley's ``Frankenstein,'' writer/director Kenneth Branagh simplifies things with this quaint valentine to actors and the theater. Michael Maloney plays a dedicated thespian who gathers a troupe of misfits to stage a no-frills version of ``Hamlet.''  Ace Ventura: When  Nature Calls PG-13  All-l-l-RIIIGHTY then. An Ace Ventura sequel was inevitable. Hence this ``. . . and dumber'' follow-up to Jim Carrey's supremely dumb ``Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.'' This time, our intrepid sleuth and animal lover is in deepest, darkest Africa, trying to locate a missing sacred animal and thus prevent tribal warfare. Yes, it's vulgar. Yes, it's idiotic. But what were you expecting? Ace Ventura in ``Schindler's List II''? As purely silly movies go, this one is aces. Rated PG-13 for vulgarity, language and sexual innuendo.  The American President PG-13  In Rob Reiner's tangy romantic comedy, Michael Douglas plays widowed President Andrew Shepherd, who woos environmental lobbyist Sydney Wade (Annette Bening). Unfortunately, election year is looming. And Senator Rumson (Richard Dreyfuss) grabs their romance as fodder for his own mudslinging campaign. Regaining his magic touch, Reiner keeps his film balanced between its smarter agenda and its Hollywood fairy-tale touches. Rated PG-13 for language. _ Steve Murray  Angels &AMP; Insects R  Sins and sensibility form the core of this mordant bit of inner-rot Victoriana. Based on a novel by A.S. Byatt, this elegant and subversive film is set on an English country estate in 1862, belonging to the aristocratic Alabasters. A poor naturalist is invited there by the family patriarch (he dabbles in Darwin) and falls for their eldest daughter. Director Philip Haas and his fine cast (headed by Mark Rylance, Patsy Kensit and Kristin Scott Thomas) adapt a tone of wicked fastidiousness while Paul Brown's costumes suggest something out of an entomological opera. A film that floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. Not rated, but there is graphic sex, nudity and adult themes.  Babe G  A best picture Oscar nominee. Pig out on this delightfully screwball movie about a piglet who thinks he's a sheepdog. Real-life animals carry the bulk of the story, but they get some high-tech help from computer graphics and superbly lifelike animatronic stand-ins created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Voice talent Christine Cavanaugh as Babe and Miriam Margolyes (``The Age of Innocence'') as Fly, Babe's adopted border collie mom.  Beautiful Girls R  A perceptive, humorous look at relationships and the late-20s blues in a working-class town in western Massachusetts. Timothy Hutton heads a strong ensemble cast as a Manhattan pianist who returns home for his high school reunion. Matt Dillon, Michael Rapaport, Max Perlich and Noah Emmerich are his pals; Mira Sorvino, Annabeth Gish, Lauren Holly, Rosie O'Donnell, Uma Thurman and a scene-stealing Natalie Portman are the girls in and out of their lives. The movie doesn't accomplish everything it sets out to, but if it misses ``The Big Chill,'' it still delivers some salient shivers about growing up. Rated R for language and adult themes.  Before and After PG-13  Before their teenage son (Edward Furlong) is accused of murder, the Ryans (Meryl Streep and Liam Neeson) are a well-heeled, respectable New England couple. After the accusation, they are worried-sick parents, small-town pariahs, amateur lawyers, sometime sleuths, etc. Barbet Schroeder (``Reversal of Fortune'') has made a solid, intelligent film that is less about a murder mystery than about a marriage on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Alas, his careful pacing and the stars' restrained performances are undermined by a tell- all trailer and an uneven script. Still, Streep and Neeson are wonderful to watch as they show us how easily normality can slip into a nightmare. Rated PG-13 for violence, language and adult themes.  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960321.0238 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(2ndtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  The Birdcage R  There's nothing terribly wrong with Mike Nichols' scene-by-scene remake of the 1978 French farce _ except the intervening 18 years. What used to cause a belly laugh now earns a pleasant chuckle. Robin Williams plays Armand, the relatively butch half of a gay couple. Nathan Lane is Albert, his shrieking drag-queen companion. Chaos arrives when Armand's son Val (Dan Futterman) brings home the parents of his fiancee: ultraconservative Senator Keeley (Gene Hackman) and his wife Louise (Dianne Wiest). Armand can play it straight, but what to do with the hyper-nelly Albert? The movie ought to take off into the laughing-gas stratosphere of the best farces. But at 20 minutes longer than the French original, the film feels padded. Like ``To Wong Foo,'' the movie feels a little safe, a little tired. Rated R for language and sexual situations. _ Steve Murray  Black Sheep PG-13  It appears that David Spade and Chris Farley are aiming to be the Abbott and Costello of the '90s. In this, their second big- screen vehicle together (following the amusing 1995 hit ``Tommy Boy''), the pair continue to chase a classic comedy team formula. At times, they evoke the spirit of Bud and Lou, superficially at least, but their shtick just ain't classic yet, and ``Black Sheep's'' negligible plot leaves them grasping for gags. _ Doug Hamilton  Bottle Rocket R  A blast. In his hilarious feature film debut, writer/director Wes Anderson tells the story of three pals _ Anthony, Dignan and Bob (played by Luke Wilson, real-life brother Owen C. Wilson and Robert Musgrave, respectively) _ who take the term ``thick as thieves'' a little too literally. Faced with uncertain futures, the three turn to an elaborate plan drawn up by Dignan that centers around them becoming professional robbers. The movie shows us the flip side of the current trend in outlaw chic _ what would happen if three not-so-bright Joes actually tried to live a Quentin Tarantino script? Call it ``Reservoir Dorks.'' _ Doug Hamilton  Braveheart R  As did ``Spartacus'' and ``Dances With Wolves,'' Mel Gibson's tumultuously entertaining epic extols such old-fashioned virtues as honor, freedom, principle, loyalty and romantic love. Gibson, who also directed, plays William Wallace, a bonnie 13th-century Scotsman who gave the English hell for the hash they tried to make out of his homeland. Rated R for brief nudity and extreme violence. Nominated for 10 Academy Awards.  Broken Arrow R  Air Force pilot Christian Slater goes up against his buddy John Travolta, who steals two nuclear warheads from their Stealth bomber with a plan to ransom an entire city. Basically, the movie is one long chase in the desert, as Slater teams with perky park ranger Samantha Mathis _ and tracks the bad guys on foot (that must be a small desert). Packed with implausibility, the movie should be a lot of dumb fun. But it can't decide if it's ``Indiana Jones'' or ``Fail-Safe.'' Directed by Hong Kong action czar John Woo, it's played too broadly to make us genuinely tense, but it's not over-the-top enough to make us giddy with thrills. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  Casino R  The ``GoodFellas'' duo _ director Martin Scorsese and writer Nicholas Pileggi _ roll the dice a second time and come up craps. Robert De Niro plays Sam ``Ace'' Rothstein, a professional gambler who operates a Las Vegas casino from behind the scenes; Joe Pesci is a hothead hit man, and both were better in ``GoodFellas.'' Finally there's Ginger (Golden Globe winner Sharon Stone, who proves once and for all that she can act), a former hooker who becomes Sam's reluctant wife and dives into the bottle. If the movie focused more clearly on these three, ``Casino'' might hold our interest. But the whole thing feels like a retread. _ Steve Murray  City Hall R  The killing of a 6-year-old boy in a shootout between a cop and a drug dealer kicks off this urban expose of civic corruption. John Cusack plays deputy to New York mayor Al Pacino, but all his spin-doctoring can't cease the public outcry when word leaks that the cop may be crooked and the crook may have gotten a suspiciously lax probation. The movie cooks as it shows how political deals go down in greasy spoons and Broadway lobbies. But as Kevin's investigation leads him toward the courtroom of a venerable judge (Martin Landau), gritty verisimilitude gives way to standard thriller cliche. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  City of Lost Children R  From the creators of ``Delicatessen'' comes this bizarre fairy tale of childhood lost and, perhaps, regained. In a nightmare neo-Victorian city _ think, Charles Dickens meets Terry Gilliam _ a hideous scientist is sending his freakish minions to kidnap children so he can steal their dreams. Ron Perlman is a circus strongman out to rescue his little brother and Judith Vittet is the street-smart urchin who helps him. Head-spinningly imaginative and seriously twisted, the movie still manages to find a strange innocence among its rank, cluttered corruption and outrageous grotesqueries. Tim Burton would feel right at home. Rated R for language and adult themes.  Dead Man Walking R  In Tim Robbins' deadly earnest, intermittently powerful death-row drama, a nun (Susan Sarandon) becomes involved with a convicted murderer (Sean Penn). Both give riveting portrayals (though Penn's arrogant, racist redneck is getting most of the attention). The problem is the movie isn't really about either character. It's about an issue _ the pros and cons of the death penalty _ which means it often lapses into the message-conscious style of a '50s TV drama. Still, Robbins manages a shatteringly effective final half hour simply by showing us how capital punishment works in every gruesome and dehumanizing detail. Robbins, Sarandon and Penn are all nominated for Oscars.  Dead Presidents R  A searingly fine sophomore effort by the Hughes brothers (``Menace II Society''). Like an African-Americanized ``The Deer Hunter,'' the movie follows some pals from the Bronx before, during and after their tour of duty in Vietnam. Larenz Tate is the film's indispensable anchor, but he gets fine support from Keith David, N'Bushe Wright and Bokeem Wodbine, among others. The film isn't perfect; by trying to cover so much ground, it skims certain issues, skimps on certain characters. But it's a vital and passionate look at a nation so caught up in the macho-angst of losing a war abroad that it ignored a far more important war at home. Rated R for sex, violence, nudity and language.

Also starring Kathy Bates and Chazz Palminteri.  Don't Be a Menace  to South Central While Drinking  Your Juice in the Hood R  A vehicle for Shawn and Marlon Wayans, the two youngest members of the comic family that includes brothers Damon and Keenen Ivory. This ``Airplane!''-style parody takes broad, juvenile jabs at such urban ``message'' movies as ``Menace II Society'' and ``Boyz N the Hood.'' If not all the jokes here work, many of the ones that do have extra weight. When two characters are busted for ``being black on a Friday night'' and taken to a police station equipped with a Rodney King punch-and-kick video game, the movie turns from goofy fun to comedy that tickles and stings. _ Doug Hamilton  Down Periscope PG-13  ``Police Academy'' on a submarine. A very un-``Frasier''-like Kelsey Grammer stars as a subversive sub commander who pulls the requisite group of misfits together into a shipshape team and beats a crazed Bruce Dern at his own war game. Fans of ``Frasier'' may be dismayed by the wanton waste of Grammer's talents _ he coasts through wearing a fixed, avuncular smile _ but he doesn't disgrace himself and there are worse ways to break into movies. Think of it as a good movie for 12-year-olds of all ages. Rated PG-13 for language and mild sexuality.  Ed PG  TV star Matt LeBlanc won't make any new friends'' with this dismal comedy about a minor-league pitcher who gets a chimpanzee for a teammate. It's a tossup as to what is more odious about this stinker _ the script, which is rife with monkey flatulence jokes, or the dime-store special effects. Ed, the chimp, is actually a brazenly fake mix of animatronics and actors in monkey suits. LeBlanc manages to retain some of the affable charm he displays on ``Friends,'' but it's a struggle. _ Doug Hamilton  Executive Decision R  A crafty pastiche of Tom Clancy, ``Die Hard'' and ``Airport.'' Kurt Russell plays Dr. David Grant, a civilian intelligence consultant for the U.S. military who inadvertently ends up the key player in an attempt to thwart the hijacking of a 747 by a Hamas-style terrorist group. Though Steven Seagal makes a brief appearance as the commanding officer of an elite anti-terrorist force, there is a welcome lack of chest-beating here that one might find in the average testosterone-fueled action vehicle. Grant is a thinker, not a warrior. The consultant as conquering hero? This nail-biter could make it a trend. _ Doug Hamilton  Fargo R  A tale of murder, greed and morning sickness in Minnesota, this squalidly hilarious black comedy marks a return to top form for the Coen Brothers (``Blood Simple''). Sleazy car salesman William H. Macy hires two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wealthy wife (they'll split the ransom dad-in-law coughs up). But things go awry and soon Frances McDormand, the very pregnant police chief of Brainerd, Minn. (Home of Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox), is on the case. Loosely based on real incidents that occurred in 1987, the movie exists in some surreal cinematic convergence of Mayberry, Twin Peaks and SCTV. It's a great place for any movie lover to visit _ provided, of course, you bring along a very sick sense of humor. Rated R for sex, nudity, violence and language.  Father of the Bride,  Part II PG  Steve Martin's father of the bride becomes a father-to-be and a grandfather-to-be in this dumbed-down diversion that's not half as enjoyable as its 1991 predecessor. The funny parts, all of which have been revealed in the trailer (the dual pregnancies of wife Diane Keaton and daughter Kimberly Williams, Martin's midlife crisis, the return of Martin Short's egregiously effeminate party planner), just aren't that funny. However, the schmaltzy parts, near the end, work like a charm. My advice: Go with someone who is pregnant and enjoy her enjoyment. Somehow, even the dumbest pregnancy cliches seem appealing in your second trimester. Rated PG for mild adult themes and language.  From Dusk Till Dawn R  Robert Rodriguez's hyperviolent vampire flick stars scripter Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney (in a dynamic big-screen crossover) as killer bank robbers who take hostage a retired minister (Harvey Keitel) and his kids (including Juliette Lewis). Bad luck for them, these anti-heroes stop at a Mexican bar _ catering to bikers and bloodsuckers. The long opening setup is vintage Tarantino, full of bloody shocks and sick humor. But once the saloon's staff morph into vampires, ``Dusk'' heads into Sam Raimi's ``Evil Dead'' territory, complete with spewing eyeballs and severed limbs. It's an excuse for a couple of way-talented filmmakers to have gruesome fun. And for most of the time, we do, too. But the squeamish, beware. Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity. _ Steve Murray  Get Shorty R  Barry Sonnenfeld's lively adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel follows the exploits of a Miami loan shark named Chili Palmer (John Travolta) who finds out that show biz isn't all that different from shylocking when he goes to pick up a debt from a B-movie producer (Gene Hackman). Anchoring the most complicated plot since ``The Usual Suspects,'' the charming Travolta proves he's no ``Pulp Fiction'' flash in the pan. _ Steve Murray  Girl 6 R  After the gritty crime drama ``Clockers,'' Spike Lee returns to the sex-charged comedy of ``She's Gotta Have It'' with this story about a phone sex operator (Theresa Randle) who dreams of being a movie star. Isaiah Washington co-stars.  GoldenEye PG-13  Reality never  intrudes on the babes and bombs, gags and gadgets in this guilty pleasure introducing Pierce Brosnan as the new 007. Despite some P.C. lip service, it's the old things that work best, including villains left over from the Cold War (Sean Bean as a disgruntled Cossack, Famke Janssen as masochistic femme fatale Xenia Onatopp). Pitched between the no-nonsense Timothy Dalton and the inimitably courtly Sean Connery, Brosnan deserves a few more spins in the Aston- Martin. _ Steve Murray  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960321.0240 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(4thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Happy Gilmore PG-13  Adam Sandler goes for the green in this slap-happy golf comedy. He plays the title role, a failed hockey player who discovers his slap shot training has given him a killer golf swing. When his grandmother's house is repossessed by the IRS, he joins the pro golf circuit to make money to buy it back. After last year's mean-spirited ``Billy Madison,'' it's nice to see Sandler display a sweet side. Too bad the movie degenerates into a by-the-numbers rewrite of ``Caddyshack.'' Rated PG-13 for language. _ Doug Hamilton  Heat R  Looks hot on paper (Al Pacino and Robert De Niro together again for the first time!), but on screen, this incoherent, overlong action flick never sputters above a pseudo-simmer. Pacino is a workaholic L.A. cop obsessed with catching De Niro, a career criminal who masterminds complex heists. The movie lasts almost three hours and the two stars spend around 10 minutes together. Maybe writer/director Michael Mann thought he was creating an existential male menopause movie masquerading as a cops and robbers drama. But watching two great actors run, jump and shoot their way through roles they would have laughed at in their Young Turk days is ultimately kind of painful. Rated R for violence, language and brief sex.  Heavy Metal R  To enjoy the re-release of 1981's animated rock 'n' roll flick, it helps to have teen hormones and a taste for comic-book violence and enormous cartoon breasts. ``Metal'' throws together six stories, loosely tied to the Loch-nar, a glowing green sphere with attitude. The first five stories are quick and casual enough to be brain-dead fun. But the final half- hour bogs down with ``Legend of Taarna,'' an excruciating epic about a babe who saves the universe, dressed in thongs and garters you'd expect from an S&AMP;M branch of Victoria's Secret. The animation may have been cutting edge in '81, but most of it now seems dated. So does the soundtrack: Black Sabbath, Journey, Blue Oyster Cult and others who have good reason to feel ashamed of themselves. Rated R for language and cartoon nudity. _ Steve Murray  Hellraiser: Bloodline R  More gloppy than scary, this fourth installment of Clive Barker's ``Hellraiser'' series is actually three 30-minute movies held together by one family's fateful link to a deadly puzzle box that can summon demons from hell (Doug Bradley as Pinhead and seductive Valentina Vargas). As is usual with this kind of picture, most of the creativity has been lavished on the gross parts while matters of plot, character and dialogue are treated as filler. As Dorothy Parker might've said, what stale hell this is.  Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco G  Sassy the Himalayan cat, Chance the American bulldog and Shadow the golden retriever aren't the only things that are lost in this sequel to the 1993 hit. Also missing is its predecessor's lovely animal-lover lyricism. This time, they wander the streets of San Francisco where they're menaced by buffoonish dog thieves and rescued by a gang of streetwise pooches (think, Dead End Dogs). The voice talent _ Sally Field as sarcastic Sassy, Michael J. Fox as irrepressible Chance and Ralph Waite (replacing the late Don Ameche) as dignified Shadow _ is as good as ever, but too many talking anthropomorphic animals spoil the movie. The first film moved you to tears; the sequel is standard babysitter stuff for undemanding kids.  If Lucy Fell R  Don't fall for this flat romantic comedy. Sarah Jessica Parker and Eric Schaeffer (who also wrote the script and directed) play longtime platonic roomies who've made a pact: If neither is romantically involved by the time Parker turns 30, they'll jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. Parker is game in an unflattering part and Elle Macpherson and Ben Stiller are fine in limited roles as potential romantic possibilities. But Schaeffer is a big black hole in the middle of his own picture. The character he's written is funny, sensitive, bright and charismatic in his own muddled way; the character he plays on screen is none of these things. Rated R for sxual situations, nudity and language.  It Takes Two PG  Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen of TV's ``Full House'' (they shared the role of Michelle Tanner) play identical strangers _ one a streetwise New York orphan, the other a billionaire's daughter _ who scheme to switch places and get their single guardians together. Sure, it's ``The Prince and the Pauper'' meets ``The Parent Trap,'' but director Andy Tennant does absolutely the best job one can with borrowed ideas, and the Olsens are _ surprise! _ a delight, far more expressive than on ``Full House'' and very natural in their parts. Rated PG for mild adult themes. _ Doug Hamilton  Jumanji PG  Robin Williams shows us where the wild things are in this effects-laden family fantasy about a mysterious board game that can bring rhinos into your living room or turn a house into a primeval swamp. Director Joe Johnstone (``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'') knows how to thrill an audience with outsized insects or a stampede down Main Street. But the movie goes on a roll of the dice or two too long. And in-between ``plays,'' things get frankly boring. Bottom line: If you've seen the trailer, you've already seen all the best parts. And those ``best parts'' may be a little scary for littler kids. Johnston does nothing to up the ante; it's like playing Candyland instead of Monopoly. Rated PG for violence.  The Juror R  In this drab legal thriller Demi Moore is a single mom whose life becomes hell when jury duty lands her in the hands of a mob operative, who threatens her life unless she gets his boss acquitted. It's a two-hour string of implausibilities. Of course, we don't go to a thriller expecting to believe every plot twist; half the fun is seeing how outrageous the action can get while still keeping us hooked. But director Brian Gibson can't make us suspend our disbelief, and there's not a scary moment in the movie. Though he's verging on typecasting (see ``Malice''), Baldwin is a pro at playing these sexy psychopaths. But forget about Moore, who blunders through with her usual mix of plucky squared jaw and perfectly timed teardrop. She's a big drag. _ Steve Murray  Leaving Las Vegas R  ``Viva Las Vegas'' on two dozen downers and a case of Jack Black. Oscar nominee Nicolas Cage is an alcoholic Hollywood screenwriter who pockets his severance check and heads to Vegas to drink himself to death. Oscar nominee Elisabeth Shue is a Vegas hooker who gets hooked on his devil-may-care despair. The movie is a bit of a drunk itself _ given to self-indulgent poses and poetic pretentiousness. But Cage and Shue are willing _ and able _ to do director Mike Figgis' dirty work for him. Their terrific performances leave you feeling unclean and sober. Rated R for sex, language, nudity and drug abuse.  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960321.0241 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(5thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Mary Reilly R  Julia Roberts shines despite some drab duds in this chilly reworking of the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde tale. As the title character, a housemaid for that king of mood swings, Dr. Henry Jekyll (John Malkovich), she skulks about in Victorian skirts, her complexion pasty, her beloved smile clamped into a tight frown. It's worlds away from ``Pretty Woman's'' unflappable hooker, and Roberts scores points for taking a career risk. Though Reilly was written as sort of a one-note mouse, the actress does wonders with the role, imbuing her with a heartbreaking fragility that draws us in even as the movie fights to keep us at arm's length. Rated R for violence and gore. _ Doug Hamilton  Mr. Holland's Opus PG  The corn is as high as an elephant's eye in this unabashedly sentimental melodrama. And guess what? The cornier it gets, the better the picture works. Oscar nominee Richard Dreyfuss stars as a would-be composer who devotes 30 years of his life to teaching high school music students. Director Stephen Herek has shaped the film into easily absorbed TV-size chunks that are given focus and humor thanks to a solid cast and Dreyfuss' energized, razor- sharp performance. Goodbye, Mr. Chips; hello, Mr. Holland. Rated PG for mild language.  Money Train R  Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson attempt to work the same buddy magic that made their 1992 basketball comedy, ``White Men Can't Jump,'' a hit. Here, their interplay is again easy and amusing, but the movie around them is a cliched jumble. The two play New York subway cops who also are foster brothers. Snipes is the responsible one; Harrelson's the habitual gambler with the Mom-always-liked-you-best chip on his shoulder. When Harrelson's fortunes take a downward turn (due to a laughable series of plot contrivances), he decides to reverse his loser status by robbing the subway's revenue train. Rated R for violence, language and nudity._ Doug Hamilton  Mr. Wrong PG-13  The good news: Ellen DeGeneres moves to the big screen with her angsty charms intact. The bad news: Her movie stinks. Alone on Valentine's night, she runs into a handsome investor (Bill Pullman) who seems heaven sent. Though it soon turns out to be hell. Pullman turns into a crazed, REO Speedwagon-listening, shoplifting clown, determined to wed her at any cost. But the character's about-face has no bearing on reality; it's a gimmick. The only thing worth watching is DeGeneres, drawing on her patented regimen of wary glances and nervous reactions. But instead of getting the sort of lift you get from screwball runaway-bride films of the '30s, ``Mr. Wrong'' only gives you a headache. _ Steve Murray  Muppet Treasure Island G  Yo! Ho! Ho! and a barrel of fun! The Muppets take to the high seas in this loose musical adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic adventure about pirates, buried treasure and a brave lad named Jim Hawkins (Kevin Bishop). Tim Curry co-stars as Long John Silver; he's convincing, though a bit upstaged by his felt colleagues. Kudos all 'round to the usual Mupport support team: director Brian Henson and his hands-on puppeteers, Frank Oz (Miss Piggy), former Atlantan Steve Whitmire (Kermit the Frog), David Goelz (the Great Gonzo) and Jerry Nelson and Kevin Clash as just about everyone else.  Once Upon a Time . . . When We Were Colored PG  Tim Reid directs a talented cast (headed by Al Freeman Jr. and Phylicia Rashad) in a tender, evocative film set in the postwar segregated South. Based on Clifton Taulbert's coming-of-age memoir, the movie spans three decades, celebrating the triumph of the spirit of a generation of African-Americans _ the generation after slavery and before lunch counter sit- ins _ who never got a break coming or going. An honorable, heartfelt picture that implores us to never forget our country's past so that we may be better prepared to shape its future. Rated PG for adult themes.  The Postman NR  A best picture Oscar contender. Set in the early '50s, this bittersweet tale of the unlikely friendship between the world-famous poet Pablo Neruda and Mario, an unworldly fisherman's son, is a deceptively simple film that sneaks up on you. English director Michael Radford (``White Mischief'') brings an outsider's intrigued eye to his Italian setting. But his ultimate focus is on the collision of poet and peasant and how each affects the other.  Primal Fear R  Richard Gere plays a hotshot attorney defending a young man accused of murdering an archbishop in the film adaptation of William Diehl's best-selling novel. ``Congo's'' Laura Linney co-stars.  Race the Sun PG  It's a busy month movie-wise for Dave Justice's ex-to-be, Halle Berry. Besides appearing in the new Kurt Russell thriller, ``Executive Decision,'' she also stars in this family comedy penned by Oscar-winning screenwriter Barry Morrow (``Rain Man''). Berry plays a high school science teacher who challenges her bored students to create a solar-powered car and enter it in a race.  Richard III R  Bloody as hell and bloody good fun. Sir Ian McKellen and director Richard Loncraine have transferred Shakespeare's tale of unruly royals doing rotten things to one another to 1930s England. The cast is a who's who of Britain's best (along with Americans Annette Bening and Robert Downey Jr.), but the crown jewel is Richard himself, played by McKellan as a magnificent media-savvy monster, as unctuous as he is unrepentant. This is a dazzling film, vividly imagined and breathtakingly performed. Everyone involved has done themselves proud, creating a ``Richard'' for the 1990s and the 1590s. If only all movies, Shakespeare adaptations or not, could be this self- confidently full-of-themselves in both concept and content.

Oh boy, as Buddy Holly would say. Part Bruce Lee, part Buster Keaton, Chan flips, kicks and leaps through his films with an exuberant kung-fu foolishness that's both death-defying and comic. In this English-dubbed action romp, he plays a Hong Kong cop on vacation in the Bronx (actually, Vancouver, British Columbia) who finds himself at odds with both the local gang and some international jewel thieves. But forget the plot and dialogue and focus on the almost nonstop action. Nimble, daring and pratfall funny, Chan and his movies aren't an acquired taste; they're an instant addiction. Rated R for violence.  Sabrina PG  The difference between the original ``Sabrina,'' a minor Billy Wilder film meant as a shameless showcase for Audrey Hepburn, and Sydney Pollack's remake isn't a matter of Hepburn vs. her replacement, Julia Ormond. It's a matter of Hepburn vs. Harrison Ford. He takes the Humphrey Bogart role of a sour tycoon who steps in when the chauffeur's daughter (Ormond) threatens to distract his easily distracted younger brother (a funny Greg Kinnear) from his impending marriage/ corporate merger. The first film was about Hepburn's transformation; this one is about Ford's. It gives it a more serious tone, but it also makes it more satisfying.  Sense and Sensibility PG  This dazzling Jane Austen adaptation is one of the year's best and a contender for a best picture Oscar. Double Oscar nominee (best actress and screenplay) Emma Thompson (who wrote the script) and Kate Winslet (``Heavenly Creatures'') co-star as penniless sisters trying to make their way among the sensible and the senseless in late 18th-century England. Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant and Greg Wise are suitors (of varying and changeable degrees of suitability). The unlikely director is Ang Lee (``Eat Drink Man Woman''), who has delivered a gorgeous film brimming with humor, romance and intelligence _ one that, on its own terms, is as fraught with peril and incident as a Spielberg thrill-flick. Score one for the good guys (and good gals.) And get your Oscar score card ready. Rated PG for mild adult themes.  Seven R  The creative serial killer in this self-conscious gibberish models his gruesome murders after each of the seven deadly sins. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are the cops out to stop him, but there's not much they can do to rescue this one-gimmick movie from quickly wearing out its one gimmick. Rated R for violence and language.  Shanghai Triad R  Zhang Yimou, the world-class director of ``Raise the Red Lantern'' and ``To Live,'' has turned his astonishing talent to a rip-roaring, stylized gangster melodrama. Set in '30s Shanghai, it's the story of a gangster's moll, Bijou (Gong Li, Zhang's muse), her powerful lover and the before and after of a bloody gang war. Zhang shows us these characters and events through the wide- open eyes of a 14-year-old country kid who's been brought to the city to be trained as Bijou's personal servant. Though not as complex as some of his other films, it's still a mesmerizing exploration of innocence, corruption and the true nature of power.  The Star Maker NR  Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore returns to a theme he's explored before in his Oscar-winning ``Cinema Paradiso.'' Namely, the magical lure of the movies. In the early '50s, a scam artist (Sergio Castellitto) crisscrosses Sicily in a battered truck. Posing as a talent agent for the studios in Rome, he shoots bogus screen tests for a mere 1500 lira. Like a rougher version of Robert Preston in ``The Music Man,'' he takes what little these dirt-poor people have; at the same time, he gives them something priceless _ a brief respite from their dreary lives. The movie's earthy humanism offers a charming respite of its own and Castellitto makes a perfect dream merchant, ultimately trapped by his own reel-to-real stories.  Sudden Death R  In this dumb-and-dumber knockoff of ``Die Hard'' (that's meant as a compliment), Jean-Claude Van Damme is the one-man cavalry who must save a stadium full of hockey fans from a madman (Powers Boothe) who's wired the place to blow up if he doesn't get a zillion-billion dollars. The movie is nonstop, state-of-the-art, over-the-top Hollywood hokum. And that's meant as a compliment, too. Rated R for violence and language.  Tom and Huck G  A straightforward, well-played adaptation of Mark Twain's classic ``The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.'' Director Peter Hewitt doesn't do much to capture Twain's tone, but he wisely stays out of the way of the story. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is initially too TV-cute as Tom, and Brad Renfro's Huck has been sanitized into a 19th-century homeless boy who just needs to be loved. But they both grow on you. One nice touch: This film's Becky Thatcher is a full head taller than Tom.

The first feature to be fully computer-generated, the all-ages comedy taps our childhood fantasies about the lives toys lead when the bedroom door closes. And it injects grown-up humor by making these Mr. Potato Heads and Slinky Dogs as psychologically diverse as any human. As neurotic as they are nice, the toys fret about their young owner Andy's birthday party, worried about getting edged out by a super-duper new toy. Longtime fave cowboy Woody (voice by Tom Hanks) gets upstaged by newcomer Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), a gleaming plastic hero. In this mock epic, Woody and Buzz go out into the ``real world,'' where they scamper beneath 18- wheelers, flee a toothy canine and survive the sadistic antics of the kid next door. Four years in the making, the film is a jaw-dropping spectacle, with one bravura sequence topping the one before. Give it five minutes, and this laugh-out-loud delight can turn the scroogiest Scrooge into a happy kid. ``Toy Story' will receive an Oscar for special achievement. _ Steve Murray  12 Monkeys R  Terry Gilliam's despair-laced fantasy gets under your skin _ even when you don't exactly know what's going on. Bruce Willis stars as Cole, who claims to be a time traveler from the year 2035. He's sent back to 1996 to discover the cause of a plague that has wiped out 5 billion people. Is he really from the future, or is he insane _ as one psychiatrist (Madeleine Stowe) thinks? As in Gilliam's other films (``Time Bandits,'' ``The Fisher King''), story and emotion come second to visual design and mood, and at times the movie could use a stronger sense of drama and momentum. Still, there's nothing else like it on screen right now. For its strange, spooky visual poetry, ``Monkeys'' is a barrel of glum fun. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  Two Much PG-13  Too long, too dumb and too much of a bad thing. In this double-trouble farce, Antonio Banderas plays a scam artist who gets involved with a wealthy divorced woman (Melanie Griffith), only to find himself falling for her intellectual sister (Daryl Hannah). In order to woo her, he poses as his own bespectacled twin brother. Danny Aiello co-stars as Griffith's very jealous, mob-connected ex. Writer/director Fernando Truebo may have Oscar credentials (he won the foreign-language category in 1994 with ``Belle Epoque''), but in plain English, this movie barely works as a romance and falls apart completely as a comedy.  Up Close and Personal PG-13  Score one for golden guy Robert Redford and golden gal Michelle Pfeiffer, who show us what star power is really about in this glossy, high-profile romance with a TV news backdrop. Pfeiffer is the raw youngster who rises from weather girl to network star; Redford is the crusty news director, oozing with integrity, who acts as her mentor (``She eats the lens'') and falls in love with her. Director Jon Avnet and writers Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne have crossed ``A Star Is Born'' with ``Broadcast News'' and come up with a movie that's not as tough or complex as it could be. But with accomplished ``lens-eaters'' like Redford and Pfeiffer on hand, it's the kind of old-fashioned love story that's infatuated audiences for decades. Rated PG-13 for language and adult themes.  Vampire in Brooklyn R  An anemic hybrid of laughs and jolts, Wes Craven's movie stars Eddie Murphy as the vampire Maximillian, who comes to New York with an unplaceable accent and a wardrobe somewhere between Vincent Price and Sunset Boulevard pimp. He's seeking Rita (Angela Bassett), a cop who doesn't realize she's got vampire blood in her veins. Mixing gross-out humor, some sex, some violence, the movie never decides whether it's a comedy, a thriller, a romance _ what? Likewise, Murphy (the hero? the villain?) is stranded, posing in his threads like an International Male model. He also plays a couple of minor characters, and his scene as a Sharpton-like preacher who convinces his flock that ``evil is good'' is one of the few moments when the movie comes alive. Otherwise, it's undead all the way. _ Steve Murray  Waiting to Exhale R  A breath of fresh air. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon play friends in this glossy, well-acted adaptation of Terry McMillan's best seller. Forest Whitaker, better known for his acting in ``Bird'' and ``The Crying Game,'' provides the expert direction. And as for the reported ``male bashing,'' before you take your man, simply ask yourself, is he man enough to take it? Whitaker is. And he's man enough to dish it out, too.

Sleazy car salesman William H. Macy hires two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wealthy wife (they'll split the ransom dad-in-law coughs up). But things go awry and soon Frances McDormand, the very pregnant police chief of Brainerd, Minn. (Home of Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox), is on the case. Loosely based on real incidents that occurred in 1987, the movie exists in some surreal cinematic convergence of Mayberry, Twin Peaks and SCTV. It's a great place for any movie lover to visit _ provided, of course, you bring along a very sick sense of humor. Rated R for sex, nudity, violence and language.  Father of the Bride,  Part II PG  Steve Martin's father of the bride becomes a father-to-be and a grandfather-to-be in this dumbed-down diversion that's not half as enjoyable as its 1991 predecessor. The funny parts, all of which have been revealed in the trailer (the dual pregnancies of wife Diane Keaton and daughter Kimberly Williams, Martin's midlife crisis, the return of Martin Short's egregiously effeminate party planner), just aren't that funny. However, the schmaltzy parts, near the end, work like a charm. My advice: Go with someone who is pregnant and enjoy her enjoyment. Somehow, even the dumbest pregnancy cliches seem appealing in your second trimester. Rated PG for mild adult themes and language.  Flirting With Disaster R  Crawling out from under the heap of accolades he received for his cheeky incest flick ``Spanking the Monkey,'' writer/director David O. Russell returns with this comedy about a man's search for his biological parents. Ben Stiller and Patricia Arquette star, with appearances by Mary Tyler Moore and George Segal.  From Dusk Till Dawn R  Robert Rodriguez's hyperviolent vampire flick stars scripter Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney (in a dynamic big-screen crossover) as killer bank robbers who take hostage a retired minister (Harvey Keitel) and his kids (including Juliette Lewis). Bad luck for them, these anti-heroes stop at a Mexican bar _ catering to bikers and bloodsuckers. The long opening setup is vintage Tarantino, full of bloody shocks and sick humor. But once the saloon's staff morph into vampires, ``Dusk'' heads into Sam Raimi's ``Evil Dead'' territory, complete with spewing eyeballs and severed limbs. It's an excuse for a couple of way-talented filmmakers to have gruesome fun. And for most of the time, we do, too. But the squeamish, beware. Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity. _ Steve Murray  Girl 6 R  Typically, Spike Lee works best when he's worked up about something. But this comedy about an aspiring actress (Theresa Randle) who takes a job as a phone-sex girl, shows a frisky, almost larkish side that's as welcome as it is unexpected. Suzan-Lori Parks' script covers some familiar territory and lacks a satisfying resolution, but the director diverts our attention with kicky visuals, heavyweight cameos and some hilarious fantasies. And Randle, with her blend of movie-star sparkle and girl-next-door likability makes an appealing protagonist.  Happy Gilmore PG-13  Adam Sandler goes for the green in this slap-happy golf comedy. He plays the title role, a failed hockey player who discovers his slap shot training has given him a killer golf swing. When his grandmother's house is repossessed by the IRS, he joins the pro golf circuit to make money to buy it back. After last year's mean-spirited ``Billy Madison,'' it's nice to see Sandler display a sweet side. Too bad the movie degenerates into a by-the- numbers rewrite of ``Caddyshack.'' Rated PG-13 for language. _ Doug Hamilton  Heat R  Looks hot on paper (Al Pacino and Robert De Niro together again for the first time!), but on screen, this incoherent, overlong action flick never sputters above a pseudo-simmer. Pacino is a workaholic L.A. cop obsessed with catching De Niro, a career criminal who masterminds complex heists. The movie lasts almost three hours and the two stars spend around 10 minutes together. Maybe writer/director Michael Mann thought he was creating an existential male menopause movie masquerading as a cops and robbers drama. But watching two great actors run, jump and shoot their way through roles they would have laughed at in their Young Turk days is ultimately kind of painful. Rated R for violence, language and brief sex.  Heavy Metal R  To enjoy the re-release of 1981's animated rock 'n' roll flick, it helps to have teen hormones and a taste for comic-book violence and enormous cartoon breasts. ``Metal'' throws together six stories, loosely tied to the Loch-nar, a glowing green sphere with attitude. The first five stories are quick and casual enough to be brain-dead fun. But the final half-hour bogs down with ``Legend of Taarna,'' an excruciating epic about a babe who saves the universe, dressed in thongs and garters you'd expect from an S&AMP;M branch of Victoria's Secret. The animation may have been cutting edge in '81, but most of it now seems dated. So does the soundtrack: Black Sabbath, Journey, Blue Oyster Cult and others who have good reason to feel ashamed of themselves.

Both give riveting portrayals (though Penn's arrogant, racist redneck is getting most of the attention). The problem is the movie isn't really about either character. It's about an issue _ the pros and cons of the death penalty _ which means it often lapses into the message-conscious style of a '50s TV drama. Still, Robbins manages a shatteringly effective final half hour simply by showing us how capital punishment works in every gruesome and dehumanizing detail. Robbins, Sarandon and Penn are all nominated for Oscars.  Dead Presidents R  A searingly fine sophomore effort by the Hughes brothers (``Menace II Society''). Like an African-Americanized ``The Deer Hunter,'' the movie follows some pals from the Bronx before, during and after their tour of duty in Vietnam. Larenz Tate is the film's indispensable anchor, but he gets fine support from Keith David, N'Bushe Wright and Bokeem Wodbine, among others. The film isn't perfect; by trying to cover so much ground, it skims certain issues, skimps on certain characters. But it's a vital and passionate look at a nation so caught up in the macho-angst of losing a war abroad that it ignored a far more important war at home. Rated R for sex, violence, nudity and language.  Diabolique R  A so-bad-it's-funny remake of the classic Clouzot thriller. At a rundown boys' school, an icy mistress (Sharon Stone) and a dishrag wife (Isabelle Adjani) join forces to murder the man making them both miserable: Adjani's sadistic husband (Chazz Palminteri). The 1955 original was a triumph of atmosphere, character, diabolical wit and outright scare-you-silly shock tactics. The remake reduces everything to the Gothic-thriller plot, some idiotically overripe lesbian innuendo and the campiest dialogue this side of ``Mommie Dearest.'' ``Killing him was a good thing,'' Stone says reassuringly to Adjani. ``Like planting a tree.''  Don't Be a Menace  to South Central While Drinking  Your Juice in the Hood R  A vehicle for Shawn and Marlon Wayans, the two youngest members of the comic family that includes brothers Damon and Keenen Ivory. This ``Airplane!''-style parody takes broad, juvenile jabs at such urban ``message'' movies as ``Menace II Society'' and ``Boyz N the Hood.'' If not all the jokes here work, many of the ones that do have extra weight. When two characters are busted for ``being black on a Friday night'' and taken to a police station equipped with a Rodney King punch-and-kick video game, the movie turns from goofy fun to comedy that tickles and stings. _ Doug Hamilton  Down Periscope PG-13  ``Police Academy'' on a submarine. A very un-``Frasier''-like Kelsey Grammer stars as a subversive sub commander who pulls the requisite group of misfits together into a shipshape team and beats a crazed Bruce Dern at his own war game. Fans of ``Frasier'' may be dismayed by the wanton waste of Grammer's talents _ he coasts through wearing a fixed, avuncular smile _ but he doesn't disgrace himself and there are worse ways to break into movies. Think of it as a good movie for 12-year-olds of all ages. Rated PG-13 for language and mild sexuality.  Ed PG  TV star Matt LeBlanc won't make any new friends with this dismal comedy about a minor-league pitcher who gets a chimpanzee for a teammate. It's a tossup as to what is more odious about this stinker _ the script, which is rife with monkey flatulence jokes, or the dime-store special effects. Ed, the chimp, is actually a brazenly fake mix of animatronics and actors in monkey suits. LeBlanc manages to retain some of the affable charm he displays on ``Friends,'' but it's a struggle. Rated PG for mild language. _ Doug Hamilton  Executive Decision R  A crafty pastiche of Tom Clancy, ``Die Hard'' and ``Airport.'' Kurt Russell plays Dr. David Grant, a civilian intelligence consultant for the U.S. military. An amateur pilot in his spare time, Grant inadvertently ends up the key player in an attempt to thwart the hijacking of a 747 by a Hamas-style terrorist group. Though Steven Seagal makes a brief appearance as the commanding officer of an elite anti-terrorist force, there is a welcome lack of chest-beating here that one might find in the average testosterone-fueled action vehicle. Grant is a thinker, not a warrior. The consultant as conquering hero? This nail-biter could make it a trend. Rated R for language and violence. _ Doug Hamilton  Faithful R  Cher returns to the big screen after nearly a six-year hiatus (her last starring role was in the 1990 comedy ``Mermaids''). The Oscar-winning actress plays a devoted wife who finds out her philandering husband (Ryan O'Neal) has hired a hit man (Chazz Palminteri) to kill her. _ Doug Hamilton  A Family Thing PG  A drama about racial identity. A white Southerner (Robert Duvall) learns his biological mother was black and that he has a brother (James Earl Jones).

They move weekly to clients of the New York Times News Service.  G: General audiences. Nothing that would offend parents if viewed by children.  PG: Parental guidance suggested. May contain some material parents consider inappropriate for young children.  PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for preteens.  R: Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking children.  NC-17: No one under 17 admitted. Replaces the X rating.  NR: Not rated.  Ace Ventura: When  Nature Calls PG-13  All-l-l-RIIIGHTY then. An Ace Ventura sequel was inevitable. Hence this `` . . . and dumber'' follow-up to Jim Carrey's supremely dumb ``Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.'' This time, our intrepid sleuth and animal lover is in deepest, darkest Africa, trying to locate a missing sacred animal and thus prevent tribal warfare. Yes, it's vulgar. Yes, it's idiotic. But what were you expecting? Ace Ventura in ``Schindler's List II''? As purely silly movies go, this one is aces. Rated PG-13 for vulgarity, language and sexual innuendo.  All Dogs Go to Heaven 2 G  In this sequel to the 1989 animated canine adventure, lovable mutt Charlie descends from doggie heaven to retrieve Gabriel's horn. Voices by Charlie Sheen, Sheena Easton and Ernest Borgnine.  The American President PG-13  In Rob Reiner's tangy romantic comedy, Michael Douglas plays widowed President Andrew Shepherd, who woos environmental lobbyist Sydney Wade (Annette Bening). Unfortunately, election year is looming. And Senator Rumson (Richard Dreyfuss) grabs their romance as fodder for his own mudslinging campaign. Regaining his magic touch, Reiner keeps his film balanced between its smarter agenda and its Hollywood fairy-tale touches. Rated PG-13 for language. _ Steve Murray  Angels &AMP; Insects R  Sins and sensibility form the core of this mordant bit of inner- rot Victoriana. Based on a novel by A.S. Byatt, this elegant and subversive film is set on an English country estate in 1862, belonging to the aristocratic Alabasters. A poor naturalist is invited there by the family patriarch (he dabbles in Darwin) and falls for their eldest daughter. Director Philip Haas and his fine cast (headed by Mark Rylance, Patsy Kensit and Kristin Scott Thomas) adapt a tone of wicked fastidiousness while Paul Brown's costumes suggest something out of an entomological opera. A film that floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee. Not rated, but there is graphic sex, nudity and adult themes.  Antonia's Line NR  The Netherlands' official candidate for this year's best foreign-language film Oscar unfolds as a work of magical feminism. With the tone of a fable and the lulling bucolic look of a pastoral fantasy, it tells of one strong woman and her talented descendants, all blessed with self-sufficiency and remarkably little need for men in their lives. _ The New York Times  Babe G  A best picture Oscar nominee. Pig out on this delightfully screwball movie about a piglet who thinks he's a sheepdog. Real- life animals carry the bulk of the story, but they get some high-tech help from computer graphics and superbly lifelike animatronic stand-ins created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Voice talent includes Christine Cavanaugh as Babe and Miriam Margolyes (``The Age of Innocence'') as Fly, Babe's adopted border collie mom.  Before and After PG-13  Before their teenage son (Edward Furlong) is accused of murder, the Ryans (Meryl Streep and Liam Neeson) are a well-heeled, respectable New England couple. After the accusation, they are worried-sick parents, small-town pariahs, amateur lawyers, sometime sleuths, etc. Barbet Schroeder (``Reversal of Fortune'') has made a solid, intelligent film that is less about a murder mystery than about a marriage on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Alas, his careful pacing and the stars' restrained performances are undermined by a tell-all trailer and an uneven script. Still, Streep and Neeson are wonderful to watch as they show us how easily normality can slip into a nightmare. Rated PG-13 for violence, language and adult themes.

The funny parts, all of which have been revealed in the trailer (the dual pregnancies of wife Diane Keaton and daughter Kimberly Williams, Martin's midlife crisis, the return of Martin Short's egregiously effeminate party planner), just aren't that funny. However, the schmaltzy parts, near the end, work like a charm. My advice: Go with someone who is pregnant and enjoy her enjoyment. Somehow, even the dumbest pregnancy cliches seem appealing in your second trimester. Rated PG for mild adult themes and language.  Flirting With Disaster R  Crawling out from under the heap of accolades he received for his cheeky incest flick ``Spanking the Monkey,'' writer/director David O. Russell returns with this comedy about a man's search for his biological parents. Ben Stiller and Patricia Arquette star, with appearances by Mary Tyler Moore and George Segal.  From Dusk Till Dawn R  Robert Rodriguez's hyperviolent vampire flick stars scripter Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney (in a dynamic big-screen crossover) as killer bank robbers who take hostage a retired minister (Harvey Keitel) and his kids (including Juliette Lewis). Bad luck for them, these anti-heroes stop at a Mexican bar _ catering to bikers and bloodsuckers. The long opening setup is vintage Tarantino, full of bloody shocks and sick humor. But once the saloon's staff morph into vampires, ``Dusk'' heads into Sam Raimi's ``Evil Dead'' territory, complete with spewing eyeballs and severed limbs. It's an excuse for a couple of way-talented filmmakers to have gruesome fun. And for most of the time, we do, too. But the squeamish, beware. Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity. _ Steve Murray  Girl 6 R  Typically, Spike Lee works best when he's worked up about something. But this comedy about an aspiring actress (Theresa Randle) who takes a job as a phone-sex girl, shows a frisky, almost larkish side that's as welcome as it is unexpected. Suzan-Lori Parks' script covers some familiar territory and lacks a satisfying resolution, but the director diverts our attention with kicky visuals, heavyweight cameos and some hilarious fantasies. And Randle, with her blend of movie-star sparkle and girl-next-door likability makes an appealing protagonist.  Happy Gilmore PG-13  Adam Sandler goes for the green in this slap-happy golf comedy. He plays the title role, a failed hockey player who discovers his slap shot training has given him a killer golf swing. When his grandmother's house is repossessed by the IRS, he joins the pro golf circuit to make money to buy it back. After last year's mean-spirited ``Billy Madison,'' it's nice to see Sandler display a sweet side. Too bad the movie degenerates into a by-the- numbers rewrite of ``Caddyshack.'' Rated PG-13 for language. _ Doug Hamilton  Heat R  Looks hot on paper (Al Pacino and Robert De Niro together again for the first time!), but on screen, this incoherent, overlong action flick never sputters above a pseudo-simmer. Pacino is a workaholic L.A. cop obsessed with catching De Niro, a career criminal who masterminds complex heists. The movie lasts almost three hours and the two stars spend around 10 minutes together. Maybe writer/director Michael Mann thought he was creating an existential male menopause movie masquerading as a cops and robbers drama. But watching two great actors run, jump and shoot their way through roles they would have laughed at in their Young Turk days is ultimately kind of painful. Rated R for violence, language and brief sex.  Heavy Metal R  To enjoy the re-release of 1981's animated rock 'n' roll flick, it helps to have teen hormones and a taste for comic-book violence and enormous cartoon breasts. ``Metal'' throws together six stories, loosely tied to the Loch-nar, a glowing green sphere with attitude. The first five stories are quick and casual enough to be brain-dead fun. But the final half-hour bogs down with ``Legend of Taarna,'' an excruciating epic about a babe who saves the universe, dressed in thongs and garters you'd expect from an S&AMP;M branch of Victoria's Secret. The animation may have been cutting edge in '81, but most of it now seems dated. So does the soundtrack: Black Sabbath, Journey, Blue Oyster Cult and others who have good reason to feel ashamed of themselves. Rated R for language and cartoon nudity. _ Steve Murray  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960412.0236 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(5thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Hellraiser: Bloodline R  More gloppy than scary, this fourth installment of Clive Barker's ``Hellraiser'' series is actually three 30-minute movies held together by one family's fateful link to a deadly puzzle box that can summon demons from hell (Doug Bradley as Pinhead and seductive Valentina Vargas). As is usual with this kind of picture, most of the creativity has been lavished on the gross parts while matters of plot, character and dialogue are treated as filler. As Dorothy Parker might've said, what stale hell this is.  Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco G  Sassy the Himalayan cat, Chance the American bulldog and Shadow the golden retriever aren't the only things that are lost in this sequel to the 1993 hit. Also missing is its predecessor's lovely animal-lover lyricism. This time, they wander the streets of San Francisco where they're menaced by buffoonish dog thieves and rescued by a gang of streetwise pooches (think, Dead End Dogs). The voice talent _ Sally Field as sarcastic Sassy, Michael J. Fox as irrepressible Chance and Ralph Waite (replacing the late Don Ameche) as dignified Shadow _ is as good as ever, but too many talking anthropomorphic animals spoil the movie. The first film moved you to tears; the sequel is standard babysitter stuff for undemanding kids.  If Lucy Fell R  Don't fall for this flat romantic comedy. Sarah Jessica Parker and Eric Schaeffer (who also wrote the script and directed) play longtime platonic roomies who've made a pact: If neither is romantically involved by the time Parker turns 30, they'll jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. Parker is game in an unflattering part and Elle Macpherson and Ben Stiller are fine in limited roles as potential romantic possibilities. But Schaeffer is a big black hole in the middle of his own picture. The character he's written is funny, sensitive, bright and charismatic in his own muddled way; the character he plays on screen is none of these things. Rated R for sxual situations, nudity and language.  It's My Party R  The party in question is hosted by a gay man named Nick (Eric Roberts), attended by his blood kin (Lee Grant, Marlee Matlin) and unofficial family as well, including gay friends (Bronson Pinchot, Margaret Cho) and an ex-lover (Gregory Harrison). The bash isn't a joyful event. Nick, facing a swift AIDS decline, plans to cap the party with a fatal course of Seconal. Better known for hits like ``The Blue Lagoon'' and ``Grease,'' writer-director Randal Kleiser captures the quicksilver emotions of lives touched by AIDS; the film reels from black comedy to wrenching confrontation. _ Steve Murray  The Journey  of August King  PG-13  The journey here is mostly a spiritual one. Set in the early 1800s and almost biblical in its spare simplicity, John Duigan's (``Flirting'') movie is about a young North Carolina farmer (Jason Patric) who helps a teenage runaway slave (Thandie Newton) escape the clutches of her vengeful master (Larry Drake looking about as ugly as a man can). Patric is nicely restrained as a widower who finds a renewed sense of who he is through his actions, but Newton makes the movie. She resists P.C. revisionism, yet never condescends to her character. It's a breathtakingly delicate performance by a breathtakingly beautiful and talented actress.  Jumanji PG  Robin Williams shows us where the wild things are in this effects-laden family fantasy about a mysterious board game that can bring rhinos into your living room or turn a house into a primeval swamp. Director Joe Johnstone (``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'') knows how to thrill an audience with outsized insects or a stampede down Main Street. But the movie goes on a roll of the dice or two too long. And in-between ``plays,'' things get frankly boring. Bottom line: If you've seen the trailer, you've already seen all the best parts. And those ``best parts'' may be a little scary for littler kids. Johnston does nothing to up the ante; it's like playing Candyland instead of Monopoly. Rated PG for violence.  The Juror R  In this drab legal thriller Demi Moore is a single mom whose life becomes hell when jury duty lands her in the hands of a mob operative, who threatens her life unless she gets his boss acquitted. It's a two-hour string of implausibilities. Of course, we don't go to a thriller expecting to believe every plot twist; half the fun is seeing how outrageous the action can get while still keeping us hooked. But director Brian Gibson can't make us suspend our disbelief, and there's not a scary moment in the movie. Though he's verging on typecasting (see ``Malice''), Baldwin is a pro at playing these sexy psychopaths. But forget about Moore, who blunders through with her usual mix of plucky squared jaw and perfectly timed teardrop. She's a big drag. _ Steve Murray  Leaving Las Vegas R  ``Viva Las Vegas' ' on two dozen downers and a case of Jack Black. Oscar nominee Nicolas Cage is an alcoholic Hollywood screenwriter who pockets his severance check and heads to Vegas to drink himself to death. Oscar nominee Elisabeth Shue is a Vegas hooker who gets hooked on his devil-may-care despair. The movie is a bit of a drunk itself _ given to self-indulgent poses and poetic pretentiousness. But Cage and Shue are willing _ and able _ to do director Mike Figgis' dirty work for him. Their terrific performances leave you feeling unclean and sober. Rated R for sex, language, nudity and drug abuse.  Little Indian, Big City PG  This horrifying French comedy may have been dubbed into English, but abysmal is abysmal in any language. A worldly French businessman (Thierry Lhermitte) brings the son (Ludwig Briand) he didn't know he had back to Paris from the Amazon. Being a rain forest wild child, the mischievous kid scares dad's flighty fiancee, wreaks havoc on the neighborhood and climbs the Eiffel Tower from the outside. If you ever wondered why the French love Jerry Lewis, here's their sense of humor in a nutshell. What's French for stinker?  A Midwinter's Tale R  A seemingly desperate Kenneth Branagh wrote and directed this low- budget, black-and-white comic valentine to actors (ah, the spangled heartbreak!) and the theater (ah, the magic!). It's about a passionate actor (Michael Maloney) who gathers a motley troupe of players to stage ``Hamlet'' in a deserted old church. The show goes on, despite all sorts of difficulties. So do the usual backstage crises, tantrums, romances, etc. Those who really know and love theater have heard this story before _ several times _ and those who don't aren't likely to give a hang. Best recommended to the very, very naive and the very, very stage-struck.  Mr. Holland's Opus PG  The corn is as high as an elephant's eye in this unabashedly sentimental melodrama. And guess what? The cornier it gets, the better the picture works. Oscar nominee Richard Dreyfuss stars as a would-be composer who devotes 30 years of his life to teaching high school music students. Director Stephen Herek has shaped the film into easily absorbed TV-size chunks that are given focus and humor thanks to a solid cast and Dreyfuss' energized, razor-sharp performance. Goodbye, Mr. Chips; hello, Mr. Holland. Rated PG for mild language.  Money Train R  Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson attempt to work the same buddy magic that made their 1992 basketball comedy, ``White Men Can't Jump,'' a hit. Here, their interplay is again easy and amusing, but the movie around them is a cliched jumble. The two play New York subway cops who also are foster brothers. Snipes is the responsible one; Harrelson's the habitual gambler with the Mom-always-liked-you-best chip on his shoulder. When Harrelson's fortunes take a downward turn (due to a laughable series of plot contrivances), he decides to reverse his loser status by robbing the subway's revenue train. Rated R for violence, language and nudity._ Doug Hamilton  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960412.0237 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(6thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Mr. Wrong PG-13  The good news: Ellen DeGeneres moves to the big screen with her angsty charms intact. The bad news: Her movie stinks. Alone on Valentine's night, she runs into a handsome investor (Bill Pullman) who seems heaven sent. Though it soon turns out to be hell. Pullman turns into a crazed, REO Speedwagon- listening, shoplifting clown, determined to wed her at any cost. But the character's about-face has no bearing on reality; it's a gimmick. The only thing worth watching is DeGeneres, drawing on her patented regimen of wary glances and nervous reactions. But instead of getting the sort of lift you get from screwball runaway-bride films of the '30s, ``Mr. Wrong'' only gives you a headache. _ Steve Murray  Muppet Treasure Island G  Yo! Ho! Ho! and a barrel of fun! The Muppets take to the high seas in this loose musical adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic adventure about pirates, buried treasure and a brave lad named Jim Hawkins (Kevin Bishop). Tim Curry co-stars as Long John Silver; he's convincing, though a bit upstaged by his felt colleagues. Kudos all 'round to the usual Mupport support team: director Brian Henson and his hands-on puppeteers, Frank Oz (Miss Piggy), former Atlantan Steve Whitmire (Kermit the Frog), David Goelz (the Great Gonzo) and Jerry Nelson and Kevin Clash as just about everyone else.  Once Upon a Time . . . When We Were Colored PG  Tim Reid directs a talented cast (headed by Al Freeman Jr. and Phylicia Rashad) in a tender, evocative film set in the postwar segregated South. Based on Clifton Taulbert's coming-of-age memoir, the movie spans three decades, celebrating the triumph of the spirit of a generation of African-Americans _ the generation after slavery and before lunch counter sit- ins _ who never got a break coming or going. An honorable, heartfelt picture that implores us to never forget our country's past so that we may be better prepared to shape its future. Rated PG for adult themes.  The Postman NR  A best picture Oscar contender. Set in the early '50s, this bittersweet tale of the unlikely friendship between the world-famous poet Pablo Neruda and Mario, an unworldly fisherman's son, is a deceptively simple film that sneaks up on you. English director Michael Radford (``White Mischief'') brings an outsider's intrigued eye to his Italian setting. But his ultimate focus is on the collision of poet and peasant and how each affects the other.  Race the Sun PG  In this sluggish comedy, a ragtag group of Hawaiian kids builds a solar-powered car and races it in Australia's World Solar Challenge. Until someone makes a movie about a paddle-boat relay, this may stand as the least engrossing race in film history. Imagine squat, roach-shaped vehicles gliding silently at tandem-bike speeds, sputtering and stalling when the sky clouds over. Based on a true story, the movie has modest charms despite its thrill- inhibiting premise. The young actors are fresh-faced and engaging, and Halle Berry, as the kids' teacher, is her usual perky self. _ Doug Hamilton  Rumble in the Bronx R  If you haven't seen a Jackie Chan movie, you don't kow what you've been missing. Oh boy, as Buddy Holly would say. Part Bruce Lee, part Buster Keaton, Chan flips, kicks and leaps through his films with an exuberant kung-fu foolishness that's both death-defying and comic. In this English-dubbed action romp, he plays a Hong Kong cop on vacation in the Bronx (actually, Vancouver, British Columbia) who finds himself at odds with both the local gang and some international jewel thieves. But forget the plot and dialogue and focus on the almost nonstop action. Nimble, daring and pratfall funny, Chan and his movies aren't an acquired taste; they're an instant addiction. Rated R for violence.  Sabrina PG  The difference between the original ``Sabrina,'' a minor Billy Wilder film meant as a shameless showcase for Audrey Hepburn, and Sydney Pollack's remake isn't a matter of Hepburn vs. her replacement, Julia Ormond. It's a matter of Hepburn vs. Harrison Ford. He takes the Humphrey Bogart role of a sour tycoon who steps in when the chauffeur's daughter (Ormond) threatens to distract his easily distracted younger brother (a funny Greg Kinnear) from his impending marriage/corporate merger. The first film was about Hepburn's transformation; this one is about Ford's. It gives it a more serious tone, but it also makes it more satisfying.  Sense and Sensibility PG  This dazzling Jane Austen adaptation is one of the year's best and a contender for a best picture Oscar. Double Oscar nominee (best actress and screenplay) Emma Thompson (who wrote the script) and Kate Winslet (``Heavenly Creatures'') co-star as penniless sisters trying to make their way among the sensible and the senseless in late 18th- century England. Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant and Greg Wise are suitors (of varying and changeable degrees of suitability). The unlikely director is Ang Lee (``Eat Drink Man Woman''), who has delivered a gorgeous film brimming with humor, romance and intelligence _ one that, on its own terms, is as fraught with peril and incident as a Spielberg thrill-flick. Score one for the good guys (and good gals.) And get your Oscar score card ready. Rated PG for mild adult themes.  Seven R  The creative serial killer in this self-conscious gibberish models his gruesome murders after each of the seven deadly sins. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are the cops out to stop him, but there's not much they can do to rescue this one-gimmick movie from quickly wearing out its one gimmick. Rated R for violence and language.  Sgt. Bilko PG-13  Steve Martin slips into Phil Silver's shoes in this film adaptation of the popular '50s sitcom about nutty doings on a Kansas military base. Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman co-star.  The Star Maker NR  Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore returns to a theme he's explored before in his Oscar-winning ``Cinema Paradiso.'' Namely, the magical lure of the movies. In the early '50s, a scam artist (Sergio Castellitto) crisscrosses Sicily in a battered truck. Posing as a talent agent for the studios in Rome, he shoots bogus screen tests for a mere 1500 lira. Like a rougher version of Robert Preston in ``The Music Man,'' he takes what little these dirt-poor people have; at the same time, he gives them something priceless _ a brief respite from their dreary lives. The movie's earthy humanism offers a charming respite of its own and Castellitto makes a perfect dream merchant, ultimately trapped by his own reel-to-real stories. Not rated, but there is sex, nudity and violence.

The movie is nonstop, state-of-the-art, over-the-top Hollywood hokum. And that's meant as a compliment, too. Rated R for violence and language.  Tom and Huck G  A straightforward, well-played adaptation of Mark Twain's classic ``The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.'' Director Peter Hewitt doesn't do much to capture Twain's tone, but he wisely stays out of the way of the story. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is initially too TV- cute as Tom, and Brad Renfro's Huck has been sanitized into a 19th-century homeless boy who just needs to be loved. But they both grow on you. One nice touch: This film's Becky Thatcher is a full head taller than Tom.  Toy Story G  A knockout. The first feature to be fully computer-generated, the all- ages comedy taps our childhood fantasies about the lives toys lead when the bedroom door closes. And it injects grown-up humor by making these Mr. Potato Heads and Slinky Dogs as psychologically diverse as any human. As neurotic as they are nice, the toys fret about their young owner Andy's birthday party, worried about getting edged out by a super-duper new toy. Longtime fave cowboy Woody (voice by Tom Hanks) gets upstaged by newcomer Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), a gleaming plastic hero. In this mock epic, Woody and Buzz go out into the ``real world,'' where they scamper beneath 18-wheelers, flee a toothy canine and survive the sadistic antics of the kid next door. Four years in the making, the film is a jaw-dropping spectacle, with one bravura sequence topping the one before. Give it five minutes, and this laugh-out-loud delight can turn the scroogiest Scrooge into a happy kid. ``Toy Story' will receive an Oscar for special achievement. _ Steve Murray  12 Monkeys R  Terry Gilliam's despair-laced fantasy gets under your skin _ even when you don't exactly know what's going on. Bruce Willis stars as Cole, who claims to be a time traveler from the year 2035. He's sent back to 1996 to discover the cause of a plague that has wiped out 5 billion people. Is he really from the future, or is he insane _ as one psychiatrist (Madeleine Stowe) thinks? As in Gilliam's other films (``Time Bandits,'' ``The Fisher King''), story and emotion come second to visual design and mood, and at times the movie could use a stronger sense of drama and momentum. Still, there's nothing else like it on screen right now. For its strange, spooky visual poetry, ``Monkeys'' is a barrel of glum fun. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  Two Much PG-13  Too long, too dumb and too much of a bad thing. In this double-trouble farce, Antonio Banderas plays a scam artist who gets involved with a wealthy divorced woman (Melanie Griffith), only to find himself falling for her intellectual sister (Daryl Hannah). In order to woo her, he poses as his own bespectacled twin brother. Danny Aiello co-stars as Griffith's very jealous, mob-connected ex. Writer/director Fernando Truebo may have Oscar credentials (he won the foreign-language category in 1994 with ``Belle Epoque''), but in plain English, this movie barely works as a romance and falls apart completely as a comedy. Rated PG-13 for language and sexual situations.  Up Close and Personal PG-13  Score one for golden guy Robert Redford and golden gal Michelle Pfeiffer, who show us what star power is really about in this glossy, high-profile romance with a TV news backdrop. Pfeiffer is the raw youngster who rises from weather girl to network star; Redford is the crusty news director, oozing with integrity, who acts as her mentor (``She eats the lens'') and falls in love with her. Director Jon Avnet and writers Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne have crossed ``A Star Is Born'' with ``Broadcast News'' and come up with a movie that's not as tough or complex as it could be. But with accomplished ``lens-eaters'' like Redford and Pfeiffer on hand, it's the kind of old- fashioned love story that's infatuated audiences for decades. Rated PG-13 for language and adult themes.  Vampire in Brooklyn R  An anemic hybrid of laughs and jolts, Wes Craven's movie stars Eddie Murphy as the vampire Maximillian, who comes to New York with an unplaceable accent and a wardrobe somewhere between Vincent Price and Sunset Boulevard pimp. He's seeking Rita (Angela Bassett), a cop who doesn't realize she's got vampire blood in her veins. Mixing gross-out humor, some sex, some violence, the movie never decides whether it's a comedy, a thriller, a romance _ what? Likewise, Murphy (the hero? the villain?) is stranded, posing in his threads like an International Male model. He also plays a couple of minor characters, and his scene as a Sharpton-like preacher who convinces his flock that ``evil is good'' is one of the few moments when the movie comes alive. Otherwise, it's undead all the way. _ Steve Murray  Waiting to Exhale R  A breath of fresh air. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon play friends in this glossy, well-acted adaptation of Terry McMillan's best seller. Forest Whitaker, better known for his acting in ``Bird'' and ``The Crying Game,'' provides the expert direction. And as for the reported ``male bashing,'' before you take your man, simply ask yourself, is he man enough to take it? Whitaker is. And he's man enough to dish it out, too.

They move weekly to clients of the New York Times News Service.  G: General audiences. Nothing that would offend parents if viewed by children.  PG: Parental guidance suggested.

R: Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking children.  NC-17: No one under 17 admitted. Replaces the X rating.  NR: Not rated.  All Dogs Go to Heaven 2 G  In this sequel to the 1989 animated canine adventure, lovable mutt Charlie descends from doggie heaven to retrieve Gabriel's horn. Voices by Charlie Sheen, Sheena Easton and Ernest Borgnine.  The American President  PG-13  In Rob Reiner's tangy romantic comedy, Michael Douglas plays widowed President Andrew Shepherd, who woos environmental lobbyist Sydney Wade (Annette Bening). Unfortunately, election year is looming. And Senator Rumson (Richard Dreyfuss) grabs their romance as fodder for his own mudslinging campaign. Regaining his magic touch, Reiner keeps his film balanced between its smarter agenda and its Hollywood fairy-tale touches. Rated PG-13 for language. _ Steve Murray  The Birdcage R  There's nothing terribly wrong with Mike Nichols' scene-by-scene remake of the 1978 French farce _ except the intervening 18 years. What used to cause a belly laugh now earns a pleasant chuckle. Robin Williams plays Armand, the relatively butch half of a gay couple. Nathan Lane is Albert, his shrieking drag-queen companion. Chaos arrives when Armand's son Val (Dan Futterman) brings home the parents of his fiancee: ultraconservative Senator Keeley (Gene Hackman) and his wife, Louise (Dianne Wiest). Armand can play it straight, but what to do with the hyper-nelly Albert? The movie ought to take off into the laughing-gas stratosphere of the best farces. But at 20 minutes longer than the French original, the film feels padded. Like ``To Wong Foo,'' the movie feels a little safe, a little tired. Rated R for language and sexual situations. _ Steve Murray  Brain Candy R  This curiously bland film debut by the sketch-comedy troupe Kids in the Hall is hampered by a laborious central plot about the invention of a ``happy pill.'' Kevin McDonald (the strangest Kid) plays a research scientist who develops a drug that cures depression; Mark McKinney (the tallest Kid) plays the CEO of a pharmaceutical company who rushes the untested drug onto the market. What modest pleasures the movie has to offer come from a handful of hilarious asides, including Bruce McCullogh (the funniest Kid) as a grunge rocker who takes the pill and gets happy, and Scott Thompson (the gay Kid) as a straight-arrow father whose arrow is less straight than he lets on. Estranged member David Foley (the squarest Kid) gives an apathetic performance in a few blah roles. _ Doug Hamilton  Braveheart R  As did ``Spartacus'' and ``Dances With Wolves,'' Mel Gibson's tumultuously entertaining epic _ winner of five Academy Awards, including best picture _ extols such old-fashioned virtues as honor, freedom, principle, loyalty and romantic love. Gibson, who also directed, plays William Wallace, a bonnie 13th-century Scotsman who gave the English hell for the hash they tried to make out of his homeland. Rated R for brief nudity and extreme violence.  The Bridges  of Madison County PG-13  Probably the only thing wrong with Clint Eastwood's radiantly romantic movie is Robert James Waller's relentlessly excessive book. And even then, it's no contest. Director/star Eastwood (as the National Geographic photographer) and co-star Meryl Streep (as the unfulfilled farm wife) perform alchemy here; while adhering to whatever it was in Waller's best seller that sold all those copies, they've transformed the material into something far, far better. Rated PG-13 for sexual and adult themes.  Broken Arrow R  Air Force pilot Christian Slater goes up against his buddy John Travolta, who steals two nuclear warheads from their Stealth bomber with a plan to ransom an entire city. Basically, the movie is one long chase in the desert, as Slater teams with perky park ranger Samantha Mathis _ and tracks the bad guys on foot (that must be a small desert). Packed with implausibility, the movie should be a lot of dumb fun. But it can't decide if it's ``Indiana Jones'' or ``Fail-Safe.'' Directed by Hong Kong action czar John Woo, it's played too broadly to make us genuinely tense, but it's not over-the-top enough to make us giddy with thrills. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  Celtic Pride PG-13  Dan Aykroyd and Daniel Stern play rabid Boston Celtics fans who kidnap a rival team's best player (Damon Wayans) right before Game 7 of the NBA finals. Filmed in part in the legendary Boston Garden arena.  Dead Man Walking R  In Tim Robbins' deadly earnest, intermittently powerful death-row drama, a nun (Susan Sarandon) becomes involved with a convicted murderer (Sean Penn). Both give riveting portrayals (though Penn's arrogant, racist redneck is getting most of the attention). The problem is the movie isn't really about either character. It's about an issue _ the pros and cons of the death penalty _ which means it often lapses into the message-conscious style of a '50s TV drama. Still, Robbins manages a shatteringly effective final half hour simply by showing us how capital punishment works in every gruesome and dehumanizing detail. Sarandon just won a best actress Oscar for her performance.  Diabolique R  A so-bad-it's-funny remake of the classic Clouzot thriller. At a run- down boys' school, an icy mistress (Sharon Stone) and a dishrag wife (Isabelle Adjani) join forces to murder the man making them both miserable: Adjani's sadistic husband (Chazz Palminteri). The 1955 original was a triumph of atmosphere, character, diabolical wit and outright scare-you-silly shock tactics. The remake reduces everything to the Gothic-thriller plot, some idiotically overripe lesbian innuendo and the campiest dialogue this side of ``Mommie Dearest.'' ``Killing him was a good thing,'' Stone says reassuringly to Adjani. ``Like planting a tree.'' Rated R for violence, sex, nudity and language.  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960417.0195 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(2ndtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Don't Be a Menace  to South Central While Drinking  Your Juice in the Hood R  A vehicle for Shawn and Marlon Wayans, the two youngest members of the comic family that includes brothers Damon and Keenen Ivory. This ``Airplane!''-style parody takes broad, juvenile jabs at such urban ``message'' movies as ``Menace II Society'' and ``Boyz N the Hood.'' If not all the jokes here work, many of the ones that do have extra weight. When two characters are busted for ``being black on a Friday night'' and taken to a police station equipped with a Rodney King punch-and-kick video game, the movie turns from goofy fun to comedy that tickles and stings. _ Doug Hamilton  Down Periscope PG-13  ``Police Academy'' on a submarine. A very un-``Frasier''-like Kelsey Grammer stars as a subversive sub commander who pulls the requisite group of misfits together into a shipshape team and beats a crazed Bruce Dern at his own war game. Fans of ``Frasier'' may be dismayed by the wanton waste of Grammer's talents _ he coasts through wearing a fixed, avuncular smile _ but he doesn't disgrace himself and there are worse ways to break into movies. Think of it as a good movie for 12-year-olds of all ages. Rated PG-13 for language and mild sexuality.  Ed PG  TV star Matt LeBlanc won't make any new friends with this dismal comedy about a minor-league pitcher who gets a chimpanzee for a teammate. It's a [DH]tossup as to what is more odious about this stinker _ the script, which is rife with monkey flatulence jokes, or the dime-store special effects. Ed, the chimp, is actually a brazenly fake mix of animatronics and actors in monkey suits. LeBlanc manages to retain some of the affable charm he displays on ``Friends,'' but it's a struggle. Rated PG for mild language. _ Doug Hamilton  Executive Decision R  A crafty pastiche of Tom Clancy, ``Die Hard'' and ``Airport.'' Kurt Russell plays Dr. David Grant, a civilian intelligence consultant for the U.S. military. An amateur pilot in his spare time, Grant inadvertently ends up the key player in an attempt to thwart the hijacking of a 747 by a Hamas-style terrorist group. Though Steven Seagal makes a brief appearance as the commanding officer of an elite anti-terrorist force, there is a welcome lack of chest-beating here that one might find in the average testosterone-fueled action vehicle. Grant is a thinker, not a warrior. The consultant as conquering hero? This nail biter could make it a trend. Rated R for language and violence. _ Doug Hamilton  Faithful R  Cher stars as a wealthy woman whose unfaithful husband (Ryan O'Neal) hires a hit man (Chazz Palminteri) to kill her on their 20th anniversary. There's an unavoidable waft of fading careers throughout this limp comedy. Consider: Cher, O'Neal and director Paul Mazursky (who also plays Palminteri's shrink) haven't had a hit among them in the '90s. And Palminteri, whose play provides the basis for the screenplay, has gone from ``The Usual Suspects'' to ``Diabolique'' in less than a year. Like the main characters' marriage, the movie is beyond help. Poor Cher still looks great and retains that camera-seductive something that makes her unique. But she's made infomercials better than this. Rated R for language and adult themes.  A Family Thing PG-13  James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall learn they are brothers under the skin, if not of the skin, in this likable, often touching film from director Richard Pearce (``Country''). A posthumous letter from his nominal mom sends Duvall from small-town Arkansas to big-city Chicago to meet the half-brother (Jones) he never knew he had. The picture sags badly midsection as the two work out their love/hate relationship (it's like ``Grumpy Old Men'' sprinkled with dated race-related jokes). Still, Duvall and Jones are a pure pleasure and their film's simple humor and humanity ultimately win you over. Rated PG-13 for language and adult themes.  Fargo R  A tale of murder, greed and morning sickness in Minnesota, this squalidly hilarious black comedy marks a return to top form for the Coen Brothers (``Blood Simple''). Sleazy car salesman William H. Macy hires two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wealthy wife (they'll split the ransom dad-in-law coughs up). But things go awry and soon Frances McDormand, the very pregnant police chief of Brainerd, Minn. (Home of Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox), is on the case. Loosely based on real incidents that occurred in 1987, the movie exists in some surreal cinematic convergence of Mayberry, Twin Peaks and SCTV. It's a great place for any movie lover to visit _ provided, of course, you bring along a very sick sense of humor. Rated R for sex, nudity, violence and language.  Fear R  Marky Mark is terrifying as a teen psycho in this standard thriller, patterned after ``Fatal Attraction.'' Yes, Marky Mark _ that hip-hoppin', pants-droppin' brother of a New Kid on the Block. (Since turning thespian, he goes by his given name, Mark Wahlberg.) ``Fear'' marks the Markster's first starring role, following smaller parts in ``Renaissance Man'' and ``The Basketball Diaries.'' Judging by his performance, he's got a fine career ahead of him playing bad guys. He's also got a fine foil here in Reese Witherspoon, a nubile young actress with a wise old aura who plays the object of his obsession. Directed in workmanlike fashion by James Foley (``At Close Range''), the movie is predictable from the get-go. Still, it builds suspense nicely and it scores points for not tacking on one of those psycho-rises-from-the-dead endings. _ Doug Hamilton  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960417.0196 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(3rdtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Flirting With Disaster R  Ben Stiller goes in search of his biological parents in David O. Russell's hilarious comedy. With his wife (Patricia Arquette) and a psychobabbling therapist (Tea Leoni) from the adoption agency in tow, Stiller crisscrosses the country looking for his roots. What he finds are enough dysfunctional-family entanglements to choke Jerry Springer. As Stiller's adopted parents, Mary Tyler Moore and George Segal exhibit a finely sifted neuroticism worthy of ``Seinfeld'' while Lily Tomlin and Alan Alda play acid- head remnants from the '60s. The movie loses some of its fizz in its last half- hour; even so, Russell may be the most bracingly original satirist to hit the movies since Albert Brooks. Rated R for language and adult themes.  The Flower of My Secret R  Pedro Almodovar's best film since ``Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' this comedy-drama focuses on the 40ish Leo (Marisa Paredes) whose surface-perfect life is crumbling. Professionally, she's sick of the successful romance novels she writes under a pseudonym. Personally, her husband's avoidance behavior has become unavoidably obvious. Eschewing the director's trademark florid outrageousness, ``Flower'' comes from a kinder, more humane perspective. A transitional work enlivened by Almodovar's intelligence and visual flair, this is a brave new whirl from a filmmaker who's never been afraid of risks. Rated R for language and brief sexuality.  From Dusk Till Dawn R  Robert Rodriguez's hyperviolent vampire flick stars scripter Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney (in a dynamic big-screen crossover) as killer bank robbers who kidnap a retired minister (Harvey Keitel) and his kids (including Juliette Lewis). Bad luck for them, these anti-heroes stop at a Mexican bar _ catering to bikers and bloodsuckers. The long opening setup is vintage Tarantino, full of bloody shocks and sick humor. But once the saloon's staff morph into vampires, ``Dusk'' heads into Sam Raimi's ``Evil Dead'' territory, complete with spewing eyeballs and severed limbs. It's an excuse for a couple of way-talented filmmakers to have gruesome fun. And for most of the time, we do, too. But the squeamish, beware. Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity. _ Steve Murray  Georgia R  A daring downer of a film about two sisters. One sings; the other doesn't. But that doesn't mean that she doesn't want to sing, with every desperate, self- destructive nerve in her drug-addled body. Mare Winningham is the title character, a centered superstar with a golden voice; Jennifer Jason Leigh is her sister, Sadie. Sort of Sid Vicious' psychic twin, she burns with neediness and ambition. Ulu Grosbard directed from a script by Barbara Turner. The strong supporting cast includes John Doe (of X) and Ted Levine. A movie for people who take their movies seriously.  Ghost in the Shell NR  Futuristic Japanese animation fun based on a series of comic books by Masamune Shirow, creator of the ``Appleseed'' and ``Dominion'' books. This one follows the Puppet Master, a cyber-generated secret agent fighting to establish a ``true physical existence'' for itself.  Girl 6 R  Typically, Spike Lee works best when he's worked up about something. But this comedy about an aspiring actress (Theresa Randle) who takes a job as a phone-sex girl, shows a frisky, almost larkish side that's as welcome as it is unexpected. Suzan-Lori Parks' script covers some familiar territory and lacks a satisfying resolution, but the director diverts our attention with kicky visuals, heavyweight cameos and some hilarious fantasies. And Randle, with her blend of movie-star sparkle and girl- next-door likability makes an appealing protagonist. Rated R for sex, language, nudity and adult themes.  Happy Gilmore PG_13  Adam Sandler goes for the green in this slap-happy golf comedy. He plays the title role, a failed hockey player who discovers his slap shot training has given him a killer golf swing. When his grandmother's house is repossessed by the IRS, he joins the pro golf circuit to make money to buy it back. After last year's mean-spirited ``Billy Madison,'' it's nice to see Sandler display a sweet side. Too bad the movie degenerates into a by-the-numbers rewrite of ``Caddyshack.'' Rated PG-13 for language. _ Doug Hamilton  Hellraiser: Bloodline R  More gloppy than scary, this fourth installment of Clive Barker's ``Hellraiser'' series is actually three 30-minute movies held together by one family's fateful link to a deadly puzzle box that can summon demons from hell (Doug Bradley as Pinhead and seductive Valentina Vargas). As is usual with this kind of picture, most of the creativity has been lavished on the gross parts while matters of plot, character and dialogue are treated as filler. As Dorothy Parker might've said, what stale hell this is.  Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco G  Sassy the Himalayan cat, Chance the American bulldog and Shadow t he golden retriever aren't the only things that are lost in this sequel to the 1993 hit. Also missing is its predecessor's lovely animal-lover lyricism. This time, they wander the streets of San Francisco where they're menaced by buffoonish dog thieves and rescued by a gang of streetwise pooches (think, Dead End Dogs). The voice talent _ Sally Field as sarcastic Sassy, Michael J. Fox as irrepressible Chance and Ralph Waite (replacing the late Don Ameche) as dignified Shadow _ is as good as ever, but too many talking animals spoil the movie. The first film moved you to tears; the sequel is standard baby-sitter stuff for undemanding kids.  It's My Party R  The party in question is hosted by a gay man named Nick (Eric Roberts), attended by his blood kin (Lee Grant, Marlee Matlin) and unofficial family as well, including gay friends (Bronson Pinchot, Margaret Cho) and an ex-lover (Gregory Harrison). The bash isn't a joyful event. Nick, facing a swift AIDS decline, plans to cap the party with a fatal course of Seconal. Better known for hits like ``The Blue Lagoon'' and ``Grease,'' writer-director Randal Kleiser captures the quicksilver emotions of lives touched by AIDS; the film reels from black comedy to wrenching confrontation. Rated R for language and adult themes. _ Steve Murray  James and the Giant Peach PG  Not the pits, but not peachy keen, either. Roald Dahl's comically macabre tale of a little boy and his buggy pals who sail a giant peach across the ocean has been turned into a classy but cold fantasy featuring the voices of Susan Sarandon (as a Garbo-ish spider), Richard Dreyfuss (a street-tough centipede) and David Thewlis (a woe-is-me earthworm). A good deal of craft and imagination have gone into this film, but everything from the script to Randy Newman's score suffers by comparison to ``Toy Story.'' Certainly kid-worthy, but grown-ups who've made the trek north on I-85 may find themselves less tickled by the movie than by the titular fruit's resemblance to its country cousin outside Gaffney, S.C.  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960417.0197 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(4thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Jane Eyre PG  Opulent and intelligently acted, Franco Zeffirelli's version of Charlotte Bronte's famous Gothic love story is as emotionally acute as it is picture-pretty. The title role is shared by Oscar winner Anna Paquin as the young Jane and Charlotte Gainsbourg as the 20ish Jane who accepts a job as a governess at remote Thornfield Hall. William Hurt is unexpectedly fine as her enigmatic employer, the brooding Mr. Rochester. Unlike the director's famous ``Romeo and Juliet'' in the '60s, there's nothing radical here. Still, this is a sure-footed, satisfying film, one that reminds us that Bronte's tale is as much a ghost story as it is a romance. If you're in the mood for some lush tortured-lovers escapism, you could hardly do better.  Jumanji PG  Robin Williams shows us where the wild things are in this effects-laden family fantasy about a mysterious board game that can bring rhinos into your living room or turn a house into a primeval swamp. Director Joe Johnstone (``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'') knows how to thrill an audience with outsized insects or a stampede down Main Street. But the movie goes on a roll of the dice or two too long. And in-between ``plays,'' things get frankly boring. Bottom line: If you've seen the trailer, you've already seen all the best parts. And those ``best parts'' may be a little scary for littler kids. Johnston does nothing to up the ante; it's like playing Candyland instead of Monopoly. Rated PG for violence.  Leaving Las Vegas R  ``Viva Las Vegas'' on two dozen downers and a case of Jack Black. Oscar nominee Nicolas Cage is an alcoholic Hollywood screenwriter who pockets his severance check and heads to Vegas to drink himself to death. Oscar nominee Elisabeth Shue is a Vegas hooker who gets hooked on his devil-may-care despair. The movie is a bit of a drunk itself _ given to self-indulgent poses and poetic pretentiousness. But Cage and Shue are willing _ and able _ to do director Mike Figgis' dirty work for him. Their terrific performances leave you feeling unclean and sober. Rated R for sex, language, nudity and drug abuse.  Mr. Holland's Opus PG  The corn is as high as an elephant's eye in this unabashedly sentimental melodrama. And guess what? The cornier it gets, the better the picture works. Oscar nominee Richard Dreyfuss stars as a would-be composer who devotes 30 years of his life to teaching high school music students. Director Stephen Herek has shaped the film into easily absorbed TV-size chunks that are given focus and humor thanks to a solid cast and Dreyfuss' energized, razor-sharp performance. Goodbye, Mr. Chips; hello, Mr. Holland. Rated PG for mild language.  Mrs. Winterbourne PG- 13  Ricki Lake takes a break from the family feuds and love-gone-wrong tales on her highly rated TV talk show to star in this romantic comedy with Shirley MacLaine and Brendan Fraser. Lake plays a penniless pregnant woman who assumes the identity of a wealthy train crash victim.  Money Train R  Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson attempt to work the same buddy magic that made their 1992 basketball comedy, ``White Men Can't Jump,'' a hit. Here, their interplay is again easy and amusing, but the movie around them is a cliched jumble. The two play New York subway cops who also are foster brothers. Snipes is the responsible one; Harrelson's the habitual gambler with the Mom-always-liked-you- best chip on his shoulder. When Harrelson's fortunes take a downward turn (due to a laughable series of plot contrivances), he decides to reverse his loser status by robbing the subway's revenue train. Rated R for violence, language and nudity._ Doug Hamilton  Mr. Wrong PG-13  The good news: Ellen DeGeneres moves to the big screen with her angsty charms intact. The bad news: Her movie stinks. Alone on Valentine's night, she runs into a handsome investor (Bill Pullman) who seems heaven sent. Though it soon turns out to be hell. Pullman turns into a crazed, REO Speedwagon-listening, shoplifting clown, determined to wed her at any cost. But the character's about-face has no bearing on reality; it's a gimmick. The only thing worth watching is DeGeneres, drawing on her patented regimen of wary glances and nervous reactions. But instead of getting the sort of lift you get from screwball runaway-bride films of the '30s, ``Mr. Wrong'' only gives you a headache. _ Steve Murray  Muppet Treasure Island G  Yo! Ho! Ho! and a barrel of fun! The Muppets take to the high seas in this loose musical adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic adventure about pirates, buried treasure and a brave lad named Jim Hawkins (Kevin Bishop). Tim Curry co-stars as Long John Silver; he's convincing, though a bit upstaged by his felt colleagues. Kudos all 'round to the usual Mupport support team: director Brian Henson and his hands-on puppeteers, Frank Oz (Miss Piggy), former Atlantan Steve Whitmire (Kermit the Frog), David Goelz (the Great Gonzo) and Jerry Nelson and Kevin Clash as just about everyone else.  Oliver &AMP; Company G  Andrew and company thought ``Oliver &AMP; Company'' was just swell and since Andrew is 5, I must defer, in part, to his expert opinion. However, adult connoisseurs of Disney animated magic will be bored silly _ or downright disgusted _ by this slight tale, very slightly based on ``Oliver Twist.'' Oliver is an orphaned kitten and Fagin's gang is a bunch of Manhattan mutts, most of whom are more crudely drawn (and crudely acted) versions of the jailhouse crowd in ``Lady and the Tramp.'' Take the kids, if they insist, but find yourself something else to see while they're in there.  Once Upon a Time . . . When We Were Colored P G  Tim Reid directs a talented cast (headed by Al Freeman Jr. and Phylicia Rashad) in a tender, evocative film set in the postwar segregated South. Based on Clifton Taulbert's coming-of-age memoir, the movie spans three decades, celebrating the triumph of the spirit of a generation of African-Americans _ the generation after slavery and before lunch counter sit-ins _ who never got a break coming or going. An honorable, heartfelt picture that implores us to never forget our country's past so that we may be better prepared to shape its future. Rated PG for adult themes.  The Postman NR  Set in the early '50s, this bittersweet tale of the unlikely friendship between the world-famous poet Pablo Neruda and Mario, an unworldly fisherman's son, is a deceptively simple film that sneaks up on you. English director Michael Radford (``White Mischief'') brings an outsider's intrigued eye to his Italian setting. But his ultimate focus is on the collision of poet and peasant and how each affects the other.  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960417.0198 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(5thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Primal Fear R  A sleek, solid courtroom thriller directed by Emmy-winner Gregory Hoblit  and based on William Diehl's best seller. Richard Gere stars as a high-powered attorney who defends a stuttering altar boy (Edward Norton) accused of murdering an archbishop. The kind of lawyer who spends as much time on magazine covers as he does in the courtroom, Gere doesn't care if the kid is guilty; he simply wants to win a front-page-friendly case. The top-notch supporting cast includes Laura Linney, John Mahoney, Alfre Woodard and John Mahoney. But the buzz is going to be about newcomer Norton, who gives the kind of electrifying performance that jump-starts careers in a big way. Rated R for violence and language.  Race the Sun PG  In this sluggish comedy, a ragtag group of Hawaiian kids builds a solar-powered car and races it in Australia's World Solar Challenge. Until someone makes a movie about a paddle-boat relay, this may stand as the least engrossing race in film history. Imagine squat, roach-shaped vehicles gliding silently at tandem-bike speeds, sputtering and stalling when the sky clouds over. Based on a true story, the movie has modest charms despite its thrill-inhibiting premise. The young actors are fresh-faced and engaging, and Halle Berry, as the kids' teacher, is her usual perky self. Rated PG for mild language. _ Doug Hamilton  Rumble in the Bronx R  If you haven't seen a Jackie Chan movie, you don't know what you've been missing. Oh boy, as Buddy Holly would say. Part Bruce Lee, part Buster Keaton, Chan flips, kicks and leaps through his films with an exuberant kung-fu foolishness that's both death-defying and comic. In this English-dubbed action romp, he plays a Hong Kong cop on vacation in the Bronx (actually, Vancouver, British Columbia) who finds himself at odds with both the local gang and some international jewel thieves. But forget the plot and dialogue and focus on the almost nonstop action. Nimble, daring and pratfall funny, Chan and his movies aren't an acquired taste; they're an instant addiction. Rated R for violence.  Sabrina PG  The difference between the original ``Sabrina,'' a minor Billy Wilder film meant as a shameless showcase for Audrey Hepburn, and Sydney Pollack's remake isn't a matter of Hepburn vs. her replacement, Julia Ormond. It's a matter of Hepburn vs. Harrison Ford. He takes the Humphrey Bogart role of a sour tycoon who steps in when the chauffeur's daughter (Ormond) threatens to distract his easily distracted younger brother (a funny Greg Kinnear) from his impending marriage/corporate merger. The first film was about Hepburn's transformation; this one is about Ford's. It gives it a more serious tone, but it also makes it more satisfying.  Sense and Sensibility PG  Oscar winner (best adapted screenplay) Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet (``Heavenly Creatures'') co-star as penniless sisters trying to make their way among the sensible and the senseless in late 18th-century England. Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant and Greg Wise are suitors (of varying and changeable degrees of suitability). The unlikely director is Ang Lee (``Eat Drink Man Woman''), who has delivered a gorgeous film brimming with humor, romance and intelligence _ one that, on its own terms, is as fraught with peril and incident as a Spielberg thrill-flick. Score one for the good guys (and good gals.) Rated PG for mild adult themes.  Seven R  The creative serial killer in this self-conscious gibberish models his gruesome murders after each of the seven deadly sins. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are the cops out to stop him, but there's not much they can do to rescue this one-gimmick movie from quickly wearing out its one gimmick. Rated R for violence and language.  Sgt. Bilko PG  The laughs are AWOL in this frenzied remake of the some-would-say-classic '50s sitcom ``The Phil Silvers Show'' (called ``Sgt. Bilko'' in syndication). Steve Martin takes over the role of Army Sgt. Ernie Bilko, the scheming officer in charge of the motor pool at fictional Fort Baxter. Martin works overtime to combine Silvers' bluster with his own ``wild and crazy'' mannerisms. It's an annoyingly hyper performance. Phil Hartman steals the show as Bilko's nasty nemesis, Major Thorn. Few comedic actors can make uptight and overbearing seem so effortlessly funny. Rated PG-13 for language. _ Doug Hamilton  The Substitute R  ``Death Wish'' meets ``To Sir With Love.'' This action-drama stars Tom Berenger as a mercenary soldier who poses as a substitute teacher at a tough urban school to uncover the gang who assaulted his girlfriend.  A Thin Line Between Love &AMP; Hate R  Martin Lawrence wrote, directed and stars in this comedy about a ladies' man who tangles with the wrong lady (Lynn Whitfield). The idea, apparently, was to do a comic spin on ``Waiting to Exhale'' _ ``Waiting to Explode,'' perhaps. But there's a thin line between amusing macho bluster and nasty piggishness and Lawrence blurs it too often. Further, while Lawrence has a certain limited appeal, Whitfield has 10 times the presence and 100 times the talent. He's a bargain basement Eddie Murphy; she's in Angela Bassett's league. Rated R for language, sex and sexual innuendo.

They move weekly to clients of the New York Times News Service.  G: General audiences. Nothing that would offend parents if viewed by children.  PG: Parental guidance suggested.

Voices by Charlie Sheen, Sheena Easton and Ernest Borgnine. Not reviewed.  The American President  PG-13  In Rob Reiner's tangy romantic comedy, Michael Douglas plays widowed President Andrew Shepherd, who woos environmental lobbyist Sydney Wade (Annette Bening). Unfortunately, election year is looming. And Senator Rumson (Richard Dreyfuss) grabs their romance as fodder for his own mudslinging campaign. Regaining his magic touch, Reiner keeps his film balanced between its smarter agenda and its Hollywood fairy-tale touches. Rated PG-13 for language. _ Steve Murray  Anne Frank Remembered PG  This Oscar-winning documentary reveals the flesh -and-blood teen behind the most famous victim of Hitler's Final Solution. Through interviews, photos, old newsreels and one startling 1941 home movie, Jon Blair gives us new insights into and appreciation for the girl whose diary gave a human face to the Holocaust. He also pays a much-deserved tribute to Miep Gies, the astonishingly heroic Dutchwoman who risked her life for the Franks and saved Anne's diary for posterity. Deftly narrated by Kenneth Branagh, with Glenn Close reading diary excerpts, the movie may sound like a total downer, but it isn't. It's both oddly uplifting and a poignant reminder that, if history is written by winners, it must be counted as some sort of triumph that one young girl's words have long outlived Hitler's proposed 1,000-year Reich.  The Birdcage R  There's nothing terribly wrong with Mike Nichols' scene-by-scene remake of the 1978 French farce _ except the intervening 18 years. What used to cause a belly laugh now earns a pleasant chuckle. Robin Williams plays Armand, the relatively butch half of a gay couple. Nathan Lane is Albert, his shrieking drag-queen companion. Chaos arrives when Armand's son Val (Dan Futterman) brings home the parents of his fiancee: ultraconservative Senator Keeley (Gene Hackman) and his wife, Louise (Dianne Wiest). Armand can play it straight, but what to do with the hyper-nelly Albert? The movie ought to take off into the laughing-gas stratosphere of the best farces. But at 20 minutes longer than the French original, the film feels padded. Like ``To Wong Foo,'' the movie feels a little safe, a little tired. Rated R for language and sexual situations. _ Steve Murray  Bloodsport 2 R  You don't have to have seen ``Bloodsport'' to skip ``Bloodsport II.'' A hunky thief (Daniel Bernhardt) is sent to prison where a mentor/inmate (James Hong) teaches him serenity and some kick-butt moves. Bernhardt is then sprung by a wealthy businessman (Pat Morita) so he can compete in an anything-goes martial arts contest. Recommended to only the most undiscriminating martial arts fans.  Brain Candy R  This curiously bland film debut by the sketch-co medy troupe Kids in the Hall is hampered by a laborious central plot about the invention of a ``happy pill.'' Kevin McDonald (the strangest Kid) plays a research scientist who develops a drug that cures depression; Mark McKinney (the tallest Kid) plays the CEO of a pharmaceutical company who rushes the untested drug onto the market. What modest pleasures the movie has to offer come from a handful of hilarious asides, including Bruce McCullogh (the funniest Kid) as a grunge rocker and Scott Thompson (the gay Kid) as a straight- arrow father whose arrow is less straight than he lets on. Estranged member David Foley (the squarest Kid) gives an apathetic performance in a few blah roles. Rated R for language, sexual innuendo and adult themes. _ Doug Hamilton .  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960426.0212 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(2ndtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Braveheart R  As did ``Spartacus'' and ``Dances With Wolves,'' Mel Gibson's tumultuously entertaining epic _ winner of five Academy Awards, including best picture _ extols such old-fashioned virtues as honor, freedom, principle, loyalty and romantic love. Gibson, who also directed, plays William Wallace, a bonnie 13th-century Scotsman who gave the English hell for the hash they tried to make out of his homeland. Rated R for brief nudity and extreme violence.  Broken Arrow R  Air Force pilot Christian Slater goes up against his buddy John Travolta, who steals two nuclear warheads from their Stealth bomber with a plan to ransom an entire city. Basically, the movie is one long chase in the desert, as Slater teams with perky park ranger Samantha Mathis _ and tracks the bad guys on foot (that must be a small desert). Packed with implausibility, the movie should be a lot of dumb fun. But it can't decide if it's ``Indiana Jones'' or ``Fail-Safe.'' Directed by Hong Kong action czar John Woo, it's played too broadly to make us genuinely tense, but it's not over- the-top enough to make us giddy with thrills. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  Celtic Pride PG-13  Septic movie. The luck of the Irish is about as bad as it can get in this excruciating noncomedy about a couple of fanatic Boston Celtics fans (Daniel Stern and Dan Aykroyd) who kidnap the star player (Damon Wayans) of a rival team so their beloved Celtics can win Game 7 of the NBA Finals. Over-the-top fandom is a fairly funny premise for a film, but this one soon turns tedious and predictable. Worse, its simple plot and broad humor would make it a good film for 10-year-olds, but the filmmakers have drenched it in vulgar language and unsubtle sexual innuendo (hence the PG- 13 rating). Why anyone would want to make something like this is almost as puzzling as why anyone would want to sit through it.  Dead Man R  Hip filmmaker Jim Jarmusch brings his inimitable deadpan style to the western genre with this comic tale set in the 19th century about a young accountant (Johnny Depp) who befriends a Native American outcast (Gary Farmer). _ Doug Hamilton  Dead Man Walking R  In Tim Robbins' deadly earnest, intermittently powerful death-row drama, a nun (Susan Sarandon) becomes involved with a convicted murderer (Sean Penn). Both give riveting portrayals (though Penn's arrogant, racist redneck is getting most of the attention). The problem is the movie isn't really about either character. It's about an issue _ the pros and cons of the death penalty _ which means it often lapses into the message-conscious style of a '50s TV drama. Still, Robbins manages a shatteringly effective final half hour simply by showing us how capital punishment works in every gruesome and dehumanizing detail. Sarandon just won a best actress Oscar for her performance.  Diabolique R  A so-bad-it's-funny remake of the classic Clouzot thriller. At a run-down boys' school, an icy mistress (Sharon Stone) and a dishrag wife (Isabelle Adjani) join forces to murder the man making them both miserable: Adjani's sadistic husband (Chazz Palminteri). The 1955 original was a triumph of atmosphere, character, diabolical wit and outright scare-you-silly shock tactics. The remake reduces everything to the Gothic-thriller plot, some idiotically overripe lesbian innuendo and the campiest dialogue this side of ``Mommie Dearest.'' ``Killing him was a good thing,'' Stone says reassuringly to Adjani. ``Like planting a tree.'' Rated R for violence, sex, nudity and language.  Don't Be a Menace  to South Central While Drinking  Your Juice in the Hood R  A vehicle for Shawn and Marlon Wayans, the two youngest members of the comic family that includes brothers Damon and Keenen Ivory. This ``Airplane!''-style parody takes broad, juvenile jabs at such urban ``message'' movies as ``Menace II Society'' and ``Boyz N the Hood.'' If not all the jokes here work, many of the ones that do have extra weight. When two characters are busted for ``being black on a Friday night'' and taken to a police station equipped with a Rodney King punch-and-kick video game, the movie turns from goofy fun to comedy that tickles and stings. _ Doug Hamilton  Down Periscope PG-13  ``Police Academy'' on a submarine. A very un-``Frasier''-like Kelsey Grammer stars as a subversive sub commander who pulls the requisite group of misfits together into a shipshape team and beats a crazed Bruce Dern at his own war game. Fans of ``Frasier'' may be dismayed by the wanton waste of Grammer's talents _ he coasts through wearing a fixed, avuncular smile _ but he doesn't disgrace himself and there are worse ways to break into movies. Think of it as a good movie for 12-year-olds of all ages. Rated PG-13 for language and mild sexuality.  Ed PG  TV star Matt LeBlanc won't make any new friends with this dismal comedy about a minor-league pitcher who gets a chimpanzee for a teammate. It's a tossup as to what is more odious about this stinker _ the script, which is rife with monkey flatulence jokes, or the dime-store special effects. Ed, the chimp, is actually a brazenly fake mix of animatronics and actors in monkey suits. LeBlanc manages to retain some of the affable charm he displays on ``Friends,'' but it's a struggle. Rated PG for mild language. _ Doug Hamilton  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960426.0213 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(3rdtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Executive Decision R  A crafty pastiche of Tom Clancy, ``Die Hard'' and ``Airport.'' Kurt Russell plays Dr. David Grant, a civilian intelligence consultant for the U.S. military. An amateur pilot in his spare time, Grant inadvertently ends up the key player in an attempt to thwart the hijacking of a 747 by a Hamas-style terrorist group. Though Steven Seagal makes a brief appearance as the commanding officer of an elite anti-terrorist force, there is a welcome lack of chest-beating here that one might find in the average testosterone-fueled action vehicle. Grant is a thinker, not a warrior. The consultant as conquering hero? This nail biter could make it a trend. Rated R for language and violence. _ Doug Hamilton  Faithful R  Cher stars as a wealthy woman whose unfaithful husband (Ryan O'Neal) hires a hit man (Chazz Palminteri) to kill her on their 20th anniversary. There's an unavoidable waft of fading careers throughout this limp comedy. Consider: Cher, O'Neal and director Paul Mazursky (who also plays Palminteri's shrink) haven't had a hit among them in the '90s. And Palminteri, whose play provides the basis for the screenplay, has gone from ``The Usual Suspects'' to ``Diabolique'' in less than a year. Like the main characters' marriage, the movie is beyond help. Poor Cher still looks great and retains that camera-seductive something that makes her unique. But she's made infomercials better than this. Rated R for language and adult themes.  A Family Thing PG-13  James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall learn they are brothers under the skin, if not of the skin, in this likable, often touching film from director Richard Pearce (``Country''). A posthumous letter from his nominal mom sends Duvall from small-town Arkansas to big-city Chicago to meet the half-brother (Jones) he never knew he had. The picture sags badly midsection as the two work out their love/hate relationship (it's like ``Grumpy Old Men'' sprinkled with dated race-related jokes). Still, Duvall and Jones are a pure pleasure and their film's simple humor and humanity ultimately win you over. Rated PG-13 for language and adult themes.  Fargo R  A tale of murder, greed and morning sickness in Minnesota, this squalidly hilarious black comedy marks a return to top form for the Coen Brothers (``Blood Simple''). Sleazy car salesman William H. Macy hires two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wealthy wife (they'll split the ransom dad-in- law coughs up). But things go awry and soon Frances McDormand, the very pregnant police chief of Brainerd, Minn. (Home of Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox), is on the case. Loosely based on real incidents that occurred in 1987, the movie exists in some surreal cinematic convergence of Mayberry, Twin Peaks and SCTV. It's a great place for any movie lover to visit _ provided, of course, you bring along a very sick sense of humor. Rated R for sex, nudity, violence and language.  Fear R  Marky Mark is terrifying as a teen psycho in this standard thriller, patterned after ``Fatal Attraction.'' Yes, Marky Mark _ that hip-hoppin', pants-droppin' brother of a New Kid on the Block. (Since turning thespian, he goes by his given name, Mark Wahlberg.) ``Fear'' marks the Markster's first starring role, following smaller parts in ``Renaissance Man'' and ``The Basketball Diaries.'' Judging by his performance, he's got a fine career ahead of him playing bad guys. He's also got a fine foil here in Reese Witherspoon, a nubile young actress with a wise old aura who plays the object of his obsession. Predictable from the get-go, the movie still builds suspense nicely and scores points for not tacking on one of those psycho-rises-from-the- dead endings. Rated R for violence, sex and language. _ Doug Hamilton  Flirting With Disaster R  Ben Stiller goes in search of his biological parents in David O. Russell's hilarious comedy. With his wife (Patricia Arquette) and a psychobabbling therapist (Tea Leoni) from the adoption agency in tow, Stiller crisscrosses the country looking for his roots. What he finds are enough dysfunctional-family entanglements to choke Jerry Springer. As Stiller's adopted parents, Mary Tyler Moore and George Segal exhibit a finely sifted neuroticism worthy of ``Seinfeld'' while Lily Tomlin and Alan Alda play acid-head remnants from the '60s. The movie loses some of its fizz in its last half-hour; even so, Russell may be the most bracingly original satirist to hit the movies since Albert Brooks. Rated R for language and adult themes.  The Flower of My Secret R  Pedro Almodovar's best film since ``Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' this comedy-drama focuses on the 40ish Leo (Marisa Paredes) whose surface-perfect life is crumbling. Professionally, she's sick of the successful romance novels she writes under a pseudonym. Personally, her husband's avoidance behavior has become unavoidably obvious. Eschewing the director's trademark florid outrageousness, ``Flower'' comes from a kinder, more humane perspective. A transitional work enlivened by Almodovar's intelligence and visual flair, this is a brave new whirl from a filmmaker who's never been afraid of risks. Rated R for language and brief sexuality.

Bad luck for them, these anti-heroes stop at a Mexican bar _ catering to bikers and bloodsuckers. The long opening setup is vintage Tarantino, full of bloody shocks and sick humor. But once the saloon's staff morph into vampires, ``Dusk'' heads into Sam Raimi's ``Evil Dead'' territory, complete with spewing eyeballs and severed limbs. It's an excuse for a couple of way-talented filmmakers to have gruesome fun. And for most of the time, we do, too. But the squeamish, beware. Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity. _ Steve Murray  Ghost in the Shell NR  Japanimation is just a ghost of its over-the-top self in this philosophical animated feature that strives to combine Sartre and ``Speed Racer.'' Based on a hugely popular manga (comic book), the movie sends its ``Femme Nikita''-ish heroine (she's part well- endowed human, part cyborg) after a superspy-cum-computer virus known as the Puppet Master. Offering atmospheric visuals instead of the adrenalin-rush violence of an ``Akita,'' the film's idea of the soul (ghost) as a Web site is intriguing. But one-dimensional characters and a plot so techno-convoluted that only computer nerds could understand half the dialogue are drawbacks.  Girl 6 R  Typically, Spike Lee works best when he's worked up about something. But  this comedy about an aspiring actress (Theresa Randle) who takes a job as a phone-sex girl, shows a frisky, almost larkish side that's as welcome as it is unexpected. Suzan-Lori Parks' script covers some familiar territory and lacks a satisfying resolution, but the director diverts our attention with kicky visuals, heavyweight cameos and some hilarious fantasies. And Randle, with her blend of movie-star sparkle and girl-next-door likability makes an appealing protagonist. Rated R for sex, language, nudity and adult themes.  Happy Gilmore PG_13  Adam Sandler goes for the green in this slap-happy golf comedy. He plays the title role, a failed hockey player who discovers his slap shot training has given him a killer golf swing. When his grandmother's house is repossessed by the IRS, he joins the pro golf circuit to make money to buy it back. After last year's mean-spirited ``Billy Madison,'' it's nice to see Sandler display a sweet side. Too bad the movie degenerates into a by-the- numbers rewrite of ``Caddyshack.'' Rated PG-13 for language. _ Doug Hamilton  Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco G  Sassy the Himalayan cat, Chance the American bulldog and Shadow the golden retriever aren't the only things that are lost in this sequel to the 1993 hit. Also missing is its predecessor's lovely animal-lover lyricism. This time, they wander the streets of San Francisco where they're menaced by buffoonish dog thieves and rescued by a gang of streetwise pooches (think, Dead End Dogs). The voice talent _ Sally Field as sarcastic Sassy, Michael J. Fox as irrepressible Chance and Ralph Waite (replacing the late Don Ameche) as dignified Shadow _ is as good as ever, but too many talking animals spoil the movie. The first film moved you to tears; the sequel is standard baby-sitter stuff for undemanding kids.  James and the Giant Peach PG  Not the pits, but not peachy keen, either. R oald Dahl's comically macabre tale of a little boy and his buggy pals who sail a giant peach across the ocean has been turned into a classy but cold fantasy featuring the voices of Susan Sarandon (as a Garbo-ish spider), Richard Dreyfuss (a street-tough centipede) and David Thewlis (a woe-is-me earthworm). A good deal of craft and imagination have gone into this film, but everything from the script to Randy Newman's score suffers by comparison to ``Toy Story.'' Certainly kid-worthy, but grown-ups who've made the trek north on I-85 may find themselves less tickled by the movie than by the titular fruit's resemblance to its country cousin outside Gaffney, S.C. Rated PG for mildly scary scenes.  Jane Eyre PG  Opulent and intelligently acted, Franco Zeffirelli's version of Charlotte Bronte's famous Gothic love story is as emotionally acute as it is picture-pretty. The title role is shared by Oscar winner Anna Paquin as the young Jane and Charlotte Gainsbourg as the 20ish Jane who accepts a job as a governess at remote Thornfield Hall. William Hurt is unexpectedly fine as her enigmatic employer, the brooding Mr. Rochester. Unlike the director's famous ``Romeo and Juliet'' in the '60s, there's nothing radical here. Still, this is a sure-footed, satisfying film, one that reminds us that Bronte's tale is as much a ghost story as it is a romance. If you're in the mood for some lush tortured-lovers escapism, you could hardly do better. Rated PG for mildly scary scenes.  Jumanji PG  Robin Williams shows us where the wild things are in this effects-laden family fantasy about a mysterious board game that can bring rhinos into your living room or turn a house into a primeval swamp. Director Joe Johnstone (``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'') knows how to thrill an audience with outsized insects or a stampede down Main Street. But the movie goes on a roll of the dice or two too long. And in- between ``plays,'' things get frankly boring. Bottom line: If you've seen the trailer, you've already seen all the best parts. And those ``best parts'' may be a little scary for littler kids. Johnston does nothing to up the ante; it's like playing Candyland instead of Monopoly. Rated PG for violence.  Leaving Las Vegas R  ``Viva Las Vegas'' on two dozen downers and a case of Jack Black. Oscar nominee Nicolas Cage is an alcoholic Hollywood screenwriter who pockets his severance check and heads to Vegas to drink himself to death. Oscar nominee Elisabeth Shue is a Vegas hooker who gets hooked on his devil-may-care despair. The movie is a bit of a drunk itself _ given to self-indulgent poses and poetic pretentiousness. But Cage and Shue are willing _ and able _ to do director Mike Figgis' dirty work for him. Their terrific performances leave you feeling unclean and sober. Rated R for sex, language, nudity and drug abuse.

Mr. Holland's Opus PG  The corn is as high as an elephant's eye in this unabashedly sentimental melodrama. And guess what? The cornier it gets, the better the picture works. Oscar nominee Richard Dreyfuss stars as a would-be composer who devotes 30 years of his life to teaching high school music students. Director Stephen Herek has shaped the film into easily absorbed TV- size chunks that are given focus and humor thanks to a solid cast and Dreyfuss' energized, razor-sharp performance. Goodbye, Mr. Chips; hello, Mr. Holland. Rated PG for mild language.  Mr. Wrong PG-13  The good news: Ellen DeGeneres moves to the big screen with her angsty charms intact. The bad news: Her movie stinks. Alone on Valentine's night, she runs into a handsome investor (Bill Pullman) who seems heaven sent. Though it soon turns out to be hell. Pullman turns into a crazed, REO Speedwagon-listening, shoplifting clown, determined to wed her at any cost. But the character's about-face has no bearing on reality; it's a gimmick. The only thing worth watching is DeGeneres, drawing on her patented regimen of wary glances and nervous reactions. But instead of getting the sort of lift you get from screwball runaway-bride films of the '30s, ``Mr. Wrong'' only gives you a headache. _ Steve Murray  Money Train R  Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson attempt to work the same bud dy magic that made their 1992 basketball comedy, ``White Men Can't Jump,'' a hit. Here, their interplay is again easy and amusing, but the movie around them is a cliched jumble. The two play New York subway cops who also are foster brothers. Snipes is the responsible one; Harrelson's the habitual gambler with the Mom-always-liked-you-best chip on his shoulder. When Harrelson's fortunes take a downward turn (due to a laughable series of plot contrivances), he decides to reverse his loser status by robbing the subway's revenue train. Rated R for violence, language and nudity._ Doug Hamilton  Mrs. Winterbourne PG-13  Ricki Lake, who made her film debut in the John Waters romp ``Hairspray'' before becoming TV's heir apparent to Oprah, returns to the big screen in this contrived mistaken-identity comedy. She plays a penniless pregnant woman who assumes the identity of a wealthy train crash victim. The movie throws logic to the wind with a succession of plot shortcuts and tortured twists, and Lake strains through it all with an eager-beaver amateurishness that's hard to watch. Waters' rough-hewn irreverence suited her better; here, Richard Benjamin's Hollywood-slick direction clashes with her lack of polish.  Mulholland Falls R  Set in the early '50s, this crime drama follows a quartet of Los Angeles police detectives as they investigate murderous goings- on at a nuclear research facility. The cast includes Nick Nolte, Melanie Griffith, Treat Williams and John Malkovich.  Muppet Treasure Island G  Yo! Ho! Ho! and a barrel of fun! The Muppets take to the high seas in this loose musical adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic adventure about pirates, buried treasure and a brave lad named Jim Hawkins (Kevin Bishop). Tim Curry co-stars as Long John Silver; he's convincing, though a bit upstaged by his felt colleagues. Kudos all 'round to the usual Mupport support team: director Brian Henson and his hands-on puppeteers, Frank Oz (Miss Piggy), former Atlantan Steve Whitmire (Kermit the Frog), David Goelz (the Great Gonzo) and Jerry Nelson and Kevin Clash as just about everyone else.  Mystery Science Theater 3000:  The Movie PG-13  Just like the TV show, only bigger. A reluctant human guinea pig (Mike J. Nelson) and two robot companions are forced to endure a Really Bad Movie as part of an experiment conducted by a mad scientist (Trace Beaulieu). To keep some semblance of sanity, they offset the idiocy onscreen with a running commentary of pop culture sarcasms and stream-of- consciousness gags. The movie's movie is ``This Island Earth,'' '50s sci-fi silliness about big-headed aliens. But don't worry about its plot; just sit back and try to catch as many of the jokes as you can.  Nixon R  Oliver Stone's compassionate, intricate, hugely ambitious character study of the only man in history to resign the presidency. The movie follows Nixon (Anthony Hopkins) from his dirt-poor childhood to his dirty-politics downfall with Watergate. A vast, talented cast, headed by Joan Allen as Pat Nixon and Paul Sorvino as Kissinger, flesh out all the president's men (and women). Even at three-hours-plus, the movie is never less than fascinating and, at heart, it's one of the saddest stories you'll ever hear. The one about the man who got everything he wanted . . . and then it got him back. Rated R for language and adult themes.  Oliver &AMP; Company G  Andrew and company thought ``Oliver &AMP; Company'' was just swell and since Andrew is 5, I must defer, in part, to his expert opinion. However, adult connoisseurs of Disney animated magic will be bored silly _ or downright disgusted _ by this slight tale, very slightly based on ``Oliver Twist.'' Oliver is an orphaned kitten and Fagin's gang is a bunch of Manhattan mutts, most of whom are more crudely drawn (and crudely acted) versions of the jailhouse crowd in ``Lady and the Tramp.'' Take the kids, if they insist, but find yourself something else to see while they're in there.

English director Michael Radford (``White Mischief'') brings an outsider's intrigued eye to his Italian setting. But his ultimate focus is on the collision of poet and peasant and how each affects the other.  Primal Fear R  A sleek, solid courtroom thriller directed by Emmy-winner Gregory Hoblit  and based on William Diehl's best seller. Richard Gere stars as a high-powered attorney who defends a stuttering altar boy (Edward Norton) accused of murdering an archbishop. The kind of lawyer who spends as much time on magazine covers as he does in the courtroom, Gere doesn't care if the kid is guilty; he simply wants to win a front-page-friendly case. The top-notch supporting cast includes Laura Linney, John Mahoney, Alfre Woodard and John Mahoney. But the buzz is going to be about newcomer Norton, who gives the kind of electrifying performance that jump-starts careers in a big way. Rated R for violence and language.  The Quest R  Jean-Claude Van Damme makes his directorial debut with _ what else? _ an action-adventure vehicle about a thief who's driven to compete in a fight-to-the-death martial arts tournament.  Richard III R  Bloody as hell and bloody good fun. Sir Ian McKellen and director Richard Loncraine have transferred Shakespeare's tale of unruly royals doing rotten things to one another to 1930s England. The cast is a who's who of Britain's best (along with Americans Annette Bening and Robert Downey Jr.), but the crown jewel is Richard himself, played by McKellan as a magnificent media- savvy monster, as unctuous as he is unrepentant. This is a dazzling film, vividly imagined and breathtakingly performed. Everyone involved has done themselves proud, creating a ``Richard'' for the 1990s and the 1590s. If only all movies, Shakespeare adaptations or not, could be this self-confidently full- of-themselves in both concept and content.  Rumble in the Bronx R  If you haven't seen a Jackie Chan movie, you don't kow what you've been missing. Oh boy, as Buddy Holly would say. Part Bruce Lee, part Buster Keaton, Chan flips, kicks and leaps through his films with an exuberant kung-fu foolishness that's both death-defying and comic. In this English-dubbed action romp, he plays a Hong Kong cop on vacation in the Bronx (actually, Vancouver, British Columbia) who finds himself at odds with both the local gang and some international jewel thieves. But forget the plot and dialogue and focus on the almost nonstop action. Nimble, daring and pratfall funny, Chan and his movies aren't an acquired taste; they're an instant addiction. Rated R for violence.  Sense and Sensibility PG  Oscar winner (best adapted screenplay) Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet (``Heavenly Creatures'') co-star as penniless sisters trying to make their way among the sensible and the senseless in late 18th-century England. Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant and Greg Wise are suitors (of varying and changeable degrees of suitability). The unlikely director is Ang Lee (``Eat Drink Man Woman''), who has delivered a gorgeous film brimming with humor, romance and intelligence _ one that, on its own terms, is as fraught with peril and incident as a Spielberg thrill-flick. Score one for the good guys (and good gals.) Rated PG for mild adult themes.  Seven R  The creative serial killer in this self-conscious gibberish models his gruesome murders after each of the seven deadly sins. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are the cops out to stop him, but there's not much they can do to rescue this one-gimmick movie from quickly wearing out its one gimmick. Rated R for violence and language.  Sgt. Bilko PG  The laughs are AWOL in this frenzied remake of the some-would-say-classic '50s sitcom ``The Phil Silvers Show'' (called ``Sgt. Bilko'' in syndication). Steve Martin takes over the role of Army Sgt. Ernie Bilko, the scheming officer in charge of the motor pool at fictional Fort Baxter. Martin works overtime to combine Silvers' bluster with his own ``wild and crazy'' mannerisms. It's an annoyingly hyper performance. Phil Hartman steals the show as Bilko's nasty nemesis, Major Thorn. Few comedic actors can make uptight and overbearing seem so effortlessly funny. Rated PG-13 for language. _ Doug Hamilton  The Substitute R  Mr. Rambo's Opus. Robert Mandel's urban high school thriller presents the crisis in education as a high- stakes battle between ruthless men in power and determined vigilantes who practice the three Rs: reconnaissance, revenge and retribution. A beleaguered high school teacher (Diane Venora) runs afoul of an oily gang leader when she threatens to get him kicked out of school. Her boyfriend Shale (Tom Berenger), a Vietnam veteran and grizzled soldier of fortune, poses as a substitute. The movie is propelled by simplifications of reality and panders to unsavory fantasies of how ``good it feels'' to beat evildoers. Berenger is a strong presence, but even he has trouble with often infantile dialogue. _ The Hollywood Reporter  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960426.0217 type=story > <HEADLINE> CACHE OF MEMORABILIA WILL BE ON DISPLAY FOR ATHLETES </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-OLY-COLLECTION-ART-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"

WHAT NOW?

Color slides of varying DCIS precancers available. By MADELINE DREXLER c.1996 McCall's (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  This year millions of women will be diagnosed with a precancer of the breast or cervix. The bad news: Doctors are still in the dark about how best to treat these medically murky conditions. The good news: The diagnosis of a precancer is not nearly as dangerous as it sounds.  The majority of them don't invade surrounding tissue and don't threaten life. In fact, most low-grade cervical precancers revert to normal cells.  And precancers of the breast that are surgically removed generally don't come back _ a natural course quite different from the runaway replication of invasive cancer cells.  ``There are all kinds of things we call cancer,'' says Melvin Silverstein, medical director and senior surgical oncologist at The Breast Center in Van Nuys, Calif., ``and this is one of the most favorable.''  Yet how to treat precancer is ``one of the most controversial areas of breast disease,'' says Stella Hetelekidis, a radiation oncologist at the Joint Center for Radiation Therapy of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.  As the scientific research evolves, though, the chances of making informed medical decisions get better and better.  The majority of breast precancers are a type known as DCIS, or ductal carcinoma in situ. Under a microscope, DCIS shows up as a clumping of cells in the ducts, the structures that carry milk to the nipple.  But it's on a mammogram that DCIS usually appears first, as a cluster of microcalcifications _ tiny particles of calcium that gather in telltale patterns.  In 1972, before mammography was able to screen for cancer as sensitively as it does now, DCIS was an uncommon finding, occurring in 2 percent to 5 percent of all new breast cancers. Today we know that DCIS is quite common, representing 20 percent to 40 percent of all new diagnoses made at breast-care facilities that rely on mammography.  Many doctors feel DCIS is really several diseases, each with its own behavior. The lesion may remain dormant throughout a woman's life, hiding itself from detection. Sometimes DCIS, if detected and removed, never returns.  In 20 percent of cases, though, DCIS does come back after surgery. It is this possibility that most worries doctors, because about half of DCIS recurrences breach the duct walls to become invasive cancer.  Women are closely monitored after being diagnosed with DCIS, so any subsequent invasive cancers are usually discovered early, when they are most curable.  What should you do if your mammogram suggests DCIS?  ``Find a physician with whom you feel comfortable,'' says Stuart Schnitt, associate director of surgical pathology at Boston's Beth Israel Hospital.  It's also important to ask questions. Start by making sure your radiologist has taken a magnified X-ray of the area, which may help determine whether the microcalcifications are truly DCIS or only a benign condition.  If your doctor still suspects DCIS, he or she should refer you  to a surgeon, who will do a biopsy. Make sure the pathologist provides a full report.  ``You may have an excellent surgeon, but if you have a schlepp for a pathologist, it's not going to do any good,'' says Dr. Michael Lagios, medical director of the Breast Cancer Consultation Service at St. Mary's Medical Center in San Francisco.  If you or your physician have any concerns about the diagnosis, you can ask your doctor to send your biopsy slides to an academic medical center that has specialists in breast-tissue pathology.  After you receive your biopsy results, Lagios suggests asking for a personal copy of the pathology report. Two-thirds of the time the sample turns out to be normal and you won't need any further treatment. But if the pathologist finds DCIS, you will probably want a second opinion.  Insist that the second pathologist examine your actual biopsy slides, not just the first pathologist's written report.  If, after a second look, your tissue indeed turns out to contain DCIS, you will face what might seem like a dizzying array of options, with no clear advantage to any particular one.  There is little data to guide the choice of treatment, so doctors often disagree. However, some research suggests that the size and appearance of a lesion and the edges of the biopsy tissue can help indicate how likely the precancer is to progress and which treatment is appropriate.  Depending on these and other features of the tissue, doctors may conclude that you need no further treatment, that you need excision of additional tissue or that excision plus radiation is necessary.  A mastectomy may be recommended if you are among the 10 percent to 20 percent of patients in whom the lesion is so diffuse or so large that it can't all be removed with breast-conserving surgery.  However, even if your surgeon advises you to have a mastectomy, get a second opinion and consider talking to a radiation oncologist in case your DCIS can be treated with radiation instead. CERVICAL PRECANCERS: QUESTIONS AND CONTROVERSIES  The plummet in cervical cancer over the last 40 years is one of the shining success stories of modern medicine. The Pap smear, which gained popularity in the 1950s, has allowed doctors to detect cervical precancers and treat them before they become malignant.  But if you're diagnosed with a cervical precancer, you will face many of the same dilemmas as do women with a breast precancer. In addition, you are more likely to have unnecessary treatment for a condition that will disappear on its own.  Despite the encouraging statistics about cervical-cancer rates, cervical precancers have increased in the United States. In 1996, 2.5 million women will learn that they have a mild cervical abnormality.  Shifting sexual habits _ having sex with more than one partner and starting to have sex at an earlier age _ are partly to blame. But many researchers suspect the increase also reflects new medical definitions of precancer.  Cells that used to be dismissed as damaged but not worrisome are now dubbed low-level precancers. Fearful of a malpractice suit, a doctor may err on the side of caution.  The most common abnormality found on a Pap smear is ASCUS (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance). Such a finding is really an admission of uncertainty _ the cells look somewhat odd, but your doctor isn't sure what's wrong or even if the cells are precancerous.  If you receive this diagnosis, you should have another Pap test done in four to six months.  Another possible finding: SIL, or squamous intraepithelial lesion, a condition in which the nuclei of the cells are large and irregular, a possible precursor to abnormal growth.  Most low-grade SIL reverts to normal without treatment, while the high-grade kind is more risky. Another name for SIL is dysplasia.  Treatment of low-grade SIL is highly controversial. Because the cells usually go back to normal on their own, your physician may tell you to return to the office for Pap tests every four to six months for two years. If you subsequently have three negative smears, you will need only routine annual Pap smears thereafter.  On the other hand, your doctor may want to examine the lesion with a colposcope (a lighted magnifying instrument that helps guide the physician toward areas of abnormal tissue) and do a biopsy.  Once a diagnosis is made after a biopsy, a precancerous lesion acquires a new name. It is referred to as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, or CIN, and graded 1, 2 or 3 (roughly equivalent to mild, moderate or severe dysplasia), based on how far it has penetrated the epithelium, the lining of the cervix.  CIN 1 is the most subdued form _ many doctors feel it's not even a precancer _ while CIN 3 is the most likely to become invasive.  At this point comes another loaded question: Watch and wait, or take out the lesion? If you have CIN 2 or 3, the answer is clear: Your doctor will want to remove it. If your biopsy indicates CIN 1, however, you'll once again have to grapple with unclear choices.  If your immune function is suppressed for any reason, if you feel anxious knowing you have abnormal cells growing in your cervix or if you're unlikely to return for regular follow-up visits, you should have the lesion removed.  But if you are wary of having unnecessary surgery, can handle an ambiguous situation that probably will resolve itself in your favor and are diligent about going to follow-up visits (for a repeat colposcopy and a biopsy in three to six months), you're better off waiting.

By CAROLYN HAGAN c.1996 Child magazine (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  They were fraternal twins bonded by their differences.  ``James is shy. Jeremy was my extrovert,'' says the boys' mother, Carole Bradberry, of Largo, Fla.  Although both brothers were skilled at sports, ``Jeremy was a natural athlete. As a baby, he skipped the crawling stage. He went straight to walking.''  But this past September, 9-year-old Jeremy couldn't move fast enough to dodge the bullet that blasted through his cheek.  He'd been playing at the home of Justin, a new friend he'd made since moving to the neighborhood that summer. Justin found his father's gun, unlocked the storage box with the key on his dad's key ring and accidentally shot Jeremy.  ``Jeremy held on until his brother showed up at the hospital. James cupped Jeremy's face in his hand and said goodbye,'' Bradberry recalls, choking back tears.  Every 98 minutes a child dies from gunshot injuries, leaving family members to say their goodbyes. In a prediction laced with almost surreal doom, experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta report that by the year 2003 guns will become the leading injury-related cause of death for children nationwide.  ``It may even happen sooner because kids are the fastest growing group of gun victims,'' says Dr. Robert Zavoski, director of research and education at the Connecticut Childhood Injury Prevention Center in Hartford.  Motor-vehicle death has long been the No. 1 nemesis, but ``our cars are getting safer while our homes and communities are getting scarier,'' he says.  Perhaps it's no surprise that the outlook is so grim for kids. Virtually 1 in 2 homes now contains one or more guns, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Recent research shows that parents' weapons of choice are handguns, and that parents are more likely to buy guns for protection than are childless families or singles.  Surprisingly, more mothers buy guns than do single women. And as crime paranoia sweeps the country, guns are as popular among suburban and rural families as they are among urbanites. Twenty-eight states allow citizens to carry concealed weapons.  One in 12 students toted a firearm to school in 1993, according to the CDC. Most of these guns are traced to the home. Last spring, in a macabre twist on show-and-tell, a kindergartener in Little Rock, Ark., pulled out a loaded revolver that he'd stored with his crayons. The 5-year-old had found the gun in his father's pickup truck. WHY OWNING GUNS FOR PROTECTION BACKFIRES  However well-intentioned their urge to crime-proof their homes, parents actually endanger their families far more often than they protect them when they own a firearm.  A household gun triples the risk of homicide and leads to a fivefold hike in suicide at home. In fact, it's 43 times more likely to kill a family member or friend than to kill an intruder, says Dr. Arthur L. Kellermann, director of the Center for Injury Control at Emory University in Atlanta.  Family violence and suicide become far more likely with guns in the home _ with kids taking their lives at increasingly younger ages _ but accidents mount too. In fact, nearly all of the unintentional gun injuries and killings occur either in kids' homes or in the homes of friends and relatives.  Of the 5,357 gun-related deaths of kids in 1992, more than one-third of the killings of kids 9 and under were accidents, reports the National Center for Health Statistics in Bethesda, Md.  Many other kids are left maimed or brain-damaged from accidental shootings. DOES ``GUN SAFETY'' EXIST?  The Fairfax, Va.-based National Rifle Association (NRA) argues that firearm tragedies would be avoided if adults simply practiced gun safety. But they often don't.  A stunning 59 percent of parents with guns admit to not locking them away from kids under age 14. Nearly 20 percent keep one gun loaded, according to a survey by the National Safe Kids Campaign in Washington, D.C.  Because parents are apt to own guns for protection, they're more likely to keep them unlocked and loaded in case an intruder breaks in.  And even if parents practice gun safety, friends and relatives may not: One-half of gun owners keep bullets in the chamber at all times, according to a recent Gallup Poll.  ``Guns have no place in the homes of children,'' says Dr. Katherine Kaufer Christoffel, the spokesperson for handguns for the Chicago-based American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).  Pediatricians increasingly counsel parents at routine visits about guns in the home and urge them, if they must own one, to practice the basic rule of safety: Keep the gun unloaded and locked up, with the ammunition stored separately. A combination-style storage box is recommended by many experts.  But holding out gun safety as the panacea to family tragedies is flawed for another reason. Both the NRA and public health experts have pushed for more firearm training programs to help prevent gun-related injuries.  While that may sound like a good idea, a new national poll blasts the assumption that such education translates into proper handling and storage. Having had formal training _ often more than 80 hours' worth _ actually made gun owners more likely to ignore basic safety guidelines, reports Dr. David Hemenway, deputy director of the Harvard Injury Control Center.  He also points out that the NRA training curricula used by many programs is inconsistent with conventional safety advice: When a gun is kept for protection, the NRA argues, it's considered ``always in use,'' so it may be stored loaded, though ``in a secure place ... away from kids.''  However, with their legendary curiosity, ``children nearly always manage to locate the gun,'' Zavoski says. One study of young urban kids found that, when a gun was in the home, 80 percent of them knew where it was hidden.  ``Parents think they're being really slick when they hide their guns. But the kids tell me, `I know where my dad's gun is,''' says Gardner, Mass. police officer Kevin Minns, a firearms instructor who has taught the controversial Eddie Eagle Gun Safety course developed by the NRA for kids.  Plus, children today often have a lot of unsupervised time to search for a gun: CDC experts report that 1.2 million ``latchkey'' kids in grade school have access to their parents' guns, with perhaps only a sibling to restrain them _ or to egg them on. THE ALLURE OF ARMS  Parents who diligently instill in an older child the dangers of touching a gun run the risk of actually stirring, not squelching, their child's curiosity.  ``Children are intrigued by forbidden objects. A compliant child might stay away, but I wouldn't count on it,'' says Dr. Eva Feindler, director of the Psychological Services Center at Long Island University in Brookville, N.Y.  Part of the attraction for a child is the power a gun represents, says Dr. Leonard Berkowitz, an expert on violence and youth at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.  ``Guns can give a sense of mastery _ and kids, especially, crave that control because their environment seems so big and unmanageable to them.''  A child who is otherwise shy may seek out his parents' gun precisely because he's frustrated by his wallflower status. And a child of any temperament, in the excitement of winning over or impressing a friend, may impulsively try to flaunt the borrowed power of a gun.  With kids' numbing familiarity with guns on TV, the taboo against touching them holds little sway.  ``Kids feel downright comfortable handling guns,'' Christoffel says.  Contributing to the problem is the fact that real guns are often indistinguishable from toy ones, even to an adult's eye, Zavoski says. In fact, the confusion has been responsible for so many accidental killings of kids by other kids that Toys R Us, the largest toy store chain in the United States, has stopped selling plastic guns.  The glorification of guns in the movies and on TV doesn't help.  ``The bad guy may get shot to death, but then he surfaces on another program three days later. Kids don't understand that guns really kill people,'' Zavoski says.  And when parents buy guns for protection, they reinforce the media's message: that ``aggression should be met with greater aggression,'' Christoffel notes.  In fact, bringing a gun into the home actually makes a child prone to violent thoughts and actions, Berkowitz adds.  ``In cognitive science, it's known as the `priming' effect: People get ideas from something they see which they might be moved to act on afterward,'' he says. HOW TO REALLY PROTECT YOUR FAMILY  If a gun can wreak so much havoc on a family, what's the justification for having one?  The linchpin of the argument in favor of keeping a gun for protection is its ability to ward off intruders. While the NRA claims that gun ownership deters crime, national police reports show a different story.  Curiously, most gun owners don't reach for their weapon when an intruder enters their home, according to a new study by Kellermann. Out of 198 break-ins in Atlanta, where an estimated majority of homes contain guns, only three victims used guns for protection _ and one was robbed anyway.  These findings echo national statistics showing that in 1994 only about 1 percent of victims of violence (including police officers) used a gun to defend themselves.  ``People often don't have the time to grab their gun when a burglar breaks into their home. The adrenaline flooding their bodies can also make them lose their bearings in the dark,'' Kellermann says.  This is nowhere more evident than in the number of kids shot dead by parents who mistook them for burglars. According to police officer Minns, ``Calling 911 on a cordless phone is a more effective weapon than a gun when a break-in occurs.''  And if more families would install alarms, as well as reinforced locks, window bars and good exterior lighting, they'd be likely to prevent most break-ins, he says.

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Teri Hatcher in a scene from ``Heaven's Prisoners.'' By IAN SPELLING (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Teri Hatcher wastes no time making sure that viewers don't confuse her role in the new thriller, ``Heaven's Prisoners,'' with her TV role as Lois Lane, Superman's girlfriend in the popular series ``Lois and Clark.''  Her very first scene finds her standing silently on the balcony of a Louisiana mansion, stark naked.  It's a long way from Metropolis, and the sexy scene sets the stage for the rest of the film, in which Hatcher's character, a cagey Cajun named Claudette, and her hood of a husband Bubba (Eric Roberts), among others, make life hell for Dave Robicheaux (Ale Baldwin).  A former cop trying to lead a quiet existence with his wife (Kelly Lynch) in the bayou, Robicheaux's investigative juices start flowing again _ with deadly results _ after a plane full of illegal immigrants slams into nearby waters.  Hatcher says she undertook the nude scene fully aware of its impact, because she felt it contributed vitally to the character.  ``When you look at a part and you think about doing a scene like that, you have to look at the whole piece,'' the petite and attractive actress says during an interview at a Manhattan hotel. ``That scene was important to me.  ``Though the arc of the character builds very slowly, you realize what a manipulative and in-your-face thing that would be for somebody to do. It immediately hooks her into Alec's character in a secret, seedy way.  ``You know she'll be in his life, trying to figure out what he's about and what he knows. It would have been difficult to establish that immediately and in such a powerful way in a scene with dialogue, so I think it was an interesting choice.''  Most of Hatcher's other scenes in ``Prisoners'' are with Baldwin or Roberts or, on occasion, both at once. Baldwin plays his scenes in a slow-burn mode, while Roberts delivers one of his typically over-the-top performances.  Hatcher says she enjoyed both men's approaches.  ``Alec is tremendously talented and he was so supportive,'' she says with such enthusiasm that she can't help but laugh at herself. ``I had to do some risky things, in terms of how out there Claudette was emotionally, and Alec was right there for me.  ``Eric is such an intense actor. What was wonderful for me was that, ultimately, Claudette has to out-intensify her husband, and being with an actor like Eric really brought me up to another level.  ``Every time he was intense, I felt I had to be stronger, because the audience has to buy that Claudia is more intense than Bubba. That really pushed me.''  New Line Cinema will release ``Heaven's Prisoners'' nationally on May 17. Hatcher realizes that the film, which is dark, violent and offbeat, may have a tough time attracting a wide audience.  ``I'm happy with the characters, and I think everybody did a good job in terms of the acting,'' Hatcher says, running her fingers through her sleekly coiffed, short hair. ``I think the film captures the weight and the heat of New Orleans, but it is a slow character piece and I'm not sure if people will want to stay with that or not.  ``Some people like films that are driven that way and some people expect more. (Personally), I like it.''  The release of ``Prisoners'' comes at a key point in Hatcher's career. ``Lois &AMP; Clark'' may not be a ratings phenomenon like ``ER,'' but ABC's romantic retelling of the Lois Lane/Superman saga boasts millions of viewers of all ages and both sexes _ many of whom, Hatcher hopes, will be interested in seeing her tackle a role so radically different from the intrepid Lois.  Hatcher recently co-wrote an episode of ``Lois &AMP; Clark,'' which just ended its third season. The series' season finale was a cliffhanger episode that left fans wondering if Clark/Superman (Dean Cain) will remain on Earth, much less be a part of Lois' life.  ``I have no idea what will happen next season,'' the 31-year-old Hatcher says, smiling coyly. ``The producers don't tell me anything.  ``So I just show up and do the best job I can. It's still fun, which is great.''  As the series' ratings have risen, so too has its leading lady's profile. Photos of Hatcher are among the most frequently downloaded on the Internet, and her guest stint in the ``perfect breasts'' episode of ``Seinfeld'' has become something of a classic.  In April, she hosted what was arguably the most consistently funny 90 minutes of ``Saturday Night Live'' in at least two seasons. Still, Hatcher, who during her summer hiatus plans to house-hunt with her husband, actor Jon Tenney, and perhaps squeeze in a film, doesn't consider herself a star.  To judge by the amount of coverage she receives in the tabloids, others disagree. But that facet of the fame game doesn't appeal to the actress.  It's not fun to read, for example, that her marriage to Tenney, who shared the screen with his wife in the ``Lois &AMP; Clark'' season finale, is on the rocks. Nor does Hatcher appreciate reports _ entirely false and ``fabricated,'' she says _ that she suffers from anorexia nervosa.  ``When it first happens to you, you feel like you're the only one it's ever happened to, being picked on or having things written about you that aren't true,'' Hatcher says. ``Then you realize that it has happened to everyone at some point, and you also realize how exhausting it is to be defending yourself all the time.  ``Then you quit that stage and just decide that your friends and family ... love you, and that that's all that really matters. If people are going to believe the things that are written about you, then they are, (but) you do your best to have them not believe it.  ``If they do, they do, and that's just the end of it.''  Getting to the point at which tabloid furors are a serious problem has been a long but steady process for Hatcher, who was born and reared in the San Francisco area and attended the American Conservatory Theatre there.  She began acting in the mid-1980s and was soon guest-starring on such TV shows as ``Star Trek: The Next Generation'' and ``L.A. Law.''  Her first big-screen outing came in the 1989 comedy ``The Big Picture,'' which was followed by roles in ``Tango and Cash'' (1989) and ``Soapdish'' (1991), as well as a couple of erotic thrillers Hatcher no longer includes in her resume.  Then came ``Lois &AMP; Clark,'' `Heaven's Prisoners'' and the upcoming film ``Two Days in the Valley,'' a drama in which she co-stars with James Spader and Jeff Daniels. Hatcher is cast in ``Two Days'' as a spiteful Olympic skier who plots to have her cheating husband murdered.  ``She makes a decision that gets a ball rolling that she's unable to stop,'' Hatcher says elliptically. ``It was different enough from Claudette and Lois to make it really interesting.  ``It's really an exciting time for me, because I feel like I'm just now getting the opportunity to do the kinds of roles I want to do. First, you have to get the opportunities and then you have to do something with them.  ``I'm very committed and disciplined, and I try to do whatever I do well.'' c.1996 Ian Spelling  (Ian Spelling is a New York-based free-lance writer.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Samuel L. Jackson in a scene from ``The Great White Hype.'' By CINDY PEARLMAN World rights except Chicago (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  The ``L'' is for lucky.  That's what Samuel L. Jackson is telling a 10-year-old boy who has run up to him on Park Avenue in New York City.  ``You're kidding,'' the kid says, screwing up his face. ``What kind of middle name is that? It sounds fake.''  Jackson leans down toward the kid.  ``OK, it's really Leroy, but I just feel lucky,'' Jackson says.  And why shouldn't he? Jackson is riding high, and the popular consensus is that he's earned every moment of his success. He's been called ``the hardest-working man in show business.''  ``Harder working than Gene Hackman?'' he asks during an interview at the Regency Hotel in New York, adjusting his beret. ``Harder working than Michael Caine? Well, yes, I am!''  His latest film is ``The Great White Hype,'' in which he plays the Rev. Fred Sultan, con man, hustler and consummate boxing promoter. Feeling that boxing audiences are ``tired of seeing brothers beating up brothers,'' Sultan seeks out a white heavyweight contender (Peter Berg) to face the black undefeated champ (Damon Wayans).  Jackson isn't himself a huge boxing fan.  ``Saw those Stallone films a couple of times,'' he says. ``My game is really the noncontact sport of golf.''  Nevertheless, ``Hype'' appealed to him because, ``It's a film about the never-ending search in the boxing world for a white heavyweight champion to beat whoever is the current black champion. I found that curious, because why can't we just have a black champion?''  Jackson also identified with certain aspects of Sultan's character.  ``This is a guy who lusts for success. He doesn't take no for an answer, and I can relate. That's how I still feel with this acting career. I still have that New York stage actor's mentality of `I have to make it. Every job can be my last job, so I have to push, push, push.'''  That last job won't come anytime soon. Jackson just wrapped the summer film ``A Time to Kill,'' based on John Grisham's book. He plays a father who kills the Ku Klux Klan members who raped and beat his 12-year-old daughter, then finds himself on trial for murder.  ``I'm a fan of Grisham's books,'' Jackson says, ``and `Time to Kill' was always my favorite one. I read the book a couple of years ago on a plane and kept saying, `Why haven't they made this into a movie?'  ``Back then I understood that the African-American storyline is not such a great seller in the American market. A few years went by and things changed.  ``I think that after the O.J. Simpson trial became a never-ending soap opera, `Time to Kill' and putting a black man on trial might have a different appeal to an audience now.''  Next up for Jackson is a role opposite Geena Davis in the action-thriller ``The Long Kiss Goodnight.'' Then there's talk of a ``Pulp Fiction'' (1994) prequel that will revolve around the early days of Jules (Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta).  These will be only the latest entries on a list of recent credits that includes ``Jurassic Park'' (1993), ``Menace II Society'' (1993), ``True Romance'' (1993), ``Fresh'' (1994), ``Pulp Fiction,'' ``Kiss of Death'' (1995), ``Losing Isaiah'' (1995) and last summer's hit ``Die Hard With a Vengeance.''  At 45, Jackson has established himself as an audience favorite. In a separate interview, his ``Die Hard'' buddy Bruce Willis says, ``We had to rewrite the ending of the film because test audiences weren't thrilled with the fact that Sam didn't show up. This guy is amazing. He's like a magnet, and audiences want to know he's there.''  Audiences first sat up and took notice of Jackson in 1991, when he played a crack addict in Spike Lee's ``Jungle Fever,'' a role that was so devastating the Cannes Film Festival created a special best-supporting-actor statue just to honor him.  ``It was the kind of thing that is dangerous,'' Jackson says. ``That sort of honor can take you out of yourself and make you believe you are more than what you are. I hate when people blow you up that way, because some actors can't be brought down back to earth.''  Last year he received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor in ``Pulp Fiction.'' There were rumors in Hollywood that Jackson was jealous of Travolta, who received a Best Actor nomination for a virtually identically sized role. There were also mutters of Hollywood racism.  ``Jealous?'' Jackson raises his eyebrows. ``No, it never crossed my mind. I couldn't think about John's popularity because I was working on my golf game like I always do. I just let things happen the way they happen.  ``I think in a fair world all of us would have been nominated in the supporting category,'' he adds. ``I can't judge how the Academy votes or the politics of Hollywood, which tends to want to make someone larger than someone else. All I know is that the quality of work is in that film.''  Racism also reared its ugly head over ``Die Hard With a Vengeance.'' Jackson grimaces at the recollection.  ``I read one review where I was described as Bruce Willis' black Tonto. I thought, `OK, here we go again.' At least I got to talk in this action movie, which is more than I got to do in `Patriot Games' (1992).''  He enjoyed making the action-packed ``Die Hard'' sequel because it reminded him of his childhood.  ``As a kid I played cowboys and Indians and war ... My mother even would yell at me, `Go to bed and stop doing sound effects!'''  Jackson grew up in Chattanooga, Tenn., an only child reared by his mother.  ``My mother still calls me and says, `Where is that movie you have, because it's not in Chattanooga?' If she can't see it, she's mad,'' he says.  Later, he was a drama major at Atlanta's Morehouse College, where he again was in the thick of things.  ``I was expelled because I held a little protest because the school didn't have a black-studies program. It was a little matter of holding some of the trustees hostage. A few days later, I wasn't expelled anymore and the school had some new classes.  ``Back in the '60s I had a big Afro and wore a flak jacket. I had my fist in the air a lot.''  At Morehouse, Jackson met and married LaTanya Richardson (``One Life to Live,'' ``Losing Isaiah''). The young couple, who now have a 14-year-old daughter, Zoe, moved to New York in pursuit of stage work.  Jackson's impressive body of theatrical work includes originating roles in two of August Wilson's plays at Yale Rep _ Boy Willie in ``The Piano Lesson'' and Wolf in ``Two Trains Running.'' Jackson also performed in ``Fences'' and with the New York Shakespeare Festival. Then Hollywood came calling.  ``Pulp Fiction'' made Jackson a star, but his breakthrough nearly didn't happen. Writer/director Quentin Tarantino had written the role of Jules for Jackson after seeing ``Jungle Fever,'' and he and the actor had gone over the part in a relaxed reading.  But then another actor whom Jackson won't name asked to read the role while auditioning for another part, and he blew Tarantino away.  ``I was like, `What? Wait a minute! I didn't audition! I was just kinda reading it! Give me a chance!''' Jackson recalls.  Then Jackson did his stuff. After his reading, he looked to the director for his reaction.  ``Quentin just sat there in silence and said, `Now I know how this movie is supposed to end, and I've never seen it before.'  ``This taught me a very valuable lesson _ that as an actor I should never take anything for granted,'' Jackson says. ``I'll never forget that again. This taught me I can't slack up or think that I've made it because that's not true.''  Even when he relaxes, it seems, Jackson doesn't let up.  ``I golf three or four times a week. My handicap is 12,'' he says. ``I love it because it's a very challenging game. It's not simple. It's an individual challenge against the elements _ sort of like acting.'' c.1996 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.)

The ``Baywatch'' regular plays a mercenary who gets caught up in a civil war that's destroying the United States.  The Birdcage R  There's nothing terribly wrong with Mike Nichols' scene-by-scene remake of the 1978 French farce _ except the intervening 18 years. What used to cause a belly laugh now earns a pleasant chuckle. Robin Williams plays Armand, the relatively butch half of a gay couple. Nathan Lane is Albert, his shrieking drag-queen companion. Chaos arrives when Armand's son Val (Dan Futterman) brings home the parents of his fiancee: ultraconservative Senator Keeley (Gene Hackman) and his wife, Louise (Dianne Wiest). Armand can play it straight, but what to do with the hyper- nelly Albert? The movie ought to take off into the laughing-gas stratosphere of the best farces. But at 20 minutes longer than the French original, the film feels padded. Like ``To Wong Foo,'' the movie feels a little safe, a little tired. Rated R for language and sexual situations. _ Steve Murray  Bloodsport 2 R  You don't have to have seen ``Bloodsport'' to skip ``Bloodsport II.'' A hunky thief (Daniel Bernhardt) is sent to prison where a mentor/inmate (James Hong) teaches him serenity and some kick-butt moves. Bernhardt is then sprung by a wealthy businessman (Pat Morita) so he can compete in an anything-goes martial arts contest. Recommended to only the most undiscriminating martial arts fans.  Brain Candy R  This curiously bland film debut by the sketch-comedy troupe Kids in the Hall is hampered by a laborious central plot about the invention of a ``happy pill.'' Kevin McDonald (the strangest Kid) plays a research scientist who develops a drug that cures depression; Mark McKinney (the tallest Kid) plays the CEO of a pharmaceutical company who rushes the untested drug onto the market. What modest pleasures the movie has to offer come from a handful of hilarious asides, including Bruce McCullogh (the funniest Kid) as a grunge rocker and Scott Thompson (the gay Kid) as a straight-arrow father whose arrow is less straight than he lets on. Estranged member David Foley (the squarest Kid) gives an apathetic performance in a few blah roles. Rated R for language, sexual innuendo and adult themes. _ Doug Hamilton  Braveheart R  As did ``Spartacus'' and ``Dances With Wolves,'' Mel Gibson's tumultuously entertaining epic _ winner of five Academy Awards, including best picture _ extols such old-fashioned virtues as honor, freedom, principle, loyalty and romantic love. Gibson, who also directed, plays William Wallace, a bonnie 13th-century Scotsman who gave the English hell for the hash they tried to make out of his homeland. Rated R for brief nudity and extreme violence.  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960501.0215 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(2ndtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Broken Arrow R  Air Force pilot Christian Slater goes up against his buddy John Travolta, who steals two nuclear warheads from their Stealth bomber with a plan to ransom an entire city. Basically, the movie is one long chase in the desert, as Slater teams with perky park ranger Samantha Mathis _ and tracks the bad guys on foot (that must be a small desert). Packed with implausibility, the movie should be a lot of dumb fun. But it can't decide if it's ``Indiana Jones'' or ``Fail-Safe.'' Directed by Hong Kong action czar John Woo, it's played too broadly to make us genuinely tense, but it's not over- the-top enough to make us giddy with thrills. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  The Celluloid Closet R  A not-to -be-missed outing in every since of the word. Narrated by Lily Tomlin, this immensely entertaining and illuminating documentary examines images of gays and lesbians on film for the past 100 years. Along with a plethora of wonderful clips (everything from Dietrich in ``Morocco'' to Terence Stamp in ``The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert''), the movie offers incisive commentary by the likes of Gore Vidal, Armistead Maupin, Tom Hanks, Susan Sarandon. An amazing prism through which we may view both cinema and society, ``The Celluloid Closet'' has something for everyone, gay or straight.  Celtic Pride PG-13  Septic movie. The luck of the Irish is about as bad as it can get in this excruciating noncomedy about a couple of fanatic Boston Celtics fans (Daniel Stern and Dan Aykroyd) who kidnap the star player (Damon Wayans) of a rival team so their beloved Celtics can win Game 7 of the NBA Finals. Over-the- top fandom is a fairly funny premise for a film, but this one soon turns tedious and predictable. Worse, its simple plot and broad humor would make it a good film for 10-year-olds, but the filmmakers have drenched it in vulgar language and unsubtle sexual innuendo (hence the PG-13 rating). Why anyone would want to make something like this is almost as puzzling as why anyone would want to sit through it. Rated PG-13 for language and sexual innuendo.  City Hall R  The killing of a 6-year-old boy in a shootout between a cop and a drug dealer kicks off this urban expose of civic corruption. John Cusack plays deputy to New York mayor Al Pacino, but all his spin-doctoring can't cease the public outcry when word leaks that the cop may be crooked and the crook may have gotten a suspiciously lax probation. The movie cooks as it shows how political deals go down in greasy spoons and Broadway lobbies. But as Kevin's investigation leads him toward the courtroom of a venerable judge (Martin Landau), gritty verisimilitude gives way to standard thriller cliche. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  City of Lost Children R  From the creators of ``Delicatessen'' come this bizarre fairy tale of childhood lost and, perhaps, regained. In a nightmare neo-Victorian city _ think, Charles Dickens meets Terry Gilliam _ a hideous scientist is sending his freakish minions to kidnap children so he can steal their dreams. Ron Perlman is a circus strongman out to rescue his little brother and Judith Vittet is the street-smart urchin who helps him. Head- spinningly imaginative and seriously twisted, the movie still manages to find a strange innocence among its rank, cluttered corruption and outrageous grotesqueries. Tim Burton would feel right at home. Rated R for language and adult themes.  The Craft R  Bearing a resemblance to a recent episode of ``The X-Files,'' this dark comedy centers around a small clique of high school girls who stir up supernatural trouble when they dabble in witchcraft. ``Party of Five's'' Neve Campbell stars.  Dead Man Walking R  In Tim Robbins' deadly earnest, intermittently powerful death-row drama, a nun (Susan Sarandon) becomes involved with a convicted murderer (Sean Penn). Both give riveting portrayals (though Penn's arrogant, racist redneck is getting most of the attention). The problem is the movie isn't really about either character. It's about an issue _ the pros and cons of the death penalty _ which means it often lapses into the message-conscious style of a '50s TV drama. Still, Robbins manages a shatteringly effective final half hour simply by showing us how capital punishment works in every gruesome and dehumanizing detail. Sarandon just won a best actress Oscar for her performance.  Diabolique R  A so-bad-it's-funny remake of the classic Clouzot thriller. At a run- down boys' school, an icy mistress (Sharon Stone) and a dishrag wife (Isabelle Adjani) join forces to murder the man making them both miserable: Adjani's sadistic husband (Chazz Palminteri). The 1955 original was a triumph of atmosphere, character, diabolical wit and outright scare-you-silly shock tactics. The remake reduces everything to the Gothic-thriller plot, some idiotically overripe lesbian innuendo and the campiest dialogue this side of ``Mommie Dearest.'' ``Killing him was a good thing,'' Stone says reassuringly to Adjani. ``Like planting a tree.'' Rated R for violence, sex, nudity and language.  Down Periscope PG-13  ``Police Academy'' on a submarine. A very un-``Frasier''-like Kelsey Grammer stars as a subversive sub commander who pulls the requisite group of misfits together into a shipshape team and beats a crazed Bruce Dern at his own war game. Fans of ``Frasier'' may be dismayed by the wanton waste of Grammer's talents _ he coasts through wearing a fixed, avuncular smile _ but he doesn't disgrace himself and there are worse ways to break into movies. Think of it as a good movie for 12-year-olds of all ages. Rated PG-13 for language and mild sexuality.  Executive Decision R  A crafty pastiche of Tom Clancy, ``Die Hard'' and ``Airport.'' Kurt Russell plays Dr. David Grant, a civilian intelligence consultant for the U.S. military. An amateur pilot in his spare time, Grant inadvertently ends up the key player in an attempt to thwart the hijacking of a 747 by a Hamas-style terrorist group. Though Steven Seagal makes a brief appearance as the commanding officer of an elite anti-terrorist force, there is a welcome lack of chest-beating here that one might find in the average testosterone-fueled action vehicle. Grant is a thinker, not a warrior. The consultant as conquering hero? This nail biter could make it a trend. Rated R for language and violence. _ Doug Hamilton  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960501.0216 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(3rdtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  A Family Thing PG-13  James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall learn they are brothers under the skin, if not of the skin, in this likable, often touching film from director Richard Pearce (``Country''). A posthumous letter from his nominal mom sends Duvall from small-town Arkansas to big-city Chicago to meet the half-brother (Jones) he never knew he had. The picture sags badly midsection as the two work out their love/hate relationship (it's like ``Grumpy Old Men'' sprinkled with dated race-related jokes). Still, Duvall and Jones are a pure pleasure and their film's simple humor and humanity ultimately win you over. Rated PG-13 for language and adult themes.  Fargo R  A tale of murder, greed and morning sickness in Minnesota, this squalidly hilarious black comedy marks a return to top form for the Coen Brothers (``Blood Simple''). Sleazy car salesman William H. Macy hires two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wealthy wife (they'll split the ransom dad-in-law coughs up). But things go awry and soon Frances McDormand, the very pregnant police chief of Brainerd, Minn. (Home of Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox), is on the case. Loosely based on real incidents that occurred in 1987, the movie exists in some surreal cinematic convergence of Mayberry, Twin Peaks and SCTV. It's a great place for any movie lover to visit _ provided, of course, you bring along a very sick sense of humor. Rated R for sex, nudity, violence and language.  Fear R  Marky Mark is terrifying as a teen psycho in this standard thriller, patterned after ``Fatal Attraction.'' Yes, Marky Mark _ that hip-hoppin', pants-droppin' brother of a New Kid on the Block. (Since turning thespian, he goes by his given name, Mark Wahlberg.) ``Fear'' marks the Markster's first starring role, following smaller parts in ``Renaissance Man'' and ``The Basketball Diaries.'' Judging by his performance, he's got a fine career ahead of him playing bad guys. He's also got a fine foil here in Reese Witherspoon, a nubile young actress with a wise old aura who plays the object of his obsession. Predictable from the get-go, the movie still builds suspense nicely and scores points for not tacking on one of those psycho-rises-from-the- dead endings. Rated R for violence, sex and language. _ Doug Hamilton  Flirting With Disaster R  Ben Stiller goes in search of his biological parents in David O. Russell's hilarious comedy. With his wife (Patricia Arquette) and a psychobabbling therapist (Tea Leoni) from the adoption agency in tow, Stiller crisscrosses the country looking for his roots. What he finds are enough dysfunctional-family entanglements to choke Jerry Springer. As Stiller's adopted parents, Mary Tyler Moore and George Segal exhibit a finely sifted neuroticism worthy of ``Seinfeld'' while Lily Tomlin and Alan Alda play acid-head remnants from the '60s. The movie loses some of its fizz in its last half-hour; even so, Russell may be the most bracingly original satirist to hit the movies since Albert Brooks. Rated R for language and adult themes.  From Dusk Till Dawn R  Robert Rodriguez's hyper violent vampire flick stars scripter Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney (in a dynamic big-screen crossover) as killer bank robbers who kidnap a retired minister (Harvey Keitel) and his kids (including Juliette Lewis). Bad luck for them, these anti-heroes stop at a Mexican bar _ catering to bikers and bloodsuckers. The long opening setup is vintage Tarantino, full of bloody shocks and sick humor. But once the saloon's staff morph into vampires, ``Dusk'' heads into Sam Raimi's ``Evil Dead'' territory, complete with spewing eyeballs and severed limbs. It's an excuse for a couple of way-talented filmmakers to have gruesome fun. And for most of the time, we do, too. But the squeamish, beware. Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity. _ Steve Murray  Girl 6 R  Typically, Spike Lee works best when he's worked up about something. But  this comedy about an aspiring actress (Theresa Randle) who takes a job as a phone-sex girl, shows a frisky, almost larkish side that's as welcome as it is unexpected. Suzan-Lori Parks' script covers some familiar territory and lacks a satisfying resolution, but the director diverts our attention with kicky visuals, heavyweight cameos and some hilarious fantasies. And Randle, with her blend of movie-star sparkle and girl-next-door likability makes an appealing protagonist. Rated R for sex, language, nudity and adult themes.  The Great White Hype R  Samuel L. Jackson stars as a Don King-style boxing promoter who stages what he calls the Fight of the Millennium between a little-known white challenger (``Chicago Hope's'' Peter Berg) and the heavyweight champ (Damon Wayans). Directed by Reginald Hudlin (``House Party''). _ Doug Hamilton  Happy Gilmore PG-13  Adam Sandler goes for the green in this slap-happy golf comedy. He plays the title role, a failed hockey player who discovers his slap shot training has given him a killer golf swing. When his grandmother's house is repossessed by the IRS, he joins the pro golf circuit to make money to buy it back. After last year's mean-spirited ``Billy Madison,'' it's nice to see Sandler display a sweet side. Too bad the movie degenerates into a by-the-numbers rewrite of ``Caddyshack.'' Rated PG-13 for language. _ Doug Hamilton  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960501.0217 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(4thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Homeward Bound II:  Lost in San Francisco G  Sassy the Himalayan cat, Chance the American bulldog and Shadow the golden retriever aren't the only things that are lost in this sequel to the 1993 hit. Also missing is its predecessor's lovely animal-lover lyricism. This time, they wander the streets of San Francisco where they're menaced by buffoonish dog thieves and rescued by a gang of streetwise pooches (think, Dead End Dogs). The voice talent _ Sally Field as sarcastic Sassy, Michael J. Fox as irrepressible Chance and Ralph Waite (replacing the late Don Ameche) as dignified Shadow _ is as good as ever, but too many talking animals spoil the movie. The first film moved you to tears; the sequel is standard baby-sitter stuff for undemanding kids.  James and the Giant Peach PG  Not the pits, but not peachy keen, either. Roald Dahl's comically macabre tale of a little boy and his buggy pals who sail a giant peach across the ocean has been turned into a classy but cold fantasy featuring the voices of Susan Sarandon (as a Garbo-ish spider), Richard Dreyfuss (a street-tough centipede) and David Thewlis (a woe- is-me earthworm). A good deal of craft and imagination have gone into this film, but everything from the script to Randy Newman's score suffers by comparison to ``Toy Story.'' Certainly kid-worthy, but grown-ups who've made the trek north on I-85 may find themselves less tickled by the movie than by the titular fruit's resemblance to its country cousin outside Gaffney, S.C. Rated PG for mildly scary scenes.  Jane Eyre PG  Opulent and intelligently acted, Franco Zeffirelli's version of Charlotte Bronte's famous Gothic love story is as emotionally acute as it is picture-pretty. The title role is shared by Oscar winner Anna Paquin as the young Jane and Charlotte Gainsbourg as the 20ish Jane who accepts a job as a governess at remote Thornfield Hall. William Hurt is unexpectedly fine as her enigmatic employer, the brooding Mr. Rochester. Unlike the director's famous ``Romeo and Juliet'' in the '60s, there's nothing radical here. Still, this is a sure-footed, satisfying film, one that reminds us that Bronte's tale is as much a ghost story as it is a romance. If you're in the mood for some lush tortured-lovers escapism, you could hardly do better. Rated PG for mildly scary scenes.  Jumanji PG  Robin Williams shows us where the wild things are in this effects-laden family fantasy about a mysterious board game that can bring rhinos into your living room or turn a house into a primeval swamp. Director Joe Johnstone (``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'') knows how to thrill an audience with outsized insects or a stampede down Main Street. But the movie goes on a roll of the dice or two too long. And in-between ``plays,'' things get frankly boring. Bottom line: If you've seen the trailer, you've already seen all the best parts. And those ``best parts'' may be a little scary for littler kids. Johnston does nothing to up the ante; it's like playing Candyland instead of Monopoly. Rated PG for violence.  Last Dance R  ``Dead Woman Walking.'' 1995 Oscar nominee Sharon Stone stars as a death row inmate who gets a sympathetic attorney (Rob Morrow) to help her prepare one final appeal. Directed by Bruce Beresford (``Driving Miss Daisy'').  The Last Supper R  Not enough to chew on. Everything feels a little pre-digested in this predictable black comedy about a quintet of liberal grad students (Courtney B. Vance, Anabeth Gish, Carmen Diaz, Jonathan Penner, Ron Eldard) who invite conservative guests for dinner and serve them poisoned wine. The notion of serial killing as an applied form of political correctness isn't bad and director Stacy Title is good with her actors. But the script is unbearably schematic and preachy. Charles Durning, Bill Paxton, Jason Alexander, Ron Perlman and Mark Harmon are among the diners/victims.  Leaving Las Vegas R  ``Viva Las Vegas'' on two dozen downers and a case of Jack Black. Oscar nominee Nicolas Cage is an alcoholic Hollywood screenwriter who pockets his severance check and heads to Vegas to drink himself to death. Oscar nominee Elisabeth Shue is a Vegas hooker who gets hooked on his devil-may-care despair. The movie is a bit of a drunk itself _ given to self-indulgent poses and poetic pretentiousness. But Cage and Shue are willing _ and able _ to do director Mike Figgis' dirty work for him. Their terrific performances leave you feeling unclean and sober. Rated R for sex, language, nudity and drug abuse.  Loaded R  For now, Anna Campion will have to settle for being known as Jane's less-talented sister. For her debut film, she gathers some British 20-somethings and sends them off to a remote country estate to make a cheesy horror film. Already overloaded with emotionally muddled young folk (even the usually perfect Thandy Newton and  ``Braveheart's'' Catherine McCormack seem at a loss), oblique feminism, psychic-network undertones and the inevitability of Something Bad Happening, the movie goes for broke by tossing in an acid trip. It's dazed and confused, all right, but not in a good way.  Man of the Year NR  In 1992, Dirk Shafer was named Playgirl magazine's Man of the Year. That meant he was contractually obligated to spend the next 12 months posing for sexy pictures, accompanying contest winners for a night on the town and making the TV talk- show rounds to dispense wisdom on what it felt like to be every woman's ``ultimate male.'' There was just one teeny problem: Shafer was a gay man passing as straight. Now Shafer _ as writer, director and star, has turned his true-life ``adventure'' into a mockumentary, interspersing interviews and re- enactments with actual clips of his appearances on ``Donahue,'' ``The Maury Povich Show,'' etc. Alas, the real stuff proves far more fascinating and funny than the staged scenes, which come off as glib and amateurish.

And guess what? The cornier it gets, the better the picture works. Oscar nominee Richard Dreyfuss stars as a would-be composer who devotes 30 years of his life to teaching high school music students. Director Stephen Herek has shaped the film into easily absorbed TV-size chunks that are given focus and humor thanks to a solid cast and Dreyfuss' energized, razor- sharp performance. Goodbye, Mr. Chips; hello, Mr. Holland. Rated PG for mild language.  Mrs. Winterbourne PG-13  Ricki Lake, who made her film debut in the John Waters romp ``Hairspray'' before becoming TV's heir apparent to Oprah, returns to the big screen in this contrived mistaken- identity comedy. She plays a penniless pregnant woman who assumes the identity of a wealthy train crash victim. The movie throws logic to the wind with a succession of plot shortcuts and tortured twists, and Lake strains through it all with an eager-beaver amateurishness that's hard to watch. Waters' rough- hewn irreverence suited her better; here, Richard Benjamin's Hollywood-slick direction clashes with her lack of polish. Rated PG-13 for language and adult themes. _ Doug Hamilton  Mulholland Falls R  We're in a period- drenched L.A. where there's always cool jazz on the soundtrack, a dame in trouble and a seeming penny-ante murder will inevitably lead to a high-level coverup. It's not ``Chinatown.'' But it is ``Chinatown'' Lite and that's not such a bad thing. Nick Nolte leads a squad of dapper LAPD detectives as they try to discover the link between a lovely corpse and the Atomic Energy Commission. New Zealand director Lee Tamahori guides a strong cast (Chazz Palminteri, Chris Penn, Michael Madsen, John Malkovich) with a sure hand.  Muppet Treasure Island G  Yo! Ho! Ho! and a barrel of fun! The Muppets take to the high seas in this loose musical adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic adventure about pirates, buried treasure and a brave lad named Jim Hawkins (Kevin Bishop). Tim Curry co-stars as Long John Silver; he's convincing, though a bit upstaged by his felt colleagues. Kudos all 'round to the usual Mupport support team: director Brian Henson and his hands-on puppeteers, Frank Oz (Miss Piggy), former Atlantan Steve Whitmire (Kermit the Frog), David Goelz (the Great Gonzo) and Jerry Nelson and Kevin Clash as just about everyone else.  Mystery Science Theater 3000:  The Movie PG-13  Just like the TV show, only bigger. A reluctant human guinea pig (Mike J. Nelson) and two robot companions are forced to endure a Really Bad Movie as part of an experiment conducted by a mad scientist (Trace Beaulieu). To keep some semblance of sanity, they offset the idiocy onscreen with a running commentary of pop culture sarcasms and stream-of-consciousness gags. The movie's movie is ``This Island Earth,'' '50s sci-fi silliness about big-headed aliens. But don't worry about its plot; just sit back and try to catch as many of the jokes as you can. Rated PG-13 for language ans sexual innuendo.  Oliver &AMP; Company G  Andrew and company thought ``Oliver &AMP; Company'' was just swell and since Andrew is 5, I must defer, in part, to his expert opinion. However, adult connoisseurs of Disney animated magic will be bored silly _ or downright disgusted _ by this slight tale, very slightly based on ``Oliver Twist.'' Oliver is an orphaned kitten and Fagin's gang is a bunch of Manhattan mutts, most of whom are more crudely drawn (and crudely acted) versions of the jailhouse crowd in ``Lady and the Tramp.'' Take the kids, if they insist, but find yourself something else to see while they're in there.  Once Upon a Time . . . When We Were Colored PG  Tim Reid directs a talented cast (headed by Al Freeman Jr. and Phylicia Rashad) in a tender, evocative film set in the postwar segregated South. Based on Clifton Taulbert's coming-of-age memoir, the movie spans three decades, celebrating the triumph of the spirit of a generation of African- Americans _ the generation after slavery and before lunch counter sit-ins _ who never got a break coming or going. An honorable, heartfelt picture that implores us to never forget our country's past so that we may be better prepared to shape its future. Rated PG for adult themes.  The Pallbearer PG- 13  The second ``Friends'' cast member to hit the big screen, David Schwimmer hopes to get a better box-office reception than Matt LeBlanc did with his chimp debacle, ``Ed.'' TV's Ross plays a nebbishy guy who's talked into giving the eulogy at a funeral for an old classmate he can't quite remember.  The Postman NR  Set in the early '50s, this bittersweet tale of the unlikely friendship between the world-famous poet Pablo Neruda and Mario, an unworldly fisherman's son, is a deceptively simple film that sneaks up on you. English director Michael Radford (``White Mischief'') brings an outsider's intrigued eye to his Italian setting. But his ultimate focus is on the collision of poet and peasant and how each affects the other.

Richard Gere stars as a high-powered attorney who defends a stuttering altar boy (Edward Norton) accused of murdering an archbishop. The kind of lawyer who spends as much time on magazine covers as he does in the courtroom, Gere doesn't care if the kid is guilty; he simply wants to win a front-page-friendly case. The top-notch supporting cast includes Laura Linney, John Mahoney, Alfre Woodard and John Mahoney. But the buzz is going to be about newcomer Norton, who gives the kind of electrifying performance that jump- starts careers in a big way. Rated R for violence and language.  Richard III R  Bloody as hell and bloody good fun. Sir Ian McKellen and director Richard Loncraine have transferred Shakespeare's tale of unruly royals doing rotten things to one another to 1930s England. The cast is a who's who of Britain's best (along with Americans Annette Bening and Robert Downey Jr.), but the crown jewel is Richard himself, played by McKellan as a magnificent media-savvy monster, as unctuous as he is unrepentant. This is a dazzling film, vividly imagined and breathtakingly performed. Everyone involved has done themselves proud, creating a ``Richard'' for the 1990s and the 1590s. If only all movies, Shakespeare adaptations or not, could be this self- confidently full-of-themselves in both concept and content.  Rumble in the Bronx R  If you haven't seen a Jackie Chan movie, you don't kow what you've been missing. Oh boy, as Buddy Holly would say. Part Bruce Lee, part Buster Keaton, Chan flips, kicks and leaps through his films with an exuberant kung-fu foolishness that's both death-defying and comic. In this English-dubbed action romp, he plays a Hong Kong cop on vacation in the Bronx (actually, Vancouver, British Columbia) who finds himself at odds with both the local gang and some international jewel thieves. But forget the plot and dialogue and focus on the almost nonstop action. Nimble, daring and pratfall funny, Chan and his movies aren't an acquired taste; they're an instant addiction. Rated R for violence.  Sense and Sensibility PG  Oscar winner (best adapted screenplay) Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet (``Heavenly Creatures'') co-star as penniless sisters trying to make their way among the sensible and the senseless in late 18th-century England. Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant and Greg Wise are suitors (of varying and changeable degrees of suitability). The unlikely director is Ang Lee (``Eat Drink Man Woman''), who has delivered a gorgeous film brimming with humor, romance and intelligence _ one that, on its own terms, is as fraught with peril and incident as a Spielberg thrill-flick. Score one for the good guys (and good gals.) Rated PG for mild adult themes.  Sgt. Bilko PG  The laughs are AWOL in this frenzied remake of the some-would -say- classic '50s sitcom ``The Phil Silvers Show'' (called ``Sgt. Bilko'' in syndication). Steve Martin takes over the role of Army Sgt. Ernie Bilko, the scheming officer in charge of the motor pool at fictional Fort Baxter. Martin works overtime to combine Silvers' bluster with his own ``wild and crazy'' mannerisms. It's an annoyingly hyper performance. Phil Hartman steals the show as Bilko's nasty nemesis, Major Thorn. Few comedic actors can make uptight and overbearing seem so effortlessly funny. Rated PG-13 for language. _ Doug Hamilton  A Thin Line Between Love &AMP; Hate R  Martin Lawrence wrote, directed and stars in this comedy about a ladies' man who tangles with the wrong lady (Lynn Whitfield). The idea, apparently, was to do a comic spin on ``Waiting to Exhale'' _ ``Waiting to Explode,'' perhaps. But there's a thin line between amusing macho bluster and nasty piggishness and Lawrence blurs it too often. Further, while Lawrence has a certain limited appeal, Whitfield has 10 times the presence and 100 times the talent. He's a bargain basement Eddie Murphy; she's in Angela Bassett's league. Rated R for language, sex and sexual innuendo.  Toy Story G  A knockout. The first feature to be fully computer-generated, the all-ages comedy taps our childhood fantasies about the lives toys lead when the bedroom door closes. And it injects grown-up humor by making these Mr. Potato Heads and Slinky Dogs as psychologically diverse as any human. As neurotic as they are nice, the toys fret about their young owner Andy's birthday party, worried about getting edged out by a super-duper new toy. Longtime fave cowboy Woody (voice by Tom Hanks) gets upstaged by newcomer Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), a gleaming plastic hero. In this mock epic, Woody and Buzz go out into the ``real world,'' where they scamper beneath 18-wheelers, flee a toothy canine and survive the sadistic antics of the kid next door. Four years in the making, the film is a jaw- dropping spectacle, with one bravura sequence topping the one before. Give it five minutes, and this laugh-out-loud delight can turn the scroogiest Scrooge into a happy kid. ``Toy Story' will receive an Oscar for special achievement. _ Steve Murray  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960501.0220 type=story > <HEADLINE> INDIANA JAMES SURVIVES THE TEMPLE OF DOOM </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> MURPHY, N.C.

NR: Not rated.  All Dogs Go to Heaven 2 G  In this sequel to the 1989 animated canine adventure, lovable mutt Charlie descends from doggie heaven to retrieve Gabriel's horn. Voices by Charlie Sheen, Sheena Easton and Ernest Borgnine. Not reviewed.  Anne Frank Remembered PG  This Oscar- winning documentary reveals the flesh-and-blood teen behind the most famous victim of Hitler's Final Solution. Through interviews, photos, newsreels and one startling 1941 home movie, Jon Blair gives us new insights into and appreciation for the girl whose diary put a human face on the Holocaust. He also pays a much-deserved tribute to Miep Gies, the astonishingly heroic Dutchwoman who risked her life for the Franks and saved Anne's diary for posterity. Deftly narrated by Kenneth Branagh, with Glenn Close reading diary excerpts, the movie may sound like a total downer, but it isn't. It's both oddly uplifting and a poignant reminder that, if history is written by winners, it must be counted as some sort of triumph that one young girl's words have long outlived Hitler's proposed thousand-year Reich. Rated PG for adult themes.  Barb Wire R  Uberbabe Pamela Lee busts into the action genre with this futuristic flick, based on a recent comic book series. The ``Baywatch'' regular plays a mercenary who gets caught up in a civil war that's destroying the United States.  The Birdcage R  There's nothing terribly wrong with Mike Nichols' scene-by-scene remake of the 1978 French farce _ except the intervening 18 years. What used to cause a belly laugh now earns a pleasant chuckle. Robin Williams plays Armand, the relatively butch half of a gay couple. Nathan Lane is Albert, his shrieking drag-queen companion. Chaos arrives when Armand's son Val (Dan Futterman) brings home the parents of his fiancee: ultraconservative Senator Keeley (Gene Hackman) and his wife, Louise (Dianne Wiest). Armand can play it straight, but what to do with the hyper- nelly Albert? The movie ought to take off into the laughing-gas stratosphere of the best farces. But at 20 minutes longer than the French original, the film feels padded. Like ``To Wong Foo,'' the movie feels a little safe, a little tired. Rated R for language and sexual situations. _ Steve Murray  Bloodsport 2 R  You don't have to have seen ``Bloodsport'' to skip ``Bloodsport II.'' A hunky thief (Daniel Bernhardt) is sent to prison where a mentor/inmate (James Hong) teaches him serenity and some kick-butt moves. Bernhardt is then sprung by a wealthy businessman (Pat Morita) so he can compete in an anything-goes martial arts contest. Recommended to only the most undiscriminating martial arts fans.  Brain Candy R  This curiously bland film debut by the sketch-comedy troupe Kids in the Hall is hampered by a laborious central plot about the invention of a ``happy pill.'' Kevin McDonald (the strangest Kid) plays a research scientist who develops a drug that cures depression; Mark McKinney (the tallest Kid) plays the CEO of a pharmaceutical company who rushes the untested drug onto the market. What modest pleasures the movie has to offer come from a handful of hilarious asides, including Bruce McCullogh (the funniest Kid) as a grunge rocker and Scott Thompson (the gay Kid) as a straight-arrow father whose arrow is less straight than he lets on. Estranged member David Foley (the squarest Kid) gives an apathetic performance in a few blah roles. Rated R for language, sexual innuendo and adult themes. _ Doug Hamilton  Braveheart R  As did ``Spartacus'' and ``Dances With Wolves,'' Mel Gibson's tumultuously entertaining epic _ winner of five Academy Awards, including best picture _ extols such old-fashioned virtues as honor, freedom, principle, loyalty and romantic love. Gibson, who also directed, plays William Wallace, a bonnie 13th-century Scotsman who gave the English hell for the hash they tried to make out of his homeland. Rated R for brief nudity and extreme violence.  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960508.0925 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(2ndtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Broken Arrow R  Air Force pilot Christian Slater goes up against his buddy John Travolta, who steals two nuclear warheads from their Stealth bomber with a plan to ransom an entire city. Basically, the movie is one long chase in the desert, as Slater teams with perky park ranger Samantha Mathis _ and tracks the bad guys on foot (that must be a small desert). Packed with implausibility, the movie should be a lot of dumb fun. But it can't decide if it's ``Indiana Jones'' or ``Fail-Safe.'' Directed by Hong Kong action czar John Woo, it's played too broadly to make us genuinely tense, but it's not over- the-top enough to make us giddy with thrills. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  The Celluloid Closet R  A not-to -be-missed outing in every since of the word. Narrated by Lily Tomlin, this immensely entertaining and illuminating documentary examines images of gays and lesbians on film for the past 100 years. Along with a plethora of wonderful clips (everything from Dietrich in ``Morocco'' to Terence Stamp in ``The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert''), the movie offers incisive commentary by the likes of Gore Vidal, Armistead Maupin, Tom Hanks, Susan Sarandon. An amazing prism through which we may view both cinema and society, ``The Celluloid Closet'' has something for everyone, gay or straight.  Celtic Pride PG-13  Septic movie. The luck of the Irish is about as bad as it can get in this excruciating noncomedy about a couple of fanatic Boston Celtics fans (Daniel Stern and Dan Aykroyd) who kidnap the star player (Damon Wayans) of a rival team so their beloved Celtics can win Game 7 of the NBA Finals. Over-the- top fandom is a fairly funny premise for a film, but this one soon turns tedious and predictable. Worse, its simple plot and broad humor would make it a good film for 10-year-olds, but the filmmakers have drenched it in vulgar language and unsubtle sexual innuendo (hence the PG-13 rating). Why anyone would want to make something like this is almost as puzzling as why anyone would want to sit through it. Rated PG-13 for language and sexual innuendo.  City Hall R  The killing of a 6-year-old boy in a shootout between a cop and a drug dealer kicks off this urban expose of civic corruption. John Cusack plays deputy to New York mayor Al Pacino, but all his spin-doctoring can't cease the public outcry when word leaks that the cop may be crooked and the crook may have gotten a suspiciously lax probation. The movie cooks as it shows how political deals go down in greasy spoons and Broadway lobbies. But as Kevin's investigation leads him toward the courtroom of a venerable judge (Martin Landau), gritty verisimilitude gives way to standard thriller cliche. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  City of Lost Children R  From the creators of ``Delicatessen'' come this bizarre fairy tale of childhood lost and, perhaps, regained. In a nightmare neo-Victorian city _ think, Charles Dickens meets Terry Gilliam _ a hideous scientist is sending his freakish minions to kidnap children so he can steal their dreams. Ron Perlman is a circus strongman out to rescue his little brother and Judith Vittet is the street-smart urchin who helps him. Head- spinningly imaginative and seriously twisted, the movie still manages to find a strange innocence among its rank, cluttered corruption and outrageous grotesqueries. Tim Burton would feel right at home. Rated R for language and adult themes.  The Craft R  Bearing a resemblance to a recent episode of ``The X-Files,'' this dark comedy centers around a small clique of high school girls who stir up supernatural trouble when they dabble in witchcraft. ``Party of Five's'' Neve Campbell stars.  Dead Man Walking R  In Tim Robbins' deadly earnest, intermittently powerful death-row drama, a nun (Susan Sarandon) becomes involved with a convicted murderer (Sean Penn). Both give riveting portrayals (though Penn's arrogant, racist redneck is getting most of the attention). The problem is the movie isn't really about either character. It's about an issue _ the pros and cons of the death penalty _ which means it often lapses into the message-conscious style of a '50s TV drama. Still, Robbins manages a shatteringly effective final half hour simply by showing us how capital punishment works in every gruesome and dehumanizing detail. Sarandon just won a best actress Oscar for her performance.  Diabolique R  A so-bad-it's-funny remake of the classic Clouzot thriller. At a run- down boys' school, an icy mistress (Sharon Stone) and a dishrag wife (Isabelle Adjani) join forces to murder the man making them both miserable: Adjani's sadistic husband (Chazz Palminteri). The 1955 original was a triumph of atmosphere, character, diabolical wit and outright scare-you-silly shock tactics. The remake reduces everything to the Gothic-thriller plot, some idiotically overripe lesbian innuendo and the campiest dialogue this side of ``Mommie Dearest.'' ``Killing him was a good thing,'' Stone says reassuringly to Adjani. ``Like planting a tree.'' Rated R for violence, sex, nudity and language.  Down Periscope PG-13  ``Police Academy'' on a submarine. A very un-``Frasier''-like Kelsey Grammer stars as a subversive sub commander who pulls the requisite group of misfits together into a shipshape team and beats a crazed Bruce Dern at his own war game. Fans of ``Frasier'' may be dismayed by the wanton waste of Grammer's talents _ he coasts through wearing a fixed, avuncular smile _ but he doesn't disgrace himself and there are worse ways to break into movies. Think of it as a good movie for 12-year-olds of all ages. Rated PG-13 for language and mild sexuality.  Executive Decision R  A crafty pastiche of Tom Clancy, ``Die Hard'' and ``Airport.'' Kurt Russell plays Dr. David Grant, a civilian intelligence consultant for the U.S. military. An amateur pilot in his spare time, Grant inadvertently ends up the key player in an attempt to thwart the hijacking of a 747 by a Hamas-style terrorist group. Though Steven Seagal makes a brief appearance as the commanding officer of an elite anti-terrorist force, there is a welcome lack of chest-beating here that one might find in the average testosterone-fueled action vehicle. Grant is a thinker, not a warrior. The consultant as conquering hero? This nail biter could make it a trend. Rated R for language and violence. _ Doug Hamilton  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960508.0926 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(3rdtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  A Family Thing PG-13  James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall learn they are brothers under the skin, if not of the skin, in this likable, often touching film from director Richard Pearce (``Country''). A posthumous letter from his nominal mom sends Duvall from small-town Arkansas to big-city Chicago to meet the half-brother (Jones) he never knew he had. The picture sags badly midsection as the two work out their love/hate relationship (it's like ``Grumpy Old Men'' sprinkled with dated race-related jokes). Still, Duvall and Jones are a pure pleasure and their film's simple humor and humanity ultimately win you over. Rated PG-13 for language and adult themes.  Fargo R  A tale of murder, greed and morning sickness in Minnesota, this squalidly hilarious black comedy marks a return to top form for the Coen Brothers (``Blood Simple''). Sleazy car salesman William H. Macy hires two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wealthy wife (they'll split the ransom dad-in-law coughs up). But things go awry and soon Frances McDormand, the very pregnant police chief of Brainerd, Minn. (Home of Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox), is on the case. Loosely based on real incidents that occurred in 1987, the movie exists in some surreal cinematic convergence of Mayberry, Twin Peaks and SCTV. It's a great place for any movie lover to visit _ provided, of course, you bring along a very sick sense of humor. Rated R for sex, nudity, violence and language.  Fear R  Marky Mark is terrifying as a teen psycho in this standard thriller, patterned after ``Fatal Attraction.'' Yes, Marky Mark _ that hip-hoppin', pants-droppin' brother of a New Kid on the Block. (Since turning thespian, he goes by his given name, Mark Wahlberg.) ``Fear'' marks the Markster's first starring role, following smaller parts in ``Renaissance Man'' and ``The Basketball Diaries.'' Judging by his performance, he's got a fine career ahead of him playing bad guys. He's also got a fine foil here in Reese Witherspoon, a nubile young actress with a wise old aura who plays the object of his obsession. Predictable from the get-go, the movie still builds suspense nicely and scores points for not tacking on one of those psycho-rises-from-the- dead endings. Rated R for violence, sex and language. _ Doug Hamilton  Flirting With Disaster R  Ben Stiller goes in search of his biological parents in David O. Russell's hilarious comedy. With his wife (Patricia Arquette) and a psychobabbling therapist (Tea Leoni) from the adoption agency in tow, Stiller crisscrosses the country looking for his roots. What he finds are enough dysfunctional-family entanglements to choke Jerry Springer. As Stiller's adopted parents, Mary Tyler Moore and George Segal exhibit a finely sifted neuroticism worthy of ``Seinfeld'' while Lily Tomlin and Alan Alda play acid-head remnants from the '60s. The movie loses some of its fizz in its last half-hour; even so, Russell may be the most bracingly original satirist to hit the movies since Albert Brooks. Rated R for language and adult themes.  From Dusk Till Dawn R  Robert Rodriguez's hyper violent vampire flick stars scripter Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney (in a dynamic big-screen crossover) as killer bank robbers who kidnap a retired minister (Harvey Keitel) and his kids (including Juliette Lewis). Bad luck for them, these anti-heroes stop at a Mexican bar _ catering to bikers and bloodsuckers. The long opening setup is vintage Tarantino, full of bloody shocks and sick humor. But once the saloon's staff morph into vampires, ``Dusk'' heads into Sam Raimi's ``Evil Dead'' territory, complete with spewing eyeballs and severed limbs. It's an excuse for a couple of way-talented filmmakers to have gruesome fun. And for most of the time, we do, too. But the squeamish, beware. Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity. _ Steve Murray  Girl 6 R  Typically, Spike Lee works best when he's worked up about something. But  this comedy about an aspiring actress (Theresa Randle) who takes a job as a phone-sex girl, shows a frisky, almost larkish side that's as welcome as it is unexpected. Suzan-Lori Parks' script covers some familiar territory and lacks a satisfying resolution, but the director diverts our attention with kicky visuals, heavyweight cameos and some hilarious fantasies. And Randle, with her blend of movie-star sparkle and girl-next-door likability makes an appealing protagonist. Rated R for sex, language, nudity and adult themes.  The Great White Hype R  Samuel L. Jackson stars as a Don King-style boxing promoter who stages what he calls the Fight of the Millennium between a little-known white challenger (``Chicago Hope's'' Peter Berg) and the heavyweight champ (Damon Wayans). Directed by Reginald Hudlin (``House Party''). _ Doug Hamilton  Happy Gilmore PG-13  Adam Sandler goes for the green in this slap-happy golf comedy. He plays the title role, a failed hockey player who discovers his slap shot training has given him a killer golf swing. When his grandmother's house is repossessed by the IRS, he joins the pro golf circuit to make money to buy it back. After last year's mean-spirited ``Billy Madison,'' it's nice to see Sandler display a sweet side. Too bad the movie degenerates into a by-the-numbers rewrite of ``Caddyshack.'' Rated PG-13 for language. _ Doug Hamilton  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960508.0927 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(4thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Homeward Bound II:  Lost in San Francisco G  Sassy the Himalayan cat, Chance the American bulldog and Shadow the golden retriever aren't the only things that are lost in this sequel to the 1993 hit. Also missing is its predecessor's lovely animal-lover lyricism. This time, they wander the streets of San Francisco where they're menaced by buffoonish dog thieves and rescued by a gang of streetwise pooches (think, Dead End Dogs). The voice talent _ Sally Field as sarcastic Sassy, Michael J. Fox as irrepressible Chance and Ralph Waite (replacing the late Don Ameche) as dignified Shadow _ is as good as ever, but too many talking animals spoil the movie. The first film moved you to tears; the sequel is standard baby-sitter stuff for undemanding kids.  James and the Giant Peach PG  Not the pits, but not peachy keen, either. Roald Dahl's comically macabre tale of a little boy and his buggy pals who sail a giant peach across the ocean has been turned into a classy but cold fantasy featuring the voices of Susan Sarandon (as a Garbo-ish spider), Richard Dreyfuss (a street-tough centipede) and David Thewlis (a woe- is-me earthworm). A good deal of craft and imagination have gone into this film, but everything from the script to Randy Newman's score suffers by comparison to ``Toy Story.'' Certainly kid-worthy, but grown-ups who've made the trek north on I-85 may find themselves less tickled by the movie than by the titular fruit's resemblance to its country cousin outside Gaffney, S.C. Rated PG for mildly scary scenes.  Jane Eyre PG  Opulent and intelligently acted, Franco Zeffirelli's version of Charlotte Bronte's famous Gothic love story is as emotionally acute as it is picture-pretty. The title role is shared by Oscar winner Anna Paquin as the young Jane and Charlotte Gainsbourg as the 20ish Jane who accepts a job as a governess at remote Thornfield Hall. William Hurt is unexpectedly fine as her enigmatic employer, the brooding Mr. Rochester. Unlike the director's famous ``Romeo and Juliet'' in the '60s, there's nothing radical here. Still, this is a sure-footed, satisfying film, one that reminds us that Bronte's tale is as much a ghost story as it is a romance. If you're in the mood for some lush tortured-lovers escapism, you could hardly do better. Rated PG for mildly scary scenes.  Jumanji PG  Robin Williams shows us where the wild things are in this effects-laden family fantasy about a mysterious board game that can bring rhinos into your living room or turn a house into a primeval swamp. Director Joe Johnstone (``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'') knows how to thrill an audience with outsized insects or a stampede down Main Street. But the movie goes on a roll of the dice or two too long. And in-between ``plays,'' things get frankly boring. Bottom line: If you've seen the trailer, you've already seen all the best parts. And those ``best parts'' may be a little scary for littler kids. Johnston does nothing to up the ante; it's like playing Candyland instead of Monopoly. Rated PG for violence.  Last Dance R  ``Dead Woman Walking.'' 1995 Oscar nominee Sharon Stone stars as a death row inmate who gets a sympathetic attorney (Rob Morrow) to help her prepare one final appeal. Directed by Bruce Beresford (``Driving Miss Daisy'').  The Last Supper R  Not enough to chew on. Everything feels a little pre-digested in this predictable black comedy about a quintet of liberal grad students (Courtney B. Vance, Anabeth Gish, Carmen Diaz, Jonathan Penner, Ron Eldard) who invite conservative guests for dinner and serve them poisoned wine. The notion of serial killing as an applied form of political correctness isn't bad and director Stacy Title is good with her actors. But the script is unbearably schematic and preachy. Charles Durning, Bill Paxton, Jason Alexander, Ron Perlman and Mark Harmon are among the diners/victims.  Leaving Las Vegas R  ``Viva Las Vegas'' on two dozen downers and a case of Jack Black. Oscar nominee Nicolas Cage is an alcoholic Hollywood screenwriter who pockets his severance check and heads to Vegas to drink himself to death. Oscar nominee Elisabeth Shue is a Vegas hooker who gets hooked on his devil-may-care despair. The movie is a bit of a drunk itself _ given to self-indulgent poses and poetic pretentiousness. But Cage and Shue are willing _ and able _ to do director Mike Figgis' dirty work for him. Their terrific performances leave you feeling unclean and sober. Rated R for sex, language, nudity and drug abuse.  Loaded R  For now, Anna Campion will have to settle for being known as Jane's less-talented sister. For her debut film, she gathers some British 20-somethings and sends them off to a remote country estate to make a cheesy horror film. Already overloaded with emotionally muddled young folk (even the usually perfect Thandy Newton and  ``Braveheart's'' Catherine McCormack seem at a loss), oblique feminism, psychic-network undertones and the inevitability of Something Bad Happening, the movie goes for broke by tossing in an acid trip. It's dazed and confused, all right, but not in a good way.  Man of the Year NR  In 1992, Dirk Shafer was named Playgirl magazine's Man of the Year. That meant he was contractually obligated to spend the next 12 months posing for sexy pictures, accompanying contest winners for a night on the town and making the TV talk- show rounds to dispense wisdom on what it felt like to be every woman's ``ultimate male.'' There was just one teeny problem: Shafer was a gay man passing as straight. Now Shafer _ as writer, director and star, has turned his true-life ``adventure'' into a mockumentary, interspersing interviews and re- enactments with actual clips of his appearances on ``Donahue,'' ``The Maury Povich Show,'' etc. Alas, the real stuff proves far more fascinating and funny than the staged scenes, which come off as glib and amateurish.

And guess what? The cornier it gets, the better the picture works. Oscar nominee Richard Dreyfuss stars as a would-be composer who devotes 30 years of his life to teaching high school music students. Director Stephen Herek has shaped the film into easily absorbed TV-size chunks that are given focus and humor thanks to a solid cast and Dreyfuss' energized, razor- sharp performance. Goodbye, Mr. Chips; hello, Mr. Holland. Rated PG for mild language.  Mrs. Winterbourne PG-13  Ricki Lake, who made her film debut in the John Waters romp ``Hairspray'' before becoming TV's heir apparent to Oprah, returns to the big screen in this contrived mistaken- identity comedy. She plays a penniless pregnant woman who assumes the identity of a wealthy train crash victim. The movie throws logic to the wind with a succession of plot shortcuts and tortured twists, and Lake strains through it all with an eager-beaver amateurishness that's hard to watch. Waters' rough- hewn irreverence suited her better; here, Richard Benjamin's Hollywood-slick direction clashes with her lack of polish. Rated PG-13 for language and adult themes. _ Doug Hamilton  Mulholland Falls R  We're in a period- drenched L.A. where there's always cool jazz on the soundtrack, a dame in trouble and a seeming penny-ante murder will inevitably lead to a high-level coverup. It's not ``Chinatown.'' But it is ``Chinatown'' Lite and that's not such a bad thing. Nick Nolte leads a squad of dapper LAPD detectives as they try to discover the link between a lovely corpse and the Atomic Energy Commission. New Zealand director Lee Tamahori guides a strong cast (Chazz Palminteri, Chris Penn, Michael Madsen, John Malkovich) with a sure hand.  Muppet Treasure Island G  Yo! Ho! Ho! and a barrel of fun! The Muppets take to the high seas in this loose musical adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic adventure about pirates, buried treasure and a brave lad named Jim Hawkins (Kevin Bishop). Tim Curry co-stars as Long John Silver; he's convincing, though a bit upstaged by his felt colleagues. Kudos all 'round to the usual Mupport support team: director Brian Henson and his hands-on puppeteers, Frank Oz (Miss Piggy), former Atlantan Steve Whitmire (Kermit the Frog), David Goelz (the Great Gonzo) and Jerry Nelson and Kevin Clash as just about everyone else.  Mystery Science Theater 3000:  The Movie PG-13  Just like the TV show, only bigger. A reluctant human guinea pig (Mike J. Nelson) and two robot companions are forced to endure a Really Bad Movie as part of an experiment conducted by a mad scientist (Trace Beaulieu). To keep some semblance of sanity, they offset the idiocy onscreen with a running commentary of pop culture sarcasms and stream-of-consciousness gags. The movie's movie is ``This Island Earth,'' '50s sci-fi silliness about big-headed aliens. But don't worry about its plot; just sit back and try to catch as many of the jokes as you can. Rated PG-13 for language ans sexual innuendo.  Oliver &AMP; Company G  Andrew and company thought ``Oliver &AMP; Company'' was just swell and since Andrew is 5, I must defer, in part, to his expert opinion. However, adult connoisseurs of Disney animated magic will be bored silly _ or downright disgusted _ by this slight tale, very slightly based on ``Oliver Twist.'' Oliver is an orphaned kitten and Fagin's gang is a bunch of Manhattan mutts, most of whom are more crudely drawn (and crudely acted) versions of the jailhouse crowd in ``Lady and the Tramp.'' Take the kids, if they insist, but find yourself something else to see while they're in there.  Once Upon a Time . . . When We Were Colored PG  Tim Reid directs a talented cast (headed by Al Freeman Jr. and Phylicia Rashad) in a tender, evocative film set in the postwar segregated South. Based on Clifton Taulbert's coming-of-age memoir, the movie spans three decades, celebrating the triumph of the spirit of a generation of African- Americans _ the generation after slavery and before lunch counter sit-ins _ who never got a break coming or going. An honorable, heartfelt picture that implores us to never forget our country's past so that we may be better prepared to shape its future. Rated PG for adult themes.  The Pallbearer PG- 13  The second ``Friends'' cast member to hit the big screen, David Schwimmer hopes to get a better box-office reception than Matt LeBlanc did with his chimp debacle, ``Ed.'' TV's Ross plays a nebbishy guy who's talked into giving the eulogy at a funeral for an old classmate he can't quite remember.  The Postman NR  Set in the early '50s, this bittersweet tale of the unlikely friendship between the world-famous poet Pablo Neruda and Mario, an unworldly fisherman's son, is a deceptively simple film that sneaks up on you. English director Michael Radford (``White Mischief'') brings an outsider's intrigued eye to his Italian setting. But his ultimate focus is on the collision of poet and peasant and how each affects the other.

Richard Gere stars as a high-powered attorney who defends a stuttering altar boy (Edward Norton) accused of murdering an archbishop. The kind of lawyer who spends as much time on magazine covers as he does in the courtroom, Gere doesn't care if the kid is guilty; he simply wants to win a front-page-friendly case. The top-notch supporting cast includes Laura Linney, John Mahoney, Alfre Woodard and John Mahoney. But the buzz is going to be about newcomer Norton, who gives the kind of electrifying performance that jump- starts careers in a big way. Rated R for violence and language.  Richard III R  Bloody as hell and bloody good fun. Sir Ian McKellen and director Richard Loncraine have transferred Shakespeare's tale of unruly royals doing rotten things to one another to 1930s England. The cast is a who's who of Britain's best (along with Americans Annette Bening and Robert Downey Jr.), but the crown jewel is Richard himself, played by McKellan as a magnificent media-savvy monster, as unctuous as he is unrepentant. This is a dazzling film, vividly imagined and breathtakingly performed. Everyone involved has done themselves proud, creating a ``Richard'' for the 1990s and the 1590s. If only all movies, Shakespeare adaptations or not, could be this self- confidently full-of-themselves in both concept and content.  Rumble in the Bronx R  If you haven't seen a Jackie Chan movie, you don't kow what you've been missing. Oh boy, as Buddy Holly would say. Part Bruce Lee, part Buster Keaton, Chan flips, kicks and leaps through his films with an exuberant kung-fu foolishness that's both death-defying and comic. In this English-dubbed action romp, he plays a Hong Kong cop on vacation in the Bronx (actually, Vancouver, British Columbia) who finds himself at odds with both the local gang and some international jewel thieves. But forget the plot and dialogue and focus on the almost nonstop action. Nimble, daring and pratfall funny, Chan and his movies aren't an acquired taste; they're an instant addiction. Rated R for violence.  Sense and Sensibility PG  Oscar winner (best adapted screenplay) Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet (``Heavenly Creatures'') co-star as penniless sisters trying to make their way among the sensible and the senseless in late 18th-century England. Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant and Greg Wise are suitors (of varying and changeable degrees of suitability). The unlikely director is Ang Lee (``Eat Drink Man Woman''), who has delivered a gorgeous film brimming with humor, romance and intelligence _ one that, on its own terms, is as fraught with peril and incident as a Spielberg thrill-flick. Score one for the good guys (and good gals.) Rated PG for mild adult themes.  Sgt. Bilko PG  The laughs are AWOL in this frenzied remake of the some-would -say- classic '50s sitcom ``The Phil Silvers Show'' (called ``Sgt. Bilko'' in syndication). Steve Martin takes over the role of Army Sgt. Ernie Bilko, the scheming officer in charge of the motor pool at fictional Fort Baxter. Martin works overtime to combine Silvers' bluster with his own ``wild and crazy'' mannerisms. It's an annoyingly hyper performance. Phil Hartman steals the show as Bilko's nasty nemesis, Major Thorn. Few comedic actors can make uptight and overbearing seem so effortlessly funny. Rated PG-13 for language. _ Doug Hamilton  A Thin Line Between Love &AMP; Hate R  Martin Lawrence wrote, directed and stars in this comedy about a ladies' man who tangles with the wrong lady (Lynn Whitfield). The idea, apparently, was to do a comic spin on ``Waiting to Exhale'' _ ``Waiting to Explode,'' perhaps. But there's a thin line between amusing macho bluster and nasty piggishness and Lawrence blurs it too often. Further, while Lawrence has a certain limited appeal, Whitfield has 10 times the presence and 100 times the talent. He's a bargain basement Eddie Murphy; she's in Angela Bassett's league. Rated R for language, sex and sexual innuendo.  Toy Story G  A knockout. The first feature to be fully computer-generated, the all-ages comedy taps our childhood fantasies about the lives toys lead when the bedroom door closes. And it injects grown-up humor by making these Mr. Potato Heads and Slinky Dogs as psychologically diverse as any human. As neurotic as they are nice, the toys fret about their young owner Andy's birthday party, worried about getting edged out by a super-duper new toy. Longtime fave cowboy Woody (voice by Tom Hanks) gets upstaged by newcomer Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), a gleaming plastic hero. In this mock epic, Woody and Buzz go out into the ``real world,'' where they scamper beneath 18-wheelers, flee a toothy canine and survive the sadistic antics of the kid next door. Four years in the making, the film is a jaw- dropping spectacle, with one bravura sequence topping the one before. Give it five minutes, and this laugh-out-loud delight can turn the scroogiest Scrooge into a happy kid. ``Toy Story' will receive an Oscar for special achievement. _ Steve Murray  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960508.0930 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(7thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  The Truth About  Cats &AMP; Dogs PG-13  An astute gender inversion of that moldy oldie ``Cyrano de Bergerac.'' Hip comedian Janeane Garofalo plays Abby Barnes, a radio talk-show host with zero self-esteem who gets a leggy model friend (Uma Thurman) to stand in for her at a face-to-face meeting with an interested caller. Here's the twist: Abby isn't cursed with a bird-perch proboscis. She's just average looking. The movie's powerful message is that this is enough to render her a freak in a society that places impossible standards on female beauty. Garofalo, in her first starring role, gives a fully realized performance as a modern Everywoman. _ Doug Hamilton  12 Monkeys R  Terry Gilliam's despair-laced fantasy gets under your skin _ even when you don't exactly know what's going on. Bruce Willis stars as Cole, who claims to be a time traveler from the year 2035. He's sent back to 1996 to discover the cause of a plague that has wiped out 5 billion people. Is he really from the future, or is he insane _ as one psychiatrist (Madeleine Stowe) thinks? As in Gilliam's other films (``Time Bandits,'' ``The Fisher King''), story and emotion come second to visual design and mood, and at times the movie could use a stronger sense of drama and momentum. Still, there's nothing else like it on screen right now. For its strange, spooky visual poetry, ``Monkeys'' is a barrel of glum fun. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  Up Close &AMP; Personal PG-13  Score one for golden guy Robert Redford and golden gal Michelle Pfeiffer, who show us what star power is really about in this glossy, high-profile romance with a TV news backdrop. Pfeiffer is the raw youngster who rises from weather girl to network star; Redford is the crusty news director, oozing with integrity, who acts as her mentor (``She eats the lens'') and falls in love with her. Director Jon Avnet and writers Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne have crossed ``A Star Is Born'' with ``Broadcast News'' and come up with a movie that's not as tough or complex as it could be. But with accomplished ``lens-eaters'' like Redford and Pfeiffer on hand, it's the kind of old-fashioned love story that's infatuated audiences for decades. Rated PG-13 for language and adult themes.  Waiting to Exhale R  A breath of fresh air. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon play friends in this glossy, well-acted adaptation of Terry McMillan's best seller. Forest Whitaker, better known for his acting in ``Bird'' and ``The Crying Game,'' provides the expert direction. And as for the reported ``male bashing,'' before you take your man, simply ask yourself, is he man enough to take it? Whitaker is. And he's man enough to dish it out, too.

They move weekly to clients of the New York Times News Service.  G: General audiences. Nothing that would offend parents if viewed by children.  PG: Parental guidance suggested. May contain some material parents consider inappropriate for young children.  PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for preteens.  R: Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking children.  NC-17: No one under 17 admitted. Replaces the X rating.  NR: Not rated.  Anne Frank Remembered PG  This Oscar-winning documentary reveals the flesh-and-blood teen behind the most famous victim of Hitler's Final Solution. Through interviews, photos, newsreels and one startling 1941 home movie, Jon Blair gives us new insights into and appreciation for the girl whose diary put a human face on the Holocaust. He also pays a much-deserved tribute to Miep Gies, the astonishingly heroic Dutchwoman who risked her life for the Franks and saved Anne's diary for posterity. Deftly narrated by Kenneth Branagh, with Glenn Close reading diary excerpts, the movie may sound like a total downer, but it isn't. It's both oddly uplifting and a poignant reminder that, if history is written by winners, it must be counted as some sort of triumph that one young girl's words have long outlived Hitler's proposed thousand-year Reich. Rated PG for adult themes.  The Arrival PG-13  Taking a cue from ``The X-Files,'' this sci-fi thriller deals with aliens and a government coverup. Charlie Sheen plays a radio astronomer who gets canned when he receives a transmission from space. _ Doug Hamilton  Barb Wire R  ``Baywatch'' body Pamela Anderson Lee makes her movie debut in this comic book adaptation set in a dystopian future. Her title character is a nightclub-owning mercenary in Steel Harbor, a lawless free zone of corrupt cops, Gestapolike government forces and struggling resistance fighters. We're talking ``Casablanca'' in fish net stockings and black leather. (Though sadly, the soundtrack lacks a heavy metal version of ``As Time Goes By.'') Everything about ``Barb Wire'' is sublimely ridiculous, but nothing is more absurd than Lee herself, whose idea of method acting was to get an actual barbed-wire tattoo. With a range of facial expressions that runs the gamut from pouty glare to glaring pout, her every screen moment provides a laugh, whether she's killing a club heckler with a stiletto high heel or taking a bubble bath. Rated R for violence and nudity. _ Mark Binelli  The Birdcage R  There's nothing terribly wrong with Mike Nichols' scene-by-scene remake of the 1978 French farce _ except the intervening 18 years. What used to cause a belly laugh now earns a pleasant chuckle. Robin Williams plays Armand, the relatively butch half of a gay couple. Nathan Lane is Albert, his shrieking drag-queen companion. Chaos arrives when Armand's son Val (Dan Futterman) brings home the parents of his fiancee: ultraconservative Senator Keeley (Gene Hackman) and his wife, Louise (Dianne Wiest). Armand can play it straight, but what to do with the hyper-nelly Albert? The movie ought to take off into the laughing-gas stratosphere of the best farces. But at 20 minutes longer than the French original, the film feels padded. Like ``To Wong Foo,'' the movie feels a little safe, a little tired. Rated R for language and sexual situations. _ Steve Murray  Boys PG-13  In this excruciatingly inert coming-of-age drama, not only does the gawky adolescent hero get the girl, she's none other than . . . Winona Ryder! Lukas Haas, best known as the Amish boy in ``Witness,'' plays a sullen prep school youth who comes upon Ryder's unconscious waif in a field. He takes her to his dorm room, nurses her back to health and learns that she's in trouble with the law. Does he turn her over to the cops, or ditch school and go on the lam with her? Hey, it's Winona Ryder, for crying out loud! The actress is radiant as usual, but she's overwhelmed by the movie's listless tone. Haas, now a gangly young adult, appears to still be acting with Amish reserve. Kindly put, he plays nondescript very well. _ Doug Hamilton  Brain Candy R  This curiously bland film debut by the sketch-comedy troupe Kids in the Hall is hampered by a laborious central plot about the invention of a ``happy pill.'' Kevin McDonald (the strangest Kid) plays a research scientist who develops a drug that cures depression; Mark McKinney (the tallest Kid) plays the CEO of a pharmaceutical company who rushes the untested drug onto the market. What modest pleasures the movie has to offer come from a handful of hilarious asides, including Bruce McCullogh (the funniest Kid) as a grunge rocker and Scott Thompson (the gay Kid) as a straight-arrow father whose arrow is less straight than he lets on. Estranged member David Foley (the squarest Kid) gives an apathetic performance in a few blah roles. Rated R for language, sexual innuendo and adult themes. _ Doug Hamilton  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960515.0237 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(2ndtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Broken Arrow R  Air Force pilot Christian Slater goes up against his buddy John Travolta, who steals two nuclear warheads from their Stealth bomber with a plan to ransom an entire city. Basically, the movie is one long chase in the desert, as Slater teams with perky park ranger Samantha Mathis _ and tracks the bad guys on foot (that must be a small desert). Packed with implausibility, the movie should be a lot of dumb fun. But it can't decide if it's ``Indiana Jones'' or ``Fail- Safe.'' Directed by Hong Kong action czar John Woo, it's played too broadly to make us genuinely tense, but it's not over-the-top enough to make us giddy with thrills. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  The Celluloid Closet R  A not-to-be-missed outing in every since of the word. Narrated by Lily Tomlin, this immensely entertaining and illuminating documentary examines images of gays and lesbians on film for the past 100 years. Along with a plethora of wonderful clips (everything from Dietrich in ``Morocco'' to Terence Stamp in ``The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert''), the movie offers incisive commentary by the likes of Gore Vidal, Armistead Maupin, Tom Hanks, Susan Sarandon. An amazing prism through which we may view both cinema and society, ``The Celluloid Closet'' has something for everyone, gay or straight. Rated R for adult themes.  Celtic Pride PG-13  Septic movie. The luck of the Irish is about as bad as it can get in this excruciating noncomedy about a couple of fanatic Boston Celtics fans (Daniel Stern and Dan Aykroyd) who kidnap the star player (Damon Wayans) of a rival team so their beloved Celtics can win Game 7 of the NBA Finals. Over-the-top fandom is a fairly funny premise for a film, but this one soon turns tedious and predictable. Worse, its simple plot and broad humor would make it a good film for 10-year- olds, but the filmmakers have drenched it in vulgar language and unsubtle sexual innuendo (hence the PG-13 rating). Why anyone would want to make something like this is almost as puzzling as why anyone would want to sit through it. Rated PG-13 for language and sexual innuendo.  The Craft R  This not-quite-bewitching thriller uses an MTV veneer to mask its conventionally moral heart. Set to a hip, alternative rock soundtrack, it tells the story of four Catholic schoolgirls who explore sisterhood and empowerment through witchcraft. Their experiments with the occult end up destroying their innocence and wrecking their friendship. The four leads _ Robin Tunney, Fairuza Balk, Neve Campbell and Rachel True _ all give complex, multilayered performances. And the movie taps into a universal youth fantasy: Who hasn't wished for supernatural powers as a guard against the cruelties of adolescence? Ultimately, though, ``The Craft'' is sunk by heavy-handed sermonizing. Rated R for violence, language and adult themes._ Doug Hamilton  Dead Man R  The Wild West becomes the Weird West in Jim Jarmusch's mytho-poetic meditation on a beloved genre. Johnny Depp stars as a mild-mannered accountant who goes west and finds himself on a surreal odyssey that takes him from so-called civilization to a natural state (both savage and enlightened). Gary Farmer co- stars as his Native American guide and spiritual adviser. Robert Mitchum, John Hurt and Gabriel Byrne turn up in cameos. Some may find the film a ploddingly paced, heavy-handed allegory. But even those put off by Jarmusch's hipster whimsy and elliptical narrative will be impressed by Robby Muller's exquisitely textured photography and Neil Young's evocative score.  Dead Man Walking R  In Tim Robbins' deadly earnest, intermittently powerful death-row drama, a nun (Susan Sarandon) becomes involved with a convicted murderer (Sean Penn). Both give riveting portrayals (though Penn's arrogant, racist redneck is getting most of the attention). The problem is the movie isn't really about either character. It's about an issue _ the pros and cons of the death penalty _ which means it often lapses into the message-conscious style of a '50s TV drama. Still, Robbins manages a shatteringly effective final half hour simply by showing us how capital punishment works in every gruesome and dehumanizing detail. Sarandon just won a best actress Oscar for her performance.  Diabolique R  A so-bad-it's-funny remake of the classic Clouzot thriller. At a run-down boys' school, an icy mistress (Sharon Stone) and a dishrag wife (Isabelle Adjani) join forces to murder the man making them both miserable: Adjani's sadistic husband (Chazz Palminteri). The 1955 original was a triumph of atmosphere, character, diabolical wit and outright scare-you- silly shock tactics. The remake reduces everything to the Gothic-thriller plot, some idiotically overripe lesbian innuendo and the campiest dialogue this side of ``Mommie Dearest.'' ``Killing him was a good thing,'' Stone says reassuringly to Adjani. ``Like planting a tree.'' Rated R for violence, sex, nudity and language.  Don't Be a Menace  to South Central While Drinking  Your Juice in the Hood R  A vehicle for Shawn and Marlon Wayans, the two youngest members of the comic family that includes brothers Damon and Keenen Ivory. This ``Airplane!''-style parody takes broad, juvenile jabs at such urban ``message'' movies as ``Menace II Society'' and ``Boyz N the Hood.'' If not all the jokes here work, many of the ones that do have extra weight. When two characters are busted for ``being black on a Friday night'' and taken to a police station equipped with a Rodney King punch-and-kick video game, the movie turns from goofy fun to comedy that tickles and stings. _ Doug Hamilton  Down Periscope PG-13  ``Police Academy'' on a submarine. A very un-``Frasier''-like Kelsey Grammer stars as a subversive sub commander who pulls the requisite group of misfits together into a shipshape team and beats a crazed Bruce Dern at his own war game. Fans of ``Frasier'' may be dismayed by the wanton waste of Grammer's talents _ he coasts through wearing a fixed, avuncular smile _ but he doesn't disgrace himself and there are worse ways to break into movies. Think of it as a good movie for 12-year-olds of all ages. Rated PG-13 for language and mild sexuality.  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960515.0238 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(3rdtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Executive Decision R  A crafty pastiche of Tom Clancy, ``Die Hard'' and ``Airport.'' Kurt Russell plays Dr. David Grant, a civilian intelligence consultant for the U.S. military. An amateur pilot in his spare time, Grant inadvertently ends up the key player in an attempt to thwart the hijacking of a 747 by a Hamas-style terrorist group. Though Steven Seagal makes a brief appearance as the commanding officer of an elite anti-terrorist force, there is a welcome lack of chest-beating here that one might find in the average testosterone-fueled action vehicle. Grant is a thinker, not a warrior. The consultant as conquering hero? This nail biter could make it a trend. Rated R for language and violence. _ Doug Hamilton  Fargo R  A tale of murder, greed and morning sickness in Minnesota, this squalidly hilarious black comedy marks a return to top form for the Coen Brothers (``Blood Simple''). Sleazy car salesman William H. Macy hires two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wealthy wife (they'll split the ransom dad-in-law coughs up). But things go awry and soon Frances McDormand, the very pregnant police chief of Brainerd, Minn. (Home of Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox), is on the case. Loosely based on real incidents that occurred in 1987, the movie exists in some surreal cinematic convergence of Mayberry, Twin Peaks and SCTV. It's a great place for any movie lover to visit _ provided, of course, you bring along a very sick sense of humor. Rated R for sex, nudity, violence and language.  Fear R  Marky Mark is terrifying as a teen psycho in this standard thriller, patterned after ``Fatal Attraction.'' Yes, Marky Mark _ that hip-hoppin', pants-droppin' brother of a New Kid on the Block. (Since turning thespian, he goes by his given name, Mark Wahlberg.) ``Fear'' marks the Markster's first starring role, following smaller parts in ``Renaissance Man'' and ``The Basketball Diaries.'' Judging by his performance, he's got a fine career ahead of him playing bad guys. He's also got a fine foil here in Reese Witherspoon, a nubile young actress with a wise old aura who plays the object of his obsession. Predictable from the get-go, the movie still builds suspense nicely and scores points for not tacking on one of those psycho-rises-from-the-dead endings. Rated R for violence, sex and language. _ Doug Hamilton  Flipper PG  Everybody's favorite TV dolphin gets his big-screen debut in this family adventure. Elijah Wood (aging much more gracefully than Macaulay Culkin) plays a bratty teen whose bummer of a summer is brightened when he befriends a chatty aquatic mammal.  Flirting With Disaster R  Ben Stiller goes in search of his biological parents in David O. Russell's hilarious comedy. With his wife (Patricia Arquette) and a psychobabbling therapist (Tea Leoni) from the adoption agency in tow, Stiller crisscrosses the country looking for his roots. What he finds are enough dysfunctional-family entanglements to choke Jerry Springer. As Stiller's adopted parents, Mary Tyler Moore and George Segal exhibit a finely sifted neuroticism worthy of ``Seinfeld'' while Lily Tomlin and Alan Alda play acid-head remnants from the '60s. The movie loses some of its fizz in its last half-hour; even so, Russell may be the most bracingly original satirist to hit the movies since Albert Brooks. Rated R for language and adult themes.  Frank and Ollie PG  A loving, lovely documentary about Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, two of Disney's renowned Nine Old Men, i.e., the core group of artists on whose imagination and skill Uncle Walt built his Magic Kingdom. Written and directed by Thomas' son, Theodore, the movie is like a quickie history of Disney animation. True, it's a sanitized, pro-company version, in which working for Disney was only slightly less delightful than working for Santa. Still Frank 'n' Ollie are captivating and between them, they've created some of the most famous scenes in cinema history. As a stagehand says before a TV appearance, ``So you're the guys who killed Bambi's mother.''  From Dusk Till Dawn R  Robert Rodriguez's hyperviolent vampire flick stars scripter Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney (in a dynamic big- screen crossover) as killer bank robbers who kidnap a retired minister (Harvey Keitel) and his kids (including Juliette Lewis). Bad luck for them, these anti- heroes stop at a Mexican bar _ catering to bikers and bloodsuckers. The long opening setup is vintage Tarantino, full of bloody shocks and sick humor. But once the saloon's staff morph into vampires, ``Dusk'' heads into Sam Raimi's ``Evil Dead'' territory, complete with spewing eyeballs and severed limbs. It's an excuse for a couple of way-talented filmmakers to have gruesome fun. And for most of the time, we do, too. But the squeamish, beware. Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity. _ Steve Murray  Girl 6 R  Typically, Spike Lee works best when he's worked up about something. But  this comedy about an aspiring actress (Theresa Randle) who takes a job as a phone-sex girl, shows a frisky, almost larkish side that's as welcome as it is unexpected. Suzan-Lori Parks' script covers some familiar territory and lacks a satisfying resolution, but the director diverts our attention with kicky visuals, heavyweight cameos and some hilarious fantasies. And Randle, with her blend of movie-star sparkle and girl-next-door likability makes an appealing protagonist. Rated R for sex, language, nudity and adult themes.  The Great White Hype R  Samuel L. Jackson stars as a Don King-ish boxing promoter in this knockout satire. To freshen up boxing's box office, Jackson digs up a white guy (``Chicago Hope's'' Peter Berg) to fight the current heavyweight champ (Damon Wayans). Director Reginald Hudlin and writers Tony Hendra and Ron Shelton are equal-opportunity nasty, gleefully sending up everything from racism in sports to faked fan letters from crippled little boys. Jackson's snake-charmer charisma helps center the movie's admittedly scattershot approach. A warning: This comedy is rowdy, crude, irreverent and uncontrolled. And refreshing as hell. Rated R for language and adult material.  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960515.0239 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(4thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Happy Gilmore PG-13  Adam Sandler goes for the green in this slap-happy golf comedy. He plays the title role, a failed hockey player who discovers his slap shot training has given him a killer golf swing. When his grandmother's house is repossessed by the IRS, he joins the pro golf circuit to make money to buy it back. After last year's mean-spirited ``Billy Madison,'' it's nice to see Sandler display a sweet side. Too bad the movie degenerates into a by-the- numbers rewrite of ``Caddyshack.'' Rated PG-13 for language. _ Doug Hamilton  Homeward Bound II:  Lost in San Francisco G  Sassy the Himalayan cat, Chance the American bulldog and Shadow the golden retriever aren't the only things that are lost in this sequel to the 1993 hit. Also missing is its predecessor's lovely animal-lover lyricism. This time, they wander the streets of San Francisco where they're menaced by buffoonish dog thieves and rescued by a gang of streetwise pooches (think, Dead End Dogs). The voice talent _ Sally Field as sarcastic Sassy, Michael J. Fox as irrepressible Chance and Ralph Waite (replacing the late Don Ameche) as dignified Shadow _ is as good as ever, but too many talking animals spoil the movie. The first film moved you to tears; the sequel is standard baby-sitter stuff for undemanding kids.  If Lucy Fell R  Don't fall for this flat romantic comedy. Sarah Jessica Parker and Eric Schaeffer (who also wrote the script and directed) play longtime platonic roomies who've made a pact: If neither is romantically involved by the time Parker turns 30, they'll jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. Parker is game in an unflattering part and Elle Macpherson and Ben Stiller are fine in limited roles as potential romantic possibilities. But Schaeffer is a big black hole in the middle of his own picture. The character he's written is funny, sensitive, bright and charismatic in his own muddled way; the character he plays on screen is none of these things. Rated R for sxual situations, nudity and language.  James and the Giant Peach PG  Not the pits, but not peachy keen, either. Roald Dahl's comically macabre tale of a little boy and his buggy pals who sail a giant peach across the ocean has been turned into a classy but cold fantasy featuring the voices of Susan Sarandon (as a Garbo-ish spider), Richard Dreyfuss (a street-tough centipede) and David Thewlis (a woe-is-me earthworm). A good deal of craft and imagination have gone into this film, but everything from the script to Randy Newman's score suffers by comparison to ``Toy Story.'' Certainly kid-worthy, but grown-ups who've made the trek north on I-85 may find themselves less tickled by the movie than by the titular fruit's resemblance to its country cousin outside Gaffney, S.C. Rated PG for mildly scary scenes.  Jane Eyre PG  Opulent and intelligently acted, Franco Zeffirelli's version of Charlotte Bronte's famous Gothic love story is as emotionally acute as it is picture-pretty. The title role is shared by Oscar winner Anna Paquin as the young Jane and Charlotte Gainsbourg as the 20ish Jane who accepts a job as a governess at remote Thornfield Hall. William Hurt is unexpectedly fine as her enigmatic employer, the brooding Mr. Rochester. Unlike the director's famous ``Romeo and Juliet'' in the '60s, there's nothing radical here. Still, this is a sure-footed, satisfying film, one that reminds us that Bronte's tale is as much a ghost story as it is a romance. If you're in the mood for some lush tortured-lovers escapism, you could hardly do better. Rated PG for mildly scary scenes.  Jumanji PG  Robin Williams shows us where the wild things are in this effects-laden family fantasy about a mysterious board game that can bring rhinos into your living room or turn a house into a primeval swamp. Director Joe Johnstone (``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'') knows how to thrill an audience with outsized insects or a stampede down Main Street. But the movie goes on a roll of the dice or two too long. And in-between ``plays,'' things get frankly boring. Bottom line: If you've seen the trailer, you've already seen all the best parts. And those ``best parts'' may be a little scary for littler kids. Johnston does nothing to up the ante; it's like playing Candyland instead of Monopoly. Rated PG for violence.  Larger Than Life PG-13  Bill Murray may be big, but this time, his co-star's bigger. The comedian must fight for screen time with a pachyderm in this comedy about a man who is bequeathed a circus elephant by his father. Janeane Garofalo appears as a helpful animal trainer.  Last Dance R  A plot summary suggests a gender-reversed ``Dead Man Walking,'' with Sharon Stone on death row and Rob Morrow as the outsider from the state clemency office who forms a bond with her. But director Bruce Beresford is less concerned with capital punishment than he is with his characters' emotional journey. True, Stone's sour, insolent inmate softens up far too quickly (plus, she looks better after years in prison than most of us do on prom night), but Beresford has cushioned his potentially too-familiar central story with some fine supporting characters _ Randy Quaid as Morrow's crusty boss and Peter Gallagher as his overachieving brother. In fact, you could film a second movie out of Morrow/Gallagher's sibling rivalry.  Leaving Las Vegas R  ``Viva Las Vegas'' on two dozen downers and a case of Jack Black. Oscar nominee Nicolas Cage is an alcoholic Hollywood screenwriter who pockets his severance check and heads to Vegas to drink himself to death. Oscar nominee Elisabeth Shue is a Vegas hooker who gets hooked on his devil-may-care despair. The movie is a bit of a drunk itself _ given to self-indulgent poses and poetic pretentiousness. But Cage and Shue are willing _ and able _ to do director Mike Figgis' dirty work for him. Their terrific performances leave you feeling unclean and sober. Rated R for sex, language, nudity and drug abuse.

That meant he was contractually obligated to spend the next 12 months posing for sexy pictures, accompanying contest winners for a night on the town and making the TV talk-show rounds to dispense wisdom on what it felt like to be every woman's ``ultimate male.'' There was just one teeny problem: Shafer was a gay man passing as straight. Now Shafer _ as writer, director and star, has turned his true-life ``adventure'' into a mockumentary, interspersing interviews and re-enactments with actual clips of his appearances on ``Donahue,'' ``The Maury Povich Show,'' etc. Alas, the real stuff proves far more fascinating and funny than the staged scenes, which come off as glib and amateurish. Not rated, but there are adult themes as well as vulgar language.  Mission Impossible PG-13  Another update of a '60s TV show, this one featuring the megawatt star power of Tom Cruise, with cheeky Brian De Palma (``The Untouchables'') handling directing duties. Cruise stars as a super-secret agent trying to keep a list of his colleagues from falling into the wrong hands.  Mr. Holland's Opus PG  The corn is as high as an elephant's eye in this unabashedly sentimental melodrama. And guess what? The cornier it gets, the better the picture works. Oscar nominee Richard Dreyfuss stars as a would- be composer who devotes 30 years of his life to teaching high school music students. Director Stephen Herek has shaped the film into easily absorbed TV- size chunks that are given focus and humor thanks to a solid cast and Dreyfuss' energized, razor-sharp performance. Goodbye, Mr. Chips; hello, Mr. Holland. Rated PG for mild language.  Mrs. Winterbourne PG-13  Ricki Lake, who made her film debut in the John Waters romp ``Hairspray'' before becoming TV's heir apparent to Oprah, returns to the big screen in this contrived mistaken- identity comedy. She plays a penniless pregnant woman who assumes the identity of a wealthy train crash victim. The movie throws logic to the wind with a succession of plot shortcuts and tortured twists, and Lake strains through it all with an eager-beaver amateurishness that's hard to watch. Waters' rough- hewn irreverence suited her better; here, Richard Benjamin's Hollywood-slick direction clashes with her lack of polish. Rated PG-13 for language and adult themes. _ Doug Hamilton  Mulholland Falls R  We're in a period- drenched L.A. where there's always cool jazz on the soundtrack, a dame in trouble and a seeming penny-ante murder will inevitably lead to a high-level coverup. It's not ``Chinatown.'' But it is ``Chinatown'' Lite and that's not such a bad thing. Nick Nolte leads a squad of dapper LAPD detectives as they try to discover the link between a lovely corpse and the Atomic Energy Commission. New Zealand director Lee Tamahori guides a strong cast (Chazz Palminteri, Chris Penn, Michael Madsen, John Malkovich) with a sure hand. Rated R for violence and language.  Muppet Treasure Island G  Yo! Ho! Ho! and a barrel of fun! The Muppets take to the high seas in this loose musical adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic adventure about pirates, buried treasure and a brave lad named Jim Hawkins (Kevin Bishop). Tim Curry co-stars as Long John Silver; he's convincing, though a bit upstaged by his felt colleagues. Kudos all 'round to the usual Mupport support team: director Brian Henson and his hands-on puppeteers, Frank Oz (Miss Piggy), former Atlantan Steve Whitmire (Kermit the Frog), David Goelz (the Great Gonzo) and Jerry Nelson and Kevin Clash as just about everyone else. Mystery Science Theater 3000:  The Movie PG- 13  Just like the TV show, only bigger. A reluctant human guinea pig (Mike J. Nelson) and two robot companions are forced to endure a Really Bad Movie as part of an experiment conducted by a mad scientist (Trace Beaulieu). To keep some semblance of sanity, they offset the idiocy onscreen with a running commentary of pop culture sarcasms and stream-of-consciousness gags. The movie's movie is ``This Island Earth,'' '50s sci-fi silliness about big-headed aliens. But don't worry about its plot; just sit back and try to catch as many of the jokes as you can. Rated PG-13 for language and sexual innuendo.  Oliver &AMP; Company G  Andrew and company thought ``Oliver &AMP; Company'' was just swell and since Andrew is 5, I must defer, in part, to his expert opinion. However, adult connoisseurs of Disney animated magic will be bored silly _ or downright disgusted _ by this slight tale, very slightly based on ``Oliver Twist.'' Oliver is an orphaned kitten and Fagin's gang is a bunch of Manhattan mutts, most of whom are more crudely drawn (and crudely acted) versions of the jailhouse crowd in ``Lady and the Tramp.'' Take the kids, if they insist, but find yourself something else to see while they're in there.  Original Gangstas R  Much more than a nostalgia trip for fans of the 1970's ``blaxploitation'' films, this picture covers ground similar to that of John Singleton's ``Boyz N the Hood'' (1991) and Spike Lee's ``Do the Right Thing'' (1989), but from a sadder and wiser perspective. And it delivers as generous a measure of sensational entertainment value as any of the ``Shaft'' or ``Superfly'' pictures of a generation ago. A retired gridiron star (Fred Williamson) returns to his hometown to deal with a family emergency: His father (Oscar Brown Jr.) has been wounded in a gang vendetta. A local beautician (Pam Grier) has lost a son in a related shooting. Another friend (Jim Brown), once a great prizefighter, returns to the old neighborhood, drawn by his secret grief in connection with the tragedy. And two businessmen (Ron O'Neal and Richard Roundtree) wonder resentfully why their famous compadres have waited until now to come home.  The Pallbearer PG-13  An amiable showcase for a pair of up-and-comers named David Schwimmer and Gwyneth Paltrow. A year out of college and still living with mom (Carol Kane), Schwimmer is mistakenly asked by Barbara Hershey to be a pallbearer at her son's funeral (``mistakenly'' because he doesn't even remember the guy). What ensues is a Mrs. Robinsonlike seduction, which leads to a ``Graduate''-like triangle. But the movie is more like an extended episode of ``Friends'' than the Dustin Hoffman classic. That it doesn't add up to much doesn't really matter. It is what it is: an appealing, non-threatening Date Movie, suitable for the just-met or the almost- engaged. Rated PG-13 for sexual material and adult themes.

Richard Gere stars as a high-powered attorney who defends a stuttering altar boy (Edward Norton) accused of murdering an archbishop. The kind of lawyer who spends as much time on magazine covers as he does in the courtroom, Gere doesn't care if the kid is guilty; he simply wants to win a front-page-friendly case. The top-notch supporting cast includes Laura Linney, John Mahoney, Alfre Woodard and John Mahoney. But the buzz is going to be about newcomer Norton, who gives the kind of electrifying performance that jump-starts careers in a big way. Rated R for violence and language.  Sgt. Bilko PG  The laughs are AWOL in this frenzied remake of the some-would-say-classic '50s sitcom ``The Phil Silvers Show'' (called ``Sgt. Bilko'' in syndication). Steve Martin takes over the role of Army Sgt. Ernie Bilko, the scheming officer in charge of the motor pool at fictional Fort Baxter. Martin works overtime to combine Silvers' bluster with his own ``wild and crazy'' mannerisms. It's an annoyingly hyper performance. Phil Hartman steals the show as Bilko's nasty nemesis, Major Thorn. Few comedic actors can make uptight and overbearing seem so effortlessly funny. Rated PG-13 for language. _ Doug Hamilton  A Thin Line Between  Love &AMP; Hate R  Martin Lawrence wrote, directed and stars in this comedy about a ladies' man who tangles with the wrong lady (Lynn Whitfield). The idea, apparently, was to do a comic spin on ``Waiting to Exhale'' _ ``Waiting to Explode,'' perhaps. But there's a thin line between amusing macho bluster and nasty piggishness and Lawrence blurs it too often. Further, while Lawrence has a certain limited appeal, Whitfield has 10 times the presence and 100 times the talent. He's a bargain basement Eddie Murphy; she's in Angela Bassett's league. Rated R for language, sex and sexual innuendo.  Toy Story G  A knockout. The first feature to be fully computer-generated, the all-ages comedy taps our childhood fantasies about the lives toys lead when the bedroom door closes. And it injects grown-up humor by making these Mr. Potato Heads and Slinky Dogs as psychologically diverse as any human. As neurotic as they are nice, the toys fret about their young owner Andy's birthday party, worried about getting edged out by a super-duper new toy. Longtime fave cowboy Woody (voice by Tom Hanks) gets upstaged by newcomer Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), a gleaming plastic hero. In this mock epic, Woody and Buzz go out into the ``real world,'' where they scamper beneath 18-wheelers, flee a toothy canine and survive the sadistic antics of the kid next door. Four years in the making, the film is a jaw- dropping spectacle, with one bravura sequence topping the one before. Give it five minutes, and this laugh-out-loud delight can turn the scroogiest Scrooge into a happy kid. ``Toy Story' will receive an Oscar for special achievement. _ Steve Murray  The Truth About  Cats &AMP; Dogs PG-13  An astute gender inversion of that moldy oldie ``Cyrano de Bergerac.'' Hip comedian Janeane Garofalo plays Abby Barnes, a radio talk-show host with zero self-esteem who gets a leggy model friend (Uma Thurman) to stand in for her at a face-to-face meeting with an interested caller. Here's the twist: Abby isn't cursed with a bird-perch proboscis. She's just average looking. The movie's powerful message is that this is enough to render her a freak in a society that places impossible standards on female beauty. Garofalo, in her first starring role, gives a fully realized performance as a modern Everywoman. Rated PG-13 for language and sex. _ Doug Hamilton  Twister PG-13  This expert special-effects extravaganza reminds us that it can be nice to fool with Mother Nature. From the safety of your theater seat, that is. Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton lead a bunch of tornado-chasers across Oklahoma (where the wind comes sweeping down the plain with a vengeance) in this Weather Channel fantasy. Don't worry about characters, story, dialogue, etc. Director Jan De Bont (``Speed'') and writers Michael Crichton (``Jurassic Park'') and Anne-Marie Martin (Missus Crichton) certainly haven't. They know what this movie is about: twisters, twisters and more twisters. You will believe a cow can fly . . . and a barn . . . and a combine . . .  Up Close &AMP; Personal PG-13  Score one for golden guy Robert Redford and golden gal Michelle Pfeiffer, who show us what star power is really about in this glossy, high-profile romance with a TV news backdrop. Pfeiffer is the raw youngster who rises from weather girl to network star; Redford is the crusty news director, oozing with integrity, who acts as her mentor (``She eats the lens'') and falls in love with her. Director Jon Avnet and writers Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne have crossed ``A Star Is Born'' with ``Broadcast News'' and come up with a movie that's not as tough or complex as it could be. But with accomplished ``lens-eaters'' like Redford and Pfeiffer on hand, it's the kind of old-fashioned love story that's infatuated audiences for decades. Rated PG-13 for language and adult themes.  Waiting to Exhale R  A breath of fresh air. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon play friends in this glossy, well-acted adaptation of Terry McMillan's best seller. Forest Whitaker, better known for his acting in ``Bird'' and ``The Crying Game,'' provides the expert direction. And as for the reported ``male bashing,'' before you take your man, simply ask yourself, is he man enough to take it? Whitaker is. And he's man enough to dish it out, too. Rated R for sex, language and adult themes.  The White Balloon NR  On New Year's Day, a 7-year-old Iranian girl (Aida Mohammadkhani) begs her mom for money to buy a goldfish, but loses the bank note before reaching the corner pet shop. How she gets her money and her fish is the entire plot of this Cannes prize-winner. Some may find the stubborn moppet's encounters with a variety of adults beguiling; others may find them just plain boring. The glimpses of everyday life in Tehran are most welcome, but even at a scant 85 minutes, you may max out on the movie's neo-realist minimalism long before Aida goes for the gold(fish). .

They move weekly to clients of the New York Times News Service.  G: General audiences. Nothing that would offend parents if viewed by children.  PG: Parental guidance suggested. May contain some material parents consider inappropriate for young children.  PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for preteens.  R: Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking children.  NC-17: No one under 17 admitted. Replaces the X rating.  NR: Not rated.  Anne Frank Remembered PG  This Oscar-winning documentary reveals the flesh-and-blood teen behind the most famous victim of Hitler's Final Solution. Through interviews, photos, newsreels and one startling 1941 home movie, Jon Blair gives us new insights into and appreciation for the girl whose diary put a human face on the Holocaust. He also pays a much-deserved tribute to Miep Gies, the astonishingly heroic Dutchwoman who risked her life for the Franks and saved Anne's diary for posterity. Deftly narrated by Kenneth Branagh, with Glenn Close reading diary excerpts, the movie may sound like a total downer, but it isn't. It's both oddly uplifting and a poignant reminder that, if history is written by winners, it must be counted as some sort of triumph that one young girl's words have long outlived Hitler's proposed thousand-year Reich. Rated PG for adult themes.  The Arrival PG-13  Taking a cue from ``The X-Files,'' this sci-fi thriller deals with aliens and a government coverup. Charlie Sheen plays a radio astronomer who gets canned when he receives a transmission from space. _ Doug Hamilton  Barb Wire R  ``Baywatch'' body Pamela Anderson Lee makes her movie debut in this comic book adaptation set in a dystopian future. Her title character is a nightclub-owning mercenary in Steel Harbor, a lawless free zone of corrupt cops, Gestapolike government forces and struggling resistance fighters. We're talking ``Casablanca'' in fish net stockings and black leather. (Though sadly, the soundtrack lacks a heavy metal version of ``As Time Goes By.'') Everything about ``Barb Wire'' is sublimely ridiculous, but nothing is more absurd than Lee herself, whose idea of method acting was to get an actual barbed-wire tattoo. With a range of facial expressions that runs the gamut from pouty glare to glaring pout, her every screen moment provides a laugh, whether she's killing a club heckler with a stiletto high heel or taking a bubble bath. Rated R for violence and nudity. _ Mark Binelli  The Birdcage R  There's nothing terribly wrong with Mike Nichols' scene-by-scene remake of the 1978 French farce _ except the intervening 18 years. What used to cause a belly laugh now earns a pleasant chuckle. Robin Williams plays Armand, the relatively butch half of a gay couple. Nathan Lane is Albert, his shrieking drag-queen companion. Chaos arrives when Armand's son Val (Dan Futterman) brings home the parents of his fiancee: ultraconservative Senator Keeley (Gene Hackman) and his wife, Louise (Dianne Wiest). Armand can play it straight, but what to do with the hyper-nelly Albert? The movie ought to take off into the laughing-gas stratosphere of the best farces. But at 20 minutes longer than the French original, the film feels padded. Like ``To Wong Foo,'' the movie feels a little safe, a little tired. Rated R for language and sexual situations. _ Steve Murray  Boys PG-13  In this excruciatingly inert coming-of-age drama, not only does the gawky adolescent hero get the girl, she's none other than . . . Winona Ryder! Lukas Haas, best known as the Amish boy in ``Witness,'' plays a sullen prep school youth who comes upon Ryder's unconscious waif in a field. He takes her to his dorm room, nurses her back to health and learns that she's in trouble with the law. Does he turn her over to the cops, or ditch school and go on the lam with her? Hey, it's Winona Ryder, for crying out loud! The actress is radiant as usual, but she's overwhelmed by the movie's listless tone. Haas, now a gangly young adult, appears to still be acting with Amish reserve. Kindly put, he plays nondescript very well. _ Doug Hamilton  Brain Candy R  This curiously bland film debut by the sketch-comedy troupe Kids in the Hall is hampered by a laborious central plot about the invention of a ``happy pill.'' Kevin McDonald (the strangest Kid) plays a research scientist who develops a drug that cures depression; Mark McKinney (the tallest Kid) plays the CEO of a pharmaceutical company who rushes the untested drug onto the market. What modest pleasures the movie has to offer come from a handful of hilarious asides, including Bruce McCullogh (the funniest Kid) as a grunge rocker and Scott Thompson (the gay Kid) as a straight-arrow father whose arrow is less straight than he lets on. Estranged member David Foley (the squarest Kid) gives an apathetic performance in a few blah roles. Rated R for language, sexual innuendo and adult themes. _ Doug Hamilton  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960524.0060 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(2ndtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Broken Arrow R  Air Force pilot Christian Slater goes up against his buddy John Travolta, who steals two nuclear warheads from their Stealth bomber with a plan to ransom an entire city. Basically, the movie is one long chase in the desert, as Slater teams with perky park ranger Samantha Mathis _ and tracks the bad guys on foot (that must be a small desert). Packed with implausibility, the movie should be a lot of dumb fun. But it can't decide if it's ``Indiana Jones'' or ``Fail- Safe.'' Directed by Hong Kong action czar John Woo, it's played too broadly to make us genuinely tense, but it's not over-the-top enough to make us giddy with thrills. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  The Celluloid Closet R  A not-to-be-missed outing in every since of the word. Narrated by Lily Tomlin, this immensely entertaining and illuminating documentary examines images of gays and lesbians on film for the past 100 years. Along with a plethora of wonderful clips (everything from Dietrich in ``Morocco'' to Terence Stamp in ``The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert''), the movie offers incisive commentary by the likes of Gore Vidal, Armistead Maupin, Tom Hanks, Susan Sarandon. An amazing prism through which we may view both cinema and society, ``The Celluloid Closet'' has something for everyone, gay or straight. Rated R for adult themes.  Celtic Pride PG-13  Septic movie. The luck of the Irish is about as bad as it can get in this excruciating noncomedy about a couple of fanatic Boston Celtics fans (Daniel Stern and Dan Aykroyd) who kidnap the star player (Damon Wayans) of a rival team so their beloved Celtics can win Game 7 of the NBA Finals. Over-the-top fandom is a fairly funny premise for a film, but this one soon turns tedious and predictable. Worse, its simple plot and broad humor would make it a good film for 10-year- olds, but the filmmakers have drenched it in vulgar language and unsubtle sexual innuendo (hence the PG-13 rating). Why anyone would want to make something like this is almost as puzzling as why anyone would want to sit through it. Rated PG-13 for language and sexual innuendo.  The Craft R  This not-quite-bewitching thriller uses an MTV veneer to mask its conventionally moral heart. Set to a hip, alternative rock soundtrack, it tells the story of four Catholic schoolgirls who explore sisterhood and empowerment through witchcraft. Their experiments with the occult end up destroying their innocence and wrecking their friendship. The four leads _ Robin Tunney, Fairuza Balk, Neve Campbell and Rachel True _ all give complex, multilayered performances. And the movie taps into a universal youth fantasy: Who hasn't wished for supernatural powers as a guard against the cruelties of adolescence? Ultimately, though, ``The Craft'' is sunk by heavy-handed sermonizing. Rated R for violence, language and adult themes._ Doug Hamilton  Dead Man R  The Wild West becomes the Weird West in Jim Jarmusch's mytho-poetic meditation on a beloved genre. Johnny Depp stars as a mild-mannered accountant who goes west and finds himself on a surreal odyssey that takes him from so-called civilization to a natural state (both savage and enlightened). Gary Farmer co- stars as his Native American guide and spiritual adviser. Robert Mitchum, John Hurt and Gabriel Byrne turn up in cameos. Some may find the film a ploddingly paced, heavy-handed allegory. But even those put off by Jarmusch's hipster whimsy and elliptical narrative will be impressed by Robby Muller's exquisitely textured photography and Neil Young's evocative score.  Dead Man Walking R  In Tim Robbins' deadly earnest, intermittently powerful death-row drama, a nun (Susan Sarandon) becomes involved with a convicted murderer (Sean Penn). Both give riveting portrayals (though Penn's arrogant, racist redneck is getting most of the attention). The problem is the movie isn't really about either character. It's about an issue _ the pros and cons of the death penalty _ which means it often lapses into the message-conscious style of a '50s TV drama. Still, Robbins manages a shatteringly effective final half hour simply by showing us how capital punishment works in every gruesome and dehumanizing detail. Sarandon just won a best actress Oscar for her performance.  Diabolique R  A so-bad-it's-funny remake of the classic Clouzot thriller. At a run-down boys' school, an icy mistress (Sharon Stone) and a dishrag wife (Isabelle Adjani) join forces to murder the man making them both miserable: Adjani's sadistic husband (Chazz Palminteri). The 1955 original was a triumph of atmosphere, character, diabolical wit and outright scare-you- silly shock tactics. The remake reduces everything to the Gothic-thriller plot, some idiotically overripe lesbian innuendo and the campiest dialogue this side of ``Mommie Dearest.'' ``Killing him was a good thing,'' Stone says reassuringly to Adjani. ``Like planting a tree.'' Rated R for violence, sex, nudity and language.  Don't Be a Menace  to South Central While Drinking  Your Juice in the Hood R  A vehicle for Shawn and Marlon Wayans, the two youngest members of the comic family that includes brothers Damon and Keenen Ivory. This ``Airplane!''-style parody takes broad, juvenile jabs at such urban ``message'' movies as ``Menace II Society'' and ``Boyz N the Hood.'' If not all the jokes here work, many of the ones that do have extra weight. When two characters are busted for ``being black on a Friday night'' and taken to a police station equipped with a Rodney King punch-and-kick video game, the movie turns from goofy fun to comedy that tickles and stings. _ Doug Hamilton  Down Periscope PG-13  ``Police Academy'' on a submarine. A very un-``Frasier''-like Kelsey Grammer stars as a subversive sub commander who pulls the requisite group of misfits together into a shipshape team and beats a crazed Bruce Dern at his own war game. Fans of ``Frasier'' may be dismayed by the wanton waste of Grammer's talents _ he coasts through wearing a fixed, avuncular smile _ but he doesn't disgrace himself and there are worse ways to break into movies. Think of it as a good movie for 12-year-olds of all ages. Rated PG-13 for language and mild sexuality.  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960524.0061 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(3rdtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Executive Decision R  A crafty pastiche of Tom Clancy, ``Die Hard'' and ``Airport.'' Kurt Russell plays Dr. David Grant, a civilian intelligence consultant for the U.S. military. An amateur pilot in his spare time, Grant inadvertently ends up the key player in an attempt to thwart the hijacking of a 747 by a Hamas-style terrorist group. Though Steven Seagal makes a brief appearance as the commanding officer of an elite anti-terrorist force, there is a welcome lack of chest-beating here that one might find in the average testosterone-fueled action vehicle. Grant is a thinker, not a warrior. The consultant as conquering hero? This nail biter could make it a trend. Rated R for language and violence. _ Doug Hamilton  Fargo R  A tale of murder, greed and morning sickness in Minnesota, this squalidly hilarious black comedy marks a return to top form for the Coen Brothers (``Blood Simple''). Sleazy car salesman William H. Macy hires two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wealthy wife (they'll split the ransom dad-in-law coughs up). But things go awry and soon Frances McDormand, the very pregnant police chief of Brainerd, Minn. (Home of Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox), is on the case. Loosely based on real incidents that occurred in 1987, the movie exists in some surreal cinematic convergence of Mayberry, Twin Peaks and SCTV. It's a great place for any movie lover to visit _ provided, of course, you bring along a very sick sense of humor. Rated R for sex, nudity, violence and language.  Fear R  Marky Mark is terrifying as a teen psycho in this standard thriller, patterned after ``Fatal Attraction.'' Yes, Marky Mark _ that hip-hoppin', pants-droppin' brother of a New Kid on the Block. (Since turning thespian, he goes by his given name, Mark Wahlberg.) ``Fear'' marks the Markster's first starring role, following smaller parts in ``Renaissance Man'' and ``The Basketball Diaries.'' Judging by his performance, he's got a fine career ahead of him playing bad guys. He's also got a fine foil here in Reese Witherspoon, a nubile young actress with a wise old aura who plays the object of his obsession. Predictable from the get-go, the movie still builds suspense nicely and scores points for not tacking on one of those psycho-rises-from-the-dead endings. Rated R for violence, sex and language. _ Doug Hamilton  Flipper PG  Everybody's favorite TV dolphin gets his big-screen debut in this family adventure. Elijah Wood (aging much more gracefully than Macaulay Culkin) plays a bratty teen whose bummer of a summer is brightened when he befriends a chatty aquatic mammal.  Flirting With Disaster R  Ben Stiller goes in search of his biological parents in David O. Russell's hilarious comedy. With his wife (Patricia Arquette) and a psychobabbling therapist (Tea Leoni) from the adoption agency in tow, Stiller crisscrosses the country looking for his roots. What he finds are enough dysfunctional-family entanglements to choke Jerry Springer. As Stiller's adopted parents, Mary Tyler Moore and George Segal exhibit a finely sifted neuroticism worthy of ``Seinfeld'' while Lily Tomlin and Alan Alda play acid-head remnants from the '60s. The movie loses some of its fizz in its last half-hour; even so, Russell may be the most bracingly original satirist to hit the movies since Albert Brooks. Rated R for language and adult themes.  Frank and Ollie PG  A loving, lovely documentary about Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, two of Disney's renowned Nine Old Men, i.e., the core group of artists on whose imagination and skill Uncle Walt built his Magic Kingdom. Written and directed by Thomas' son, Theodore, the movie is like a quickie history of Disney animation. True, it's a sanitized, pro-company version, in which working for Disney was only slightly less delightful than working for Santa. Still Frank 'n' Ollie are captivating and between them, they've created some of the most famous scenes in cinema history. As a stagehand says before a TV appearance, ``So you're the guys who killed Bambi's mother.''  From Dusk Till Dawn R  Robert Rodriguez's hyperviolent vampire flick stars scripter Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney (in a dynamic big- screen crossover) as killer bank robbers who kidnap a retired minister (Harvey Keitel) and his kids (including Juliette Lewis). Bad luck for them, these anti- heroes stop at a Mexican bar _ catering to bikers and bloodsuckers. The long opening setup is vintage Tarantino, full of bloody shocks and sick humor. But once the saloon's staff morph into vampires, ``Dusk'' heads into Sam Raimi's ``Evil Dead'' territory, complete with spewing eyeballs and severed limbs. It's an excuse for a couple of way-talented filmmakers to have gruesome fun. And for most of the time, we do, too. But the squeamish, beware. Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity. _ Steve Murray  Girl 6 R  Typically, Spike Lee works best when he's worked up about something. But  this comedy about an aspiring actress (Theresa Randle) who takes a job as a phone-sex girl, shows a frisky, almost larkish side that's as welcome as it is unexpected. Suzan-Lori Parks' script covers some familiar territory and lacks a satisfying resolution, but the director diverts our attention with kicky visuals, heavyweight cameos and some hilarious fantasies. And Randle, with her blend of movie-star sparkle and girl-next-door likability makes an appealing protagonist. Rated R for sex, language, nudity and adult themes.  The Great White Hype R  Samuel L. Jackson stars as a Don King-ish boxing promoter in this knockout satire. To freshen up boxing's box office, Jackson digs up a white guy (``Chicago Hope's'' Peter Berg) to fight the current heavyweight champ (Damon Wayans). Director Reginald Hudlin and writers Tony Hendra and Ron Shelton are equal-opportunity nasty, gleefully sending up everything from racism in sports to faked fan letters from crippled little boys. Jackson's snake-charmer charisma helps center the movie's admittedly scattershot approach. A warning: This comedy is rowdy, crude, irreverent and uncontrolled. And refreshing as hell. Rated R for language and adult material.

He plays the title role, a failed hockey player who discovers his slap shot training has given him a killer golf swing. When his grandmother's house is repossessed by the IRS, he joins the pro golf circuit to make money to buy it back. After last year's mean-spirited ``Billy Madison,'' it's nice to see Sandler display a sweet side. Too bad the movie degenerates into a by-the- numbers rewrite of ``Caddyshack.'' Rated PG-13 for language. _ Doug Hamilton  Homeward Bound II:  Lost in San Francisco G  Sassy the Himalayan cat, Chance the American bulldog and Shadow the golden retriever aren't the only things that are lost in this sequel to the 1993 hit. Also missing is its predecessor's lovely animal-lover lyricism. This time, they wander the streets of San Francisco where they're menaced by buffoonish dog thieves and rescued by a gang of streetwise pooches (think, Dead End Dogs). The voice talent _ Sally Field as sarcastic Sassy, Michael J. Fox as irrepressible Chance and Ralph Waite (replacing the late Don Ameche) as dignified Shadow _ is as good as ever, but too many talking animals spoil the movie. The first film moved you to tears; the sequel is standard baby-sitter stuff for undemanding kids.  If Lucy Fell R  Don't fall for this flat romantic comedy. Sarah Jessica Parker and Eric Schaeffer (who also wrote the script and directed) play longtime platonic roomies who've made a pact: If neither is romantically involved by the time Parker turns 30, they'll jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. Parker is game in an unflattering part and Elle Macpherson and Ben Stiller are fine in limited roles as potential romantic possibilities. But Schaeffer is a big black hole in the middle of his own picture. The character he's written is funny, sensitive, bright and charismatic in his own muddled way; the character he plays on screen is none of these things. Rated R for sxual situations, nudity and language.  James and the Giant Peach PG  Not the pits, but not peachy keen, either. Roald Dahl's comically macabre tale of a little boy and his buggy pals who sail a giant peach across the ocean has been turned into a classy but cold fantasy featuring the voices of Susan Sarandon (as a Garbo-ish spider), Richard Dreyfuss (a street-tough centipede) and David Thewlis (a woe-is-me earthworm). A good deal of craft and imagination have gone into this film, but everything from the script to Randy Newman's score suffers by comparison to ``Toy Story.'' Certainly kid-worthy, but grown-ups who've made the trek north on I-85 may find themselves less tickled by the movie than by the titular fruit's resemblance to its country cousin outside Gaffney, S.C. Rated PG for mildly scary scenes.  Jane Eyre PG  Opulent and intelligently acted, Franco Zeffirelli's version of Charlotte Bronte's famous Gothic love story is as emotionally acute as it is picture-pretty. The title role is shared by Oscar winner Anna Paquin as the young Jane and Charlotte Gainsbourg as the 20ish Jane who accepts a job as a governess at remote Thornfield Hall. William Hurt is unexpectedly fine as her enigmatic employer, the brooding Mr. Rochester. Unlike the director's famous ``Romeo and Juliet'' in the '60s, there's nothing radical here. Still, this is a sure-footed, satisfying film, one that reminds us that Bronte's tale is as much a ghost story as it is a romance. If you're in the mood for some lush tortured-lovers escapism, you could hardly do better. Rated PG for mildly scary scenes.  Jumanji PG  Robin Williams shows us where the wild things are in this effects-laden family fantasy about a mysterious board game that can bring rhinos into your living room or turn a house into a primeval swamp. Director Joe Johnstone (``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'') knows how to thrill an audience with outsized insects or a stampede down Main Street. But the movie goes on a roll of the dice or two too long. And in-between ``plays,'' things get frankly boring. Bottom line: If you've seen the trailer, you've already seen all the best parts. And those ``best parts'' may be a little scary for littler kids. Johnston does nothing to up the ante; it's like playing Candyland instead of Monopoly. Rated PG for violence.  Larger Than Life PG-13  Bill Murray may be big, but this time, his co-star's bigger. The comedian must fight for screen time with a pachyderm in this comedy about a man who is bequeathed a circus elephant by his father. Janeane Garofalo appears as a helpful animal trainer.  Last Dance R  A plot summary suggests a gender-reversed ``Dead Man Walking,'' with Sharon Stone on death row and Rob Morrow as the outsider from the state clemency office who forms a bond with her. But director Bruce Beresford is less concerned with capital punishment than he is with his characters' emotional journey. True, Stone's sour, insolent inmate softens up far too quickly (plus, she looks better after years in prison than most of us do on prom night), but Beresford has cushioned his potentially too-familiar central story with some fine supporting characters _ Randy Quaid as Morrow's crusty boss and Peter Gallagher as his overachieving brother. In fact, you could film a second movie out of Morrow/Gallagher's sibling rivalry.  Leaving Las Vegas R  ``Viva Las Vegas'' on two dozen downers and a case of Jack Black. Oscar nominee Nicolas Cage is an alcoholic Hollywood screenwriter who pockets his severance check and heads to Vegas to drink himself to death. Oscar nominee Elisabeth Shue is a Vegas hooker who gets hooked on his devil-may-care despair. The movie is a bit of a drunk itself _ given to self-indulgent poses and poetic pretentiousness. But Cage and Shue are willing _ and able _ to do director Mike Figgis' dirty work for him. Their terrific performances leave you feeling unclean and sober.

That meant he was contractually obligated to spend the next 12 months posing for sexy pictures, accompanying contest winners for a night on the town and making the TV talk-show rounds to dispense wisdom on what it felt like to be every woman's ``ultimate male.'' There was just one teeny problem: Shafer was a gay man passing as straight. Now Shafer _ as writer, director and star, has turned his true-life ``adventure'' into a mockumentary, interspersing interviews and re-enactments with actual clips of his appearances on ``Donahue,'' ``The Maury Povich Show,'' etc. Alas, the real stuff proves far more fascinating and funny than the staged scenes, which come off as glib and amateurish. Not rated, but there are adult themes as well as vulgar language.  Mission Impossible PG-13  Another update of a '60s TV show, this one featuring the megawatt star power of Tom Cruise, with cheeky Brian De Palma (``The Untouchables'') handling directing duties. Cruise stars as a super-secret agent trying to keep a list of his colleagues from falling into the wrong hands.  Mr. Holland's Opus PG  The corn is as high as an elephant's eye in this unabashedly sentimental melodrama. And guess what? The cornier it gets, the better the picture works. Oscar nominee Richard Dreyfuss stars as a would- be composer who devotes 30 years of his life to teaching high school music students. Director Stephen Herek has shaped the film into easily absorbed TV- size chunks that are given focus and humor thanks to a solid cast and Dreyfuss' energized, razor-sharp performance. Goodbye, Mr. Chips; hello, Mr. Holland. Rated PG for mild language.  Mrs. Winterbourne PG-13  Ricki Lake, who made her film debut in the John Waters romp ``Hairspray'' before becoming TV's heir apparent to Oprah, returns to the big screen in this contrived mistaken- identity comedy. She plays a penniless pregnant woman who assumes the identity of a wealthy train crash victim. The movie throws logic to the wind with a succession of plot shortcuts and tortured twists, and Lake strains through it all with an eager-beaver amateurishness that's hard to watch. Waters' rough- hewn irreverence suited her better; here, Richard Benjamin's Hollywood-slick direction clashes with her lack of polish. Rated PG-13 for language and adult themes. _ Doug Hamilton  Mulholland Falls R  We're in a period- drenched L.A. where there's always cool jazz on the soundtrack, a dame in trouble and a seeming penny-ante murder will inevitably lead to a high-level coverup. It's not ``Chinatown.'' But it is ``Chinatown'' Lite and that's not such a bad thing. Nick Nolte leads a squad of dapper LAPD detectives as they try to discover the link between a lovely corpse and the Atomic Energy Commission. New Zealand director Lee Tamahori guides a strong cast (Chazz Palminteri, Chris Penn, Michael Madsen, John Malkovich) with a sure hand. Rated R for violence and language.  Muppet Treasure Island G  Yo! Ho! Ho! and a barrel of fun! The Muppets take to the high seas in this loose musical adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic adventure about pirates, buried treasure and a brave lad named Jim Hawkins (Kevin Bishop). Tim Curry co-stars as Long John Silver; he's convincing, though a bit upstaged by his felt colleagues. Kudos all 'round to the usual Mupport support team: director Brian Henson and his hands-on puppeteers, Frank Oz (Miss Piggy), former Atlantan Steve Whitmire (Kermit the Frog), David Goelz (the Great Gonzo) and Jerry Nelson and Kevin Clash as just about everyone else. Mystery Science Theater 3000:  The Movie PG- 13  Just like the TV show, only bigger. A reluctant human guinea pig (Mike J. Nelson) and two robot companions are forced to endure a Really Bad Movie as part of an experiment conducted by a mad scientist (Trace Beaulieu). To keep some semblance of sanity, they offset the idiocy onscreen with a running commentary of pop culture sarcasms and stream-of-consciousness gags. The movie's movie is ``This Island Earth,'' '50s sci-fi silliness about big-headed aliens. But don't worry about its plot; just sit back and try to catch as many of the jokes as you can. Rated PG-13 for language and sexual innuendo.  Oliver &AMP; Company G  Andrew and company thought ``Oliver &AMP; Company'' was just swell and since Andrew is 5, I must defer, in part, to his expert opinion. However, adult connoisseurs of Disney animated magic will be bored silly _ or downright disgusted _ by this slight tale, very slightly based on ``Oliver Twist.'' Oliver is an orphaned kitten and Fagin's gang is a bunch of Manhattan mutts, most of whom are more crudely drawn (and crudely acted) versions of the jailhouse crowd in ``Lady and the Tramp.'' Take the kids, if they insist, but find yourself something else to see while they're in there.  Original Gangstas R  Much more than a nostalgia trip for fans of the 1970's ``blaxploitation'' films, this picture covers ground similar to that of John Singleton's ``Boyz N the Hood'' (1991) and Spike Lee's ``Do the Right Thing'' (1989), but from a sadder and wiser perspective. And it delivers as generous a measure of sensational entertainment value as any of the ``Shaft'' or ``Superfly'' pictures of a generation ago. A retired gridiron star (Fred Williamson) returns to his hometown to deal with a family emergency: His father (Oscar Brown Jr.) has been wounded in a gang vendetta. A local beautician (Pam Grier) has lost a son in a related shooting. Another friend (Jim Brown), once a great prizefighter, returns to the old neighborhood, drawn by his secret grief in connection with the tragedy. And two businessmen (Ron O'Neal and Richard Roundtree) wonder resentfully why their famous compadres have waited until now to come home.  The Pallbearer PG-13  An amiable showcase for a pair of up-and-comers named David Schwimmer and Gwyneth Paltrow. A year out of college and still living with mom (Carol Kane), Schwimmer is mistakenly asked by Barbara Hershey to be a pallbearer at her son's funeral (``mistakenly'' because he doesn't even remember the guy). What ensues is a Mrs. Robinsonlike seduction, which leads to a ``Graduate''-like triangle. But the movie is more like an extended episode of ``Friends'' than the Dustin Hoffman classic. That it doesn't add up to much doesn't really matter. It is what it is: an appealing, non-threatening Date Movie, suitable for the just-met or the almost- engaged. Rated PG-13 for sexual material and adult themes.  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960524.0064 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(6thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Primal Fear R  A sleek, solid courtroom thriller directed by Emmy-winner Gregory Hoblit and based on William Diehl's best seller. Richard Gere stars as a high-powered attorney who defends a stuttering altar boy (Edward Norton) accused of murdering an archbishop. The kind of lawyer who spends as much time on magazine covers as he does in the courtroom, Gere doesn't care if the kid is guilty; he simply wants to win a front-page-friendly case. The top-notch supporting cast includes Laura Linney, John Mahoney, Alfre Woodard and John Mahoney. But the buzz is going to be about newcomer Norton, who gives the kind of electrifying performance that jump-starts careers in a big way. Rated R for violence and language.  Sgt. Bilko PG  The laughs are AWOL in this frenzied remake of the some-would-say-classic '50s sitcom ``The Phil Silvers Show'' (called ``Sgt. Bilko'' in syndication). Steve Martin takes over the role of Army Sgt. Ernie Bilko, the scheming officer in charge of the motor pool at fictional Fort Baxter. Martin works overtime to combine Silvers' bluster with his own ``wild and crazy'' mannerisms. It's an annoyingly hyper performance. Phil Hartman steals the show as Bilko's nasty nemesis, Major Thorn. Few comedic actors can make uptight and overbearing seem so effortlessly funny. Rated PG-13 for language. _ Doug Hamilton  A Thin Line Between  Love &AMP; Hate R  Martin Lawrence wrote, directed and stars in this comedy about a ladies' man who tangles with the wrong lady (Lynn Whitfield). The idea, apparently, was to do a comic spin on ``Waiting to Exhale'' _ ``Waiting to Explode,'' perhaps. But there's a thin line between amusing macho bluster and nasty piggishness and Lawrence blurs it too often. Further, while Lawrence has a certain limited appeal, Whitfield has 10 times the presence and 100 times the talent. He's a bargain basement Eddie Murphy; she's in Angela Bassett's league. Rated R for language, sex and sexual innuendo.  Toy Story G  A knockout. The first feature to be fully computer-generated, the all-ages comedy taps our childhood fantasies about the lives toys lead when the bedroom door closes. And it injects grown-up humor by making these Mr. Potato Heads and Slinky Dogs as psychologically diverse as any human. As neurotic as they are nice, the toys fret about their young owner Andy's birthday party, worried about getting edged out by a super-duper new toy. Longtime fave cowboy Woody (voice by Tom Hanks) gets upstaged by newcomer Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), a gleaming plastic hero. In this mock epic, Woody and Buzz go out into the ``real world,'' where they scamper beneath 18-wheelers, flee a toothy canine and survive the sadistic antics of the kid next door. Four years in the making, the film is a jaw- dropping spectacle, with one bravura sequence topping the one before. Give it five minutes, and this laugh-out-loud delight can turn the scroogiest Scrooge into a happy kid. ``Toy Story' will receive an Oscar for special achievement. _ Steve Murray  The Truth About  Cats &AMP; Dogs PG-13  An astute gender inversion of that moldy oldie ``Cyrano de Bergerac.'' Hip comedian Janeane Garofalo plays Abby Barnes, a radio talk-show host with zero self-esteem who gets a leggy model friend (Uma Thurman) to stand in for her at a face-to-face meeting with an interested caller. Here's the twist: Abby isn't cursed with a bird-perch proboscis. She's just average looking. The movie's powerful message is that this is enough to render her a freak in a society that places impossible standards on female beauty. Garofalo, in her first starring role, gives a fully realized performance as a modern Everywoman. Rated PG-13 for language and sex. _ Doug Hamilton  Twister PG-13  This expert special-effects extravaganza reminds us that it can be nice to fool with Mother Nature. From the safety of your theater seat, that is. Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton lead a bunch of tornado-chasers across Oklahoma (where the wind comes sweeping down the plain with a vengeance) in this Weather Channel fantasy. Don't worry about characters, story, dialogue, etc. Director Jan De Bont (``Speed'') and writers Michael Crichton (``Jurassic Park'') and Anne-Marie Martin (Missus Crichton) certainly haven't. They know what this movie is about: twisters, twisters and more twisters. You will believe a cow can fly . . . and a barn . . . and a combine . . .  Up Close &AMP; Personal PG-13  Score one for golden guy Robert Redford and golden gal Michelle Pfeiffer, who show us what star power is really about in this glossy, high-profile romance with a TV news backdrop. Pfeiffer is the raw youngster who rises from weather girl to network star; Redford is the crusty news director, oozing with integrity, who acts as her mentor (``She eats the lens'') and falls in love with her. Director Jon Avnet and writers Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne have crossed ``A Star Is Born'' with ``Broadcast News'' and come up with a movie that's not as tough or complex as it could be. But with accomplished ``lens-eaters'' like Redford and Pfeiffer on hand, it's the kind of old-fashioned love story that's infatuated audiences for decades. Rated PG-13 for language and adult themes.  Waiting to Exhale R  A breath of fresh air. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon play friends in this glossy, well-acted adaptation of Terry McMillan's best seller. Forest Whitaker, better known for his acting in ``Bird'' and ``The Crying Game,'' provides the expert direction. And as for the reported ``male bashing,'' before you take your man, simply ask yourself, is he man enough to take it? Whitaker is. And he's man enough to dish it out, too. Rated R for sex, language and adult themes.  The White Balloon NR  On New Year's Day, a 7-year-old Iranian girl (Aida Mohammadkhani) begs her mom for money to buy a goldfish, but loses the bank note before reaching the corner pet shop. How she gets her money and her fish is the entire plot of this Cannes prize-winner. Some may find the stubborn moppet's encounters with a variety of adults beguiling; others may find them just plain boring. The glimpses of everyday life in Tehran are most welcome, but even at a scant 85 minutes, you may max out on the movie's neo-realist minimalism long before Aida goes for the gold(fish). .

They move weekly to clients of the New York Times News Service.  G: General audiences. Nothing that would offend parents if viewed by children.  PG: Parental guidance suggested. May contain some material parents consider inappropriate for young children.  PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for preteens.  R: Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking children.  NC-17: No one under 17 admitted. Replaces the X rating.  NR: Not rated.  The Arrival PG-13  Alternately compelling and hokey, this sci-fi thriller is ultimately trapped in a thematic void somewhere between ``The X-Files'' and ``This Island Earth.'' Charlie Sheen plays a radio astronomer who picks up some truly ethereal static on his monitoring station's satellite dish. Convinced he's struck pay dirt, he takes the tape to NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab for analysis. To his surprise, not only does his boss (Ron Silver) remain dubious, but he has to let Zane go because of sudden department downsizing. Novice director David Twohy has his moments, particularly when choreographing suspense. But both direction and writing suffer from the same tonal problems. Unable to decide between being somber and sensational, the movie wavers unsatisfactorily between the two. Rated PG-13 for adult themes. _ Hollywood Reporter  The Birdcage R  There's nothing terribly wrong with Mike Nichols' scene-by-scene remake of the 1978 French farce _ except the intervening 18 years. What used to cause a belly laugh now earns a pleasant chuckle. Robin Williams plays Armand, the relatively butch half of a gay couple. Nathan Lane is Albert, his shrieking drag-queen companion. Chaos arrives when Armand's son Val (Dan Futterman) brings home the parents of his fiancee: ultraconservative Senator Keeley (Gene Hackman) and his wife, Louise (Dianne Wiest). Armand can play it straight, but what to do with the hyper- nelly Albert? The movie ought to take off into the laughing-gas stratosphere of the best farces. But at 20 minutes longer than the French original, the film feels padded. Like ``To Wong Foo,'' the movie feels a little safe, a little tired. Rated R for language and sexual situations. _ Steve Murray  Broken Arrow R  Air Force pilot Christian Slater goes up against his buddy John Travolta, who steals two nuclear warheads from their Stealth bomber with a plan to ransom an entire city. Basically, the movie is one long chase in the desert, as Slater teams with perky park ranger Samantha Mathis _ and tracks the bad guys on foot (that must be a small desert). Packed with implausibility, the movie should be a lot of dumb fun. But it can't decide if it's ``Indiana Jones'' or ``Fail-Safe.'' Directed by Hong Kong action czar John Woo, it's played too broadly to make us genuinely tense, but it's not over-the-top enough to make us giddy with thrills. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  The Cable Guy PG-13  Reports are that this Jim Carrey vehicle is darker than his usual super-silly fare, but in the trailer the rubber-faced comedian looks as ``Dumb and Dumber'' as he ever was. He plays a cable installer who becomes obsessed with one of his customers (Matthew Broderick). Ben Stiller directed.  Cemetery Man R  These dead men walking wouldn't want Susan Sarandon's spiritual care. They'd want to eat her. A kind of ``Night of the Living Dead'' gone gonzo-baroque, Michael Soavi's film stars Rupert Everett as a cemetery keeper whose corpses are coming back to life and attacking the living. Everett puts up with it (they can be re-killed with a bullet through the head) because he doesn't want the cemetery closed. It's the old dilemma: job security vs. putting up with flesh-eating ghouls. Though the movie has lapses of sophomoric silliness (especially in the sex scenes), it's still a satisfyingly sick flick.  Cold Comfort Farm PG  One of the best things to happen to a barnyard since ``Babe.'' Based on Stella Gibbons' popular 1932 book that deftly satirized the rustic rhapsodies of Hardy and Lawrence, John Schlesinger's movie is a sweet, savvy comic fable (think ``Clueless'' meets ``Tobacco Road''). Our heroine (the marvelous Kate Beckinsale) is a sleek, self-possessed socialite who goes to live with her country cousins in Sussex. With an ``as if'' aplomb worthy of Alicia Silverstone, she sets about tidying up the farm and her eccentric relatives' pigsty lives. The excellent supporting cast is a potpourri of prodigiously talented British actors, headed by Sir Ian McKellen (``Richard III''). Rated PG for mild adult themes.  MORE </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960703.0768 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(2ndtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> undated  Cold Fever NR  Icelandic director Fridrik Thor Fridriksson must be Jim Jarmusch's spiritual twin. His movie is a cooled-out road trip, a deadpan comedy-cum-spiritual fever dream set in a frozen landscape. Masatoshi Nagase stars as a Japanese yuppie who reluctantly journeys to Iceland to perform a memorial service for his parents, who died there several years earlier. He finds Iceland is a surreal Wonderland, full of spirits, Icelandic cowboys, German tourists, abusive Americans and Lord-knows- what-else. Nagase, who played the Japanese tourist in Jarmusch's ``Mystery Train'' is, once again, a winning stranger in a strange land.  The Craft R  This not-quite-bewitching thriller uses an MTV veneer to mask its conventionally moral heart. Set to a hip, alternative rock soundtrack, it tells the story of four Catholic schoolgirls who explore sisterhood and empowerment through witchcraft. Their experiments with the occult end up destroying their innocence and wrecking their friendship. The four leads _ Robin Tunney, Fairuza Balk, Neve Campbell and Rachel True _ all give complex, multilayered performances. And the movie taps into a universal youth fantasy: Who hasn't wished for supernatural powers as a guard against the cruelties of adolescence? Ultimately, though, ``The Craft'' is sunk by heavy-handed sermonizing. Rated R for violence, language and adult themes. _ Doug Hamilton  Dead Man Walking R  In Tim Robbins' deadly earnest, intermittently powerful death-row drama, a nun (Susan Sarandon) becomes involved with a convicted murderer (Sean Penn). Both give riveting portrayals (though Penn's arrogant, racist redneck is getting most of the attention). The problem is the movie isn't really about either character. It's about an issue _ the pros and cons of the death penalty _ which means it often lapses into the message-conscious style of a '50s TV drama. Still, Robbins manages a shatteringly effective final half hour simply by showing us how capital punishment works in every gruesome and dehumanizing detail. Sarandon won a best actress Oscar for her performance.  Diabolique R  A so-bad-it's-funny remake of the classic Clouzot thriller. At a run- down boys' school, an icy mistress (Sharon Stone) and a dishrag wife (Isabelle Adjani) join forces to murder the man making them both miserable: Adjani's sadistic husband (Chazz Palminteri). The 1955 original was a triumph of atmosphere, character, diabolical wit and outright scare-you-silly shock tactics. The remake reduces everything to the Gothic-thriller plot, some idiotically overripe lesbian innuendo and the campiest dialogue this side of ``Mommie Dearest.'' ``Killing him was a good thing,'' Stone says reassuringly to Adjani. ``Like planting a tree.'' Rated R for violence, sex, nudity and language.  Don't Be a Menace  to South Central While Drinking  Your Juice in the Hood R  A vehicle for Shawn and Marlon Wayans, the two youngest members of the comic family that includes brothers Damon and Keenen Ivory. This ``Airplane!''-style parody takes broad, juvenile jabs at such urban ``message'' movies as ``Menace II Society'' and ``Boyz N the Hood.'' If not all the jokes here work, many of the ones that do have extra weight. When two characters are busted for ``being black on a Friday night'' and taken to a police station equipped with a Rodney King punch-and-kick video game, the movie turns from goofy fun to comedy that tickles and stings. _ Doug Hamilton  Dragonheart PG-13  A drag. Knight Dennis Quaid teams up with Draco, the last dragon on Earth, to defeat an evil king (David Thewlis). Despite a hefty special-effects budget and a guest performance by Sean Connery as the voice of Draco, the movie is barely better than ``Pete's Dragon.'' Someone _ perhaps director Rob Cohen or writer Charles Edward Pogue _ should've realized that a friendly dragon becomes smaller than life, best-suited for the kids or a sitcom. There's no sense of peril here, no hint of soaring enchantments, no trace of wonder and awe. ``Dragonheart'' is a dragon movie made by people with no respect for dragons. Rated PG for mildly scary scenes.  Eddie PG-13  You have to like Whoopi Goldberg and round ball a whole, whole, whole lot to like this go-get'em sports comedy even a little. Whoopi plays a devout and opinionated New York Knicks fan who, thanks to a whim of the new owner (Frank Langella), becomes the team's coach. At first the players resent and ignore her, but then they come to appreciate . . . well, you're probably ahead of me already. At any rate, Whoopi still manages to be likable in the most unlikely projects (remember the Oscars). Without her, ``Eddie'' would be unwatchable. Even so, it's pretty close. Rated PG-13 for language and sexual innuendo.  Executive Decision R  A crafty pastiche of Tom Clancy, ``Die Hard'' and ``Airport.'' Kurt Russell plays Dr. David Grant, a civilian intelligence consultant for the U.S. military. An amateur pilot in his spare time, Grant inadvertently ends up the key player in an attempt to thwart the hijacking of a 747 by a Hamas-style terrorist group. Though Steven Seagal makes a brief appearance as the commanding officer of an elite anti-terrorist force, there is a welcome lack of chest-beating here that one might find in the average testosterone-fueled action vehicle. Grant is a thinker, not a warrior. The consultant as conquering hero? This nail biter could make it a trend. Rated R for language and violence. _ Doug Hamilton  Fargo R  A tale of murder, greed and morning sickness in Minnesota, this squalidly hilarious black comedy marks a return to top form for the Coen Brothers (``Blood Simple''). Sleazy car salesman William H. Macy hires two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wealthy wife (they'll split the ransom dad-in-law coughs up). But things go awry and soon Frances McDormand, the very pregnant police chief of Brainerd, Minn. (Home of Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox), is on the case. Loosely based on real incidents that occurred in 1987, the movie exists in some surreal cinematic convergence of Mayberry, Twin Peaks and SCTV. It's a great place for any movie lover to visit _ provided, of course, you bring along a very sick sense of humor. Rated R for sex, nudity, violence and language.

MILITIA-GAG (Phoenix) _ A judge Wednesday chastised federal prosecutors and agencies investigating the Viper Militia, saying they are attempting to try their case in the news media. But U.S. District Judge Earl Carroll said a gag order isn't necessary because federal court rule 4.13 already restricts public posturing by prosecutors and defendants in criminal cases. ``If the rule isn't complied with, I expect to hear about it,'' he said.

MILITIA-AT&AMP;T (Phoenix) _ For the past three years, Ellen Adella Belliveau was one of the thousands of AT&AMP;T employees who have access to telephone customers' records to handle billing accounts. But this week, Belliveau, 27, was accused of using her position at AT&AMP;T to obtain the telephone records of prospective Viper Militia members, federal documents filed Monday assert.

That's because most dropped farther underground than a fortified bunker in the aftermath of last year's Oklahoma City bombing. And militias may burrow even deeper now after the arrest this week of 12 members of the Viper Militia, whom law officers say were targeting the destruction of federal buildings in Phoenix.

Yes, Marky Mark _ that hip-hoppin', pants-droppin' brother of a New Kid on the Block. (Since turning thespian, he goes by his given name, Mark Wahlberg.) ``Fear'' marks the Markster's first starring role, following smaller parts in ``Renaissance Man'' and ``The Basketball Diaries.'' Judging by his performance, he's got a fine career ahead of him playing bad guys. He's also got a fine foil here in Reese Witherspoon, a nubile young actress with a wise old aura who plays the object of his obsession. Predictable from the get-go, the movie still builds suspense nicely and scores points for not tacking on one of those psycho-rises-from-the-dead endings. Rated R for violence, sex and language. _ Doug Hamilton  Flipper PG  Writer - director Alan Shapiro's remake of the '60s family classic ``Flipper'' is an entertaining summer diversion that doesn't take itself too seriously. It's predictable but fun. Elijah Wood is Sandy, a sullen city teen who's shipped off to live with his eccentric uncle for the summer on a remote Bahamian island while his parents hash out a messy divorce. Paul Hogan (``Crocodile Dundee'') is the bachelor uncle, Porter, who's found paradise in a ramshackle fishing camp. Neither nephew nor uncle is thrilled about the prospect of spending the summer together, but things change when a bottlenose cutie with a big grin and an irresistible personality shows up. The underwater photography is awesome. Try to guess which are the live dolphins and which are the mechanical. _ Paula Crouch Thrasher  Flirting With Disaster R  Ben Stiller goes in search of his biological parents in David O. Russell's hilarious comedy. With his wife (Patricia Arquette) and a psychobabbling therapist (Tea Leoni) from the adoption agency in tow, Stiller crisscrosses the country looking for his roots. What he finds are enough dysfunctional-family entanglements to choke Jerry Springer. As Stiller's adopted parents, Mary Tyler Moore and George Segal exhibit a finely sifted neuroticism worthy of ``Seinfeld'' while Lily Tomlin and Alan Alda play acid-head remnants from the '60s. The movie loses some of its fizz in its last half-hour; even so, Russell may be the most bracingly original satirist to hit the movies since Albert Brooks. Rated R for language and adult themes.  From Dusk Till Dawn R  Robert Rodriguez's hyper violent vampire flick stars scripter Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney (in a dynamic big-screen crossover) as killer bank robbers who kidnap a retired minister (Harvey Keitel) and his kids (including Juliette Lewis). Bad luck for them, these anti-heroes stop at a Mexican bar _ catering to bikers and bloodsuckers. The long opening setup is vintage Tarantino, full of bloody shocks and sick humor. But once the saloon's staff morph into vampires, ``Dusk'' heads into Sam Raimi's ``Evil Dead'' territory, complete with spewing eyeballs and severed limbs. It's an excuse for a couple of way-talented filmmakers to have gruesome fun. And for most of the time, we do, too. But the squeamish, beware. Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity. _ Steve Murray  Girl 6 R  Typically, Spike Lee works best when he's worked up about something. But  this comedy about an aspiring actress (Theresa Randle) who takes a job as a phone-sex girl, shows a frisky, almost larkish side that's as welcome as it is unexpected. Suzan-Lori Parks' script covers some familiar territory and lacks a satisfying resolution, but the director diverts our attention with kicky visuals, heavyweight cameos and some hilarious fantasies. And Randle, with her blend of movie-star sparkle and girl-next-door likability makes an appealing protagonist. Rated R for sex, language, nudity and adult themes.  The Great White Hype R Samuel L. Jackson stars as a Don King-ish boxing promoter in this knockout satire. To freshen up boxing's box office, Jackson digs up a white guy (``Chicago Hope's'' Peter Berg) to fight the current heavyweight champ (Damon Wayans). Director Reginald Hudlin and writers Tony Hendra and Ron Shelton are equal-opportunity nasty, gleefully sending up everything from racism in sports to faked fan letters from crippled little boys. Jackson's snake-charmer charisma helps center the movie's admittedly scattershot approach. A warning: This comedy is rowdy, crude, irreverent and uncontrolled. And refreshing as hell. Rated R for language and adult material.  Heaven's Prisoners R  Alec Baldwin produced and stars in this Louisiana-set mystery- thriller, based on James Lee Burke's flavorful novel. He plays a former New Orleans cop and recovering alcoholic who swings back into action after a mysterious plane crash. Director Phil Joanou has assembled a fine cast _ Baldwin, Kelly Lynch, Mary Stuart Masterson, Eric Roberts and Teri Hatcher. But he's more stylist than storyteller and in his hands, Burke's multilayered tale becomes a shapeless gumbo. Rated R for language, violence and nudity.

The time is 1832; the place, Provence. That's where Angelo (Olivier Martinez), an ardent Italian patriot and nobleman, has fled to escape the Austrians who've overtaken his country. Unfortunately, he arrives at the same time as a deadly cholera epidemic. Juliette Binoche is the lady fair who helps him (and is helped by him) as the pair elude Austrian spies, fear-maddened mobs, French soldiers and, of course, the plague. The movie is a rousing Errol Flynn-type flick with subtitles: chases, fights, hairbreadth escapes, all done against the backdrop of the gorgeous Provence countryside. Put your brain on hold and let the movie gallop over you. Rated R for nudity and swashbuckler violence.  The Hunchback of Notre Dame G  Disney's newest animated feature takes Victor Hugo's tale of love and deformity in medieval Paris and brightens it up with Alan Menken tunes, gargoyles as comic relief and a now-adorable Quasimodo. Voices by Tom Hulce and Jason Alexander, among others.  I Shot Andy Warhol NR  Valerie Solanas was the original disgruntled postal worker. Only she ``worked'' for Andy Warhol and in 1968, frustrated by his failure to produce her work, she shot him three times. Mary Harron's movie beings with the attempted murder and then backtracks to fill in Valerie's bio _ her geek days in college, her scrounger's life in the Village, her brush with ``superstardom,'' Factory-style. Lili Taylor, one of our most gifted and versatile actresses, is a wonder as mad Valerie. But the movie is like the Factory's sham-glam scene. At first, it's perversely tantalizing. Then it's merely intriguing, in a detached, ironic way. Finally, you just want to go home. Not rated, but there are vulgar themes, drug use, violence and vulgar language.  Jack and Sarah R  Or ``One Man and a Baby.'' This British import stars Richard E. Grant (``Ready to Wear'') as a London businessman given custody of his infant daughter. Samantha Mathis plays the nanny who cares for both father and child.  James and the Giant Peach PG  Not the pits, but not peachy keen, either. Roald Dahl's comically macabre tale of a little boy and his buggy pals who sail a giant peach across the ocean has been turned into a classy but cold fantasy featuring the voices of Susan Sarandon (as a Garbo-ish spider), Richard Dreyfuss (a street-tough centipede) and David Thewlis (a woe-is-me earthworm). A good deal of craft and imagination have gone into this film, but everything from the script to Randy Newman's score suffers by comparison to ``Toy Story.'' Certainly kid-worthy, but grown-ups who've made the trek north on I-85 may find themselves less tickled by the movie than by the titular fruit's resemblance to its country cousin outside Gaffney, S.C. Rated PG for mildly scary scenes.  Jane Eyre PG  Opulent and intelligently acted, Franco Zeffirelli's version of Charlotte Bronte's famous Gothic love story is as emotionally acute as it is picture-pretty. The title role is shared by Oscar winner Anna Paquin as the young Jane and Charlotte Gainsbourg as the 20ish Jane who accepts a job as a governess at remote Thornfield Hall. William Hurt is unexpectedly fine as her enigmatic employer, the brooding Mr. Rochester. Unlike the director's famous ``Romeo and Juliet'' in the '60s, there's nothing radical here. Still, this is a sure-footed, satisfying film, one that reminds us that Bronte's tale is as much a ghost story as it is a romance. If you're in the mood for some lush tortured-lovers escapism, you could hardly do better. Rated PG for mildly scary scenes.  Jumanji PG  Robin Williams shows us where the wild things are in this effects-laden family fantasy about a mysterious board game that can bring rhinos into your living room or turn a house into a primeval swamp. Director Joe Johnstone (``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'') knows how to thrill an audience with outsized insects or a stampede down Main Street. But the movie goes on a roll of the dice or two too long. And in-between ``plays,'' things get frankly boring. Bottom line: If you've seen the trailer, you've already seen all the best parts. And those ``best parts'' may be a little scary for littler kids. Johnston does nothing to up the ante; it's like playing Candyland instead of Monopoly. Rated PG for violence.  Mighty Aphrodite R  A lightweight lark. Woody Allen plays Lenny, a sportswriter who decides to track down the biological mom of his young adopted son. She's bound to be brilliant, savvy, beautiful, right? Well, no. She's Linda (Mira Sorvino), a hooker and porn star. Mortified, Lenny tries to find her a new line of work and a nice boyfriend. In doing so, he tries to turn Linda into a woman his adopted son would be proud of. Sorvino speaks in a glass-cutting nasal pitch that's disarmingly funny. She's the movie's buoyant motor. If somebody else made ``Aphrodite,'' it'd get three stars, easy. But for Allen, ``Mighty'' is minor. Rated R for language. _ Steve Murray  Mission: Impossible PG-13  Good morning, Mr. Cruise. Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to produce and star in a summer blockbuster based on a TV series that will rival the phenomenal box office success of ``The Fugitive'' while, at the same time, re-establishing your ``Top Gun'' credentials as an action hero. As always, should you and your team turn out a box office bust, every powerbroker in Hollywood will disavow any knowledge of your actions. Happily, Cruise's ``Mission: Impossible'' is a mission accomplished, from the solid international cast to the action set- pieces. And don't worry about the slightly incomprehensible plot; it was that way on the old TV series, too. Rated PG-13 for language and violence.  Moll Flanders PG-13  This feminist rewrite of the Daniel Defoe classic is trying to avoid the ``Scarlett Letter'' curse. Robin Wright (``Forrest Gump'') plays the title heroine, an 18th-century London girl who must overcome class prejudices to make her way in the world. Morgan Freeman co- stars.

And guess what? The cornier it gets, the better the picture works. Oscar nominee Richard Dreyfuss stars as a would- be composer who devotes 30 years of his life to teaching high school music students. Director Stephen Herek has shaped the film into easily absorbed TV- size chunks that are given focus and humor thanks to a solid cast and Dreyfuss' energized, razor-sharp performance. Goodbye, Mr. Chips; hello, Mr. Holland. Rated PG for mild language.  The Monster NR  Almost as much fun as gum surgery. Here's the rib-tickling premise for this cretinous Italian comedy: A rubber-faced nerd (Roberto Benigni) is mistaken for a serial rapist-killer on the loose in Rome. A female detective (Nicoletta Braschi) is assigned to act as a decoy, i.e., get close to him and, um, entrap him. Are we having fun yet? It's possible that the only thing more torturous than a thuddingly unfunny comedy is a thuddingly unfunny comedy with subtitles. This thing is as unwittingly depressing as any movie you'll see this year. Jerry Lewis, come back. All is forgiven.  Mulholland Falls R  We're in a period-drenched L.A. where there's always cool jazz on the soundtrack, a dame in trouble and a seeming penny-ante murder will inevitably lead to a high-level coverup. It's not ``Chinatown.'' But it is ``Chinatown'' Lite and that's not such a bad thing. Nick Nolte leads a squad of dapper LAPD detectives as they try to discover the link between a lovely corpse and the Atomic Energy Commission. New Zealand director Lee Tamahori guides a strong cast (Chazz Palminteri, Chris Penn, Michael Madsen, John Malkovich) with a sure hand. Rated R for violence and language.  Muppet Treasure Island G  Yo! Ho! Ho! and a barrel of fun! The Muppets take to the high seas in this loose musical adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic adventure about pirates, buried treasure and a brave lad named Jim Hawkins (Kevin Bishop). Tim Curry co-stars as Long John Silver; he's convincing, though a bit upstaged by his felt colleagues. Kudos all 'round to the usual Mupport support team: director Brian Henson and his hands-on puppeteers, Frank Oz (Miss Piggy), former Atlantan Steve Whitmire (Kermit the Frog), David Goelz (the Great Gonzo) and Jerry Nelson and Kevin Clash as just about everyone else.  Oliver &AMP; Company G  Andrew and company thought ``Oliver &AMP; Company'' was just swell and since Andrew is 5, I must defer, in part, to his expert opinion. However, adult connoisseurs of Disney animated magic will be bored silly _ or downright disgusted _ by this slight tale, very slightly based on ``Oliver Twist.'' Oliver is an orphaned kitten and Fagin's gang is a bunch of Manhattan mutts, most of whom are more crudely drawn (and crudely acted) versions of the jailhouse crowd in ``Lady and the Tramp.'' Take the kids, if they insist, but find yourself something else to see while they're in there.  Original Gangstas R  Much more than a nostalgia trip for fans of the 1970's ``blaxploitation'' films, this picture covers ground similar to that of John Singleton's ``Boyz N the Hood'' (1991) and Spike Lee's ``Do the Right Thing'' (1989), but from a sadder and wiser perspective. And it delivers as generous a measure of sensational entertainment value as any of the ``Shaft'' or ``Superfly'' pictures of a generation ago. A retired gridiron star (Fred Williamson) returns to his hometown to deal with a family emergency: His father (Oscar Brown Jr.) has been wounded in a gang vendetta. A local beautician (Pam Grier) has lost a son in a related shooting. Another friend (Jim Brown), once a great prizefighter, returns to the old neighborhood, drawn by his secret grief in connection with the tragedy. And two businessmen (Ron O'Neal and Richard Roundtree) wonder resentfully why their famous compadres have waited until now to come home. Rated R for language, sadistic violence and drug references.  The Pallbearer PG-13  An amiable showcase for a pair of up-and-comers named David Schwimmer and Gwyneth Paltrow. A year out of college and still living with Mom (Carol Kane), Schwimmer is mistakenly asked by Barbara Hershey to be a pallbearer at her son's funeral (``mistakenly'' because he doesn't even remember the guy). What ensues is a Mrs. Robinsonlike seduction, which leads to a ``Graduate''-like triangle. But the movie is more like an extended episode of ``Friends'' than the Dustin Hoffman classic. That it doesn't add up to much doesn't really matter. It is what it is: an appealing, nonthreatening date movie, suitable for the just-met or the almost- engaged. Rated PG-13 for sexual material and adult themes.  The Phantom PG  Fast-paced, entertaining and altogether kid-friendly, this adventure movie is a cleverly put together update of a Saturday afternoon serial. Based on the comic strip character created 60 years ago and set in a ``Raiders''-like 1930s, the movie globetrots between the Phantom's (Billy Zane) home jungle and an exquisitely art-deco Manhattan where a power-mad millionaire (Treat Williams) schemes to take over the world by exploiting the power of three legendary skulls. Director Simon Wincer and his cast (add Kristy Swanson as a fearless heiress) have a bold adventure-movie style leavened with a tongue-in- cheek sense of humor. And you have to admire the Phantom's low-tech arsenal: a gun, a wolf and a white horse.

English director Michael Radford (``White Mischief'') brings an outsider's intrigued eye to his Italian setting. But his ultimate focus is on the collision of poet and peasant and how each affects the other.  Primal Fear R  A sleek, solid courtroom thriller directed by Emmy- winner Gregory Hoblit and based on William Diehl's best seller. Richard Gere stars as a high-powered attorney who defends a stuttering altar boy (Edward Norton) accused of murdering an archbishop. The kind of lawyer who spends as much time on magazine covers as he does in the courtroom, Gere doesn't care if the kid is guilty; he simply wants to win a front-page-friendly case. The top- notch supporting cast includes Laura Linney, John Mahoney, Alfre Woodard and John Mahoney. But the buzz is going to be about newcomer Norton, who gives the kind of electrifying performance that jump-starts careers in a big way. Rated R for violence and language.  The Rock R  The sort of paramilitary action-adventure that appeals to those who just  can't get enough of handsomely weathered men saying things like ``Standing by for launch command.'' U.S. Brig. Gen. Francis Hummel (Ed Harris) has seen hundreds of his men sacrificed in military reconnaissance missions. After years of fighting the military brass for reparations, he's decided to strike back, commandeering a force of rogue Marines and some chemical bombs to invade Alcatraz Island, the former prison-turned-tourist attraction. Called in to trouble-shoot are Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), the FBI's top chemical- biological weapons expert, and Patrick Mason (Sean Connery), the only man ever to have escaped Alcatraz, who has been in maximum-security prisons for most of his 60 years. Director Michael Bay's highly stylized visual sense overpowers the pyrotechnics on screen, as well as the charismatic presence of the movie's three lead players. _ The Austin-American Statesman  Sgt. Bilko PG  The laughs are AWOL in this frenzied remake of the some-would-say-classic '50s sitcom ``The Phil Silvers Show'' (called ``Sgt. Bilko'' in syndication). Steve Martin takes over the role of Army Sgt. Ernie Bilko, the scheming officer in charge of the motor pool at fictional Fort Baxter. Martin works overtime to combine Silvers' bluster with his own ``wild and crazy'' mannerisms. It's an annoyingly hyper performance. Phil Hartman steals the show as Bilko's nasty nemesis, Major Thorn. Few comedic actors can make uptight and overbearing seem so effortlessly funny. Rated PG-13 for language. _ Doug Hamilton  Spy Hard PG-13  More silliness from the sultan of spoof, Leslie Nielsen. The star of the three ``Naked Gun'' movies and 1995's ``Dracula: Dead and Loving It'' plays agent Dick Steele, a spy out to stop a madman named General Rancor (a gleefully wicked Andy Griffith) from destroying the world. As is usual with these ``Airplane!''-style parodies, the story takes a back seat to the gags, many of which feel a bit secondhand. The movie even borrows its target _ James Bond- type espionage thrillers _ from the 1984 spoof ``Top Secret!'' But there are some inspired bits, the best of which comes at the beginning in an affectionate sendup of the opening credits for the Bond films. Rated PG-13 for language and sexual innuendo. _ Doug Hamilton  Striptease R  Demi Moore got $12.5 million to bare all in this big screen version of the Carl Hiaasen comic yarn. She plays a single mother embroiled in a custody battle who must turn to exotic dancing to pay her legal fees. _ Doug Hamilton  The Substitute R  Mr. Rambo's Opus. Robert Mandel's urban high school thriller presents the crisis in education as a high-stakes battle between ruthless men in power and determined vigilantes who practice the three Rs: reconnaissance, revenge and retribution. A beleaguered high school teacher (Diane Venora) runs afoul of an oily gang leader when she threatens to get him kicked out of school. Her boyfriend Shale (Tom Berenger), a Vietnam veteran and grizzled soldier of fortune, poses as a substitute. The movie is propelled by simplifications of reality and panders to unsavory fantasies of how ``good it feels'' to beat evildoers. Berenger is a strong presence, but even he has trouble with often infantile dialogue. _ The Hollywood Reporter  A Thin Line Between  Love &AMP; Hate R  Martin Lawrence wrote, directed and stars in this comedy about a ladies' man who tangles with the wrong lady (Lynn Whitfield). The idea, apparently, was to do a comic spin on ``Waiting to Exhale'' _ ``Waiting to Explode,'' perhaps. But there's a thin line between amusing macho bluster and nasty piggishness and Lawrence blurs it too often. Further, while Lawrence has a certain limited appeal, Whitfield has 10 times the presence and 100 times the talent. He's a bargain basement Eddie Murphy; she's in Angela Bassett's league. Rated R for language, sex and sexual innuendo.

Yes, Marky Mark _ that hip-hoppin', pants-droppin' brother of a New Kid on the Block. (Since turning thespian, he goes by his given name, Mark Wahlberg.) ``Fear'' marks the Markster's first starring role, following smaller parts in ``Renaissance Man'' and ``The Basketball Diaries.'' Judging by his performance, he's got a fine career ahead of him playing bad guys. He's also got a fine foil here in Reese Witherspoon, a nubile young actress with a wise old aura who plays the object of his obsession. Predictable from the get-go, the movie still builds suspense nicely and scores points for not tacking on one of those psycho-rises-from-the-dead endings. Rated R for violence, sex and language.  _ Doug Hamilton  Flipper PG  Writer - director Alan Shapiro's remake of the '60s family classic ``Flipper'' is an entertaining summer diversion that doesn't take itself too seriously. It's predictable but fun. Elijah Wood is Sandy, a sullen city teen who's shipped off to live with his eccentric uncle for the summer on a remote Bahamian island while his parents hash out a messy divorce. Paul Hogan (``Crocodile Dundee'') is the bachelor uncle, Porter, who's found paradise in a ramshackle fishing camp. Neither nephew nor uncle is thrilled about the prospect of spending the summer together, but things change when a bottlenose cutie with a big grin and an irresistible personality shows up. The underwater photography is awesome. Try to guess which are the live dolphins and which are the mechanical.  _ Paula Crouch Thrasher  Flirting With Disaster R  Ben Stiller goes in search of his biological parents in David O. Russell's hilarious comedy. With his wife (Patricia Arquette) and a psychobabbling therapist (Tea Leoni) from the adoption agency in tow, Stiller crisscrosses the country looking for his roots. What he finds are enough dysfunctional-family entanglements to choke Jerry Springer. As Stiller's adopted parents, Mary Tyler Moore and George Segal exhibit a finely sifted neuroticism worthy of ``Seinfeld'' while Lily Tomlin and Alan Alda play acid-head remnants from the '60s. The movie loses some of its fizz in its last half-hour; even so, Russell may be the most bracingly original satirist to hit the movies since Albert Brooks. Rated R for language and adult themes.  From Dusk Till Dawn R  Robert Rodriguez's hyper violent vampire flick stars scripter Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney (in a dynamic big-screen crossover) as killer bank robbers who kidnap a retired minister (Harvey Keitel) and his kids (including Juliette Lewis). Bad luck for them, these anti-heroes stop at a Mexican bar _ catering to bikers and bloodsuckers. The long opening setup is vintage Tarantino, full of bloody shocks and sick humor. But once the saloon's staff morph into vampires, ``Dusk'' heads into Sam Raimi's ``Evil Dead'' territory, complete with spewing eyeballs and severed limbs. It's an excuse for a couple of way-talented filmmakers to have gruesome fun. And for most of the time, we do, too. But the squeamish, beware. Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity. _ Steve Murray  Girl 6 R  Typically, Spike Lee works best when he's worked up about something. But  this comedy about an aspiring actress (Theresa Randle) who takes a job as a phone-sex girl, shows a frisky, almost larkish side that's as welcome as it is unexpected. Suzan-Lori Parks' script covers some familiar territory and lacks a satisfying resolution, but the director diverts our attention with kicky visuals, heavyweight cameos and some hilarious fantasies. And Randle, with her blend of movie-star sparkle and girl-next-door likability makes an appealing protagonist. Rated R for sex, language, nudity and adult themes.  The Great White Hype R  Samuel L. Jackson stars as a Don King-ish boxing promoter in this knockout satire. To freshen up boxing's box office, Jackson digs up a white guy (``Chicago Hope's'' Peter Berg) to fight the current heavyweight champ (Damon Wayans). Director Reginald Hudlin and writers Tony Hendra and Ron Shelton are equal-opportunity nasty, gleefully sending up everything from racism in sports to faked fan letters from crippled little boys. Jackson's snake-charmer charisma helps center the movie's admittedly scattershot approach. A warning: This comedy is rowdy, crude, irreverent and uncontrolled. And refreshing as hell. Rated R for language and adult material.  Heaven's Prisoners R  Alec Baldwin produced and stars in this Louisiana-set mystery-thriller, based on James Lee Burke's flavorful novel. He plays a former New Orleans cop and recovering alcoholic who swings back into action after a mysterious plane crash. Director Phil Joanou has assembled a fine cast _ Baldwin, Kelly Lynch, Mary Stuart Masterson, Eric Roberts and Teri Hatcher.

They move weekly to clients of the New York Times News Service.  G: General audiences. Nothing that would offend parents if viewed by children.  PG: Parental guidance suggested. May contain some material parents consider inappropriate for young children.  PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for preteens.  R: Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking children.  NC-17: No one under 17 admitted. Replaces the X rating.  NR: Not rated.  The Arrival PG-13  Alternately compelling and hokey, this sci-fi thriller is ultimately trapped in a thematic void somewhere between ``The X-Files'' and ``This Island Earth.'' Charlie Sheen plays a radio astronomer who picks up some truly ethereal static on his monitoring station's satellite dish. Convinced he's struck pay dirt, he takes the tape to NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab for analysis. To his surprise, not only does his boss (Ron Silver) remain dubious, but he has to let Zane go because of sudden department downsizing. Novice director David Twohy has his moments, particularly when choreographing suspense. But both direction and writing suffer from the same tonal problems. Unable to decide between being somber and sensational, the movie wavers unsatisfactorily between the two. Rated PG-13 for adult themes.  _ Hollywood Reporter  The Birdcage R  There's nothing terribly wrong with Mike Nichols' scene-by-scene remake of the 1978 French farce _ except the intervening 18 years. What used to cause a belly laugh now earns a pleasant chuckle. Robin Williams plays Armand, the relatively butch half of a gay couple. Nathan Lane is Albert, his shrieking drag-queen companion. Chaos arrives when Armand's son Val (Dan Futterman) brings home the parents of his fiancee: ultraconservative Senator Keeley (Gene Hackman) and his wife, Louise (Dianne Wiest). Armand can play it straight, but what to do with the hyper- nelly Albert? The movie ought to take off into the laughing-gas stratosphere of the best farces. But at 20 minutes longer than the French original, the film feels padded. Like ``To Wong Foo,'' the movie feels a little safe, a little tired. Rated R for language and sexual situations.  _ Steve Murray  Broken Arrow R  Air Force pilot Christian Slater goes up against his buddy John Travolta, who steals two nuclear warheads from their Stealth bomber with a plan to ransom an entire city. Basically, the movie is one long chase in the desert, as Slater teams with perky park ranger Samantha Mathis _ and tracks the bad guys on foot (that must be a small desert). Packed with implausibility, the movie should be a lot of dumb fun. But it can't decide if it's ``Indiana Jones'' or ``Fail-Safe.'' Directed by Hong Kong action czar John Woo, it's played too broadly to make us genuinely tense, but it's not over-the-top enough to make us giddy with thrills. Rated R for violence and language. _ Steve Murray  The Cable Guy PG-13  Reports are that this Jim Carrey vehicle is darker than his usual super-silly fare, but in the trailer the rubber-faced comedian looks as ``Dumb and Dumber'' as he ever was. He plays a cable installer who becomes obsessed with one of his customers (Matthew Broderick). Ben Stiller directed.  Cemetery Man R  These dead men walking wouldn't want Susan Sarandon's spiritual care. They'd want to eat her. A kind of ``Night of the Living Dead'' gone gonzo-baroque, Michael Soavi's film stars Rupert Everett as a cemetery keeper whose corpses are coming back to life and attacking the living. Everett puts up with it (they can be re-killed with a bullet through the head) because he doesn't want the cemetery closed. It's the old dilemma: job security vs. putting up with flesh-eating ghouls. Though the movie has lapses of sophomoric silliness (especially in the sex scenes), it's still a satisfyingly sick flick.  Cold Comfort Farm PG  One of the best things to happen to a barnyard since ``Babe.'' Based on Stella Gibbons' popular 1932 book that deftly satirized the rustic rhapsodies of Hardy and Lawrence, John Schlesinger's movie is a sweet, savvy comic fable (think ``Clueless'' meets ``Tobacco Road''). Our heroine (the marvelous Kate Beckinsale) is a sleek, self-possessed socialite who goes to live with her country cousins in Sussex. With an ``as if'' aplomb worthy of Alicia Silverstone, she sets about tidying up the farm and her eccentric relatives' pigsty lives. The excellent supporting cast is a potpourri of prodigiously talented British actors, headed by Sir Ian McKellen (``Richard III''). Rated PG for mild adult themes.

His movie is a cooled-out road trip, a deadpan comedy-cum-spiritual fever dream set in a frozen landscape. Masatoshi Nagase stars as a Japanese yuppie who reluctantly journeys to Iceland to perform a memorial service for his parents, who died there several years earlier. He finds Iceland is a surreal Wonderland, full of spirits, Icelandic cowboys, German tourists, abusive Americans and Lord-knows- what-else. Nagase, who played the Japanese tourist in Jarmusch's ``Mystery Train'' is, once again, a winning stranger in a strange land.  The Craft R  This not-quite-bewitching thriller uses an MTV veneer to mask its conventionally moral heart. Set to a hip, alternative rock soundtrack, it tells the story of four Catholic schoolgirls who explore sisterhood and empowerment through witchcraft. Their experiments with the occult end up destroying their innocence and wrecking their friendship. The four leads _ Robin Tunney, Fairuza Balk, Neve Campbell and Rachel True _ all give complex, multilayered performances. And the movie taps into a universal youth fantasy: Who hasn't wished for supernatural powers as a guard against the cruelties of adolescence? Ultimately, though, ``The Craft'' is sunk by heavy-handed sermonizing. Rated R for violence, language and adult themes. _ Doug Hamilton  Dead Man Walking R  In Tim Robbins' deadly earnest, intermittently powerful death-row drama, a nun (Susan Sarandon) becomes involved with a convicted murderer (Sean Penn). Both give riveting portrayals (though Penn's arrogant, racist redneck is getting most of the attention). The problem is the movie isn't really about either character. It's about an issue _ the pros and cons of the death penalty _ which means it often lapses into the message-conscious style of a '50s TV drama. Still, Robbins manages a shatteringly effective final half hour simply by showing us how capital punishment works in every gruesome and dehumanizing detail. Sarandon won a best actress Oscar for her performance.  Diabolique R  A so-bad-it's-funny remake of the classic Clouzot thriller. At a run- down boys' school, an icy mistress (Sharon Stone) and a dishrag wife (Isabelle Adjani) join forces to murder the man making them both miserable: Adjani's sadistic husband (Chazz Palminteri). The 1955 original was a triumph of atmosphere, character, diabolical wit and outright scare-you-silly shock tactics. The remake reduces everything to the Gothic-thriller plot, some idiotically overripe lesbian innuendo and the campiest dialogue this side of ``Mommie Dearest.'' ``Killing him was a good thing,'' Stone says reassuringly to Adjani. ``Like planting a tree.'' Rated R for violence, sex, nudity and language.  Don't Be a Menace  to South Central While Drinking  Your Juice in the Hood R  A vehicle for Shawn and Marlon Wayans, the two youngest members of the comic family that includes brothers Damon and Keenen Ivory. This ``Airplane!''-style parody takes broad, juvenile jabs at such urban ``message'' movies as ``Menace II Society'' and ``Boyz N the Hood.'' If not all the jokes here work, many of the ones that do have extra weight. When two characters are busted for ``being black on a Friday night'' and taken to a police station equipped with a Rodney King punch-and-kick video game, the movie turns from goofy fun to comedy that tickles and stings. _ Doug Hamilton  Dragonheart PG-13  A drag. Knight Dennis Quaid teams up with Draco, the last dragon on Earth, to defeat an evil king (David Thewlis). Despite a hefty special-effects budget and a guest performance by Sean Connery as the voice of Draco, the movie is barely better than ``Pete's Dragon.'' Someone _ perhaps director Rob Cohen or writer Charles Edward Pogue _ should've realized that a friendly dragon becomes smaller than life, best-suited for the kids or a sitcom. There's no sense of peril here, no hint of soaring enchantments, no trace of wonder and awe. ``Dragonheart'' is a dragon movie made by people with no respect for dragons. Rated PG for mildly scary scenes.  Eddie PG-13  You have to like Whoopi Goldberg and round ball a whole, whole, whole lot to like this go-get'em sports comedy even a little. Whoopi plays a devout and opinionated New York Knicks fan who, thanks to a whim of the new owner (Frank Langella), becomes the team's coach. At first the players resent and ignore her, but then they come to appreciate . . . well, you're probably ahead of me already. At any rate, Whoopi still manages to be likable in the most unlikely projects (remember the Oscars). Without her, ``Eddie'' would be unwatchable. Even so, it's pretty close. Rated PG-13 for language and sexual innuendo.  Executive Decision R  A crafty pastiche of Tom Clancy, ``Die Hard'' and ``Airport.'' Kurt Russell plays Dr. David Grant, a civilian intelligence consultant for the U.S. military. An amateur pilot in his spare time, Grant inadvertently ends up the key player in an attempt to thwart the hijacking of a 747 by a Hamas-style terrorist group. Though Steven Seagal makes a brief appearance as the commanding officer of an elite anti-terrorist force, there is a welcome lack of chest-beating here that one might find in the average testosterone-fueled action vehicle. Grant is a thinker, not a warrior. The consultant as conquering hero? This nail biter could make it a trend. Rated R for language and violence. _ Doug Hamilton  Fargo R  A tale of murder, greed and morning sickness in Minnesota, this squalidly hilarious black comedy marks a return to top form for the Coen Brothers (``Blood Simple''). Sleazy car salesman William H. Macy hires two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wealthy wife (they'll split the ransom dad-in-law coughs up). But things go awry and soon Frances McDormand, the very pregnant police chief of Brainerd, Minn. (Home of Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox), is on the case. Loosely based on real incidents that occurred in 1987, the movie exists in some surreal cinematic convergence of Mayberry, Twin Peaks and SCTV. It's a great place for any movie lover to visit _ provided, of course, you bring along a very sick sense of humor. Rated R for sex, nudity, violence and language.

It's a great place for any movie lover to visit _ provided, of course, you bring along a very sick sense of humor. Rated R for sex, nudity, violence and language.  Fear R  Marky Mark is terrifying as a teen psycho in this standard thriller, patterned after ``Fatal Attraction.'' Yes, Marky Mark _ that hip-hoppin', pants-droppin' brother of a New Kid on the Block. (Since turning thespian, he goes by his given name, Mark Wahlberg.) ``Fear'' marks the Markster's first starring role, following smaller parts in ``Renaissance Man'' and ``The Basketball Diaries.'' Judging by his performance, he's got a fine career ahead of him playing bad guys. He's also got a fine foil here in Reese Witherspoon, a nubile young actress with a wise old aura who plays the object of his obsession. Predictable from the get-go, the movie still builds suspense nicely and scores points for not tacking on one of those psycho-rises-from-the- dead endings. Rated R for violence, sex and language. _ Doug Hamilton  Flipper PG  Writer-director Alan Shapiro's remake of the '60s family classic ``Flipper'' is an entertaining summer diversion that doesn't take itself too seriously. It's predictable but fun. Elijah Wood is Sandy, a sullen city teen who's shipped off to live with his eccentric uncle for the summer on a remote Bahamian island while his parents hash out a messy divorce. Paul Hogan (``Crocodile Dundee'') is the bachelor uncle, Porter, who's found paradise in a ramshackle fishing camp. Neither nephew nor uncle is thrilled about the prospect of spending the summer together, but things change when a bottlenose cutie with a big grin and an irresistible personality shows up. The underwater photography is awesome. Try to guess which are the live dolphins and which are the mechanical. _ Paula Crouch Thrasher  From Dusk Till Dawn R  Robert Rodriguez's hyperviolent vampire flick stars scripter Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney (in a dynamic big-screen crossover) as killer bank robbers who kidnap a retired minister (Harvey Keitel) and his kids (including Juliette Lewis). Bad luck for them, these anti-heroes stop at a Mexican bar _ catering to bikers and bloodsuckers. The long opening setup is vintage Tarantino, full of bloody shocks and sick humor. But once the saloon's staff morph into vampires, ``Dusk'' heads into Sam Raimi's ``Evil Dead'' territory, complete with spewing eyeballs and severed limbs. It's an excuse for a couple of way-talented filmmakers to have gruesome fun. And for most of the time, we do, too. But the squeamish, beware. Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity. _ Steve Murray  The Great White Hype R  Samuel L. Jackson stars as a Don King-ish boxing promoter in this knockout satire. To freshen up boxing's box office, Jackson digs up a white guy (``Chicago Hope's'' Peter Berg) to fight the heavyweight champ (Damon Wayans). Director Reginald Hudlin and writers Tony Hendra and Ron Shelton are equal-opportunity nasty, gleefully sending up everything from racism in sports to faked fan letters from crippled little boys. Jackson's snake-charmer charisma helps center the movie's admittedly scattershot approach. A warning: This comedy is rowdy, crude, irreverent and uncontrolled. And refreshing as hell. Rated R for language and adult material.  Harriet the Spy PG  Louise Fitzhugh's 1964 book about an 11-year-old girl who secretly observes the actions of her family and friends has been updated to the '90s and stars Michelle Trachtenberg (``The Adventures of Pete &AMP; Pete'').  The Hunchback  of Notre Dame G  This ambitious adaptation of Victor Hugo's massive classic is a thing of beauty, but not always a joy to behold. Team Disney has pulled out all the stops for its 34th animated feature, but it's left out a lot of the fun, too. In 15th-century Paris, a lonely, misshapen bell-ringer (voice by Tom Hulce) loves a spirited Gypsy (Demi Moore). Several scenes are stunning and some much-needed humor is provided by a trio of gargoyles (Jason Alexander, Charles Kimbrough, the late Mary Wickes). But the movie as a whole succumbs to an operatic preachiness; the message overwhelms the medium. Take the kids; they'll be enthralled by the visuals and enjoy the gargoyles. But you may find yourself thinking, where's Charles Laughton when we need him?  Independence Day PG-13  On a pure popcorn-movie level, it's a blast. After alien spaceships blow up Earth (spectacularly!), President Bill Pullman, fighter pilot Will Smith and computer whiz Jeff Goldblum lead mankind's counterattack. Offering support _ or potential victimhood _ is a large cast headed by Judd Hirsch and Mary McDonnell. As director Roland Emmerich would be the first to admit, despite references/borrowings from sci-fi classics of every stripe (notably a germ of an idea updated from H.G. Wells' ``War of the Worlds''), the movie is really a state-of-the-art '70s disaster flick _ ``The Towering Inferno From Outer Space.'' Is it a great movie? Hardly. But it is great fun and, sometimes, that's just as important.

But at 20 minutes longer than the French original, the film feels padded. Like ``To Wong Foo,'' the movie feels a little safe, a little tired. Rated R for language and sexual situations. _ Steve Murray.  The Cable Guy PG-13  In this cataclysmically wretched comedy, Jim Carrey plays a cable installer who launches a fatal-attraction invasion of a customer's (Matthew Broderick) life. The movie is a horror that swamps Carrey's considerable talent in Hollywood-style overkill (helicopters, medieval jousts, flashbacks to an abusive childhood). The daring satiric message is that too much TV can be bad for you, but the unintended subtext is, can too much Jim Carrey be bad for you? I think not. Carrey's still wired to our inner cretin (what laughs there are he nabs), but his movie is nothing but static.  Cold Comfort Farm PG  One of the best things to happen to a barnyard since ``Babe.'' Based on Stella Gibbons' popular 1932 book that deftly satirized the rustic rhapsodies of Hardy and Lawrence, John Schlesinger's movie is a sweet, savvy comic fable (think ``Clueless'' meets ``Tobacco Road'').

With an ``as if'' aplomb worthy of Alicia Silverstone, she sets about tidying up the farm and her eccentric relatives' pigsty lives. The excellent supporting cast is a potpourri of prodigiously talented British actors, headed by Sir Ian McKellen (``Richard III'').  Courage Under Fire R  Credit Denzel Washington, Meg Ryan, director Ed Zwick, a solid script and an excellent supporting cast for this rewarding and courageous movie. Washington plays a military officer assigned to review the Medal of Honor candidacy of a pilot killed in combat during the Gulf War. The twist? The pilot is a woman (Meg Ryan). Instead of rubber-stamping the case as his superiors and the media clearly wish, he investigates and discovers a ``Rashomon''-like web of conflicting stories and possible military coverups. The movie has something for everyone, from guts-and- glory combat scenes to post-Watergate paranoia about the nature of truth in an age of photo ops. Zwick and company may not deserve the Medal of Honor but a few Oscar nominations will do.

Johnny Depp stars as a mild-mannered accountant who goes west and finds himself on a surreal odyssey that takes him from so-called civilization to a natural state (both savage and enlightened). Gary Farmer co-stars as his Native American guide and spiritual adviser. Robert Mitchum, John Hurt and Gabriel Byrne turn up in cameos. Some may find the film a ploddingly paced, heavy-handed allegory. But even those put off by Jarmusch's hipster whimsy and elliptical narrative will be impressed by Robby Muller's exquisitely textured photography and Neil Young's evocative score.  Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood R  QLA vehicle for Shawn and Marlon Wayans, the two youngest members of the comic family that includes brothers Damon and Keenen Ivory.

At any rate, Whoopi still manages to be likable in the most unlikely projects (remember the Oscars). Without her, ``Eddie'' would be un-watchable. Even so, it's pretty close.  Eraser R  A most satisfying dose of major summer movie mayhem. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a federal agent who ``erases'' the identities of people in the Witness Protection Program. His new assignment is Vanessa Williams, a corporate whistle-blower. Making things especially difficult is a powerful mole within Arnold's agency. (Yeah, it's like ``Mission: Impossible,'' but Arnold is Arnold and Cruise is Cruise.) The movie slams along with jaw-dropping efficiency, having fun with all kinds of preposterous action stunts. True, it's too long _ our patience and Arnold's invincibility wear thin _ but it delivers. Robert Pastorelli and James Caan co-star.  Executive Decision R  A crafty pastiche of Tom Clancy, ``Die Hard'' and ``Airport.'' Kurt Russell plays Dr. David Grant, a civilian intelligence consultant for the U.S. military. An amateur pilot in his spare time, Grant inadvertently ends up the key player in an attempt to thwart the hijacking of a 747 by a Hamas-style terrorist group.

The Frighteners R  New Zealand director Peter Jackson follows up ``Heavenly Creatures'' with an intriguing horror-fantasy that could serve as a comeback vehicle for its star, Michael J. Fox. The actor plays a ``ghostbuster''-type con man who uses friends from the spirit world to sucker people out of their money.

Harriet the Spy PG  Michelle Trachtenberg makes a winning 11-year-old Harriet M. Welsch, sixth-grader and neighborhood spy. Based on the 1964 Louise Fitzhugh book, Nickelodeon Movies' first feature updates the story of a budding writer and her sensible nanny Ole Golly (Rosie O'Donnell) by setting it in a shiny urban Anytown with exotic Asian markets and a rolling rap-bop soundtrack. The characters along Harriet's spy route (notably Eartha Kitt) and the vagaries of sixth-grade life form the heart of her hilarious notebook and the movie's plot. This movie reminds you, with a sting, that it's still hell to be 11. _ Eileen M. Drennen.  The Hunchback of Notre Dame G  This ambitious adaptation of Victor Hugo's massive classic is a thing of beauty, but not always a joy to behold. Team Disney has pulled out all the stops for its 34th animated feature, but it's left out a lot of the fun, too. In 15th century Paris, a lonely, misshapen bell- ringer (voice by Tom Hulce) loves a spirited Gypsy (Demi Moore). Several scenes are stunning and some much-needed humor is provided by a trio of gargoyles (Jason Alexander, Charles Kimbrough, the late Mary Wickes). But the movie as a whole succumbs to an operatic preachiness; the message overwhelms the medium. Take the kids; they'll be enthralled by the visuals and enjoy the gargoyles. But you may find yourself thinking, where's Charles Laughton when we need him?

Replaces the X rating.  NR _ Not rated.  A Time to Kill PG-13 The stakes are high for Matthew McConaughey, the heretofore unknown star of this latest film adaptation of a John Grisham novel. But as an idealistic young lawyer who defends a black man accused of murder in a backward Mississippi town, McConaughey gets help from a star-studded supporting cast, including Sandra Bullock and Samuel L. Jackson.  The Arrival PG-13 Alternately compelling and hokey, this sc i-fi thriller is ultimately trapped in a thematic void somewhere between ``The X- Files'' and ``This Island Earth.'' Charlie Sheen plays a radio astronomer who picks up some truly ethereal static on his monitoring station's satellite dish. Convinced he's struck pay dirt, he takes the tape to NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab for analysis. To his surprise, not only does his boss (Ron Silver) remain dubious, but he has to let Zane go because of sudden department downsizing. Novice director David Twohy has his moments, particularly when choreographing suspense. But both direction and writing suffer from the same tonal problems. Unable to decide between being somber and sensational, the movie wavers unsatisfactorily between the two. _ Hollywood Reporter.  The Birdcage R  There's nothing terribly wrong with Mike Nichols' scene-by-scene remake of the 1978 French farce _ except the intervening 18 years. What used to cause a belly laugh now earns a pleasant chuckle. Robin Williams plays Armand, the relatively butch half of a gay couple. Nathan Lane is Albert, his shrieking drag-queen companion. Chaos arrives when Armand's son Val (Dan Futterman) brings home the parents of his fiancee: ultraconservative Senator Keeley (Gene Hackman) and his wife, Louise (Dianne Wiest). Armand can play it straight, but what to do with the hyper- nelly Albert? The movie ought to take off into the laughing-gas stratosphere of the best farces. But at 20 minutes longer than the French original, the film feels padded. Like ``To Wong Foo,'' the movie feels a little safe, a little tired. _ Steve Murray.  The Cable Guy PG-13  In this cataclysmically wretched comedy, Jim Carrey pla ys a cable installer who launches a fatal-attraction invasion of a customer's (Matthew Broderick) life. The movie is a horror that swamps Carrey's considerable talent in Hollywood-style overkill (helicopters, medieval jousts, flashbacks to an abusive childhood). The daring satiric message is that too much TV can be bad for you, but the unintended subtext is, can too much Jim Carrey be bad for you? I think not. Carrey's still wired to our inner cretin (what laughs there are he nabs), but his movie is nothing but static.  Cold Comfort Farm PG  One of the best things to happen to a barnyard since ``Babe.'' Based on Stella Gibbons' popular 1932 book that deftly satirized the rustic rhapsodies of Hardy and Lawrence, John Schlesinger's movie is a sweet, savvy comic fable (think ``Clueless'' meets ``Tobacco Road''). Our heroine (the marvelous Kate Beckinsale) is a sleek, self-possessed socialite who goes to live with her country cousins in Sussex. With an ``as if'' aplomb worthy of Alicia Silverstone, she sets about tidying up the farm and her eccentric relatives' pigsty lives. The excellent supporting cast is a potpourri of prodigiously talented British actors, headed by Sir Ian McKellen (``Richard III'').  Courage Under Fire R  Credit Denzel Washington, Meg Ryan, director Ed Zwick, a solid script and an excellent supporting cast for this rewarding and courageous movie. Washington plays a military officer assigned to review the Medal of Honor candidacy of a pilot killed in combat during the Gulf War. The twist? The pilot is a woman (Meg Ryan). Instead of rubber-stamping the case as his superiors and the media clearly wish, he investigates and discovers a ``Rashomon''-like web of conflicting stories and possible military coverups. The movie has something for everyone, from guts-and-glory combat scenes to post-Watergate paranoia about the nature of truth in an age of photo ops. Zwick and company may not deserve the Medal of Honor but a few Oscar nominations will do.

The Craft R  This not-quite-bewitching thriller uses an MTV veneer to ma sk its conventionally moral heart. Set to a hip, alternative rock soundtrack, it tells the story of four Catholic schoolgirls who explore sisterhood and empowerment through witchcraft. Their experiments with the occult end up destroying their innocence and wrecking their friendship. The four leads _ Robin Tunney, Fairuza Balk, Neve Campbell and Rachel True _ all give complex, multilayered performances. And the movie taps into a universal youth fantasy: Who hasn't wished for supernatural powers as a guard against the cruelties of adolescence? Ultimately, though, ``The Craft'' is sunk by heavy-handed sermonizing. _ Doug Hamilton.  Dead Man R  The Wild West becomes the Weird West in Jim Jarmusch's mytho-poetic meditation on a beloved genre. Johnny Depp stars as a mild-mannered accountant who goes west and finds himself on a surreal odyssey that takes him from so- called civilization to a natural state (both savage and enlightened). Gary Farmer co-stars as his Native American guide and spiritual adviser. Robert Mitchum, John Hurt and Gabriel Byrne turn up in cameos. Some may find the film a ploddingly paced, heavy-handed allegory. But even those put off by Jarmusch's hipster whimsy and elliptical narrative will be impressed by Robby Muller's exquisitely textured photography and Neil Young's evocative score.  Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood R  A vehicle for Shawn and Marlon Wayans, the two youngest members of the comic family that includes brothers Damon and Keenen Ivory. This ``Airplane!''-style parody takes broad, juvenile jabs at such urban ``message'' movies as ``Menace II Society'' and ``Boyz N the Hood.'' If not all the jokes here work, many of the ones that do have extra weight. When two characters are busted for ``being black on a Friday night'' and taken to a police station equipped with a Rodney King punch-and-kick video game, the movie turns from goofy fun to comedy that tickles and stings. _ Doug Hamilton  Dragonheart PG-13  A drag. Knight Dennis Quaid teams up with Draco, the last dragon on Earth, to defeat an evil king (David Thewlis). Despite a hefty special-effects budget and a guest performance by Sean Connery as the voice of Draco, the movie is barely better than ``Pete's Dragon.'' Someone _ perhaps director Rob Cohen or writer Charles Edward Pogue _ should've realized that a friendly dragon becomes smaller than life, best- suited for the kids or a sitcom. There's no sense of peril here, no hint of soaring enchantments, no trace of wonder and awe. ``Dragonheart'' is a dragon movie made by people with no respect for dragons.  Eraser R  A most satisfying dose of major summer movie mayhem. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a federal agent who ``erases'' the identities of people in the Witness Protection Program. His new assignment is Vanessa Williams, a corporate whistle-blower. Making things especially difficult is a powerful mole within Arnold's agency. (Yeah, it's like ``Mission: Impossible,'' but Arnold is Arnold and Cruise is Cruise.) The movie slams along with jaw- dropping efficiency, having fun with all kinds of preposterous action stunts. True, it's too long _ our patience and Arnold's invincibility wear thin _ but it delivers. Robert Pastorelli and James Caan co-star.  Executive Decision R  A crafty pastiche of Tom Clancy, ``Die Hard'' and ``Airport.'' Kurt Russell plays Dr. David Grant, a civilian intelligence consultant for the U.S. military. An amateur pilot in his spare time, Grant inadvertently ends up the key player in an attempt to thwart the hijacking of a 747 by a Hamas-style terrorist group. Though Steven Seagal makes a brief appearance as the commanding officer of an elite anti-terrorist force, there is a welcome lack of chest-beating here that one might find in the average testosterone-fueled action vehicle. Grant is a thinker, not a warrior. The consultant as conquering hero? This nail biter could make it a trend. _ Doug Hamilton  Fargo R  A tale of murder, greed and morning sickness in Minnesota, this squalidly hilarious black comedy marks a return to top form for the Coen Brothers (``Blood Simple''). Sleazy car salesman William H. Macy hires two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wealthy wife (they'll split the ransom dad-in-law coughs up). But things go awry and soon Frances McDormand, the very pregnant police chief of Brainerd, Minn. (Home of Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox), is on the case. Loosely based on real incidents that occurred in 1987, the movie exists in some surreal cinematic convergence of Mayberry, Twin Peaks and SCTV. It's a great place for any movie lover to visit _ provided, of course, you bring along a very sick sense of humor.

Fled R  Flee. The Atlanta landmarks are the best thing abo ut this second-rate action-comedy starring Laurence Fishburne and Stephen Baldwin as escaped convicts on the lam from local authorities (led by Will Patton), the Feds and the Cuban Mafia. A black guy and a white guy chained together may suggest ``The Defiant Ones,'' but this film is less interested in racial issues than buddy-movie cliches. The stars' chemistry is negligible, leaving the way open for Patton to steal scenes with his entertaining impersonation of Tommy Lee Jones in ``The Fugitive.'' But give director Kevin Hooks credit for capturing Atlanta's sleek big-city anonymity. Miss Daisy wouldn't know the place, but then, neither would anyone who left town before 1990.  Flipper PG  Writer-director Alan Shapiro's remake of the '60s family classi c ``Flipper'' is an entertaining summer diversion that doesn't take itself too seriously. It's predictable but fun. Elijah Wood is Sandy, a sullen city teen who's shipped off to live with his eccentric uncle for the summer on a remote Bahamian island while his parents hash out a messy divorce. Paul Hogan (``Crocodile Dundee'') is the bachelor uncle, Porter, who's found paradise in a ramshackle fishing camp. Neither nephew nor uncle is thrilled about the prospect of spending the summer together, but things change when a bottlenose cutie with a big grin and an irresistible personality shows up. The underwater photography is awesome. Try to guess which are the live dolphins and which are the mechanical. _ Paula Crouch Thrasher  The Frighteners R  Flawed but still frightfully fun. This comic gore-fest from impish director Peter Jackson marks a step forward for its star, Michael J. Fox. As a former architect who is so traumatized by his wife's death that he begins to see ghosts, Fox is likably haunted and finally comfortable in an adult role. But the movie is a step backward for Jackson, whose previous film, 1994's ``Heavenly Creatures,'' was a harrowing account of teenage obsession that ends in murder. This time around, Jackson treats death much more cavalierly, injecting its messier aspects _ burial and decomposition _ into a kooky ``Ghostbusters''-type premise. Eye- popping effects and a luminescent supporting performance by Trini Alvarado help one forgive the slight plot. _ Doug Hamilton  From Dusk Till Dawn R  Robert Rodriguez's hyperviolent vampire flick stars scripter Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney (in a dynamic big-screen crossover) as killer bank robbers who kidnap a retired minister (Harvey Keitel) and his kids (including Juliette Lewis). Bad luck for them, these anti-heroes stop at a Mexican bar _ catering to bikers and bloodsuckers. The long opening setup is vintage Tarantino, full of bloody shocks and sick humor. But once the saloon's staff morph into vampires, ``Dusk'' heads into Sam Raimi's ``Evil Dead'' territory, complete with spewing eyeballs and severed limbs. It's an excuse for a couple of way-talented filmmakers to have gruesome fun. And for most of the time, we do, too. But the squeamish, beware. _ Steve Murray  Harriet the Spy PG  Michelle Trachtenberg makes a winning 11-year-old Harriet M. Welsch, sixth-grader and neighborhood spy. Based on the 1964 Louise Fitzhugh book, Nickelodeon Movies' first feature updates the story of a budding writer and her sensible nanny Ole Golly (Rosie O'Donnell) by setting it in a shiny urban Anytown with exotic Asian markets and a rolling rap-bop soundtrack. The characters along Harriet's spy route (notably Eartha Kitt) and the vagaries of sixth-grade life form the heart of her hilarious notebook and the movie's plot. This movie reminds you, with a sting, that it's still hell to be 11. _ Eileen M. Drennen  Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco G  Sassy the Himalayan cat, Chance the American bulldog and Shadow the golden retriever aren't the only things that are lost in this sequel to the 1993 hit. Also missing is its predecessor's lovely animal-lover lyricism. This time, they wander the streets of San Francisco where they're menaced by buffoonish dog thieves and rescued by a gang of streetwise pooches (think, Dead End Dogs). The voice talent _ Sally Field as sarcastic Sassy, Michael J. Fox as irrepressible Chance and Ralph Waite (replacing the late Don Ameche) as dignified Shadow _ is as good as ever, but too many talking animals spoil the movie. The first film moved you to tears; the sequel is standard baby-sitter stuff for undemanding kids.  The Hunchback of Notre Dame G  This ambitious adaptation of Victor Hugo's massive classic is a thing of beauty, but not always a joy to behold. Team Disney has pulled out all the stops for its 34th animated feature, but it's left out a lot of the fun, too. In 15th century Paris, a lonely, misshapen bell- ringer (voice by Tom Hulce) loves a spirited Gypsy (Demi Moore). Several scenes are stunning and some much-needed humor is provided by a trio of gargoyles (Jason Alexander, Charles Kimbrough, the late Mary Wickes). But the movie as a whole succumbs to an operatic preachiness; the message overwhelms the medium. Take the kids; they'll be enthralled by the visuals and enjoy the gargoyles.

Independence Day PG-13  On a pure popcorn-movie level, it's a blast. After alien spaceships blow up Earth (spectacularly!), President Bill Pullman, fighter pilot Will Smith and computer whiz Jeff Goldblum lead mankind's counterattack. Offering support _ or potential victimhood _ is a large cast headed by Judd Hirsch and Mary McDonnell. As director Roland Emmerich would be the first to admit, despite references/borrowings from sci-fi classics of every stripe (notably a germ of an idea updated from H.G. Wells' ``War of the Worlds''), the movie is really a state-of-the-art '70s disaster flick _ ``The Towering Inferno From Outer Space.'' Is it a great movie? Hardly. But it is great fun and, sometimes, that's just as important.  Jack PG-13  Robin Williams thinks ``Big'' in this comedy-drama directed by Francis Ford Coppola (``Apocalypse Now''). Williams plays a 10-year-old boy who has a rare condition that causes his body to age too quickly. ``The Nanny's'' Fran Drescher co-stars. _ Doug Hamilton  James and the Giant Peach PG  Not the pits, but not peachy keen, either. Roald Dahl's comically macabre tale of a little boy and his buggy pals who sail a giant peach across the ocean has been turned into a classy but cold fantasy featuring the voices of Susan Sarandon (as a Garbo-ish spider), Richard Dreyfuss (a street-tough centipede) and David Thewlis (a woe-is-me earthworm). A good deal of craft and imagination have gone into this film, but everything from the script to Randy Newman's score suffers by comparison to ``Toy Story.'' Certainly kid-worthy, but grown-ups who've made the trek north on I-85 may find themselves less tickled by the movie than by the titular fruit's resemblance to its country cousin outside Gaffney, S.C.  Joe's Apartment R  MTV's first film release should come with a can of Raid for each viewer. Based on a live-action short frequently run on the video channel, it stars Jerry O'Connell as a New York apartment dweller beseiged by meddling roaches. Moviegoers may barely recognize O'Connell as River Phoenix's chubby friend in ``Stand By Me.''  Jumanji PG  Robin Williams shows us where the wild things are in this effects-laden family fantasy about a mysterious board game that can bring rhinos into your living room or turn a house into a primeval swamp. Director Joe Johnstone (``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'') knows how to thrill an audience with outsized insects or a stampede down Main Street. But the movie goes on a roll of the dice or two too long. And in-between ``plays,'' things get frankly boring. Bottom line: If you've seen the trailer, you've already seen all the best parts. And those ``best parts'' may be a little scary for littler kids. Johnston does nothing to up the ante; it's like playing Candyland instead of Monopoly.  Kazaam PG  Shaquille O'Neal should have slam-dunked this script into the nearest wastebasket: The 12-year-old who finds the lamp containing Kazaam (O'Neal) is an obnoxious punk named Max (Francis Capra), who seems not so much an urban Huck Finn of the 1990s as a candidate for serious therapy. Max convinces the genie to help him search for a father he hasn't seen in 10 years. They track him to a club where they become involved with a villain named Malik (Marshall Manesh), assorted thugs, pirated recordings and other distractions that imperil the boy, his father and Kazaam's magical boombox. As fairy tale, buddy comedy, family drama, thriller or rap revue, ``Kazaam'' is simply uninspired and unconvincing, and O'Neal, who can carry a basketball team, lacks the charisma to rescue this misguided effort. _ New York Times.  Lone Star R  In this stunningly multifaceted social study of a small Texas border town, writer-director John Sayles has created a movie that's Dickensian in its moral fervor and has a rich panoply of characters. The central thread is a murder mystery. The current lawman (Chris Cooper) is sworn to find out who killed Sheriff Wade _ a bigoted bully played to swaggering perfection by Kris Kristofferson _ 40 years ago. In doing so, far more than who shot the sheriff comes to light. Sayles takes us deep into the heart of Texas darkness (and, by extension, into our nation's conflicted heritage). That he does so with such literate intelligence, subtle humor and implacable humanism makes his movie as invaluable as it is irresistible.

Maybe . . . Maybe Not R  You may like this mildly funny, well-intentioned German comedy, but then again, you may not. Basically, if you loved the big-hearted drag queens in ``To Wong Foo,'' then you may get a kick out of this sex farce with hetero vs. homo complications. The story revolves around Axel (Til Schweiger), a 20-ish cutie-pie who somehow ends up caught between his pregnant girlfriend, who's tired of his cheating, and a shy homosexual (Joachim Krol), who's smitten with Axel's pinup-boy looks. The movie touts tolerance in basic, dated terms (say, 1976) that border on stereotypes. If you're long past thinking gays should be put in jail, ``Maybe'' is a maybe. But if you're on the side of the Cobb County Commission, it's a must-see.  Mission: Impossible PG-13  Good morning, Mr. Cruise. Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to produce and star in a summer blockbuster based on a TV series that will rival the phenomenal box office success of ``The Fugitive'' while, at the same time, re-establishing your ``Top Gun'' credentials as an action hero. As always, should you and your team turn out a box office bust, every powerbroker in Hollywood will disavow any knowledge of your actions. Happily, Cruise's ``Mission: Impossible'' is a mission accomplished, from the solid international cast to the action set pieces. And don't worry about the slightly incomprehensible plot; it was that way on the old TV series, too.  Multiplicity PG-13  There are four reasons to see this comedy-fantasy, and they're all named Michael Keaton. He plays an overextended Everyman who clones himself to have enough time for his job and for his wife (Andie MacDowell) and kids. Unfortunately, director Harold Ramis and his multiple screenwriters have settled for a broad comedy with limited aspirations. Take Keaton out of the equation, and the movie just doesn't add up to much. Still, the star is hilarious, and his ability to play off himself times three is as miraculous as the special effects. His tour-de-four performance raises the film to the level of mildly pleasant, but nothing more.  The Nutty Professor PG-13  Nuts to the naysayers, Eddie Murphy's back. The hottest comedian of the '80s manages to make an iffy idea _ remaking a Jerry Lewis classic _ work by giving his most engaging performance in years. With a little help from latex, he plays Sherman Klump, a painfully shy, 400-pound college professor who tests an experimental fat gene on himself. He is transformed into a svelte ladies' man who has a way with a one-liner and a mile-wide mean streak (in short, he becomes Eddie Murphy). The movie relies a bit too much on juvenile gags, but Murphy displays a newfound sweetness as Klump that suggests career possibilities as a date-movie lead. _ Doug Hamilton  The Phantom PG  Fast-paced, entertaining and altogether kid-friendly, this adventure movie is a cleverly put together update of a Saturday afternoon serial. Based on the comic strip character created 60 years ago and set in a ``Raiders''-like 1930s, the movie globetrots between the Phantom's (Billy Zane) home jungle and an exquisitely art-deco Manhattan where a power-mad millionaire (Treat Williams) schemes to take over the world by exploiting the power of three legendary skulls. Director Simon Wincer and his cast (add Kristy Swanson as a fearless heiress) have a bold adventure-movie style leavened with a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor. And you have to admire the Phantom's low-tech arsenal: a gun, a wolf and a white horse.  Phenomenon PG  This phenomenally likable movie cuts across niche-marketing lines; it works as a family film, a tear-jerker and a date movie. John Travolta stars as an average Joe mechanic who's transformed by a blinding white light into a genius with telekinetic and psychic powers. Jon Turtletaub's movie starts out as a harmless, warmhearted fantasy but deepens into a more thoughtful, complex picture. The fine supporting cast _ Kyra Sedgwick, Forest Whitaker, Robert Duvall _ is a huge help, but the movie just wouldn't work without Travolta. He's radiantly charming as the bumpkin-turned-Einstein _ thrilled and energized by his newfound intellectual curiosity and his discovery of the interconnectedness of all living things.  Primal Fear R  A sleek, solid courtroom thriller directed by Emmy-winner Gregory Hoblit and based on William Diehl's best seller. Richard Gere stars as a high-powered attorney who defends a stuttering altar boy (Edward Norton) accused of murdering an archbishop. The kind of lawyer who spends as much time on magazine covers as he does in the courtroom, Gere doesn't care if the kid is guilty; he simply wants to win a front-page-friendly case. The top- notch supporting cast includes Laura Linney, Alfre Woodard and John Mahoney. But the buzz is going to be about newcomer Norton, who gives the kind of electrifying performance that jump-starts careers in a big way.

Purple Noon NR  It says something about today's movies when the cleverest film of the year was made in 1960. This re-release of Rene Clement's classic thriller, based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith (author of Hitchcock's ``Strangers on a Train''), has been brought to us by Martin Scorsese and Miramax Zoe. The less you know about the plot, the better, but here's the setup: Alain Delon is a baby-faced bad boy sent to bring his rich pal (Maurice Ronet) back home from his permanent Mediterranean vacation. When Ronet proves recalcitrant, Delon makes other plans. Clement has given the film a tangy aura of homicidal hedonism and ambisexual ambiguity. It's film noir done as a travel poster _ pretty as a picture and perverse as hell.  The Quest R  Most action heroes have moved on to other genres, but Jean-Claude Van Damme sticks with what he does best: kick-boxing. ``The Quest,'' which he also directed, is about a Tibetan competition in which wrestlers and kick-boxers from many countries battle each other while wearing clothing of their native lands (note to Van Damme: Africa is not a country). It's like a cross between the World Wrestling Federation and the parade of state costumes at the beginning of the Miss USA Pageant. As an actor, Van Damme spends most of his time neutralizing opponents with his bare hands. Heck, the movie's so choppy it looks like he edited it with his bare hands. Rated PG-13 for bone-crunching violence. _ St. Paul Pioneer Press  The Rock R  The sort of paramilitary action-adventure that appeals to those who just can't get enough of handsomely weathered men saying things like ``Standing by for launch command.'' U.S. Brig. Gen. Francis Hummel (Ed Harris) has seen hundreds of his men sacrificed in military reconnaissance missions. After years of fighting the military brass for reparations, he's decided to strike back, commandeering a force of rogue Marines and some chemical bombs to invade Alcatraz Island, the former prison-turned-tourist attraction. Called in to trouble-shoot are Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), the FBI's top chemical-biological weapons expert, and Patrick Mason (Sean Connery), the only man ever to have escaped Alcatraz, who has been in maximum- security prisons for most of his 60 years. Director Michael Bay's highly stylized visual sense overpowers the pyrotechnics on screen, as well as the charismatic presence of the movie's three lead players. _ The Austin-American Statesman  Rumble in the Bronx R  If you haven't seen a Jackie Chan movie, you don't know what you've been missing. Oh boy, as Buddy Holly would say. Part Bruce Lee, part Buster Keaton, Chan flips, kicks and leaps through his films with an exuberant kung-fu foolishness that's both death-defying and comic. In this English-dubbed action romp, he plays a Hong Kong cop on vacation in the Bronx (actually, Vancouver, British Columbia) who finds himself at odds with both the local gang and some international jewel thieves. But forget the plot and dialogue and focus on the almost nonstop action. Nimble, daring and pratfall funny, Chan and his movies aren't an acquired taste; they're an instant addiction.  Stealing Beauty R  Like its nubile teen heroine, Bernardo Bertolucci's film is beautiful but empty. Liv Tyler stars as a lovely American abroad looking for two things: her real father and a way to lose her virginity. Set in the luscious Tuscan countryside, the movie surrounds her with various poseurs and intellectuals, all fascinated by the prospect of her deflowering (not since Brooke Shields has one young woman's loss of innocence invited so much, um, scrutiny). Tyler is pretty much a pretty blank, but then, almost all the characters and their relationships are hazily underwritten. Even Jeremy Irons, as a dying aesthete, recedes into the background.  Striptease R  Demi Moore takes it off, but her movie never really takes off. Not that it's an out-and-out bust (sorry), but at best it achieves a certain pleasant goofiness. Moore plays a single mom who starts stripping in order to raise cash to wage a custody battle for her little girl. A boozy, lecherous congressman (Burt Reynolds) becomes besotted with her, and she finds herself in the middle of a tangled web of lust, blackmail, murder and political corruption. Demi's buffed-to-the-max bod is everything it's been advertised to be, but the movie wobbles so uncertainly between melodrama and farce that she and Reynolds don't seem to be in the same film. Filling the vacuum is Ving Rhames, hilarious as the strip joint's bouncer and all-around Galahad.

A Thin Line Between Love &AMP; Hate R  Martin Lawrence wrote, directed and stars in this comedy about a ladies' man who tangles with the wrong lady (Lynn Whitfield). The idea, apparently, was to do a comic spin on ``Waiting to Exhale'' _ ``Waiting to Explode,'' perhaps. But there's a thin line between amusing macho bluster and nasty piggishness and Lawrence blurs it too often. Further, while Lawrence has a certain limited appeal, Whitfield has 10 times the presence and 100 times the talent. He's a bargain basement Eddie Murphy; she's in Angela Bassett's league.  Toy Story G  A knockout. T he first feature to be fully computer-generated, the all-ages comedy taps our childhood fantasies about the lives toys lead when the bedroom door closes.

Longtime fave cowboy Woody (voice by Tom Hanks) gets upstaged by newcomer Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), a gleaming plastic hero. In this mock epic, Woody and Buzz go out into the ``real world,'' where they scamper beneath 18-wheelers, flee a toothy canine and survive the sadistic antics of the kid next door. Four years in the making, the film is a jaw- dropping spectacle, with one bravura sequence topping the one before. Give it five minutes, and this laugh-out-loud delight can turn the scroogiest Scrooge into a happy kid. _ Steve Murray  Trainspotting R  This controversial British import is already generating maximum buzz. Directed by Danny Boyle (``Shallow Grave''), it follows a group of young London junkies as they experience the ups and downs of heroin.  The Truth About Cats &AMP; Dogs PG-13  An astute gender inversion of that moldy oldie ``Cyrano de Bergerac.'' Hip comedian Janeane Garofalo plays Abby Barnes, a radio talk-show host with zero self-esteem who gets a leggy model friend (Uma Thurman) to stand in for her at a face-to-face meeting with an interested caller. Here's the twist: Abby isn't cursed with a bird-perch proboscis. She's just average looking. The movie's powerful message is that this is enough to render her a freak in a society that places impossible standards on female beauty. Garofalo, in her first starring role, gives a fully realized performance as a modern Everywoman. _ Doug Hamilton  Twister PG-13  This expert special-effects extravaganza reminds us that it can be nice to fool with Mother Nature.

Up Close &AMP; Personal PG-13  Score one for golden guy Robert Redford and golden gal Michelle Pfeiffer, who show us what star power is really about in this glossy, high-profile romance with a TV news backdrop. Pfeiffer is the raw youngster who rises from weather girl to network star; Redford is the crusty news director, oozing with integrity, who acts as her mentor (``She eats the lens'') and falls in love with her. Director Jon Avnet and writers Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne have crossed ``A Star Is Born'' with ``Broadcast News'' and come up with a movie that's not as tough or complex as it could be. But with accomplished ``lens-eaters'' like Redford and Pfeiffer on hand, it's the kind of old-fashioned love story that's infatuated audiences for decades.  Les Visiteurs (The Visitors) NR  We all like to make jokes a bout the French people's fondness for Jerry Lewis, but this spawn of Lewis' heavy- handed antic style is no laughing matter. An 11th-century knight and his squire (Jean Reno and Christian Clavier) are mistakenly propelled into modern France where they meet their own descendants (including Valerie Lemercier as a raised- pinky countess). Many fish-out-of-water gags ensue as the time travelers try to get back to their own era. Unless you like your comedy very broad and very crude, ``Les Visiteurs'' isn't worth a visit.  Welcome to the Dollhouse R  Welcome to the so-called life of Dawn Wiener (Heather Matarazzo) a.k.a. ``Wiener Dog'' a.k.a. ``Dog Face.'' She's the protagonist of Todd Solondz's alternately hilarious and excruciating look at one seventh-grader's personal hell. Winner of the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, the movie uses a mix of poignance and absurdity to show us that peculiar trauma ward known as junior high. The movie's best move is that it refuses to sentimentalize Dawn. There's no swan-self lurking under her ugly duckling exterior. Her very ordinariness is part of the point and Matarazzo masterfully conveys the survivalist insularity such outcasts must cultivate. A movie for anyone who ever suffered even a second of adolescent angst.  Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory G  Talk about your childhood wishes . . . this re-release of the 1971 children's fantasy reveals a film that's every bit as unsettling and fantastic as you remember (even the dated parts are intriguing, from the old-fashioned special effects to culture-shock moments like an all-white-male media corps). Gene Wilder is especially wonderful as the mysterious candy maker who invites a handful of lucky kids on a magical journey inside his fabled factory. He's so full of vitality and sly surprises that you wish someone would give him a script worthy of his underused talents. And you kind of wish it would be, ``Willy Wonka: The Next Generation.''

The idea, apparently, was to do a comic spin on ``Waiting to Exhale'' _ ``Waiting to Explode,'' perhaps. But there's a thin line between amusing macho bluster and nasty piggishness and Lawrence blurs it too often.

Purple Noon NR  It says something about today's movies when the cleverest film of the year was made in 1960. This re-release of Rene Clement's classic thriller, based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith (author of Hitchcock's ``Strangers on a Train''), has been brought to us by Martin Scorsese and Miramax Zoe. The less you know about the plot, the better, but here's the setup: Alain Delon is a baby-faced bad boy sent to bring his rich pal (Maurice Ronet) back home from his permanent Mediterranean vacation. When Ronet proves recalcitrant, Delon makes other plans. Clement has given the film a tangy aura of homicidal hedonism and ambisexual ambiguity. It's film noir done as a travel poster _ pretty as a picture and perverse as hell.  The Quest R  Most action heroes have moved on to other genres, but Jean-Claude Van Damme sticks with what he does best: kick-boxing. ``The Quest,'' which he also directed, is about a Tibetan competition in which wrestlers and kick-boxers from many countries battle each other while wearing clothing of their native lands (note to Van Damme: Africa is not a country). It's like a cross between the World Wrestling Federation and the parade of state costumes at the beginning of the Miss USA Pageant. As an actor, Van Damme spends most of his time neutralizing opponents with his bare hands. Heck, the movie's so choppy it looks like he edited it with his bare hands. Rated PG-13 for bone-crunching violence. _ St. Paul Pioneer Press  The Rock R  The sort of paramilitary action-adventure that appeals to those who just can't get enough of handsomely weathered men saying things like ``Standing by for launch command.'' U.S. Brig. Gen. Francis Hummel (Ed Harris) has seen hundreds of his men sacrificed in military reconnaissance missions. After years of fighting the military brass for reparations, he's decided to strike back, commandeering a force of rogue Marines and some chemical bombs to invade Alcatraz Island, the former prison-turned-tourist attraction. Called in to trouble-shoot are Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), the FBI's top chemical-biological weapons expert, and Patrick Mason (Sean Connery), the only man ever to have escaped Alcatraz, who has been in maximum- security prisons for most of his 60 years. Director Michael Bay's highly stylized visual sense overpowers the pyrotechnics on screen, as well as the charismatic presence of the movie's three lead players. _ The Austin-American Statesman  Rumble in the Bronx R  If you haven't seen a Jackie Chan movie, you don't know what you've been missing. Oh boy, as Buddy Holly would say. Part Bruce Lee, part Buster Keaton, Chan flips, kicks and leaps through his films with an exuberant kung-fu foolishness that's both death-defying and comic. In this English-dubbed action romp, he plays a Hong Kong cop on vacation in the Bronx (actually, Vancouver, British Columbia) who finds himself at odds with both the local gang and some international jewel thieves. But forget the plot and dialogue and focus on the almost nonstop action. Nimble, daring and pratfall funny, Chan and his movies aren't an acquired taste; they're an instant addiction.  Stealing Beauty R  Like its nubile teen heroine, Bernardo Bertolucci's film is beautiful but empty. Liv Tyler stars as a lovely American abroad looking for two things: her real father and a way to lose her virginity. Set in the luscious Tuscan countryside, the movie surrounds her with various poseurs and intellectuals, all fascinated by the prospect of her deflowering (not since Brooke Shields has one young woman's loss of innocence invited so much, um, scrutiny). Tyler is pretty much a pretty blank, but then, almost all the characters and their relationships are hazily underwritten. Even Jeremy Irons, as a dying aesthete, recedes into the background.  Striptease R  Demi Moore takes it off, but her movie never really takes off. Not that it's an out-and-out bust (sorry), but at best it achieves a certain pleasant goofiness. Moore plays a single mom who starts stripping in order to raise cash to wage a custody battle for her little girl. A boozy, lecherous congressman (Burt Reynolds) becomes besotted with her, and she finds herself in the middle of a tangled web of lust, blackmail, murder and political corruption. Demi's buffed-to-the-max bod is everything it's been advertised to be, but the movie wobbles so uncertainly between melodrama and farce that she and Reynolds don't seem to be in the same film. Filling the vacuum is Ving Rhames, hilarious as the strip joint's bouncer and all-around Galahad.

Maybe . . . Maybe Not R  You may like this mildly funny, well-intentioned German comedy, but then again, you may not. Basically, if you loved the big-hearted drag queens in ``To Wong Foo,'' then you may get a kick out of this sex farce with hetero vs. homo complications. The story revolves around Axel (Til Schweiger), a 20-ish cutie-pie who somehow ends up caught between his pregnant girlfriend, who's tired of his cheating, and a shy homosexual (Joachim Krol), who's smitten with Axel's pinup-boy looks. The movie touts tolerance in basic, dated terms (say, 1976) that border on stereotypes. If you're long past thinking gays should be put in jail, ``Maybe'' is a maybe. But if you're on the side of the Cobb County Commission, it's a must-see.  Mission: Impossible PG-13  Good morning, Mr. Cruise. Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to produce and star in a summer blockbuster based on a TV series that will rival the phenomenal box office success of ``The Fugitive'' while, at the same time, re-establishing your ``Top Gun'' credentials as an action hero. As always, should you and your team turn out a box office bust, every powerbroker in Hollywood will disavow any knowledge of your actions. Happily, Cruise's ``Mission: Impossible'' is a mission accomplished, from the solid international cast to the action set pieces. And don't worry about the slightly incomprehensible plot; it was that way on the old TV series, too.  Multiplicity PG-13  There are four reasons to see this comedy-fantasy, and they're all named Michael Keaton. He plays an overextended Everyman who clones himself to have enough time for his job and for his wife (Andie MacDowell) and kids. Unfortunately, director Harold Ramis and his multiple screenwriters have settled for a broad comedy with limited aspirations. Take Keaton out of the equation, and the movie just doesn't add up to much. Still, the star is hilarious, and his ability to play off himself times three is as miraculous as the special effects. His tour-de-four performance raises the film to the level of mildly pleasant, but nothing more.  The Nutty Professor PG-13  Nuts to the naysayers, Eddie Murphy's back. The hottest comedian of the '80s manages to make an iffy idea _ remaking a Jerry Lewis classic _ work by giving his most engaging performance in years. With a little help from latex, he plays Sherman Klump, a painfully shy, 400-pound college professor who tests an experimental fat gene on himself. He is transformed into a svelte ladies' man who has a way with a one-liner and a mile-wide mean streak (in short, he becomes Eddie Murphy). The movie relies a bit too much on juvenile gags, but Murphy displays a newfound sweetness as Klump that suggests career possibilities as a date-movie lead. _ Doug Hamilton  The Phantom PG  Fast-paced, entertaining and altogether kid-friendly, this adventure movie is a cleverly put together update of a Saturday afternoon serial. Based on the comic strip character created 60 years ago and set in a ``Raiders''-like 1930s, the movie globetrots between the Phantom's (Billy Zane) home jungle and an exquisitely art-deco Manhattan where a power-mad millionaire (Treat Williams) schemes to take over the world by exploiting the power of three legendary skulls. Director Simon Wincer and his cast (add Kristy Swanson as a fearless heiress) have a bold adventure-movie style leavened with a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor. And you have to admire the Phantom's low-tech arsenal: a gun, a wolf and a white horse.  Phenomenon PG  This phenomenally likable movie cuts across niche-marketing lines; it works as a family film, a tear-jerker and a date movie. John Travolta stars as an average Joe mechanic who's transformed by a blinding white light into a genius with telekinetic and psychic powers. Jon Turtletaub's movie starts out as a harmless, warmhearted fantasy but deepens into a more thoughtful, complex picture. The fine supporting cast _ Kyra Sedgwick, Forest Whitaker, Robert Duvall _ is a huge help, but the movie just wouldn't work without Travolta. He's radiantly charming as the bumpkin-turned-Einstein _ thrilled and energized by his newfound intellectual curiosity and his discovery of the interconnectedness of all living things.  Primal Fear R  A sleek, solid courtroom thriller directed by Emmy-winner Gregory Hoblit and based on William Diehl's best seller. Richard Gere stars as a high-powered attorney who defends a stuttering altar boy (Edward Norton) accused of murdering an archbishop. The kind of lawyer who spends as much time on magazine covers as he does in the courtroom, Gere doesn't care if the kid is guilty; he simply wants to win a front-page-friendly case. The top- notch supporting cast includes Laura Linney, Alfre Woodard and John Mahoney. But the buzz is going to be about newcomer Norton, who gives the kind of electrifying performance that jump-starts careers in a big way.

Fled R  Flee. The Atlanta landmarks are the best thing abo ut this second-rate action-comedy starring Laurence Fishburne and Stephen Baldwin as escaped convicts on the lam from local authorities (led by Will Patton), the Feds and the Cuban Mafia. A black guy and a white guy chained together may suggest ``The Defiant Ones,'' but this film is less interested in racial issues than buddy-movie cliches. The stars' chemistry is negligible, leaving the way open for Patton to steal scenes with his entertaining impersonation of Tommy Lee Jones in ``The Fugitive.'' But give director Kevin Hooks credit for capturing Atlanta's sleek big-city anonymity. Miss Daisy wouldn't know the place, but then, neither would anyone who left town before 1990.  Flipper PG  Writer-director Alan Shapiro's remake of the '60s family classi c ``Flipper'' is an entertaining summer diversion that doesn't take itself too seriously. It's predictable but fun. Elijah Wood is Sandy, a sullen city teen who's shipped off to live with his eccentric uncle for the summer on a remote Bahamian island while his parents hash out a messy divorce. Paul Hogan (``Crocodile Dundee'') is the bachelor uncle, Porter, who's found paradise in a ramshackle fishing camp. Neither nephew nor uncle is thrilled about the prospect of spending the summer together, but things change when a bottlenose cutie with a big grin and an irresistible personality shows up. The underwater photography is awesome. Try to guess which are the live dolphins and which are the mechanical. _ Paula Crouch Thrasher  The Frighteners R  Flawed but still frightfully fun. This comic gore-fest from impish director Peter Jackson marks a step forward for its star, Michael J. Fox. As a former architect who is so traumatized by his wife's death that he begins to see ghosts, Fox is likably haunted and finally comfortable in an adult role. But the movie is a step backward for Jackson, whose previous film, 1994's ``Heavenly Creatures,'' was a harrowing account of teenage obsession that ends in murder. This time around, Jackson treats death much more cavalierly, injecting its messier aspects _ burial and decomposition _ into a kooky ``Ghostbusters''-type premise. Eye-popping effects and a luminescent supporting performance by Trini Alvarado help one forgive the slight plot. _ Doug Hamilton  From Dusk Till Dawn R  Robert Rodriguez's hyperviolent vampire flick stars scripter Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney (in a dynamic big-screen crossover) as killer bank robbers who kidnap a retired minister (Harvey Keitel) and his kids (including Juliette Lewis). Bad luck for them, these anti-heroes stop at a Mexican bar _ catering to bikers and bloodsuckers. The long opening setup is vintage Tarantino, full of bloody shocks and sick humor. But once the saloon's staff morph into vampires, ``Dusk'' heads into Sam Raimi's ``Evil Dead'' territory, complete with spewing eyeballs and severed limbs. It's an excuse for a couple of way-talented filmmakers to have gruesome fun. And for most of the time, we do, too. But the squeamish, beware. _ Steve Murray  Harriet the Spy PG  Michelle Trachtenberg makes a winning 11-year-old Harriet M. Welsch, sixth-grader and neighborhood spy. Based on the 1964 Louise Fitzhugh book, Nickelodeon Movies' first feature updates the story of a budding writer and her sensible nanny Ole Golly (Rosie O'Donnell) by setting it in a shiny urban Anytown with exotic Asian markets and a rolling rap-bop soundtrack. The characters along Harriet's spy route (notably Eartha Kitt) and the vagaries of sixth-grade life form the heart of her hilarious notebook and the movie's plot. This movie reminds you, with a sting, that it's still hell to be 11. _ Eileen M. Drennen  Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco G  Sassy the Himalayan cat, Chance the American bulldog and Shadow the golden retriever aren't the only things that are lost in this sequel to the 1993 hit. Also missing is its predecessor's lovely animal-lover lyricism. This time, they wander the streets of San Francisco where they're menaced by buffoonish dog thieves and rescued by a gang of streetwise pooches (think, Dead End Dogs). The voice talent _ Sally Field as sarcastic Sassy, Michael J. Fox as irrepressible Chance and Ralph Waite (replacing the late Don Ameche) as dignified Shadow _ is as good as ever, but too many talking animals spoil the movie. The first film moved you to tears; the sequel is standard baby-sitter stuff for undemanding kids.  The Hunchback of Notre Dame G  This ambitious adaptation of Victor Hugo's massive classic is a thing of beauty, but not always a joy to behold. Team Disney has pulled out all the stops for its 34th animated feature, but it's left out a lot of the fun, too. In 15th century Paris, a lonely, misshapen bell- ringer (voice by Tom Hulce) loves a spirited Gypsy (Demi Moore). Several scenes are stunning and some much-needed humor is provided by a trio of gargoyles (Jason Alexander, Charles Kimbrough, the late Mary Wickes). But the movie as a whole succumbs to an operatic preachiness; the message overwhelms the medium. Take the kids; they'll be enthralled by the visuals and enjoy the gargoyles. But you may find yourself thinking, where's Charles Laughton when we need him?

Independence Day PG-13  On a pure popcorn-movie level, it's a blast. After alien spaceships blow up Earth (spectacularly!), President Bill Pullman, fighter pilot Will Smith and computer whiz Jeff Goldblum lead mankind's counterattack. Offering support _ or potential victimhood _ is a large cast headed by Judd Hirsch and Mary McDonnell. As director Roland Emmerich would be the first to admit, despite references/borrowings from sci-fi classics of every stripe (notably a germ of an idea updated from H.G. Wells' ``War of the Worlds''), the movie is really a state-of-the-art '70s disaster flick _ ``The Towering Inferno From Outer Space.'' Is it a great movie? Hardly. But it is great fun and, sometimes, that's just as important.  Jack PG-13  Robin Williams thinks ``Big'' in this comedy-drama directed by Francis Ford Coppola (``Apocalypse Now''). Williams plays a 10-year-old boy who has a rare condition that causes his body to age too quickly. ``The Nanny's'' Fran Drescher co-stars. _ Doug Hamilton  James and the Giant Peach PG  Not the pits, but not peachy keen, either. Roald Dahl's comically macabre tale of a little boy and his buggy pals who sail a giant peach across the ocean has been turned into a classy but cold fantasy featuring the voices of Susan Sarandon (as a Garbo-ish spider), Richard Dreyfuss (a street-tough centipede) and David Thewlis (a woe-is-me earthworm). A good deal of craft and imagination have gone into this film, but everything from the script to Randy Newman's score suffers by comparison to ``Toy Story.'' Certainly kid-worthy, but grown-ups who've made the trek north on I-85 may find themselves less tickled by the movie than by the titular fruit's resemblance to its country cousin outside Gaffney, S.C.  Joe's Apartment R  MTV's first film release should come with a can of Raid for each viewer. Based on a live-action short frequently run on the video channel, it stars Jerry O'Connell as a New York apartment dweller beseiged by meddling roaches. Moviegoers may barely recognize O'Connell as River Phoenix's chubby friend in ``Stand By Me.''  Jumanji PG  Robin Williams shows us where the wild things are in this effects-laden family fantasy about a mysterious board game that can bring rhinos into your living room or turn a house into a primeval swamp. Director Joe Johnstone (``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'') knows how to thrill an audience with outsized insects or a stampede down Main Street. But the movie goes on a roll of the dice or two too long. And in-between ``plays,'' things get frankly boring. Bottom line: If you've seen the trailer, you've already seen all the best parts. And those ``best parts'' may be a little scary for littler kids. Johnston does nothing to up the ante; it's like playing Candyland instead of Monopoly.  Kazaam PG  Shaquille O'Neal should have slam-dunked this script into the nearest wastebasket: The 12-year-old who finds the lamp containing Kazaam (O'Neal) is an obnoxious punk named Max (Francis Capra), who seems not so much an urban Huck Finn of the 1990s as a candidate for serious therapy. Max convinces the genie to help him search for a father he hasn't seen in 10 years. They track him to a club where they become involved with a villain named Malik (Marshall Manesh), assorted thugs, pirated recordings and other distractions that imperil the boy, his father and Kazaam's magical boombox. As fairy tale, buddy comedy, family drama, thriller or rap revue, ``Kazaam'' is simply uninspired and unconvincing, and O'Neal, who can carry a basketball team, lacks the charisma to rescue this misguided effort. _ New York Times.  Lone Star R  In this stunningly multifaceted social study of a small Texas border town, writer-director John Sayles has created a movie that's Dickensian in its moral fervor and has a rich panoply of characters. The central thread is a murder mystery. The current lawman (Chris Cooper) is sworn to find out who killed Sheriff Wade _ a bigoted bully played to swaggering perfection by Kris Kristofferson _ 40 years ago. In doing so, far more than who shot the sheriff comes to light. Sayles takes us deep into the heart of Texas darkness (and, by extension, into our nation's conflicted heritage). That he does so with such literate intelligence, subtle humor and implacable humanism makes his movie as invaluable as it is irresistible.

The Craft R  This not-quite-bewitching thriller uses an MTV veneer to ma sk its conventionally moral heart. Set to a hip, alternative rock soundtrack, it tells the story of four Catholic schoolgirls who explore sisterhood and empowerment through witchcraft. Their experiments with the occult end up destroying their innocence and wrecking their friendship. The four leads _ Robin Tunney, Fairuza Balk, Neve Campbell and Rachel True _ all give complex, multilayered performances. And the movie taps into a universal youth fantasy: Who hasn't wished for supernatural powers as a guard against the cruelties of adolescence? Ultimately, though, ``The Craft'' is sunk by heavy-handed sermonizing. _ Doug Hamilton.  Dead Man R  The Wild West becomes the Weird West in Jim Jarmusch's mytho-poetic meditation on a beloved genre. Johnny Depp stars as a mild-mannered accountant who goes west and finds himself on a surreal odyssey that takes him from so- called civilization to a natural state (both savage and enlightened). Gary Farmer co-stars as his Native American guide and spiritual adviser. Robert Mitchum, John Hurt and Gabriel Byrne turn up in cameos. Some may find the film a ploddingly paced, heavy-handed allegory. But even those put off by Jarmusch's hipster whimsy and elliptical narrative will be impressed by Robby Muller's exquisitely textured photography and Neil Young's evocative score.  Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood R  A vehicle for Shawn and Marlon Wayans, the two youngest members of the comic family that includes brothers Damon and Keenen Ivory. This ``Airplane!''-style parody takes broad, juvenile jabs at such urban ``message'' movies as ``Menace II Society'' and ``Boyz N the Hood.'' If not all the jokes here work, many of the ones that do have extra weight. When two characters are busted for ``being black on a Friday night'' and taken to a police station equipped with a Rodney King punch-and-kick video game, the movie turns from goofy fun to comedy that tickles and stings. _ Doug Hamilton  Dragonheart PG-13  A drag. Knight Dennis Quaid teams up with Draco, the last dragon on Earth, to defeat an evil king (David Thewlis). Despite a hefty special-effects budget and a guest performance by Sean Connery as the voice of Draco, the movie is barely better than ``Pete's Dragon.'' Someone _ perhaps director Rob Cohen or writer Charles Edward Pogue _ should've realized that a friendly dragon becomes smaller than life, best- suited for the kids or a sitcom. There's no sense of peril here, no hint of soaring enchantments, no trace of wonder and awe. ``Dragonheart'' is a dragon movie made by people with no respect for dragons.  Eraser R  A most satisfying dose of major summer movie mayhem. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a federal agent who ``erases'' the identities of people in the Witness Protection Program. His new assignment is Vanessa Williams, a corporate whistle-blower. Making things especially difficult is a powerful mole within Arnold's agency. (Yeah, it's like ``Mission: Impossible,'' but Arnold is Arnold and Cruise is Cruise.) The movie slams along with jaw- dropping efficiency, having fun with all kinds of preposterous action stunts. True, it's too long _ our patience and Arnold's invincibility wear thin _ but it delivers. Robert Pastorelli and James Caan co-star.  Executive Decision R  A crafty pastiche of Tom Clancy, ``Die Hard'' and ``Airport.'' Kurt Russell plays Dr. David Grant, a civilian intelligence consultant for the U.S. military. An amateur pilot in his spare time, Grant inadvertently ends up the key player in an attempt to thwart the hijacking of a 747 by a Hamas-style terrorist group. Though Steven Seagal makes a brief appearance as the commanding officer of an elite anti-terrorist force, there is a welcome lack of chest-beating here that one might find in the average testosterone-fueled action vehicle. Grant is a thinker, not a warrior. The consultant as conquering hero? This nail biter could make it a trend. _ Doug Hamilton  Fargo R  A tale of murder, greed and morning sickness in Minnesota, this squalidly hilarious black comedy marks a return to top form for the Coen Brothers (``Blood Simple''). Sleazy car salesman William H. Macy hires two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wealthy wife (they'll split the ransom dad-in-law coughs up). But things go awry and soon Frances McDormand, the very pregnant police chief of Brainerd, Minn. (Home of Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox), is on the case. Loosely based on real incidents that occurred in 1987, the movie exists in some surreal cinematic convergence of Mayberry, Twin Peaks and SCTV. It's a great place for any movie lover to visit _ provided, of course, you bring along a very sick sense of humor.

Code rating guide:  G _ General audiences. Nothing that would offend parents if viewed by children.  PG _ Parental guidance suggested. May contain some material parents might not like for their young children.  PG-13 _ Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for pre-teenagers.  R _ Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking their young children with them.  NC-17 _ No one under 17 admitted. Replaces the X rating.  NR _ Not rated.  A Time to Kill PG-13 The stakes are high for Matthew McConaughey, the heretofore unknown star of this latest film adaptation of a John Grisham novel. But as an idealistic young lawyer who defends a black man accused of murder in a backward Mississippi town, McConaughey gets help from a star-studded supporting cast, including Sandra Bullock and Samuel L. Jackson.  The Arrival PG-13 Alternately compelling and hokey, this sc i-fi thriller is ultimately trapped in a thematic void somewhere between ``The X-Files'' and ``This Island Earth.'' Charlie Sheen plays a radio astronomer who picks up some truly ethereal static on his monitoring station's satellite dish. Convinced he's struck pay dirt, he takes the tape to NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab for analysis. To his surprise, not only does his boss (Ron Silver) remain dubious, but he has to let Zane go because of sudden department downsizing. Novice director David Twohy has his moments, particularly when choreographing suspense. But both direction and writing suffer from the same tonal problems. Unable to decide between being somber and sensational, the movie wavers unsatisfactorily between the two. _ Hollywood Reporter.  The Birdcage R  There's nothing terribly wrong with Mike Nichols' scene-by-scene remake of the 1978 French farce _ except the intervening 18 years. What used to cause a belly laugh now earns a pleasant chuckle. Robin Williams plays Armand, the relatively butch half of a gay couple. Nathan Lane is Albert, his shrieking drag-queen companion. Chaos arrives when Armand's son Val (Dan Futterman) brings home the parents of his fiancee: ultraconservative Senator Keeley (Gene Hackman) and his wife, Louise (Dianne Wiest). Armand can play it straight, but what to do with the hyper- nelly Albert? The movie ought to take off into the laughing-gas stratosphere of the best farces. But at 20 minutes longer than the French original, the film feels padded. Like ``To Wong Foo,'' the movie feels a little safe, a little tired. _ Steve Murray.  The Cable Guy PG-13  In this cataclysmically wretched comedy, Jim Carrey pla ys a cable installer who launches a fatal-attraction invasion of a customer's (Matthew Broderick) life. The movie is a horror that swamps Carrey's considerable talent in Hollywood-style overkill (helicopters, medieval jousts, flashbacks to an abusive childhood). The daring satiric message is that too much TV can be bad for you, but the unintended subtext is, can too much Jim Carrey be bad for you? I think not. Carrey's still wired to our inner cretin (what laughs there are he nabs), but his movie is nothing but static.  Cold Comfort Farm PG  One of the best things to happen to a barnyard since ``Babe.'' Based on Stella Gibbons' popular 1932 book that deftly satirized the rustic rhapsodies of Hardy and Lawrence, John Schlesinger's movie is a sweet, savvy comic fable (think ``Clueless'' meets ``Tobacco Road''). Our heroine (the marvelous Kate Beckinsale) is a sleek, self-possessed socialite who goes to live with her country cousins in Sussex. With an ``as if'' aplomb worthy of Alicia Silverstone, she sets about tidying up the farm and her eccentric relatives' pigsty lives. The excellent supporting cast is a potpourri of prodigiously talented British actors, headed by Sir Ian McKellen (``Richard III'').  Courage Under Fire R  Credit Denzel Washington, Meg Ryan, director Ed Zwick, a solid script and an excellent supporting cast for this rewarding and courageous movie. Washington plays a military officer assigned to review the Medal of Honor candidacy of a pilot killed in combat during the Gulf War. The twist? The pilot is a woman (Meg Ryan). Instead of rubber-stamping the case as his superiors and the media clearly wish, he investigates and discovers a ``Rashomon''-like web of conflicting stories and possible military coverups. The movie has something for everyone, from guts-and-glory combat scenes to post-Watergate paranoia about the nature of truth in an age of photo ops. Zwick and company may not deserve the Medal of Honor but a few Oscar nominations will do.

After the hearing, Frank Lindh told reporters that he and his ex-wife, Marilyn Walker, met with their son for the first time in two years Thursday morning.

"137161"	"you"	"do"	" Actress Tracey Gold is perhaps best-known for two things: playing brainy Carol Seaver on the '80s television series ``Growing Pains'' and her battle with the eating disorder anorexia nervosa. Ten years later, Gold reflects on her recovery from the devastating disease in ``Room to Grow: An Appetite for Life'' (New Millennium; $18.95) with Julie McCarron. Gold, married and the mother of two boys in Valencia, spoke to the Daily News about her reasons for writing the book.  Q: You say that you've never told your story in your own words. Why did you decide to write the book at this point in your life? A: I think it was really to educate other people. There had been some wonderful opportunities to tell my story. The People magazine article was very fair and they did a great job. But that was 11 years ago. It was a week after I got out of the hospital. If I had to pick the timing, it would not have been then. I've had years of recovery now. I've had so many experiences of talking to young women and seeing how my story has affected them. It's not a book with all the answers. It's just my experience and it's helpful to know that there's someone else out there who went through it.  Q: You wrote that you left out certain details so that the book does not become a manual for girls who are anorexic. A: I don't write my lowest weight. And I don't talk about how much I weighed when I was told to lose weight. Our society is so numbers-obsessed. It's dangerous because girls with anorexia are so fragile and so susceptible to suggestion. Yet when you talk about anorexia, you do, unfortunately, have to discuss some of the behaviors. In explaining my journey, I had to mention some of the things I did. I tried to walk a tightrope.  Q: Have you heard about the Web sites in which people with anorexia exchange tips on how to lose more weight? A: Those Web sites are so horrific. A lot of times, they're put out by anorexic girls who are in the midst of it. They're proud of their disease. They haven't realized what it's to.m to their lives. That's one reason I had such a hard time with group therapy. We'd exchange diet secrets. I walked out knowing way more. It's still a training ground to figure out the best way to treat these girls. My opinion is you do it individually. You take them away from the group (therapy) situation where girls are trading secrets and having a competition of who's thinnest.  Q: What finally made you decide to stop and get healthy? A: My husband. I had this dream of getting married and having children and moving forward in my life. All of the things I wanted were slipping away from me. I always thought I could stop beforE it got bad. I didn't have that control.   Q: How has motherhood affected your outlook? A: I have to do everything to stay healthy. My boys didn't ask to be born to an anorexic mother. I say they're my best cure.  Q: Any final thoughts? A: The book is for girls suffering from anorexia and it's for families to understand what's going on in the anorexic eiN`. It affects everyone, not just the anorexic. In truth, the family is probably more devastated. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20030311.0057 type=story > <HEADLINE> COURT RULES GUANTANAMO PRISONERS NOT COVERED BY U.S. CONSTITUTION </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WASHINGTON  (BC-TERROR-DETAIN-480&amp;ADD) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200303.gz"

WITH: CYC-TOUR-MAIN BODYGUARDS KEEP ARMSTRONG AHEAD OF THE GANG </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> NIMES, France </DATELINE> <TEXT> Neither Erwin Ballarta nor Serge Borlee carry a weapon.  Neither needs to.  As one U.S. Postal official said of Ballarta, He can kill you 20 different ways.  Why would he need to? Well, both he and Borlee are accomplished martial arts practictioners and lean, muscular athletes for whom 500 situps a day is normal. They are also active law enforcement officers.  All are prerequisites for their job description at the Tour de France.  They're Lance Armstrong's bodyguards.  For all the bodies on the French country roads and in the hosting villages at this 21-day event, they're hopelessly outnumbered.  According to other teams and Tour officials, Armstrong's the only one of the original 188 riders who had even one bodyguard.  We don't need it, said Brian Nygaard, the press relations manager for the Dutch CSC team and emerging star Ivan Basso, who may require one soon. Lance is a special character. Even though there are some famous riders here, they're very different from Lance.  Few, save perhaps popular Frenchman Richard Virenque and Euskaltel climber Iban Mayo, command anywhere close to the attention that Armstrong does.  Lance can't take a step outside the U.S. Postal bus without Ballarta or Borlee -- or both of the trim 46-year-olds. When Armstrong rides to the pre-stage introductions to sign in each morning, the two of them run at almost top speed alongside to keep up and keep the fanatics at bay. At race's end, they are there to protect him from the multitudes and squire him away.  Armstrong could have used them Saturday on the Plateau de Beille, where an estimated 85,000 Basque supporters almost smothered him. One photographer got a shot of two spectators sticking obscene gestures in Lance's face on the final ascent.  A nerve-wracking day?  A little bit, Ballarta said. There's a lot more people this time. There's more frenzy.  He and Borlee are accustomed to such. Between the native Filipino Ballarta and Belgian Borlee, the two have a combined 51 years in law enforcement.  For 18 years, Ballarta has worked for the Texas Department of Public Safety. The lieutenant instructs troopers in the use of force and self-defense and applies karate and the Filipino martial art of kali against multiple attackers and weapons.  When Borlee isn't policing the crowded roads in tiny French villages every July for the past 10 years, he's protecting the streets of Brussels as the city's police inspector.  Before joining the DPS, Ballarta worked in the Big Springs police department, where in all of six years he didn't have to deal with traffic jams like he's had to control in a single Tour stage in France.  His lone run-in with an overly exuberant fan came at the prologue when a man came charging at Armstrong with a flag in his hand and a scowl on his face.  I put a serious face on, said Ballarta, who had to push the man aside. But a lot can be done by a kind word.  Ballarta usually has plenty of those, this outgoing father of two sons, who were both drum majors at Pflugerville (Texas) High School.  This assignment isn't totally foreign to Ballarta. He protected both Texas Gov. George Bush and Ann Richards, but finds this task much tougher. So does Borlee, a bald, thick-chested man with a Romanesque nose, who has guarded Armstrong for four years and worked 10 Tours.  Asked if it's a grueling assignment since Lance is somewhat of a rock star, Borlee corrected, Lance is a rock star.  So might be Ballarta soon because Armstrong's fans just want to get close to the five-time champion or anyone in his entourage. Ballarta has taken his vacation in July and been at Armstrong's side for the past three Tours. He joined the Lance entourage after working the security detail at Armstrong's Ride for the Roses.  Only 5-foot-7 1/2 with 170 pounds of fighting shape worthy of a soccer and tennis player, Ballarta got his degrees in psychology and sociology at Eastern Michigan University.  The son of a Chrysler engineer who moved from the Philippines to a gritty section of Detroit when he was a child, Ballarta steered clear of the gang members at Fort and Junction and developed a keen sense of family and community that he retains.  For three years, he worked as a counselor for emotionally disturbed children in the Detroit area until turning to police work. He had strongly considered joining a Catholic seminary but eventually wavered, he joked, when discouraged by the celibacy guidelines.  In a week, his summer vacation will end although he does get paid for this work. And how much does he make, trying to keep half of France off Lance's back?  Not enough, he said with a wide grin. Not enough.  Kirk Bohls wriotes for the Austin American-Statesman.
