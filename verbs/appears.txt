The new government is counting on foreign capital to fuel growth and jobs, but investors are worried about high labor costs, trade barriers and the Government's commitment to capitalism.   GATT took a step toward congressional approval.

Mexico accused the U.S. steel industry of dumping -- selling products abroad at unfairly low prices. Mexico imposed tariffs on two types of United States steel imports.   The Economy   Sales of new homes fell 14.1 percent in June, the government reported. Analysts said higher interest rates were putting a crimp in housing, an important segment of the economy.   Consumer borrowing and corporate bank loans are rising, suggesting that there is still optimism and growth in the economy. Many economists say that the increase reflects an economy that is healthy today, whatever the future might hold.   Nearly $1 billion in shipbuilding contracts was announced. The government contracts will benefit shipyards in California, Louisiana, Mississippi and Virginia.   Markets   Three recent technical breakdowns at Nasdaq have tarnished the exchange's image as as a technological leader and has prompted concern from securities traders and lawmakers.   Prices of Treasury securities were mixed. Short-term securities rose, while the price of the long bond fell.   Blue-chip stocks slipped in listless trading.   The London stock market led rallies by European exchanges. China's stock market gave back part of Monday's gains.   The dollar rose against the yen as the outlook improved for trade relations between the United States and Japan.

"22129"	"it"	"appears"	" Honda Racing, it appears, is an oxymoron no more. A year ago, that seemed to be the case when Bobby Rahal,who bore the torch for Honda's debut in the PPG Indy Car World Series, ended his season by switching to Mercedes-Benz. Enter Steve Horne,owner of Tasman Motorsports, who this season helped Honda save face by joining forces with Robert Clarke,general manager of Honda Performance Development, to put a competitive package on the track for drivers Scott Goodyear and rookie Andre Ribeiro. ``What we have now is a totally different engine, with an alloy block and revised induction system,'' Clarke said. ``Most of the performance gains have been made in the induction area.'' While they ran an old HRX engine last season and in the first five races this season, Honda engineers developed a new aluminum block engine, the HRH. ``I think the opportunity to work with Honda is a once-in-a-lifetime proposition,'' said Horne. ``When the opportunity came up, there was no question in my mind what we wanted to do, because there was no downside for us.'' Even by marrying the engine with a Reynard chassis and Firestone tires? ``I didn't feel like we were rolling the dice with Honda and Firestone,'' Horne said. ``I think I looked at the facts. And the facts are that Honda had a difficult year last year, but if you look at their previous history in racing (specifically in Formula One, where Honda developed a dominant engine for Team McLaren), you'd have to be blind not to recognize their record of success over the years. I didn't see any dice involved in that.'' ... Scott Sharp of East Norwalk, Conn., who made his Indy 500 debut last year with PacWest Racing, landed a ride with A.J. Foyt and will drive a year-old Lola-Ford Cosworth. During Friday's practice, Sharp went 224.003 m.p.h., the fastest tour he's ever made at the Brickyard. ``That was a lot faster than I thought we had run,'' said Sharp, who qualified 17th with a four-lap average of 222.091 m.p.h, a year ago. ``A.J. is just fantastic, honestly. Every change he's made has been a good change. You don't usually get that. You usually get a couple of good ones then one in the wrong direction. But he's just really helped me out. We're in a '94 car, so I'll be happy with any spot that will get me in securely.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"22200"	"it"	"appears"	" 11. This curious reasoning drives the dissent. If Edmonds allowed only related persons (whatever their number) to dwell in a house in a single-family zone, then the dissent, it appears, would agree that the s3607(b)(1) exemption is unavailable. But so long as the City introduces a specific number any number (two will do) the City can insulate its single-family zone entirely from FHA coverage. The exception-takes-the-rule reading the dissent advances is hardly the ``generous construction'' warranted for antidiscrimination prescriptions. See Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.

"26734"	"it"	"appears"	" Conducting the review of government action required by the Establishment Clause is always a sensitive matter. Unfortunately, as I noted in Allegheny, ``even the development of articulable standards and guidelines has not always resulted in agreement among the Members of this Court on the results in individual cases.'' 492 U. S., at 623. Today, JUSTICE STEVENS reaches a different conclusion regarding whether the Board's decision to allow respondents' display on Capitol Square constituted an impermissible endorsement of the cross' religious message. Yet I believe it is important to note that we have not simply arrived at divergent results after conducting the same analysis. Our fundamental point of departure, it appears, concerns the knowledge that is properly attributed to the test's ``reasonable observer (who) evaluates whether a challenged governmental practice conveys a message of endorsement of religion.'' Id., at 630 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). In my view, proper application of the endorsement test requires that the reasonable observer be deemed more informed than the casual passerby postulated by the dissent. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

JAPAN-AIR-CARGO (Los Angeles) -- The U.S. and Japan agreed last night to broaden access to air-cargo routes through both countries. Negotiators are meeting this morning to iron out details.  BLINDER-INTERVIEW (Washington) -- Alan Blinder, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said he's ``open-minded'' about the need for another cut in short-term interest rates to stimulate the economy. ``The probability of a recession is lower in mid-July than it was in the middle of June,'' Blinder told the Bloomberg Forum. ``But that doesn't mean the risk is zero.''

BANK-OF-BOSTON-STEPANIAN (Boston) -- With reports that Bank of Boston Corp. may merge with Corestates Financial Corp., it appears Chairman Ira Stepanian either scaled back his demands in finding a merger partner or found a partner willing to meet them.  WESTINGHOUSE-CBS (New York) -- Westinghouse Electric Corp. and CBS Inc. officials are negotiating terms of a formal takeover bid by Westinghouse today, people familiar with the talks said.  WESTINGHOUSE-CBS-FUTURE (New York) -- On David Letterman's ``Late Show,'' Mary Tyler Moore lamented that her new CBS drama, ``New York News,'' would have to compete against NBC's hit series, ``Seinfeld,'' on Thursday evenings this fall. Moore shrugged her shoulders and said, ``We'll just have to do our best,'' So, it appears, will Westinghouse Electric Co. The Pittsburgh giant is in talks to buy the nation's third-rated network.  MICROSOFT-JUSTICE (Washington) -- The Justice Department withdrew a disputed demand for information in its antitrust probe of Microsoft Corp., saying the fast-approaching deadline for release of Windows 95 doesn't leave time for a procedural fight. The government said it's continuing its probe of possible antitrust violations in Microsoft's plan to use its ballyhooed Windows 95 operating system as a launching pad into computer information services.  What The Markets Are Saying  US-BONDS (New York) -- U.S. bonds fell and yields rose to the highest in about two months as investors bet the economy's growth won't slow enough to renew a recent rally.  COMMODITIES (New York) -- Commodities were higher, with coffee prices jumping amid perceptions a plan by producers to withhold exports is working to lower available supply.  US-STOCKS (New York) -- U.S. stocks were mixed as the outlook for technology companies varied. Apple Computer Inc.'s fiscal third-quarter were beneath last year's, and less than analysts' consensus forecast.

DOLLAR (New York) -- The dollar rose against the yen as the conviction grew that the Bank of Japan is willing to buy dollars aggressively to drive the U.S. currency higher.

Washington Report  SPENDING-CUTS (Washington) -- A bill to cut current spending by $16.4 billion is expected to win final congressional approval. It would be a small, yet symbolic, first step in the Republicans' quest to balance the budget by the 2002.  US-ECONOMY (Washington) -- On Monday, the White House and Congress are likely to the kind of news they like: that the government posted a budget surplus in June as quarterly tax returns streamed into the Treasury's coffers. However, analysts say, the outlook for the months and years ahead isn't quite as upbeat.  AG-SPENDING (Washington) -- The House expects to finish work on a $62.7 billion agricultural spending bill for fiscal 1996, after disposing of controversial amendments today on whether to abolish a $110 million program that subsidizes food company advertising overseas.  Canada  INTERBREW-LABATT (Toronto) -- Interbrew SA moved a step closer to acquiring John Labatt Ltd. after the Canadian brewer's shareholders approved its C$4 billion (US$2.94 billion) takeover offer.

Analysts believe Kmart may try to sell its Canadian unit to raise cash.  Columns &AMP; Commentary  RATES-OF-RETURN (New York) -- In the crowded market for corporate debt, sometimes it pays to be different. Just ask the Tennessee Valley Authority, which this week crafted a $500 million bond issue wiht such unique features that it attracted a flock of new investors on one of the businest days for corpate bond sales in months. In another sale, Walt Disney Co. sold bonds whose interest rate is tied to the box office returns of summer movies such as ``Die Hard 3'' and ``While You Were Sleeping.''  US-OUTLOOK (Washington) -- When is an employee not an employee? When he's an independent contractor. That distinction is becoming increasingly blurred as many companies move toward hiring more workers as contractors -- paid by the project, with no employer-supplied health or retirement benefits, and responsible for their own quarterly Social Security tax payments. The Internal Revenue Service, meanwhile, is having a hard time cracking down on employers who blur the distinction.  CONGRESS-WATCH (Washington) -- Some advice for American taxpayers on the so-called fiscal ``train wreck'' that's due to come when U.S. debt reaches its statutory limit: Take it with a grain of salt. Investors in the U.S. bond market, on the other hand, may want to take a couple of aspirin. They're the ones on the tracks.  WHITE-HOUSE-WATCH (Washington) -- The most serious foreign policy dilemma facing President Bill Clinton and U.S. business today isn't in the Balkans; it's in China. Tensions that have been growing for more than a year now have spilled over into corporate America, putting at risk billions of dollars in U.S.-China contracts.

"30348"	"it"	"appears"	" Peter McNeeley's manager, Vinny Vecchione,had an interesting point of view on the 770 layoffs at the MGM Grand, where his fighter will oppose Tyson in two weeks. ``If Peter beats Tyson, they'll have to close the place,'' Vecchione said ... McNeeley put on quite a show for the neighbors of co-trainer Beau Williford in Lafayette, La., last week before he left for Las Vegas. Because of a fire, Williford had to set up the ring in the gym's driveway. With the heat around 97 degrees and the humidity just as high, McNeeley sparred outdoors as passersby watched in wonderment ... British heavyweight Henry Akinwande recently whacked out local Stanley Wright in England ... Chelsea heavy-weight John Ruiz will fight a benefit match for the Somerville Boxing Club, where he has long trained, Aug. 24 at the Somerville High field house vs. a Texas heavy-weight named Willie Jackson (9-3-1). Ruiz, who won the WBC International heavyweight title several months ago in England from Derrick Roddy,is 23-2 and angling for a fall fight against a world-rated opponent. Manager Norman Stone reports that Ruiz has been offered a bout with Thunder that he would willingly accept, but it could hinge on the outcome of Thunder's fight next week with Annis ... If you happened to watch the replay of the Vinny Pazienza-Roy Jones Jr. fight Tuesday night on USA, you will now better understand the explanation given by trainer Kevin Rooney after Pazienza was stopped by Jones. ``Our plan was to fight inside,'' Rooney said. ``The first two rounds, I thought Vinny did some of that. After that I knew he was in trouble. He had no way to counter a guy as quick as that. I was shocked. Jones was in a comfort zone (all night), and Vinny was always chasing.'' Pazienza, it appears, will press on despite the defeat, however. He has said he's been offered a shot at the WBO light heavyweight title, and former welterweight champion Buddy McGirt has been popping off that he would like to fight Pazienza ``at whatever he wants to weigh.'' ... The Jones-Pazienza rebroadcast last week was USA Network's highest-rated fight _ doing a 2.8 Nielsen rating (1.845 million homes) _ since Aug. 9, 1994, when Larry Holmes fought Ferguson ... They were dancing in the streets in Southie last week when news came back from Nagoya, Japan, that Ireland's Wayne McCullough,who now fights for Eddie Futch out of Las Vegas, had won the WBC bantamweight title from Yasuei Yakusjiji by a split decision ... Middleweight contender Dana Rosenblatt returns to the ring Friday in New Orleans vs. Troy Watson (17-12) on ESPN. His management continues to talk about a match with Roberto Duran,but Duran is asking twice what he's worth these days, so that fight seems doubtful ... Goody Petronelli will finally get light heavyweight Drake Thadzi a shot at the World Boxing Association title Sept. 2 when he steps into the ring vs. champion Virgil Hill at Wembley Stadium. Thadzi was supposed to fight Hill more than a year ago, but the fight fell through and Petronelli has been chasing the match ever since. Now he's got it. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950805.0240 type=story > <HEADLINE> A REFLECTIVE TYSON EMERGES FROM PRISON </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> LAS VEGAS (BC-BOX-TYSONOUTLOOK-BOS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"

Times News Service  MEXICO REACHES TENTATIVE CONCLUSION ON CARDINAL'S MURDER  MEXICO CITY (NYT) _ After more than two years of investigation, the questioning of scores of witnesses and the pursuit of hundreds of leads, the Mexican authorities say they have reached a tentative conclusion about the murder of the Roman Catholic cardinal of Guadalajara.  Government officials say they still believe a group of drug traffickers shot the cardinal by mistake, confusing the tall, robed cleric with a short, rival trafficer. And most Mexicans, it appears, still don't believe them.  ``We do not agree with that hypothesis,'' the cleric's successor, Cardinal Juan Sandoval Iniguez(tilde over nn) said through a spokesman. ``We have never believed in the idea of a confusion, and we hope they will someday solve the case.''  COUPLE SUES ROMANIAN GOVERNMENT FOR CAUSING CHILD'S HIV INFECTION  IASI, Romania (NYT) _ Challenging a government with one of the worst records for AIDS prevention in Europe, a Romanian couple is suing the Romanian Health Ministry for causing the HIV infection of their daughter.  The case of Iasmina Calinciuc, a wide-eyed six year old girl with a loopy grin and a great fondness for TNT cartoons, has attracted wide attention and encouraged other parents to take on the Romanian Health Ministry for failing to eliminate what critcs describe as sloppy practices that cause the needless spread of AIDS.  Iasmina's case got to court for the simple reason that, unlike the thousands of Romania's orphans who were infected with the HIV virus during the communist dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu, she has parents willing to sue on her behalf.  BREATHING LIFE INTO A 1,000-YEAR-OLD SUPERMAN  BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan (NYT) _ The 1,000-year-old legend of Manas has riveted this formerly Soviet, Central Asian nation where people say they have lost faith in just about everything else.  His birthday is being celebrated this week in a giant fair, including the construction of Manas Village, a government-sponsored ``authentic'' setting that, for some reason, employs pseudo-Roman architecture that might look at home in Disney World.  The legend of Manas has lived on here through an oral epic 20 times longer than the Iliad and Odyssey combined. The hero is a sort of divine superman, possessing the strength of Hercules and the avenging spirit of David. Using his omnipotent powers, Manas defeats foreign invaders and creates a ninth-century Kyrgyz superpower. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950830.0469 type=story > <HEADLINE> SPURRED BY TORONTO, MONTREAL LAYS ON A FEAST OF CINEMA </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> MONTREAL (BC-FILM-FESTIVALS-2TAKES-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"

HEALTH-CUTS (Undated) _ Millions of working people and their employers will end up paying more for health care as a result of cuts that Congress is making in Medicare and Medicaid spending, economists and Washington business lobbyists said. The higher costs are a little discussed side effect of the legislation that would mainly be felt by the 130 million people covered by traditional fee-for-service health plans.

Jerry Gray. w. 9 p.m.  YUGOSLAVIA-CROATIA (Sarajevo) _ Mostar, a 500-year-old city in a narrow, mountainous valley, was supposed to be the showcase of the Bosnian-Croat federation forged by Washington. It is the city where the West has worked hardest to reunify people who fought bitterly before a truce early in 1994. But today it remains as divided as Berlin once was. The Croats who govern the west side of Mostar refuse to allow the Muslims, who live in the east, where the Bosnian government has control, to cross the Neverta River. If anything, it appears, these are two nations moving apart, not together. They have different license plates, currency, and passports. Raymond Bonner. i. 9 p.m.  BOTTOM:  POWELL-POLITICS (Undated) _ There has been a veritable fusillade of telephone calls in the last couple of weeks from the general to friends, family members, governors, potential-fund-raisers, former cabinet members, and onetime colleagues at the Pentagon and the White House, seeking advice. Powell had a reputation as a hyper-cautious officer, stringing out decisions until the last possible moment, weighing every factor, and he is proving to be that kind of politician-in-the-making.

The old bill will still be accepted everywhere, of course, and it's not exactly as if hundred-dollar notes are the coin of the realm. But things couldn't be more different here, because Russians are completely obsessed with the C-note. They covet, hoard, and trade them more than in any country other than America itself. Despite the fact that it is illegal to use dollars for retail trade, people who can scrape them together routinely use hundred-dollar bills to buy cars, trucks, or houses. Whenever they can get away with it, wage earners demand their salaries in hundreds, too. Michael Specter. i. 9 p.m.  MISS-POLITICS (Starkville, Miss.) _ If it is still possible for a progressive Democrat to win statewide office in the Deep South, the pollsters and consultants say, it is by forging a coalition between black voters and white women.

Larry Forgy is challenging Paul Patton, the Democratic lieutenant-governor, to succeed Brereton C. Jones and end 24 consecutive years of Democrats in the Governor's Mansion. Until a recent change in state law, a Kentucky governor was barred from seeking re-election. While independent polls gave Patton comfortable leads early in the campaign, more recent surveys show that Forgy has pulled virtually even. Michael Janofsky. a. 9 p.m.  JAPAN-U.S. (Ginowan, Okinawa) _ To listen to Okinawans, the American military presence here is not a source of comfort or protection, but an annoyance and a threat. The result is a growing outcry to evict the American troops and American bases from Japan, or at least curb their presence. The uproar, backed by a recent protest of more than 50,000 demonstrators, is threatening to spoil the summit meeting this month between President Clinton and Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama.

Yet Renzulli, a resident of Westchester County, will appear on Tuesday's ballot as a Conservative candidate for Bronx Supreme Court justice _ a job he did not seek and does not want. Renzulli is one of a handful of unwitting candidates who were nominated for judge without their consent or knowledge by underdog political parties bidding for some presence in this year's races. a. 9:30 p.m.  MIDWIVES (Hartford, Conn.) _ Connecticut health officials are trying a midwife, who has delivered 175 babies for practicing without a license.

Two sets of plaintiffs filed complaints in the Central District of California: the Epstein plaintiffs (including Lawrence Epstein, John Linder, Jane Rockford, Maurice Karlin, Ruth Karlin, Beth Karlin, and Bert Karlin) sued both individually and on behalf of all MCA shareholders at the time of the tender offer; Walter Minton brought suit in his individual capacity. All had tendered their shares for the $71 tender price. The District Court consolidated the two cases. Minton and, it appears, Rockford opted out of the Delaware class action settlement. Matsushita does not contest the qualification of Minton and Rockford, as individuals, to pursue federal claims unimpeded by the settlement in Delaware. See Brief for Petitioners ii.

If you have any questions, please call Vinton Supplee on the Republic News Desk at (602) 271-8108.  MONTINI-COLUMN (Undated) _ Outside the Southside Presbyterian Church in Tucson, near a large, hand-painted sign reading ``Este es el Santuario para los Oprimidos de Centro America'' _ ``This is a sanctuary for the oppressed of Central America'' _ young girls attached red, yellow, green and white paper flowers to a spindly wire fence. It was May 2, 1986, the day after eight of 11 defendants, including the church's pastor, Rev. John Fife, were found guilty in federal court of transporting illegal aliens, conspiracy and other charges. By E.J. MONTINI. Story will move in the ``A'' and ``K'' categories.  FOURPEAKSFIRE (Roosevelt, Ariz.) _ The thick pall of smoke over much of metropolitan Phoenix on Monday begins here, on the eastern slope of rugged Four Peaks, the logistical center of a fire fighting operation costing as much as $500,000 per day. Extending over 30,000 acres by Monday afternoon, the human-caused fire is the first wild fire of the dry season. By CHUCK HAWLEY. Story will move in the ``A'' category.  PROP187 (Phoenix) _ A proposed Arizona initiative to curb illegal immigration would make employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants legally liable and would create a state ``verification center'' to determine whether job applicants have legal documents. The initiative, ``Save Our State-Az'' and patterned after California's Proposition 187, was filed Monday with the Arizona Secretary of State's Office. By MARK SHAFFER. Story will move in the ``A'' category.  BOMBECK (Phoenix) _ In Bermuda shorts and a straw hat, Joe Mudd of Phoenix, an avowed Erma Bombeck fan, watched Monday as pallbearers moved the humor columnist's coffin into St. Thomas the Apostle Catholic Church. ``I loved her for her goodness,'' he said. ``And I wouldn't have missed this for anything.'' Mudd was among 1,500 family members, friends and fans who came to say goodbye to the Ohio housewife-turned-humor columnist. By GAIL TABOR and LINDA HELSER. Story will move in the ``A'' category.  ARCHER-COLUMN (Undated) _ In the wake of Oklahoma City, President Clinton blamed ``promoters of paranoia'' for spreading ``hate'' and ``bitter words.'' Others were even less partisanly delicate, blaming those opposed to massive government regulation, high taxes and law enforcement excesses for inspiring the tragedy. The bombers of Oklahoma City, it appears, were right-wing nuts. Plain and simple. Eco-nut, it seems to me, fits the Unabomber. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960430.0008 type=story > <HEADLINE> FATHER CHARGED WITH MISDEMEANORS FOR REMARKS TO SON'S COACH </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> LOS ANGELES (BC-PARENT-JAILED-LADN) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"

"62909"	"it"	"appears"	" In their cross-petition, the Lohrs present a final argument, suggesting that common-law duties are never ``requirements'' within the meaning of s360k and that the statute therefore never pre-empts common-law actions. The Lohrs point out that our holding in Cipollone is not dispositive of this issue, for as Part IV, supra, suggests, there are significant textual and historical differences between the Cipollone statute and s360k, and the meaning of words must always be informed by the environment within which they are situated. We do not think that the issue is resolved by the FDA regulation suggesting that s360k is applicable to those requirements ``having the force and effect of law'' that are ``established by . . . court decision,'' 21 CFR s808.1(b) (1995); that reference, it appears, was intended to refer to court decisions construing state statutes or regulations.

"67459"	"it"	"appears"	" For the second time this season, Robert Yates Racing posted a 1-2 finish, this time at the Brickyard 400. At the Jiffy Lube 300 July 14 at NHIS, Ernie Irvan and Dale Jarrett took first and second; at last Saturday's Winston Cup race at the Brickyard, the order was reversed, as Jarrett, winner of the Daytona 500 and the Coca-Cola 600, finished ahead of his teammate. For his spoils, Jarrett pocketed a whopping $564,035. ``To win here, it's a dream,'' said Jarrett, the only driver eligible to collect a $1 million bonus for winning three of the four Winston Million races (Daytona, Charlotte, Talladega and Darlington). ``To win Daytona, Charlotte and (Indy) in one year is just incredible. Reflecting back, and knowing where I came from, to get to this point is very gratifying. I don't know why God decided this is Dale Jarrett's year, but we may as well go ahead and win some more and take that million off their hands.'' ... After being injured in a terrible wall crash at Talladega, where he fractured his left collarbone and cracked his sternum, Dale Earnhardt gallantly rebounded to qualify 12th for the Brickyard 400, take the green flag and drive six laps before pitting on Lap 7 to relinquish his ride to Mike Skinner. ``I wasn't that nervous,'' said Skinner, whose 15th-place finish enabled Earnhardt to collect 123 points and remain in second place (2,731 points) in the Winston Cup race behind Terry Labonte (2,792). ``The nervousness that I had was for wrecking Dale's car.'' Earnhardt, it appears, will look to Busch Grand National driver David Green to step in for Skinner as his relief in Sunday's Bud at the Glen at Watkins Glen, N.Y. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199608.gz"

Clinton: The Vital Center. A shorthand phrase has grown up around Bill Clinton: `He moved to the center.'

She was the ``first lady of song,'' perhaps because people could listen to her all day long. Gene Kelly brought Irish sass and working-class brass to the art of dance.

YEAR-CARS-NYT (Undated) _ Four automotive writers choose the cars they drove in 1996 that stood out, for good or ill, from the pack. The picks do not represent a list of the best or most significant vehicles of the year, though in many cases it would be hard to argue otherwise.

TOPFILMS-96-KAN (Undated) _ This year's choices of films that opened in Kansas City in 1996 run the gamut from easygoing comedy to searing social drama to a radical reinterpretation of Shakespeare. They stand out because they don't rely on cliche and convention, because they dare to be different at a time when _ if box office figures are any indication _ audiences are interested only in the superficial, the bland and the easily assimilated. By Robert W. Butler. Moved 12-30.  FILMS-YEAR-SPI (Undated) _ The American movie business at year's end seemed a troubled industry, uncertain exactly who its audience is, assaulted by a gauntlet of unpleasant pressures, mystified as to why nine out of 10 films it released in 1996 seemed to go belly up on opening weekend. By William Arnold. Moved 12-26.  TOP-10-MOVIES-NYT (Undated) _ This year in film seemed more like two.

ENTERTAINMENT  YEAR-ENTERTAINMENT-BOS (Undated) _ The pop game was a high-stakes sport in 1996, the year heroin became a series of celebrated ad campaigns and a hit movie, the year bullets took down rapper Tupac Shakur and made his phrase ``Thug Life'' oxymoronic, the year Michael Jackson chose nothing less than fatherhood as his next PR gambit. When we weren't watching analysis of the real-life ``O.J. Simpson Murders: The Sequel,'' we were charmed by world-threatening images from science-fiction phenomena like ``The X-Files'' and ``Independence Day,'' which rode into the all-time box-office Top 10 on footage of the White House collapsing. Rockers R.E.M. began a new national adventure in high finance by signing the fattest recording deal ever ($80 million for five albums), and with Jackie O.'s auction, America's idealized Camelot era was symbolically disassembled and scattered like so many ashes around the world.

YEAR-POP-WOMAN-BOS (Undated) _ Time to call 1996 what it was: pop music's Year of the Woman. While testosterone-fueled bands had their ups and downs, women in rock 'n' roll, pop, country and folk often made the most dramatic impact in their fields. The super-gifted, super-charged Alanis Morissette became a household name. So did post-Streisand pop queen Celine Dion, whose ``Falling Into You'' album sold 5 million copies to become the year's top-selling release. By Steve Morse.Moved 12-30.  MUSIC-YEAR-BOS (Undated) _ Years come; years go; year-end wrap-ups will be with us always. Think of them as the Ebola virus of the media. Attempts to escape these encapsulations are futile. This, however, my 17th annual It's Only Rock 'n' Roll Awards, is less ``what did it all mean?'' than an attempt to honor the few, the proud, the rocking _ and pelt the charlatans with fruit and vegetables. As always, we operate under the motto we stole from a long-ago Streetwalkers album title: ``Vicious, but fair.'' By Jim Sullivan. Moved 12-27.  SPORTS  YEAR-ANDERSON-COLUMN-NYT (Undated) _ After the revelry, reality returned. Not long after a celebration, a comedown usually occurred. And even with the glory, gloom often hovered. In sports in 1996, many victories were never enjoyed for long and the losses lingered. By Dave Anderson. Moved 12-28.  YEAR-LIPSYTE-COLUMN-NYT (Undated) _ I AM TIGER WOODS.

YEAR-VECSEY-COLUMN-NYT (New York) _ For a roaming columnist who lives for exciting and exotic datelines, 1996 was never going to be a great year, once the Olympic delegates handed the Summer Games over to Atlanta. Then the Yankees _ bless their transient little hearts _ made sure I would be spending much of September and October on the Cross Bronx Expressway. However, sticking close to home has its advantages. By George Vecsey. Moved 12-28.  FASHION  96FASHION-WHITE-KAN (Undated) _ Kick up your chunky boot heels. Hike your skinny pants (if they aren't too tight). Tuck in your shiny shirt. Flick the lint from your brown velvet. And, cheerfully, folks, just let go of 1996. By Jackie White. Moved 12-30.  COMMENTARY  YEARS-INS-AND-OUTS-BOS (Undated) _ Ah, but who or what was truly above suspicion? No one, that's who. Not in a year when going negative was In and going public was Out. When same-sex marriages were In and schoolyard smooching was Out. When trainspotting was In and ump-spitting was Out. When lawyering up was In and dumbing down was Out. When tickling Elmo was In and toe sucking was... ``Didn't do it,'' said Texaco executives. ``Not us,'' said the Clinton administration. ``Wrong shoes,'' said O.J. ``Check out John Huang.''

NEWS  YEAR-AULD-BOS (Undated) _ When Robert Burns raised a cup o' kindness to those of auld acquaintance, he suggested they not be forgot, for auld lang syne. Ella Fitzgerald died in 1996. She was the ``first lady of song,'' perhaps because people could listen to her all day long. Gene Kelly brought Irish sass and working-class brass to the art of dance. George Burns, who brought an impishly beguiling straight-man role to vaudeville, radio, television and movies, died at 100. By Martin F. Nolan. Moved 12-30.  BUSINESS  YEAR-IN-REVIEW-WINNERS-BLOOM (New York) _ In a year dominated by mega-mergers and flamboyant chief executives, IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner was the year's biggest winner by sticking to an old rule: Pay attention to your customers. Moved 12-24.  YEAR-IN-REVIEW-1996-BLOOM (New York) _ The U.S. stock market's sixth straight annual gain led this year's rally in most equities worldwide, spurring companies to set records for mergers, acquisitions and initial public offerings. By Adam Levy. Moved 12-24.  YEAR-IN-REVIEW-FINANCE-BLOOM (Undated) _ Soaring stocks, low interest rates and rising corporate profits made 1996 the biggest year for finance and mergers. Stock and bond sales rose to a record $419 billion, beating 1993's record of $388 billion. Mergers topped $1 trillion, shattering last year's $866 billion record. By Beth William. Moved 12-24.

YEAR-IN-REVIEW-IPOS-BLOOM (New York) _ From Deutsche Telekom AG and Lucent Technologies Inc. to celebrity-backed Planet Hollywood International Inc. and chichi Saks Holdings Inc., 1996 was dominated by technology and retail initial public offerings.

YEAR-IN-REVIEW-MERGERS-BLOOM (Undated) _ Corporate mergers around the globe surged 25 percent to a record $1.04 trillion in 1996, propelled by record stock prices and low interest rates.

COMPUTER-COLUMN-$ADV29-HNS (Undated) _ The computer industry continued to race along in 1996, churning out at an even more feverish pace goodies for you and me to buy. Deciding which of these are worthy of the Computing column's annual Attaboy Awards is a tough job, but someone's gotta do it. By Dwight Silverman. Moved 12-26.  YEAR-ADS-MEDIA-NYT (Undated) _ A recap of the peaks and valleys of 1996 in the advertising world. A year of unprecedented turmoil on Madison Avenue produced many ads that seem fresher, sharper and better than the dreary and formulaic campaigns of the early '90s. But there were also scads of stinkers. By Stuart Elliott. Moved 12-26.  YEAR-CARS-NYT (Undated) _ Four automotive writers choose the cars they drove in 1996 that stood out, for good or ill, from the pack. The picks do not represent a list of the best or most significant vehicles of the year, though in many cases it would be hard to argue otherwise. They obviously reflect personal styles and preferences, but in each case the vehicles listed made an impression above and beyond many others. Moved 12-27 for release 12-29.  YEAR-BIZ-AWARDS-NYT (Undated) _ It was a marvelous year in the stock market, and voters showed they were no longer angry by re-electing almost every incumbent. That set off the best post-election rally since 1928. In such a year, there were many outstanding performances in the business world deserving of awards. By Floyd Norris.

YEAR-MOVIES-BOS (Undated) _ Look at the most interesting films of 1996, and it's amazing to think that at one time most of the world defined film as Hollywood. Most of today's best movies come from places other than Hollywood. By Jay Carr. Moved 12-30.  TOPFILMS-96-KAN (Undated) _ This year's choices of films that opened in Kansas City in 1996 run the gamut from easygoing comedy to searing social drama to a radical reinterpretation of Shakespeare. They stand out because they don't rely on cliche and convention, because they dare to be different at a time when _ if box office figures are any indication _ audiences are interested only in the superficial, the bland and the easily assimilated. By Robert W. Butler. Moved 12-30.  FILMS-YEAR-SPI (Undated) _ The American movie business at year's end seemed a troubled industry, uncertain exactly who its audience is, assaulted by a gauntlet of unpleasant pressures, mystified as to why nine out of 10 films it released in 1996 seemed to go belly up on opening weekend. By William Arnold. Moved 12-26.  TOP-10-MOVIES-NYT (Undated) _ This year in film seemed more like two. The most memorable films of 1996 suggested parallel universes, one light and one fascinatingly dark. A mordant outlook, along with chilly detachment and often pitch-black humor, was the year's most pervasive force. By Janet Maslin. Moved 12-29.

YEAR-MUSIC-BOS (Undated) _ Like most years in this musical city, 1996 was a great one for music. The unbreakable three-way tie for the best concerto performance could arguably be matched in any of the other categories _ even opera, and this is supposed to be an opera-starved area! By Richard Dyer. Moved 12-30.  YEAR-THEATER-NYT (New York) _ The year in theater: new musicals, new stages quicken the pulse of Broadway. By Andrea Stevens. W/photos. Moved 12-24 for release 12-29.  YEAR-STAGE-BOS (Undated) _ While all the hype this season was about the Wilbur and Shubert theaters' reopening with national road-company premieres of ``Master Class'' and ``Rent,'' I'll bet the most satisfied theatergoers were those coming out of the Colonial and Emerson Majestic after seeing Anna Deavere Smith and Spalding Gray. By Ed Siegel. Moved 12-30.  YEAR-IN-ART-NYT (New York) _ The year in art: praising famous men, and an empire or two. By Annette Grant. Moved 12-24 for release 12-29.

YEAR-ART-BOS (Undated) _ The history of dance is ephemeral, which is why the opening of the Jacob's Pillow Archives at the famed Berkshire dance festival this summer is so important to the art form. By Christine Temin.Moved 12-30.  YEAR-ARCHITECTURE-NYT (New York) _ The year in architecture: renewal in New York, thinking big beyond. By Nora Kerr. Moved 12-24 for release 12-29.  ENTERTAINMENT  YEAR-ENTERTAINMENT-BOS (Undated) _ The pop game was a high-stakes sport in 1996, the year heroin became a series of celebrated ad campaigns and a hit movie, the year bullets took down rapper Tupac Shakur and made his phrase ``Thug Life'' oxymoronic, the year Michael Jackson chose nothing less than fatherhood as his next PR gambit. When we weren't watching analysis of the real-life ``O.J. Simpson Murders: The Sequel,'' we were charmed by world-threatening images from science-fiction phenomena like ``The X-Files'' and ``Independence Day,'' which rode into the all-time box-office Top 10 on footage of the White House collapsing. Rockers R.E.M. began a new national adventure in high finance by signing the fattest recording deal ever ($80 million for five albums), and with Jackie O.'s auction, America's idealized Camelot era was symbolically disassembled and scattered like so many ashes around the world. By Matthew Gilbert.Moved 12-30.  YEAR-POP-BOS (Undated) _ Alanis, Alanis, Alanis. Tell me, do you ever want to hear that name again? To say nothing of hearing her ``play'' the harmonica ...By Jim Sullivan. Moved 12-30.  YEAR-POP-JAZZ-MUSIC (Undated) _ The year in pop and jazz: as a dance caught fire, a cold killing. By Fletcher Roberts. Mvoed 12-24 for release 12-29.  POPYEAR-AZR (Undated) _ Rock turned a deaf year to having fun. By Salvatore Caputo. W/POPALBUMS-AZR. Moved 12-28 for release 12-29.  YEAR-POP-WOMAN-BOS (Undated) _ Time to call 1996 what it was: pop music's Year of the Woman. While testosterone-fueled bands had their ups and downs, women in rock 'n' roll, pop, country and folk often made the most dramatic impact in their fields. The super-gifted, super-charged Alanis Morissette became a household name. So did post-Streisand pop queen Celine Dion, whose ``Falling Into You'' album sold 5 million copies to become the year's top-selling release. By Steve Morse.Moved 12-30.  MUSIC-YEAR-BOS (Undated) _ Years come; years go; year-end wrap-ups will be with us always. Think of them as the Ebola virus of the media. Attempts to escape these encapsulations are futile. This, however, my 17th annual It's Only Rock 'n' Roll Awards, is less ``what did it all mean?'' than an attempt to honor the few, the proud, the rocking _ and pelt the charlatans with fruit and vegetables. As always, we operate under the motto we stole from a long-ago Streetwalkers album title: ``Vicious, but fair.'' By Jim Sullivan. Moved 12-27.  SPORTS  YEAR-ANDERSON-COLUMN-NYT (Undated) _ After the revelry, reality returned. Not long after a celebration, a comedown usually occurred. And even with the glory, gloom often hovered. In sports in 1996, many victories were never enjoyed for long and the losses lingered. By Dave Anderson. Moved 12-28.  YEAR-LIPSYTE-COLUMN-NYT (Undated) _ I AM TIGER WOODS. If that's going to be the sports/advertising slogan of 1997, it's going to be my personal mantra, too. By Robert Lipsyte.Moved 12-28.  YEAR-VECSEY-COLUMN-NYT (New York) _ For a roaming columnist who lives for exciting and exotic datelines, 1996 was never going to be a great year, once the Olympic delegates handed the Summer Games over to Atlanta. Then the Yankees _ bless their transient little hearts _ made sure I would be spending much of September and October on the Cross Bronx Expressway. However, sticking close to home has its advantages. By George Vecsey. Moved 12-28.  FASHION  96FASHION-WHITE-KAN (Undated) _ Kick up your chunky boot heels. Hike your skinny pants (if they aren't too tight). Tuck in your shiny shirt. Flick the lint from your brown velvet. And, cheerfully, folks, just let go of 1996. By Jackie White. Moved 12-30.  COMMENTARY  YEARS-INS-AND-OUTS-BOS (Undated) _ Ah, but who or what was truly above suspicion? No one, that's who. Not in a year when going negative was In and going public was Out. When same-sex marriages were In and schoolyard smooching was Out. When trainspotting was In and ump-spitting was Out. When lawyering up was In and dumbing down was Out.

ISRAEL-SCENE (Hebron, West Bank) _ The scene in Hebron after Israeli soldier opens fire on Arabs in a market. By Joel Greenberg.  Eds, should an accord be announced, The Times is considering additional coverage to include a piece on the history of Hebron and another on Hebron's significance to both Israel and to the Palestinians.  OTHER INTERNATIONAL  PERU-HOSTAGES (Lima) _ The hostage crisis begins its second week. People are saying that letting the journalists in is showing the rebels' weaknesses. By Calvin Sims.  Following is a tentative sked:  KOREA-DOGS (Seoul) _ This is one of a number of places in Asia where man can cuddle up by a fire with his best friend, and in hungrier days, eat him or his kin. In South Korea, the term ``dog-lover'' is as ambiguous a phrase as ``dog food.'' As South Korea tries to gain a more important spot on the world stage, it is sometimes caught between old tastes and a yearning for respect from foreign countries. Many Koreans argue that it is no one's business but their own if they happen to eat dog, but there is still a broad current of embarrassment about the practice because people realize that Westerners may regard such dining habits as uncouth or morally offensive. A Foreign Journal by Sheryl WuDunn.  WASHINGTON  CONGRESS-GIFTS (Washington) _ A year after federal lawmakers imposed on themselves one of the most restrictive codes of conduct ever and on the eve of the start of the first full Congress to live under those regulations, they are beginning to feel the full bite of the rules. By Karen DeWitt.  NATIONAL GENERAL (``a'' code)  SEE-ROCK-CITY (Lookout Mountain, Ga.) _ They were the Sirens of the South, beckoning to generations of vacationers driving to Florida. Around the bend on U.S. Highway 41 out of Michigan, over the crest of a hill on Kentucky state highway 91, all of a sudden there would be a barn, splashed with giant white block letters: ``See Rock City.'' It was a masterful marketing campaign that grew up with the automobile, some 900 barns in 19 states. But times changed, and, ``The barns, they're all fading now,'' said Clark Byers, 81, who spent more than 30 years painting the signs.  NORTHWEST-STORM (Seattle) _ The Pacific Northwest finished off its holiday week with yet another powerful storm that brought drenching rain and high wind to the coast, mudslides in Seattle and flooding south of the city. On the southern Oregon coast, gusts of up to 100 mph whipped beach towns, toppling utility poles and trees and knocking out power to hundreds of people. And in tiny Guerneville, Calif., the Russian River is expected to reach a record crest of 49 feet, 17 feet above flood level. By Carey Goldberg.  DETROIT-KIDNAP (Detroit) _ Debra Iverson had everything: a notable career as an opthalmalogist, wealth and two beautiful children. Then one day, on her way to an upscale shopping mall, she disappeared. For a time her husband was a suspect, but now, it appears, she fell victim to a modern nightmare: a random kidnapping and murder by two young strangers.  ACCUSED-NAZI (Kansas City, Kan.) _ Michael Kolnhofer, was thought to be a quiet widower who made a pleasant neighbor. Then on Tuesday, he got into a shootout with the police after being accused of being a former Nazi concentration camp guard.  COMMENTARY (``k'' code)  William Safire's ``Essay''; details to come.

CITY STREETS  DEAR DIARY:  A couple we know briefed their 3-year-old granddaughter on the Nativity before traveling from New Jersey to see the Christmas pageant at Radio City Music Hall.  Our seats were well upstairs. So it was that amid the silence of the manger scene the youngster rose, waved her arms and shouted: ``Baby Jesus! It's me, Cameo. I'm up here!''  _ STANLEY H. KREITMAN  Another chapter from the annals of the New York City Subway Journal. At the 66th Street station on the IRT line, that mysterious ``sick passenger'' held up the morning rush hour by at least 20 minutes. The riders were getting restless, especially one extremely vexed fellow who was yelling at the token clerk. Just when the police arrived, the man shouted: ``I gotta get somewhere! This is called `rapid transit,' officers. Rapid transit!''  ``And this,'' the officer replied sternly, ``is called `calm down, nobody cares!' ''  A brief pause, then the man said, ``My therapist says it's good to vent.'' _ RITA D. POLIDORI  Dear Diary:  This past Christmas I resolved not to make anyone a sweater. Sure, I have closets full of yarn, springy spruce-green worsted, candy-cane red chenille, wispy white angora. I can whip up a winter woodland scene on a pullover. Or a cabled cardigan trimmed with gold metallic thread. Well, maybe, if I had started earlier. In June, say.  Why do we pretend to be pioneers around the holidays? Braiding rag rugs in a ragless age of paper towels? Ruining manicures by stringing popcorn and cranberry garlands like Laura Ingalls Wilder? Piecing together quilts even if we have to buy our scrap materials at the mall? While our grandmothers welcomed store-bought decorations as a sign of prosperity, we insist on making Christmas creations in front of the gas-powered fireplace.  Maybe modern women want to get in touch with the spirit of their ancestors as a comforting antidote to the stresses of the two-career family. The holidays provide a socially acceptable opportunity to ``stay home and bake cookies.'' It may be an expression of a softer, feminine side that is buried under publishing deadlines. Whatever the reason, I loved my craftless Christmas.  _ ANN TRACY  The time: Christmas week.  Place: The North American Mammals wing of the American Museum of Natural History.  Dramatis personae: 7-year-old boy talking to his 3-year-old sister, overheard by Mariana Nacht.  ``Did you know that a full-size moose is longer than two Volvos?''  Dear Diary:  I left New York reluctantly when I retired some years ago. Now I return two or three times a year for what I call my ``New York fix.'' A couple of weeks ago, on a beautiful day, I was walking up Fifth Avenue, gaping at Lord &AMP; Taylor. I was sublimely happy _ until I tripped and fell flat on my face.  As I lay sprawled on the sidewalk a kind voice said, ``Are you all right?''  ``Yes,'' I replied.  ``Why the hell don't you look where you're going?'' came the swift reply.  I love New York.  _ GEORGE DOOLITTLE  DAVID-LETTERMAN ``LATE SHOW'' TOP TEN  ``President Clinton Pick-Up Lines''  10. ``I bet you could use some hillbilly lovin'.''  9. ``Ever done it in a jacuzzi full of gravy?''  8. ``How would you like to become a minor footnote to history?''  7. ``I want you so bad, it's worth the inevitable multi-million dollar lawsuit.''  6. ``For a Secretary of State, you've got a great ass.''  5. ``Is your husband really fulfilling your needs, Mrs. Yeltsin?''  4. ``My wife's going to jail. Wanna party?''  3. ``Do you take Visa?''  2. ``I just ratified a bill -- how would you like to gratify a bill?''  1. ``Let's McDo it!''  HEADLINE HEADACHES  You might think of them as the missed notes in the symphony of American journalism.  Then again, you might not.  But you don't need to be able to tell the difference between a constipated goose and an out-of-tune oboe to detect some serious discordance in the following headlines:  Lung Cancer In Women Mushrooms _ This is tragic news, certainly, and we can only hope that medical science will someday find a cure. But I think the more important question here is whether the women mushrooms' condition makes them unsafe to eat.  Stolen Painting Found By Tree _ Everybody knows that trees provide shade and lumber, but this is the first time I've heard of one tracking down a stolen painting. Who knows? If they had had a competent, unbiased eucalyptus on the Los Angeles police force, O.J. Simpson might be behind bars.  Prostitutes Appeal To Pope _ What the heck. The guy's old. He's been shot. Let him have a little fun.  Man Struck By Lightning Faces Battery Charges _ This seems like a rather odd way to charge batteries, but if it works, why not? Personally, if I had been struck by lightning, I don't think my first thought would be, Hey! Let's go charge up some Diehards! Clearly, this guy has way too much energy.  Chef Throws His Heart Into Helping The Needy _ This is a rather disgusting example of a man who is much too nice for his own good. It's bad enough finding a hair in your soup, let alone someone's heart.  Bank Drive-In Window Blocked By Board _ So what's the big deal? Pick up the damn board and move it out of the way! Sheesh. People can be so helpless.  Lansing Residents Can Drop Off Trees _ Well, yes, I suppose they can, but why would they want to? Things must be pretty slow in Lansing if people are getting their kicks by dropping off trees. It sounds like a dumb idea to me. For one thing, you might hurt yourself. And the other thing is the tree might arrest you.  Prosecutor Releases Probe Into Undersheriff _ Ouch! I'm not quite sure what an undersheriff is, but I definitely don't want the job if that's the way they're treated.  Old School Pillars Are Replaced By Alumn _ Perhaps this is what happens to alumns who don't send the old school enough money, I don't know. Either way, it doesn't sound like a very satisfactory way to hold up a roof. Your arms and back would get really tired, but probably not as much as if you were a pillar of the community.  Arson Suspect Is Held In Massachusetts Fire _ This seems like a rather extreme form of interrogation. Then again, they used to burn witches in Salem, so maybe this is just the way things are done in Massachusetts.  Typhoon Rips Through Cemetery; Hundreds Dead _ Well, what do you expect to find in a cemetery? People dancing the Macarena? How about giving us some details about the typhoon?  Astronaut Takes Blame For Gas In Spacecraft _ That's what the astronaut gets for eating that pastrami-and-sauerkraut sandwich before takeoff. I mean, you can't exactly open a window up there, you know.  Kids Make Nutritious Snacks _ Well, so do grasshoppers and earthworms, but that doesn't mean we should eat them! Jeez, talk about your irresponsible journalism.  Include Your Children When Baking Cookies _ OK, that's it. I'm canceling my subscription.  _ From David Grimes, columnist for the Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune.)  BILL'S WORLD  by Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star  Super Bowl tip: Bet on a team with a nickname that begins Pa-something, as long as it's not the Panthers.  One of the official participants in presidential inauguration-related events will be Elmo from Sesame Street. Makes you wonder when someone will market a Tickle Me Paula Jones doll.  In the military's recent rehearsal of the inauguration, Mr. Clinton was played by a Marine sergeant. Obviously not type cast.  The Colorado Avalanche, winners of the 1996 Stanley Cup, visited the White House the other day. Team members must all be Democrats. None of them checked the president into a wall.  Huge amounts of snow fell in New York state last weekend. Wait until you see what Washington gets with the upcoming inaugural and State of the Union speeches.  A new survey shows 38 percent of college freshmen spend at least an hour a week doing volunteer work. Which may be more than the amount of sleep some of them get.  A new study shows smokers age faster than nonsmokers. All that nagging must take a toll.  A British newspaper says Buckingham Palace is planning a public relations campaign to convince folks Prince Charles will make a good king. And, it appears, a brief one, too.  Michael Jackson says he wants to make Scotland his home. Bet that's an idea some residents there want kilt.  Chinese scientists report a breakthrough in breeding better varieties of rice. Will it be marketed as Uncle Ben Xiaoping's?  GOOD DAY, WIRE WANDERERS!!!!!  Offer not available in any store! (Or any other news service!)

NYT News Service  INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  COLOMBIA-EXODUS (Bogota, Colombia) _ Frustrated with four years of recession and terrified by the crime and kidnappings that flourish in a grinding civil conflict, many of Colombia's most promising young professionals and business people have reluctantly abandoned this country in the hope of finding success and stability. Many have wound up in the United States, which the Census Bureau estimates has a Colombian-American community of 435,000 people. By Juan Forero. 1.400 words.  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.)  CHINA-U.S. (Beijing) _ Although China remains a one-party dictatorship, public opinion is increasingly a factor that must be taken into account by leaders who, in the absence of a charismatic figure like Mao or Deng Xiaoping, must also resolve internal disputes before resolving an issue as sensitive as the spy-plane standoff. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.  NATIONAL _ GENERAL (Moved in ``a'' category)  TEENS-RUSSIAN-ROULETTE (Indiana, Pa.) _ Court stories: The tale of two boys, a gun and the legal repercussions.

INDIGENT-DEFENSE-III (New York) _ For indigent defendants who believe that justice was not done in New York City's trial courts, appeals courts offer a measure of hope. The likelihood of success depends, at least in part, on the skill and effort of the lawyer appointed to handle the appeal. But just as there are problems with lawyers who defend the poor at trial, there are problems with the lawyers appointed to file appeals. Some work for nonprofit organizations and are paid salaries, but many work on their own. By Jane Fritsch and David Rohde. (Scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in ``a'' news file.) 2,200 words.  Editors: This is the third of three articles examining the representation that New York City offers to indigent defendants.

But their arguments do not compose the core of the Bush administration's rationale for a tax cut, as they did in the Reagan administration. Still, while none of President Bush's top advisers are considered true supply-siders, their basic philosophy has a good deal in common with the school of thought that was famously encapsulated by the Laffer curve. By David Leonhardt.  NIKE-AD-COLUMN (New York) _ A popular television commercial for basketball shoes is being turned into a spot that resembles a music video in a step that is likely to further blur the already wavy line between sponsored and nonsponsored content. By Stuart Elliott.  INDONESIA-ECON (Jakarta) _ When a team from the International Monetary Fund arrives here on Wednesday, it may feel a sense of deja vu. Indonesia's currency is tumbling, the economy is weakening and political instability is roiling the country. Much has certainly changed since the turbulent days of the Asian financial crisis. But analysts here say Indonesia stands at yet another perilous crossroads. By Mark Landler.  SAINSBURY-MIDEAST (London) _ The British supermarket group J. Sainsbury, whose stores in Egypt have been the target of a boycott of U.S. and Israeli products and attacks fueled by rumors that the chain was owned by a Jewish backer of Israel, said it will withdraw from Egypt at a cost of as much as $180 million to focus on its home market, Britain, and the United States.

SCIENCE TIMES (Moved in ``a'' category)  SCI-DARK-ENERGY (Baltimore) _ Evidence is presented at an astronomical conference that many consider incontrovertible, based on observations of star that exploded 11 billion years ago: that the universe is being blown apart under the influence of a mysterious antigravitational force known only as ``dark energy,'' and that stars and galaxies are but mere specks of froth on a stormy sea of dark matter that outweighs the stuff of stars and people almost 10 to 1. By Dennis Overbye. (2800 words)  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.)  SCI-EXTREME-GALAXIES (Baltimore) _ Astronomers at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in Arizona announced at a conference here this month that they had apparently doubled, to four, the number of known ``extreme'' galaxies, which are oriented in the rarest and most revealing angle for earthly observers. Astronomers theorize that these galaxies are special because of powerful jets of particles, possibly accelerated by an unseen, massive black hole at the center, pointed directly at Earth from millions of light-years away.

SCI-SUNSPOTS (Undated) _ A tempestuous sun at the peak of its 11-year cycle of storms is lighting up dark skies around the globe with auroras that dance in shimmering waves of color reaching as far south as Mexico. The action picked up on March 29, when a dark, agitated region of the sun developed into the biggest sunspot of the current solar cycle. The spot was 14 times as large as than the Earth, and its seething tumult and associated flares soon had a number of terrestrial effects. By William J. Broad.

As a park scientist explains: ``Mother Nature does not destroy herself. It's that simple. Instead it is a giant reapportionment of species.'' Wildfires, in other words, cause shifts in habitat along a spectrum, from major re-structurings to subtle ones depending on factors that include the intensity of the burn and the condition of the soil. The changes favor some species and increase their distribution and abundance, while hampering others, sometimes for the short term, and sometimes for much longer periods. The park has detailed these effects in a new 118-page book called ``Yellowstone in the Afterglow: Lessons from the Fire.'' By Jim Robbins. (1950 words)  (ART ADV: Photo NYT9 and a graphic are being sent to NYT photo and graphic clients.)  SCI-VOGT-VIRUS (Undated) _ A Scientist at Work profile: Dr. Marguerite Vogt. Over the decades, Vogt has worked with Dr. Renato Dulbecco of the Salk Institute on groundbreaking studies of how the polio virus forms distinctive plaques in tissue culture, work that proved essential to the development of a polio vaccine. Later, the two researchers explored how a type of mammalian tumor virus called the polyoma virus transforms ordinary cells into cancer cells, research that lifted the study of cancer biology from a mere cataloging of the gross anatomy of a tumor cell to an exploration of the genetic mutations that underlie the disease. But while Dulbecco eventually won a Nobel Prize for his research, Vogt has yet to be awarded a single significant prize. By Natalie Angier.

By Henry Fountain.  SCI-HAT-PROBLEM (Undated) _ It's no ordinary puzzle that's spreading through networks of mathematicians like a juicy bit of gossip. ``The hat problem'' is consuming brain cycles at universities and research labs across the country and has become a vibrant topic of discussion on the Internet. The reason this problem is so captivating, mathematicians say, is that it is not just a recreational puzzle to be solved and put away. Rather, it has deep and unexpected connections to coding theory, an active area of mathematical research with broad applications in telecommunications and computer science. By Sara Robinson. (1500 words)  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.)  SCI-SYNESTHESIA (Undated) _ People who claim to taste shapes, feel sounds and see numbers or letters in color are often dismissed as having particularly vivid imaginations. In two newly published reports, scientists demonstrated that the phenomenon, known as synesthesia, was genuine. On a variety of perceptual tests in which colors were mixed with numbers and letters, synesthetes performed more accurately and faster than people who did not experience sensory mixing. By Sandra Blakeslee. (750 words)  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.)  SCI-CANCER-THERAPY (Undated) _ A study involving arsenic as a treatment for leukemia is one of the recent successes of developmental chemotherapy, the field of cancer research dealing with human testing of unproven drugs. Because the National Institutes of Health randomly screens tens of thousands of compounds annually, the drugs tested in early human trials often have the flavor of the accidental or even bizarre. Paclitaxel, for example, one of the most successful new drugs in recent years, now widely used to treat breast cancer, was originally isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew tree. Besides arsenic, other heavy metals are being studied for anti-cancer activity, including antimony and mercury. In New York, trials are under way looking at high-dose Tylenol and green tea. By Sandeep Jauhar. (1885 words)  (ART ADV: Photos NYT 11,12,13 are being sent to NYt photo clients.)  SCI-SELF-IMAGE (Undated) _ ``I'm a better person than I used to be'' may seem the exclusive mantra of former presidents, chastened lovers and veterans of the analytic couch. But if a series of studies by two social psychologists offers any indication, the conviction that today's self is a new and improved version of yesterday's is, in fact, ubiquitous. Asked to evaluate themselves in the past and in the present, the researchers found, the subjects in their studies consistently reported that they were now more competent, more socially skilled, more tolerant, more polite, more mature and less boring than they had been in the past. Moreover, their own degree of improvement over time, the subjects revealed, was substantially greater than that of their friends and relatives. By Erica Goode. (975 words)  SCI-DYSLEXIA-LANGUAGE (Undated) _ Dyslexia _ or at least the seriousness of any given case _ may also be an accident not just of neurology but of geography, a new study suggests. Simply put: where a dyslexic is raised, and the language that is spoken there, may play a role in the severity of his disability. And English, it appears, owing to its notoriously fickle spelling, may be the most daunting. The findings were reported in a recent issue of the journal Science, and were based on work done by researchers in three countries: England, France and Italy. By Eric Nagourney. (800 words)  SCI-INFANT-DISEASE (Undated) _ A doctor encounters his first case of Cockayne's syndrome in a tiny infant. The milder form of this syndrome (Type I) is rare and horrific and those affected usually die in their teens or 20s. This child had Type II Cockayne's, the rarer (about 30 reported cases) and more severe form (death usually occurs within the first few years of life). Cockayne's syndrome occurs because of a defect in the process of repairing RNA. By Michael Rosenbaum, M.D. (900 words)  SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: Thousands of unwanted pregnancies and subsequent abortions could be prevented with what experts describe as one of medicine's best-kept secrets: the morning after pill. By Jane E. Brody. (1280 words)  SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and fitness:  _ Doctors often prescribe antibiotics for children who have acute sinusitis, but a new study suggests that the drugs do not help most of them. Writing in the current issue of Pediatrics, researchers said that in most cases, the children got better on their own within three weeks. So doctors should hold off giving antibiotics, the authors say. (250 words)  _ While parents have become much more likely to place their children into car seats, they still have much to learn about the best ways to safeguard young passengers, a study by the National Highway and Transportation Safety Administration reports.  _ Ecstasy, the popular drug often associated with the club scene, may harm the memories of people who use it regularly, researchers are reporting in the journal Neurology. It's just one in a series of reports on the drug. (295 words)  _ Women who gain too much weight during pregnancy, already known to be at risk of a number of complications, may also be at risk for a post-pregnancy one: breast-feeding problems. (275 words)  _ Men don't talk about their eating disorders, it seems. They still have them, a new study reports. They're just much less likely to seek treatment for them. The findings are contained in a report in the current American Journal of Psychiatry.

But the effect of the diary _ and its adaptation for the stage, films and, now, television _ has stirred controversy that has touched figures like the director Steven Spielberg and Michael Eisner, chairman of the Walt Disney Co. One issue is a question of law: who owns the rights to Anne Frank's life? By Bernard Weinraub.  NC-POTTERY-MANIA (Charlotte, N.C.) _ North Carolina has at least 500 full-time potters, more per capita than any other state. For four days at the end of March, Charlotte was likely the ceramics capital of the world as it played host to several thousand potters. By Stephen Kinzer.  FOLD-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Chief among the casualties in an increasingly virtual world are books, newspapers and periodicals _ old paper-based repositories for knowledge and information, which libraries are hastily converting to microfilm and optical disk.

Carrie, unlike Bjork, never wrapped herself in a giant swan, but her clothes seemed to reach for a level of eccentricity not lavishly appreciated outside the context of Japanese fashion magazines.  In the course of one hour on Sunday night, Carrie, the dogged romantic and sample-sale fiend played by Sarah Jessica Parker, wore, at various turns, a vintage nurse's cape, bustier and fingerless white gloves that made her look like a deranged nanny; a Prada headband that looked as if it were on its way to morphing into a Davy Crockett cap; and what appeared to be a muslin bra over a slip dress, which left the impression that Carrie had dressed herself with the Sunday morning leavings from the floor of a frat house.  ``We kind of work bit by bit,'' Patricia Field, a costume designer on ``Sex and the City,'' explained. ``We have certain ideas we might want to try, but we don't have a grand master plan.''  A few of the looks selected by Field _ a dress in an upholstery pattern and a sweater depicting a deer roaming in a forest _ came from the French designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, whom Field visited in Paris earlier this year when she was attending the couture shows.  What inspired Field to put Carrie in knee-high argyle socks paired with high-heel sandals _ a look that never quite imparts the idea that the wearer is a functioning, job-holding person with her own ATM card _ is harder to say.  ``We just thought, `Oh, this looks cute,''' Field said. ``It was supposed to be cold out or something like that.''  One imagines that it wasn't supposed to be too cold at the charity fashion show that Carrie participated in during the second episode. Asked to model a Dolce &AMP; Gabbana gown, Carrie, at the behest of a nutty stylist played by Alan Cumming, wound up walking down the runway in jewel-encrusted briefs and a thigh-high silk evening coat (and, winningly, in last season's Versace hair). This was the closest she got to authenticity _ or, rather, to looking like Carrie's creator, Candace Bushnell.  A WIDE CHOICE OF ADROVERS  Editors, it appears, are not the only ones in the fashion community to have quickly outgrown their infatuation with a certain proclaimed genius. Retailers may have, too.  A few weeks ago, a visitor to Loehmann's, the discount clothing emporium on lower Seventh Avenue, came upon racks of clothes, estimated in the hundreds of pieces, belonging not to the Calvin Klein, DKNY or Byblos collections of three seasons ago _ typical fare at the Manhattan store _ but rather to American fashion's most recently anointed superstar, Miguel Adrover. The clothes came from Adrover's spring 2001 collection, inspired by the world of the military and lauded by critics. Jackets at stores like Barneys were originally priced at $1,500.  ``Unfortunately, it is in the nature of our business that you are never able to predict your cuttings exactly,'' Gary Nelson, head of sales for Miguel Adrover, said, referring to the risks inherent in producing clothing lines. ``I don't know a single designer in the world who hasn't had excess inventory.''  Nelson added that Adrover's clothes are in eight Loehmann's stores and that some of those have about 20 pieces each. He also attributed the overstock to the line's rapid expansion. ``Our distribution grew dramatically from fall to spring,'' he said. ``We literally expanded globally.''  THE FASHION COUNCIL CHOOSES  Today, the 26-member board of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, a group claiming Diane Von Furstenberg, Calvin Klein and Carolina Herrera as members, will convene to select an executive director, and the man expected to be named is not a son of their own.  Stan Herman, the president of the council, said that the only candidate being considered is Peter Arnold, a 43-year-old lawyer at the firm of Brown &AMP; Wood.  If confirmed, Wood will replace Fern Mallis, the council's current executive director, who plans to join IMG, the talent agency, which will officially take over the Seventh on Sixth fashion shows. Relieved of the responsibility of producing that event, the council will focus more on fund-raising.  Arnold would not comment on the prospect of becoming the council's new director. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010605.0207 type=story > <HEADLINE> TURNING TO SINGING AND YOGA FOR BALANCE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-KIPLINGER-NEWSLETTER-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"

AFGHAN-MILITARY (Washington) _ Ledeall: U.S. Special Operations Forces have been shooting at enemy forces in southern Afghanistan, in the most forceful ground combat operations by American soldiers to date, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said Friday. Rumsfeld's remarks indicated an expanding, and more dangerous, role for American ground forces as the military heightens its efforts to find and destroy the leadership of al-Qaida and the Taliban. In a separate action against the al-Qaida network, one of its most senior members, Muhammed Atef, was killed by U.S. bombs in an airstrike near Kabul earlier this week, Rumsfeld said. By Thom Shanker, James Dao and Eric Schmitt.  With photo, NYT11.  TERROR-NETWORK (Washington) _ The reported death in Afghanistan of Mohammed Atef, al-Qaida's chief of military operations, would be a significant blow to Osama bin Laden's efforts to regain the offensive against the United States, and could mark a turning point in the Bush administration's global efforts to disrupt and destroy al-Qaida's terrorist capabilities. By James Risen.  KABUL-HOUSES (Kabul, Afghanistan) _ A flight simulator computer program, a list of flight schools in the United States and documents describing chemical, biological and nuclear warfare were found Friday in safe houses used by members of Osama Bin Laden's al-Qaida network here, among the debris left behind by al-Qaida members when they fled Kabul on Monday.

The number of fire fighters at ground zero has been restored to what it was; not, it appears, because of the threats of unions, the negotiating power of the mayor's aides or the recommendations of safety experts.

OTHER STORIES  International  AFGHAN-KANDAHAR (Quetta, Pakistan) _ The Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, one of the main targets of the U.S. war in Afghanistan, has decided to surrender the political stronghold of Kandahar within 24 hours and retreat to the mountains, the Afghan Islamic Press reported Friday. The Mullah agreed to cede control of the city to two well-known commanders from the Pashtun ethnic group, the news agency said, possibly ending the seven year reign of the extremist Islamic group that gave safe harbor to Osama bin Laden and the al-Qaida network. By Jane Perlez.  AFGHAN-HERAT (Herat, Afghanistan) _ On Tuesday, Ismail Khan, the commander who liberated this far west capital from Soviet occupation, returned triumphantly here having helped liberate it once again, this time from Taliban rule. By Friday he had been ``elected'' as governor general _ by tens of thousands of supporters who gathered at a mosque _ and with that authority he held a press conference in a villa's garden here and delivered a message to the West: thank you for your help, such as it was, but it is no longer needed.

National  TERROR-DEARBORN (Dearborn, Mich.) _ Half the 5,000 young Middle Eastern men on the Justice Department's list of people to question live in Dearborn, and local police have been told that they will have to help the FBI carry out its interviews. And Daniel Saab is dreading the ordeal. Not because he is on the list, but because he might have to ask the hard questions. As one of a handful of Arab-Americans on the 220-person police force in Dearborn, Saab already feels squeezed. By Jodi Wilgoren.  ATLANTA-AIRPORT (Atlanta) _ Authorities halted flights at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport and evacuated up to 10,000 people from the terminal Friday after a man ran through a security checkpoint and eluded police. The security breach all but shut down the nation's busiest airport, its effects rippling across the United States as all flights into or out of Atlanta were delayed on the busy travel weekend before Thanksgiving.

"114057"	"it"	"appears"	" Now and then an author surprises me. Thomas H. Cook is a writer I would buy in order to read, and as with Hillerman's autobiography, he seldom disappoints, but ``The Interrogation'' (Bantam Doubleday Dell, $23.95) is disappointing. Cook's intent is intriguing: to recount an interrogation of a homeless man who is believed by the police to have kidnapped and killed a young girl. The time is 1952, so there is reference to ``an unspeakable crime,'' of which we would readily speak today. The interrogation is interesting enough, but every figure carries a heavy burden of torment, and we can guess pretty quickly that the police are on the wrong track. The novel unfolds in what is called ``real time,'' and we see the interrogators, certain they have the right man, trample on what today we would regard as the suspect's rights. Cook conducts all this in an earlier time for no other reason, it appears, than to allow for contrived plot developments unhindered by post-Miranda concerns; virtually no one is interesti </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"

"114592"	"it"	"appears"	" The latest example was the news this week that the board of 180 West End Ave., a large co-op near Lincoln Center, had approved a rule banning new buyers from smoking in their own apartments. This, it appears, is a first. Predictably, eyebrows everywhere arched high enough to be mistaken for McDonald's signs.

"115088"	"it"	"appears"	" Carrie Bell, the book's 23-year-old narrator, is engaged to marry her high school sweetheart, Mike Mayer. It is Mike who makes the ominous-sounding plunge at Clausen's Pier and is permanently paralyzed. Mike can't escape the consequences of that event. But Carrie can. Although this sounds too cold-hearted for two people ``in love,'' consider the extenuating circumstances: The couple's relationship was faltering before Mike was hurt, and both of them knew it. Carrie, filled with an inchoate desire to grow beyond the experiences of high school, had become increasingly aloof. Mike, while not sure what was wrong, recognized a problem. His fateful dive was, it appears, an act of bravado spurred by Carrie's cold disregard. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"

Hitler's favorite filmmaker, Leni Riefensthal, celebrated her 100th birthday at the end of August. At about the same time, Martin Amis' book on Josef Stalin, ``Koba the Dread,'' a masterpiece of journalism, was published in London.  These two happenings also illuminate very clear differences between dictatorships that bend the artist into subservience, and the more stupid dictatorships that simply ignore the artist or try to silence him. Spain's Franco and most of Latin America's dictators that ruled after 1930, fall into this last category.  Everyone knows that both the Nazis and Stalin _ whose code name in the underground press was Koba _ tried to establish an art that glorified heroes and patriotism in a simple language. Several artists managed to create, even within those limits, something original or worthy.  The Soviet Union produced some formidable artists: filmmakers, like Sergei Mikhailovich Einsenstein (``Potemkin,'' ``Ivan the Terrible'') and Vsevolod Pudovkin (``Mother''); or writers like Maxim Gorki and Mikhail Bulgakov, who wrote an admirable novel, ``The Master and Margarita,'' and a really mediocre play, ``The Days of the Turbines,'' which Stalin saw 15 times.  Amis describes with devastating effectiveness how these artists were all bowed into submission, tormented and reduced to echoing the official party-line.  Hitler had at his disposal artists and thinkers equally as renowned as the Soviets. Among musicians, he had the cowed composer Richard Strauss and the accommodating conductor Wilhelm Furtwangler; among the thinkers, there was the astute Martin Heidegger and the genius militarist, Ernst Junger. But in German cinema, nobody got as far as Leni Riefenstahl.  Amis' book attempts to explain the strange indifference of many Western intellectuals to Stalin's savage crimes, which everyone knew about. But Amis goes further than that. He reveals how the dictator was completely intoxicated with power and describes in detail the intricacies of Stalin's methods of submission.  ``Bolshevism was an export product,'' Amis writes in one memorable paragraph, ``and produced almost identical results everywhere. Nazism, on the other hand, could not be duplicated. But, compared with those two, the other Fascist states were just amateurs.''  Like Nero or the first emperor of China, these dictators were actually frustrated artists, which explains why they _ in contrast to Spain's Franco, Argentina's Videla and Chile's Pinochet _ were interested in having intellectuals at their side. With tongue-in cheek, Amis suggests that one could put together an interesting book with the poems of Ho Chi Minh, Mao, Stalin and Fidel Castro _ illustrated with watercolors by Adolf Hitler.  The West's intellectuals who defended Stalin, based their arguments on moral grounds. To build a better world for the long term, it was necessary to tolerate, meanwhile, a worse world in the short term. The end justified any means.  The Communist ghost conjured up by Sen. Joseph McCarthy in the late 1940s _ and revived 30 years later by his pathetic disciples in the Southern Cone _ was based on the same principle. Faced with the menace of a Third World War, you had to clean up the dissidents.  The long-lived Leni Riefenstahl is even more audacious. She has found an aesthetic justification for her Nazi propaganda films which, by the way, are probably the best ever made. To celebrate her centennial, she agreed to be interviewed in Poking, the town where she lives, on the Austrian border.  Millions of people have seen her outstanding work, ``Triumph of the Will,'' and know what it is about. A glorification of Hitler and of Arian beauty, it was filmed in 1934 during the Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg.  Its message is defined in the opening scene: a sky full of bright fluffy clouds, from which descends, like some sort of apparition, the Fuhrer's plane. All of the Third Reich's resources were placed at Riefenstahl's service. She made use of 30 cameras, an endless assortment of lenses and 120 assistants.  ``I wasn't in the least interested in politics,'' said Riefenstahl, ingenuously. ``Hitler interested me only in that he was offering jobs to 6 million unemployed Germans.''  Leni insists that her documentaries only record fact, not ideology, and that neither ``Triumph of the Will'' nor ``Olympia,'' the film she made of the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, has a single anti-Jewish comment.  Several journalist reminded her that although her films may register ``facts,'' her own declarations later contradicted that. In 1938, she insisted she knew nothing about Kristal Nacht _ which marked the beginning of the Nazi persecution of the Jews _ in spite of the fact that she had actually filmed scenes of the outrage. And in 1944 she went on to say, ``It's not important if it's a concentration camp, as long as it produces beauty.''  The dictatorships of Franco (Spain), Trujillo (Dominican Republic), Geisel (Brazil) and Viola and Videla (Argentina) generated only one valuable art form: that expressing resistance or desperation. Their propaganda creations, such as the Valley of the Fallen or the glorifications of World Cup football are mediocre, valueless and merely satisfy illiterate vanities. It is doubtful they will leave a mark on anyone's memory.  Martin Amis' chronicle and Leni Riefenstahl's legacy prove, however, a strange fact: Some dictators may disappear into opprobrium, as Hitler and Stalin did, but their curiosity about creative talent, their desire to tame it and use for their own ends, managed to leave behind malignant jewels, like ``Triumph of the Will,'' or tormented ones, like ``Ivan the Terrible.''  The history of Evil, it appears, treads countless paths _ but not all of them lead to the same Hell.

Hitler's favorite filmmaker, Leni Riefenstahl, celebrated her 100th birthday at the end of August. At about the same time, Martin Amis' book on Josef Stalin, ``Koba the Dread,'' a masterpiece of journalism, was published in London.  These two happenings also illuminate very clear differences between dictatorships that bend the artist into subservience, and the more stupid dictatorships that simply ignore the artist or try to silence him. Spain's Franco and most of Latin America's dictators that ruled after 1930, fall into this last category.  Everyone knows that both the Nazis and Stalin _ whose code name in the underground press was Koba _ tried to establish an art that glorified heroes and patriotism in a simple language. Several artists managed to create, even within those limits, something original or worthy.  The Soviet Union produced some formidable artists: filmmakers, like Sergei Mikhailovich Einsenstein (``Potemkin,'' ``Ivan the Terrible'') and Vsevolod Pudovkin (``Mother''); or writers like Maxim Gorki and Mikhail Bulgakov, who wrote an admirable novel, ``The Master and Margarita,'' and a really mediocre play, ``The Days of the Turbines,'' which Stalin saw 15 times.  Amis describes with devastating effectiveness how these artists were all bowed into submission, tormented and reduced to echoing the official party-line.  Hitler had at his disposal artists and thinkers equally as renowned as the Soviets. Among musicians, he had the cowed composer Richard Strauss and the accommodating conductor Wilhelm Furtwangler; among the thinkers, there was the astute Martin Heidegger and the genius militarist, Ernst Junger. But in German cinema, nobody got as far as Leni Riefenstahl.  Amis' book attempts to explain the strange indifference of many Western intellectuals to Stalin's savage crimes, which everyone knew about. But Amis goes further than that. He reveals how the dictator was completely intoxicated with power and describes in detail the intricacies of Stalin's methods of submission.  ``Bolshevism was an export product,'' Amis writes in one memorable paragraph, ``and produced almost identical results everywhere. Nazism, on the other hand, could not be duplicated. But, compared with those two, the other Fascist states were just amateurs.''  Like Nero or the first emperor of China, these dictators were actually frustrated artists, which explains why they _ in contrast to Spain's Franco, Argentina's Videla and Chile's Pinochet _ were interested in having intellectuals at their side. With tongue-in cheek, Amis suggests that one could put together an interesting book with the poems of Ho Chi Minh, Mao, Stalin and Fidel Castro _ illustrated with watercolors by Adolf Hitler.  The West's intellectuals who defended Stalin, based their arguments on moral grounds. To build a better world for the long term, it was necessary to tolerate, meanwhile, a worse world in the short term. The end justified any means.  The Communist ghost conjured up by Sen. Joseph McCarthy in the late 1940s _ and revived 30 years later by his pathetic disciples in the Southern Cone _ was based on the same principle. Faced with the menace of a Third World War, you had to clean up the dissidents.  The long-lived Riefenstahl is even more audacious. She has found an aesthetic justification for her Nazi propaganda films which, by the way, are probably the best ever made. To celebrate her centennial, she agreed to be interviewed in Poking, the town where she lives, on the Austrian border.  Millions of people have seen her outstanding work, ``Triumph of the Will,'' and know what it is about. A glorification of Hitler and of Arian beauty, it was filmed in 1934 during the Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg.  Its message is defined in the opening scene: a sky full of bright fluffy clouds, from which descends, like some sort of apparition, the Fuhrer's plane. All of the Third Reich's resources were placed at Riefenstahl's service. She made use of 30 cameras, an endless assortment of lenses and 120 assistants.  ``I wasn't in the least interested in politics,'' said Riefenstahl, ingenuously. ``Hitler interested me only in that he was offering jobs to 6 million unemployed Germans.''  Riefenstahl insists that her documentaries only record fact, not ideology, and that neither ``Triumph of the Will'' nor ``Olympia,'' the film she made of the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, has a single anti-Jewish comment.  Several journalist reminded her that although her films may register ``facts,'' her own declarations later contradicted that. In 1938, she insisted she knew nothing about Kristal Nacht _ which marked the beginning of the Nazi persecution of the Jews _ in spite of the fact that she had actually filmed scenes of the outrage. And in 1944 she went on to say, ``It's not important if it's a concentration camp, as long as it produces beauty.''  The dictatorships of Franco (Spain), Trujillo (Dominican Republic), Geisel (Brazil) and Viola and Videla (Argentina) generated only one valuable art form: that expressing resistance or desperation. Their propaganda creations, such as the Valley of the Fallen or the glorifications of World Cup football are mediocre, valueless and merely satisfy illiterate vanities. It is doubtful they will leave a mark on anyone's memory.  Martin Amis' chronicle and Leni Riefenstahl's legacy prove, however, a strange fact: Some dictators may disappear into opprobrium, as Hitler and Stalin did, but their curiosity about creative talent, their desire to tame it and use for their own ends, managed to leave behind malignant jewels, like ``Triumph of the Will,'' or tormented ones, like ``Ivan the Terrible.''  The history of Evil, it appears, treads countless paths _ but not all of them lead to the same Hell.

New Haven police arrested about 800 of the well-behaved Yale University students, employees, union members after they clogged a popular downtown street to protest the university's relations with its workers. Unlike epic protests of yore, however, this was no pitched battle between angry union members and police battalions in riot gear.

In John Allen Muhammad, the teenager, who is now 17, may have finally found the role model and mentor he had longed for. And in the end, it appears, as the facts of the boy's unsettled existence emerge, sustaining Muhammad's acceptance may have become more important to Malvo than the lives of the 13 innocent victims that police now believe the young boy helped to gun down.

TOP  Lede story:  CAMPAIGN-SENATE (Washington) _ The political disarray caused by the death of Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota put a sharp new focus on the battle for control of the Senate, leaving grim strategists in both parties scrambling for their footing Saturday in a national struggle that remains too close to call little more than a week before Election Day. By Alison Mitchell.  (The story is scheduled to move by 3 p.m. ET in ``a'' news file.)  Top center story:  RUSSIA-HOSTAGES (Moscow) _ Russian troops violently crushed a 57-hour hostage siege in Moscow early Saturday, handing President Vladimir V. Putin a high-risk triumph over a terrorist threat. But the price, the loss of more than 60 civilian lives, could yet prove dear. Still, almost 700 people were freed from two days' captivity in the dramatic pre-dawn rescue, a whirlwind of explosions, gunfire and clouds of disabling gas by perhaps 250 anti-terrorist soldiers and police. By Michael Wines.  With photos NYT 1-10, graphic and map.  (Scheduled to move by 3 p.m. ET in ``i'' news file.)  Off-lead story:  SNIPER-RECONSTRUCT (Washington) _ A detailed reconstruction of the sniper investigation: Charles A. Moose, the police chief in Montgomery County, Md., who led the investigation, said that police work took persistence, teamwork and community support _ but almost always depended on chance a well. ``As police chief, I know you need a lot of luck,'' Moose said. ``I'd like to think it's all skill and moxie and brains. But it's mostly luck.'' By David Johnston and Don Van Natta Jr.  (Scheduled to move by 3 p.m. ET in ``a'' news file.)  FOLD  SNIPER-MALVO (Undated) _ John Lee Malvo spent much of his life in search of a father figure. In John Allen Muhammad, the teenager may have finally found the role model and mentor he had longed for. And in the end, it appears, as the facts of the boy's unsettled existence emerge, sustaining Muhammad's acceptance may have become more important to Malvo than the lives of the 13 innocent victims that police now believe the teenager helped to gun down. By Lynette Clemetson.  With photo NYT 23.  (Scheduled to move by 3 p.m. ET in ``a'' news file.)

Security Council if that was the only way to reach agreement. By Elaine Sciolino.  (Scheduled to move by 3 p.m. ET in ``i'' news file.)  INSIDE STORIES PROMOTED ON PAGE 1:  SNIPER-RELIGION (Washington) _ By many accounts, religion had been a stabilizing factor in the life of John Allen Muhammad, who is charged with murder in the sniper rampage that killed 10 people in the Washington region. But as the behavior of the suspected sniper went out of control this month, so did the character of the religious utterances. By Blaine Harden.  With photos NYT 23 and 24.  (Scheduled to move by 3 p.m. ET in ``a'' news file.)  SNIPER-MOOSE (Rockville, Md.) _ For Charles A. Moose, the police chief of Montgomery County, Md., the intensely public manhunt posed extraordinary challenges. Suddenly, a man whose department handled just 19 homicides last year was commanding a task force of more than 1,000 state and federal investigators, under the unforgiving glare of hundreds of reporters, all the while dancing a delicate and dangerous minuet with his quarry. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.  With photos NYT 18 and 19.  (Scheduled to move by 3 p.m. ET in ``a'' news file.)  SNIPER-VICTIM-FUNERAL (Silver Spring, Md.) _ The buses started lining up here Saturday in the early morning darkness.

Johnson, a driver for Ride On, the transit agency in Montgomery County, Md. By Jayson Blair.  With photos NYT 20-22.  (Scheduled to move by 3 p.m. ET in ``a'' news file.)  HAWAIIANS-LAS-VEGAS (Las Vegas) _ A broad swath of the Hawaiian middle class _ hotel workers, retired police officers, teachers and, increasingly, nurses and other professionals _ has abandoned its economically depressed home state in the last 10 years, seeking better jobs, cheaper houses and easier lives here. This stream of migrants has merged with a deluge of visitors _ Hawaiians make 300,000 trips here every year _ to transform Las Vegas into perhaps the most Hawaiian city on the mainland. By Lawrence Downes.  With photos NYT 25 and 26.  (Scheduled to move by 3 p.m. ET in ``a'' news file.)

"137913"	"it"	"appears"	" ``Th' supreme coort,'' Dooley famously observed, ``follows th' iliction returns.'' A century after Finley Peter Dunne's fictional Irish saloon keeper made the point, the court has put an interesting spin on Dooley's theory. At a time when President Bush and his Republican majority in Congress are continually arguing that they have the mandate to appoint extreme conservatives to the federal bench, the highest court of all has surprised many people with its moderation. The Supreme Court, it appears, is better at reading the election returns than some elected politicians. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200306.gz"

These guys only had, it appears, AK-47s, and you had immense amount of firepower. Surely the possibility of the immense amount of information they could have given coalition forces, not to mention the trials that they could have been put on for war crimes, held out a much greater possibility of victory for you if you could have surrounded that house and just sat there until they came out, even if they were prepared to keep shooting.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200307.gz"

"138553"	"it"	"appears"	" In his first work of fiction since ``Disgrace,'' Coetzee creates a formidable, even charismatic stand-in: a writer so dedicated to her work that she suggests ``one of those large cats that pause as they eviscerate their victim and, across the torn-open belly, give you a cold yellow stare.'' If she is not precisely lovable, Elizabeth is still admirably fierce. Yet this book delves its way into her deepest doubts, culminating in a theatrical denouement teased out of Elizabeth's own affinity for the Kafkaesque. She is ultimately forced to explain her own writerly principles, includingbeth Costello'' proves improbably inviting at the simple narrative level. Coetzee punctuates each episode with some glimpse behind Elizabeth's sturdy armor and with her comically withering observations of those around her. ``We have so much catching up to do!'' exclaims a colleague, prompting Elizabeth to think: ``In his lexicon, it appears, catching up means talking about his own activities.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200310.gz"

But creating a clean and everlasting source of energy may be simple compared to figuring out where to build the reactor.

The lineup is fluid, depending on developments. Presently planned are:  IRAQ-ELECT (Baghdad, Iraq) -- Ledeall on the Iraqi election. By Dexter Filkins.  IRAQ-ELECT-BAGHDAD (Baghdad, Iraq) -- The scene in Baghdad on election day. By Dexter Filkins.  IRAQ-ELECT-SCENE (Baghdad, Iraq) -- The scene on the streets of Baghdad. By John F. Burns.  IRAQ-ELECT-ASSESS (Baghdad, Iraq) -- News analysis of the Iraq election, particularly as it related to the insurgency. By John F. Burns.  IRAQ-ELECT-MOSUL (Mosul, Iraq) -- The scene in Mosul: Kurds turn out to vote but find no voting materials. By Christine Hauser.  IRAQ-ELECT-NAJAF (Najaf, Iraq) -- The scene in Najaf. By Edward Wong.  IRAQ-ELECT-BUSH (Washington) -- President Bush speaks about the election, claiming a victory. By David E. Sanger.  IRAQ-ELECT-PRESS (Amman, Jordan) -- The reaction of the Arab press. By Hassan M. Fattah.  MIDEAST (Jerusalem) -- Israel is prepared to hand over security control of several West Bank cities to the Palestinians in the next few days, Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz said on Sunday, in the latest sign of increasing cooperation between the two sides. By Greg Myre.  IRAQ-AUDIT (Undated) -- An audit shows irregularities in spending on Iraq. By Erik Eckholm.  IRAQ-U.N.-OIL (Undated) -- Developments in the oil-for-food case. By Julia Preston and Judith Miller.  CHINA-MISSING-GIRLS (Anxi, China) -- For farming families in the lush mountains of coastal Fujian Province, the famous crop is oolong tea and the favorite source of labor is sons. There is such a glut of boys here -- roughly 134 are born for every 100 girls -- that the imbalance has forced an unlikely response from the Chinese government. To convince more families to have girls, it has decided in some cases to pay families that already have daughters. By Jim Yardley.  CANADA-GAY-MARRIAGE (Toronto) -- The Roman Catholic Church has opened a major campaign to defeat a bill to legalize same-sex marriage across the country, which the government says will be introduced in early February when a deeply divided Parliament reconvenes. By Clifford Krauss.  BRAZIL-MILITARY-ABUSES (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) -- Incriminating documents supposedly incinerated years ago by the government have suddenly reappeared. As a result, Brazil is being forced to confront one of the most distasteful aspects of its past: the death, disappearance or torture of political prisoners during 21 years of military dictatorship. By Larry Rohter.  NETHERLANDS-MUSLIMS (Paris) -- Can angry young Muslims dictate what is and is not acceptable in the traditionally open-minded world of Dutch arts? In the past few weeks, it appears, the answer has been yes. By Marlise Simons.  TURKEY-POLITICS (Istanbul, Turkey) -- After a raucous session of name-calling and a chair-throwing melee that had to be broken up by riot police, the country's main opposition leader beat back a challenge by reformers on Sunday and was re-elected as the leader of the Republican People's Party. By Susan Sachs.  IRELAND-ROADS (Tara, Ireland) -- Ancient England may have Stonehenge, but ancient Ireland has the Hill of Tara. The 6,000-year-old sacred site in the middle of quiet rolling fields is revered here as the burial place of 140 kings, and as the formative birthplace of this land's national identity. Modern Ireland also has Dublin, whose burgeoning metropolitan area is home to about 1.5 million people out of Ireland's population of close to 4 million. The city's growing sprawl is causing a clash that is affecting the entire country, as lovers of the mythical and prehistoric Ireland try to preserve the placidity of Tara against the needs of local residents struggling to commute to the capital on antiquated and inadequate roads. By Brian Lavery.  IRAQ-COPTER-VICTIMS (Kailua, Hawaii) -- Portraits of the 37 American troops who were killed in Iraq on Wedsday, the deadliest day for Americans since the United States invaded Iraq 22 months ago.

Now, the centers say they have discovered a powerful new tool: ultrasounds. Over the last 18 months, Christian anti-abortion activists on the national and local level have started major fund-raising campaigns to outfit centers with ultrasound equipment. By Neela Banerjee.  JACKSON-TRIAL (Santa Maria, Calif.) -- Fourteen months after a small army of sheriff's deputies laid siege to Michael Jackson's Neverland ranch seeking evidence of the entertainer's suspected lewd acts with a 13-year-old cancer patient, California's latest and greatest celebrity show trial is set to begin Monday with the first stages of jury selection. By John M. Broder.  NUKE-WASTE (Undated) -- Nuclear energy advocates are backing away from the assertion that the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository would have to open before anyone could order a new power reactor, as completion looks later and less certain, and the prospect for new reactors improves. By Matthew L. Wald.  DEMS-PREBUTTLE (Washington) -- With President Bush scheduled to deliver his State of the Union address on Wednesday, Democratic leaders in Congress are planning a pre-emptive strike of their own on Monday, challenging Bush on his policy in Iraq and plans for Social Security. In a prebuttal to the presidential address, Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada is set to urge the president to use Sunday's elections as an opportunity to change course in Iraq and come clean with the American public by presenting a coherent plan for what lies ahead in Iraq. By Carl Hulse.  KERRY (Washington) -- Sen. John Kerry appears on NBC's Meet the Press. By Adam Nagourney.  WHITEHOUSE-LETTER (Washington) -- The White House letter. By Elisabeth Bumiller.

There is such a glut of boys here -- roughly 134 are born for every 100 girls -- that the imbalance has forced an unlikely response from the Chinese government. To convince more families to have girls, it has decided in some cases to pay families that already have daughters. By Jim Yardley.  CANADA-GAY-MARRIAGE (Toronto) -- The Roman Catholic Church has opened a major campaign to defeat a bill to legalize same-sex marriage across the country, which the government says will be introduced in early February when a deeply divided Parliament reconvenes. By Clifford Krauss.  BRAZIL-MILITARY-ABUSES (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) -- Incriminating documents supposedly incinerated years ago by the government have suddenly reappeared. As a result, Brazil is being forced to confront one of the most distasteful aspects of its past: the death, disappearance or torture of political prisoners during 21 years of military dictatorship. By Larry Rohter.  NETHERLANDS-MUSLIMS (Paris) -- Can angry young Muslims dictate what is and is not acceptable in the traditionally open-minded world of Dutch arts? In the past few weeks, it appears, the answer has been yes. By Marlise Simons.  IRELAND-ROADS (Tara, Ireland) -- Ancient England may have Stonehenge, but ancient Ireland has the Hill of Tara. The 6,000-year-old sacred site in the middle of quiet rolling fields is revered here as the burial place of 140 kings, and as the formative birthplace of this land's national identity. Modern Ireland also has Dublin, whose burgeoning metropolitan area is home to about 1.5 million people out of Ireland's population of close to 4 million. The city's growing sprawl is causing a clash that is affecting the entire country, as lovers of the mythical and prehistoric Ireland try to preserve the placidity of Tara against the needs of local residents struggling to commute to the capital on antiquated and inadequate roads. By Brian Lavery.  NATIONAL  (Coded a)  IRAQ-COPTER-VICTIMS (Kailua, Hawaii) -- Portraits of the 37 American troops who were killed in Iraq on Wednesday, the deadliest day for Americans since the United States invaded Iraq 22 months ago. By Dean E. Murphy and Sarah Kershaw.  NUKE-WASTE (Undated) -- Nuclear energy advocates are backing away from the assertion that the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository would have to open before anyone could order a new power reactor, as completion looks later and less certain, and the prospect for new reactors improves. By Matthew L. Wald.  FINANCIAL  (Coded f)  FED-RATES (Undated) -- The Fed will almost certainly raise rates another quarter-point on Wednesday. But will it hint about faster-than-expected rate hikes down the road? By Edmund L. Andrews.  GOOGLE-YAHOO (Undated) -- Google sits securely atop the search market, but Yahoo is making significant gains, particularly in the United States. By Saul Hansell.  DVD-WORLD-SALES (Undated) -- There's another windfall coming to Hollywood courtesy of the DVD: foreign sales. But the studios would rather not discuss it. By Ross Johnson.

E-COMMERCE-COLUMN (Undated) -- United will be among the first airlines to offer travel agents a new means of booking flights over the Web, and the airline will give agents financial incentives to avoid the more expensive traditional reservation systems. The technology companies behind the new Web booking services could take significant market share from so-called GDS companies like Saber. By Bob Tedeschi.  IBM-LENOVO (Undated) -- On its face, IBM's planned sale of its personal computer business to Lenovo of China for $1.75 billion hardly seems a deal that would prompt a national security investigation by the Bush administration. Most IBM personal computers are now produced in China. Like other PCs, the IBM machines are powered by Intel microprocessors and are assembled with chips and parts made around the world, though mainly in East Asia. But the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a multiagency group, will carry out a formal investigation, which is expected to last 45 days, people close to the inquiry have confirmed. By Steve Lohr.  P&amp;G-GILLETTE (Undated) -- Madison Avenue is responding to the planned acquisition of Gillette by Procter &amp; Gamble with a mix of anxiety and eagerness. By Stuart Elliott.  MOVIES-AD-COLUMN (Undated) -- Now that the nominees for the 77th annual Academy Awards have been announced, it is time to consider a category that also deserves its due: best product in a leading role. By Stuart Elliott.  FORD-EPA-DIESEL (Ann Arbor, Mich.) -- The Environmental Protection Agency has developed a prototype diesel engine that meets tough new emissions standards to be phased in over the next few years in the United States. On Friday, Ford Motor Co. said it had reached agreement with the agency to try to develop it for use in its cars and trucks. By Danny Hakim.  RUMBO-PAPERS-MEDIA (San Antonio) -- In one of the most closely watched experiments in the publishing industry, the Rumbo newspaper chain has started four Spanish-language daily newspapers in Texas in the past year, starting in San Antonio before going to Houston, Austin and the Rio Grande Valley. By Simon Romero.  DISNEY-BOOK-MEDIA (Orlando, Fla.) -- Analysts and investors gathering at the Walt Disney World resort here on Monday for Walt Disney Co.'s annual conference will be buzzing about DisneyWar: The Battle for the Magic Kingdom, a new book written by James B. Stewart and said to have sections highly critical of Disney's outgoing chief executive, Michael D. Eisner. By Laura M. Holson and Lorne Manley.  MEDIA-TALK (Undated) -- A new magazine is marketed to plastic surgery patients. Guess who advertises?; Stan Lee's former collaborators react to his windfall settlement with Marvel; In the latest example of a Hollywood trend, Kevin Connolly is trying to dump his manager -- and his 10 percent commission -- just as he makes it big.  HURLEYBURLY (Undated) -- The 1998 film version of David Rabe's Hurlyburly may be one of the all-time bad movies made from an all-time good play. But that misbegotten film now serves an unexpected purpose. Updated from Rabe's 1984 work and chock-full of cell phones, the movie highlights how shrewd it was for the exhilarating new off-Broadway production to keep the play where it started: in the cocaine-fueled Hollywood of the '80s. By Caryn James.  WENDY-DONIGER (Undated) -- Wendy Doniger is one of the foremost scholars of Hindu mythology, the author, editor or translator of 20 books, and a professor with multiple appointments at the University of Chicago, where she has taught since 1978. By Edward Rothstein.  EASTWOOD-CRITICISM (Los Angeles) -- When the Clint Eastwood film Million Dollar Baby first came out, critics praised the film for its subtle power, moving performances and the quiet confidence of its director. But not wanting to give away its ending, few mentioned that a controversial social issue was buried in its plot. Now that it has been nominated for seven Oscars, social activists and conservative commentators have emerged to criticize the film, which they say sends a message advocating assisted suicide. By Sharon Waxman.  SUNDANCE-NOTEBOOK (Park City, Utah) -- A Critic's Notebook wrapping up the Sundance Festival. By A.O. Scott.  SHAKESPEARE-MILITARY (Queenstown, Md.) -- For the last two years, the U.S. Air Force has contracted with Movers &amp; Shakespeares, a company run by Kenneth L. Adelman, a Republican political consultant who is probably best known as having been President Ronald Reagan's chief adviser on arms control. Adelman and his wife, Carol, also a Reagan administration veteran, are amateur Shakespeare scholars and Shakespeare lovers, and they have marshaled their avocation and their high-level contacts into a management-training business.

CHINA-ARTS (Washington) -- As it races toward a more market-driven economy, China is building new theaters, concert halls and museums nearly as fast as it is erecting Western-style shopping malls, hotels and business complexes. But after a half century of the arts being supported exclusively by the government, many arts organizations are on their own to develop financing, programming and audiences. A cadre of nascent Chinese arts executives spent the past two weeks at the Kennedy Center, getting an intense immersion in how the nonprofit arts operate. By Lynette Clemetson.  SMITHS-MUSICAL-REVIEW (London) -- The Smiths -- a band from Manchester, England, whose singer and lyricist, Morrissey, taught a generation-wide cult how to mope with melodramatic self-consciousness -- are getting a West End treatment in Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others, a music-theater piece based on Smiths songs. The Smiths' lyrics were proudly defenseless and unguarded, yet the staging doesn't wrap them in obvious scenarios. The show is an allusive, surreal, ever-mutating fantasia on love and sex, family and control, violence and death. By Jon Pareles.  MCCARTHY-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) -- No Country for Old Men, by Cormac McCarthy. Reviewed by Michiko Kakutani.

FRANCE-OPERA-FEST (Aix-en-Provence, France) -- Before this month's Aix-en-Provence Festival, the buzz centered on Patrice Chereau's Cosi Fan Tutte, his first venture into opera in 11 years. Mozart's works have been the focus of this festival since it was founded in the late 1940s, and usually two of his operas are presented each season in the open-air courtyard of the former Archbishop's Palace here. This year, the other is La Clemenza di Tito, directed by Lukas Hemleb, with Paul Daniel conducting the Mahler Chamber Orchestra. By Alan Riding.  ARTS-BRIEFLY (Undated) -- News and notes from the world of arts and entertainment.  ONLINE-MAPS (San Francisco) -- In the last few weeks, both Google and Yahoo published documentation making it significantly easier for programmers to link virtually any kind of Internet data to Web-based maps and, in Google's case, satellite imagery. Later this summer, Microsoft plans to introduce a competing service, Virtual Earth, with software that programmers will be able to use in similarly creative ways. So far the uses have been noncommercial. But Yahoo, Google and Microsoft are creating the services with the expectation that they will become a focal point in one of the next significant growth areas in Internet advertising: contextual advertisements tied to specific locations. By John Markoff.  HOLLYWOOD-CHRISTIANS (Los Angeles) -- Mainstream Hollywood, after decades of ignoring the pious, or occasionally defying them, is adjusting to what it perceives to be a rising religiosity in American culture. Producers, directors, studio executives and marketing specialists have been looking to either mollify or entice an audience that made its power felt with last year's Passion of the Christ. That film, along with the empowerment of a Christian conservative bloc after the last presidential election, helped change attitudes and practices in an industry usually known for its secularism. By Sharon Waxman.  MARTHA-COMEBACK (Undated) -- By attempting a corporate comeback while still serving out her felony sentence, Martha Stewart is in uncharted territory. And so, it appears, is her company's stock. While many media executives are lamenting investors' lack of enthusiasm for their companies' shares, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia has been on a tear. Its stock price has nearly tripled in the last year, a period during which the Standard &amp; Poor's media index has gone sideways. By Richard Siklos.  CARR-COLUMN (Undated) -- Two strivers came together in a room in July of 2003. One was a former body builder turned actor who wanted to be king, at least of California, and the other was a former CPA who has refashioned himself into a media mogul. Each had something the other wanted, although it could be argued that David Pecker, the chief executive of American Media Inc. needed Arnold Schwarzenegger more.

TERROR-FICTION (Undated) -- The author of Incendiary, a novel about a fictitious London bombing that was released July 7, goes online to ask what he should do with his book now. By Tom Zeller Jr.  POTTER-PUBLISHER (Paris) -- This is the magical summer season when Hogwarts students loll on vacation and Bloomsbury Publishing's chief executive, Nigel Newton, hunkers down in his 18th-century Soho Square offices in London to monitor sales of the sixth installment of the Harry Potter epic. By the end of this year, analysts expect that Bloomsbury will have amassed sizable resources to allow the publishing house to press onward with its global expansion and to search for new writers. By Doreen Carvajal.  DATA-AD-COLUMN (Undated) -- Over the last few years, financial services and technology companies have been quietly tweaking their advertising to incorporate themes about the safety of customers' data. But in the wake of recent crises, that message has shifted from the background to center stage. By Eric Dash.  GLF-WIE-MARKETING (Undated) -- Michelle Wie came in 23rd at the U.S. Women's Open last month, behind other personable young golfers. Wie failed to survive elimination in the PGA Tour's John Deere Classic this month and fell short in her attempt to qualify for the Masters tournament next year. Yet Wie, 15, is the golfer that sports marketers have their eyes on. By Louise Story.  The late supervisor is Dan Berman (e-mail, bermand@nytimes.com.)

KURDS-MISCREANTS (Erbil, Iraq) -- Each night at 10 p.m., all eyes in Kurdistan have been on a sadistic gay sheik and a band of miscreants that he says he led through a series of crimes so grotesque that people speak of them with their voices lowered. By James Glanz.  MEXICO-NEWSPAPER (Oaxaca, Mexico) -- For 28 days, a couple of dozen editors, reporters and other employees of a newspaper here have been besieged in their newsroom as the result of a labor dispute with a union that has close ties to the government and claims to represent the newspaper's workers.

With the governor on hand and thousands in the pews, Lakewood opened a new sanctuary this weekend: an arena that was once the home for the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association. The church, which was established in 1959 in an abandoned feed store, recently became the first in the United States to average more than 30,000 worshippers weekly. By John Leland.  IRAQ-BOY (Washington) -- Ayad Al-Sirowiy came to America this week hoping doctors here could remove the war embedded in his face. Thirteen years old, small and skinny, Ayad was severely burned and blinded in one eye when a cluster bomb blew up in his face at the beginning of the Iraq war. By Jeffrey Gettleman.

By David Cay Johnston.  CLIMATE-CHANGE-DISPUTE (Undated) -- A rare public dispute has flared between two Republican House committee chairmen over an inquiry one of them began last month into the integrity of an influential study of global temperature trends. The study, published in 1998 and 1999, meshed data from modern thermometers and indirect evidence of past warmth or cold, such as variations in tree rings. The result was a curve with a distinctive hockey stick shape showing little variation for nearly 1,000 years and then a sharp upward hook (the blade) in recent decades. The resulting hockey stick curve has since become a familiar icon used in efforts to curtail emissions of greenhouse gases linked to global warming.

But Republicans close to the White House said that people had it reversed. Mrs. Bush, they said, was not so much nudging her husband as reflecting his thinking. By Elisabeth Bumiller.

"159721"	"it"	"appears"	" What it is about, I strongly believe, is The Times' failure to train properly and monitor regularly. All Times bylines now must be considered suspect because behind them are human beings who, it appears, all too soon ally themselves with the people in power (governmental, political, corporate). </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"159959"	"it"	"appears"	" Brian J. Walsh, the lawmaker's spokesman, said, All this plea agreement shows is that Scanlon had a deliberate, secret and well-concealed scheme to defraud many people and, it appears, unfortunately, that Rep. Ney was one of the many people defrauded. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"160689"	"it"	"appears"	" Cox News Service LUFKIN, Texas -- Jesus Christ isn't a Republican or a Democrat. The Son of God certainly isn't a politician. Religious holidays shouldn't have liberal or conservative connotations, but, it appears, they just might. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"161448"	"it"	"appears"	" Julie Myers will now head Immigration and Customs Enforcement, qualified mainly, it appears, as wife of former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and niece of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"161689"	"it"	"appears"	" While the Internet offers a banquet of romance-related technologies, from ubiquitous dating Web sites to advice bloggers to programs that will store pertinent information about the women in mens' lives, GirlFriendX, it appears, is the first to tie it all together. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"161738"	"it"	"appears"	" Step one, it appears, is treating faculty as colleagues. Is the man mad, or what? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"162092"	"it"	"appears"	" Real wages are one of the best arbiters of how people are doing financially. Driving those wages down, it appears, are inflation, and the absence of serious upward pressure on wages in most industries, especially those that employ the lowest earners. The number of both high- and low-wage jobs have grown, but there is not much mobility between the two. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"163151"	"it"	"appears"	" Today, though, the gender gap -- that men lean right and women lean left -- has become a political truism, and a series of new studies suggests that gender plays an even bigger role in politics than many believed. Having a son tends to make parents more conservative, it appears, while a daughter makes them more liberal. The parental has become the political. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"163502"	"it"	"appears"	" No one, it appears, mapped a strategy to break the news to Congress that the country where two Sept. 11 attackers were born would soon be running ports here -- an obvious political thicket, even if it posed no real security risk. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"163783"	"it"	"appears"	" But it has long been evident that this was nonsense, and a lawsuit by The Associated Press has now demonstrated the truth in shameful detail. The suit compelled the release of records from hearings for some of the 760 or so men who have been imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay. (About 490 are still there.) Far too many show no signs of being a threat to American national security. Some, it appears, did nothing at all. And they have no way to get a fair hearing because Gitmo was created outside the law. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164256"	"it"	"appears"	" Strangely enough, Pankin found that the most efficient lineup (assuming Reyes led off, an inevitability) featured Lo Duca second, then Delgado, Wright, Cliff Floyd and then Beltran; the worst had Wright batting second and Beltran third. (Even allowing Beltran to improve from last year's disappointing New York debut did not change matters much.) The reason, it appears, comes in how managers gear their lineups toward first-inning potency, at the expense of later innings. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164546"	"it"	"appears"	" On city streets, too, trends in scruff have reached new levels of unruliness, a backlash, some beard enthusiasts say, against the heightened grooming expectations that were unleashed with the rise of metrosexuality as a cultural trend. Men both straight and gay, it appears, want to feel rough and manly. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164547"	"it"	"appears"	" On city streets, too, trends in scruff have reached new levels of unruliness, a backlash, some beard enthusiasts say, against the heightened grooming expectations that were unleashed with the rise of metrosexuality as a cultural trend. Men both straight and gay, it appears, want to feel rough and manly. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164628"	"it"	"appears"	" This is a shameful exercise by two groups who, it appears, have bargained successfully in fat times, Bloch said. But in hard times the talk turns to nuclear options - shredding the labor agreement, eviscerating pensions, striking the company, and generally taking actions that challenge ... a 65-year relationship. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164669"	"it"	"appears"	" Polian was also upset, it appears, by Vanderjagt's subsequent appearance on Late Night with David Letterman , just four days after the botched kick. (Shame on Polian. If you're invited to go on the Letterman show, you go on the Letterman show.) </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"166740"	"it"	"appears"	" Still, it appears, many investors burned by the technology bust and accounting scandals at former market darlings like Enron and WorldCom have yet to regain their optimism and faith in the market. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"166757"	"it"	"appears"	" To some Iraqi politicians, it appears, the prospect of civil war seems less terrifying than the prospect of compromise over who will control the vital security ministries: defense, interior and national security. Among them, these ministries control the Army, the police and the prisons. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"166964"	"it"	"appears"	" The brief era of good feelings, it appears, is over. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"167065"	"it"	"appears"	" Another problem is that no light could enter the cloaking device, so a spy could not see out of it. Harry Potter can don his cloak and the lurk the halls of Hogwarts, spying on whomever he wants. Not to mention the fact that the scientists' cloaking device would be a solid object instead of a supple cloak that can be folded up and hidden in a pocket. Scientists are doing their best, but Harry Potter, it appears, still has the upper hand. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"167773"	"it"	"appears"	" The purpose of this first meeting, it appears, was for al-Rahman to be told of al-Zarqawi's exact location and that it would be safe to go there. Until that time, it is unlikely that al-Rahman even knew where al-Zarqawi was. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"167792"	"it"	"appears"	" The purpose of this first meeting, it appears, was for al-Rahman to be told of al-Zarqawi's exact location and that it would be safe to go there. Until that time, it is unlikely that al-Rahman even knew where al-Zarqawi was. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"167891"	"it"	"appears"	" With options practices under the microscope, it has become clearer why the Silicon Valley protests grew so histrionic as the expensing requirement neared. Some of these executives, it appears, had far more to lose than investors could possibly know. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060616.0286 type=story > <HEADLINE> COLE FAMILIES, SENATOR CLASH OVER SKIPPER'S FATE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WASHINGTON </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"168139"	"it"	"appears"	" The U.S. hopes for a World Cup, and possibly a golden era in American soccer, came to an end at Frankenstadion, where Ghana made history with a 2-1 victory in a Group E finale, advancing to the second round at the expense of the U.S. It was the final game, it appears, for Reyna, possibly for forward Brian McBride, we'll see about goalkeeper Kasey Keller, and, just maybe, Bruce Arena. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"168457"	"it"	"appears"	" The hot media news while I was away in Italy, it appears, was a series of celebrity send-offs. The biggest circus involved the departure of Star Jones from The View. The media obsession in Italy during the same period was the World Cup. Between the two, only one brought screaming fans into the streets. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"
"169429"	"it"	"appears"	" Junior Seau tried to do it Monday night by returning to retire as a Charger. His three years in Miami, it appears, never happened. (Statistically, you can argue that for the past two seasons, he had a point). The rest of the league retired Seau in March, when no one signed him after he was released from the Dolphins; it was high time the Chargers got around to noticing. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"170398"	"it"	"appears"	" Shinnick, it appears, was a victim of the classic Nigerian 419 scam, adapted in this case to sucker in unwary Craigslist users. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"170538"	"it"	"appears"	" What should networks do if these shows don't work? The answer, it appears, will be the Web. At worst, a network should be able to put a bow on a canceled series. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"171011"	"it"	"appears"	" -- Most Bible courses in Texas are taught by teachers who have no academic training in biblical, religious or theological studies and, it appears, little familiarity with separation of church-state issues. Some districts bring in local clergy to teach their Bible courses and fund them with private money. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171450"	"it"	"appears"	" And the truth, it appears, may be worse than anyone in this sleepy, conservative corner of western Michigan ever imagined. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171605"	"it"	"appears"	" Markov wrote novels and plays that displeased the hard-line Communist president of Bulgaria, Todor Zhivkov, and in 1969 he defected to the West, eventually ending up in England doing commentary for the BBC and Radio Free Europe. The Bulgarian Communist machine, it appears, had a long memory and a long reach to go with it: While waiting for a bus on a London bridge in September 1978, Markov felt a sting on his thigh. He guessed what had happened -- he had been injected with a poison pellet -- but had trouble convincing doctors that the illness he quickly developed was not a mere flu. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172253"	"it"	"appears"	" That didn't happen on the first play of the season, as Brady called out a protection that had Dillon releasing to the right side. The correct call, it appears, would have had Dillon staying in to block. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172387"	"it"	"appears"	" Now, it appears, Roche will not be able to sell its drug to Fresenius, which represents about 35 percent of the U.S. dialysis market. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172608"	"it"	"appears"	" The right, it appears, does not have a similarly exhaustive guide to corporate political donations, although the BuyBlue site could be nearly as handy to a Republican as to a Democrat. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172902"	"it"	"appears"	" Now, it appears, the road to college football's national championship will run through the Big East. On Thursday night, No. 3 West Virginia plays at No. 5 Louisville in a conference meeting of unbeaten teams that will help position the winner to play for the Division I-A title. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173034"	"it"	"appears"	" Bush and many in Congress remain steadfastly opposed -- still convinced, it appears, that calamity can be avoided on the cheap. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173355"	"it"	"appears"	" Harold, it appears, is next. You have to die, Hoffman's prof tells him. It's her masterpiece. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173528"	"she"	"appears"	" That leaves us with O'Hara, whose Marilyn, a virtual unknown after nearly 30 years in show business, initially feigns nonchalance about the buzz. As she makes the rounds of talk shows, stroked and goaded by one talking head after another, you observe her seduction by the insatiable monster of television celebrity journalism. In her final act of obeisance to the system, she appears, drastically made over and destroyed, her lips plumped, her face stretched into an expressionless mask of desperate ambition. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"

For the latest photos and graphics from The New York Times, go to www.nytimages.com.  CULTURE AND ENTERTAINMENT (e code)  WILSON-MUSIC-REVIEW (New York) -- Review of Brian Wilson and Pet Sounds, a 40th anniversary celebration at the Beacon Theater. By Ben Ratliff.

SUNDANCE-FILM-FEST (Undated) -- Sorting out the Sundance Film Festival schedule, to be announced on Wednesday. By David M. Halbfinger.  RUSSIA-BOOK-PRIZE (Moscow) -- To help put itself back on the world literary map, Russia is instituting a big new book prize that it is calling, helpfully, the Big Book Prize. It promises to be the second most lucrative book prize in the world, and 14 Russian authors are vying for it. The winner will be announced in a gala ceremony Wednesday evening in Moscow. By Sophia Kishkovsky.  VISITORS-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) -- Permanent Visitors by Kevin Moffett (University of Iowa Press) and Things Kept, Things Left Behind by Jim Tomlinson (University of Iowa Press). By S. Kirk Walsh.  HOUSE AND HOME (l code)  DIGITAL-HOME-SAFETY (Undated -- Home sweet home is becoming, finally, home smart home. The family group is becoming the family network: computers and appliances and services are shared and distributed through the house. Nesting has become digital nesting, as Americans bring the world home to work and play. But it is not home safe home. People know to lock their doors and close the blinds, but most, security experts agree, haven't developed the same habits in the rapidly expanding digital world at home. By William L. Hamilton.  With photo.  With:  DIGITAL-HOME-PROTECT (Undated) --Tips on protecting your home from a hacker's attack. William L. Hamilton.  JAGGER-STYLE (Atlantic, N.J.) -- In an era of music careers created in the democratic nowhere of MySpace, where the members of hot bands dress as if they were office temps, the days of the rock show as spectacle and the rock star as circus star are unquestionably numbered. Yet arena rock still has a certifiable god in Mick Jagger. And, as the Rolling Stones blew through Atlantic City last week on the last leg of its Bigger Band tour, Jagger gave a performance that was a master class in the school of rock style. By Guy Trebay.  With photo.  FASHION-FORMAL (Undated) -- Fashion, it appears, is in the throes of one of its inevitable mood swings, the years of casual, sketchily improvised party dressing giving way to a more formal look. The days of jeans and a dressy top are long gone, said Lela Rose, a young Texan whose tent dresses and pinafores seem conceived for steel magnolias. This is a much more feminine time. By Ruth La Ferla.  BOTULISM-REGULATE (Undated) -- A Florida couple who went to a doctor for Botox in 2004 and instead received injections of botulinum toxin, the deadly bacteria that cause botulism, may have received almost 3,000 times the lethal dose of the toxin, according to a report published this week in The Journal of the American Medical Association. The couple survived. The report said regulators should tighten the rules surrounding sales of this toxin to prevent it from happening again. By Natasha Singer.  WORKPLACE-BLUNDERS (Undated) -- Nancy Pelosi, speaker-elect of the House of Representatives, did something last week that plenty of working Americans have done: She made a blunder on the job. Pelosi is certainly not about to lose the job she (almost) has. Even though she is one of the country's most powerful leaders, and the politics of her workplace are on a different scale than those of most offices, her predicament has parallels to the lives of everyday executives who fumble a big opportunity. But when anyone, be it a public figure or private citizen, suffers a political setback in the workplace, can he or she ever really recover? By Stephanie Rosenbloom.  With photo.  ONLINE-SHOPPING (Undated) -- Michelle Slatalla in search of ways to organize her home office.  For information and repeats call the News Service at (888) 346-9867 or (212) 556-1927.

"173737"	"it"	"appears"	" Fashion, it appears, is in the throes of one of its inevitable mood swings, the years of casual, sketchily improvised party dressing giving way to a perceptibly more formal look.

"174375"	"it"	"appears"	" The other American service member who became a casualty of the Vietnam War that day - a day when, it appears, there was no combat action in which any U.S. troops died - was Harry Richard Sine Jr., who had been in country for all of two weeks. He'd been drafted and assigned to the Americal Division, an infantry force that operated along South Vietnam's central coast. He was 20, from Rivesville, W.Va., and was married.
