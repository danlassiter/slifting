"95190"	"he"	"assures"	" Ice Hotel employment seems sort of cool, too. ``The only part I wasn't thrilled about was waking the guests in the morning with their complimentary cups of warm fruit drink,'' Lansky says. But, he assures, ``This duty was easily offset by a few of the perks, such as acting as a judge for a corporate drink-mixing contest for the Absolut Vodka executives from Estonia.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"
"126269"	"he"	"assures"	" Apparently the FDA's Sept. 5 censure of Allergan, the Botox maker, has not dissuaded anybody. The agency claimed the company misled the public with a $50 million ad campaign that implies its product is the miracle cosmetic Ponce de Leon died trying to find.

"143731"	"he"	"assures"	" Two hours into the three-hour trip, still no orcas, but we're not complaining. Capt. Jim points out a difference between porpoises and dolphins -- porpoises have flat, spade-shaped teeth, dolphins have conical-shaped ones. He tells us about the three pods of orcas, the black-and-white marked whales that return annually to the San Juans, and the gray whales and humpbacks that sometimes swim by. The resident orcas are salmon eaters, he assures, though transient orcas have been known to munch on sea lions, seals, porpoises and dolphins. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
