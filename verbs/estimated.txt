Inventories swelled so rapidly, according to Friday's Commerce Department report, that analysts scrambled to scale back forecasts of business activity for the first half of 1995.   ``That big inventory number is the 400-pound gorilla that is jumping all over first quarter growth,'' said James Annable of the First National Bank of Chicago. ``The slowdown in this economy is here.''   The latest figures, which also showed slackening inflation, combined with other recent reports of idled automobile plants and lackluster retail and home sales to suggest that the economy might throttle back to its supposed sustainable growth pace of 2.5 percent as early as spring.   WASHINGTON (NYT) -- In an extroadinary session with the National Rifle Association, House Speaker Newt Gingrich said he would block any premature attempt by the gun lobby to repeal last year's ban on assault weapons.   But members who favor an immediate repeal left the door open Friday for some unspecified action to overturn the ban sooner rather than later. One possible route would be to include the ban with various pieces of the crime bill as they are being hammered out between House and Senate negotiators.   The Speaker and other Republican leaders said they were prepared to consider the repeal in May, once the House finishes voting on the Contract With America. But they are adamant that bringing up the divisive issue now would only distract the House from its main job of voting on the 10 items on the Republican agena before the Congressional recess in April.   WASHINGTON (NYT) -- Hours after the balanced-budget movement rolled its Constitutional amendment, juggernaut-fashion, through the House, the Senate served notice Friday that it does not intend to provide such a smooth path for the measure.   At a news conference, four Senate Democratic leaders who have long called for an amendment broadly hinted that their support is in jeopardy unless the Senate's Republican majority agrees to produce a detailed budget-balancing plan as part of an amendment package.   They backed up their demand with a letter to Majority Leader Bob Dole urging a start on bipartisan budget legislation charting a path to erase the Federal deficit by 2002, the earliest an amendment would take effect.   Forty-one Democrats signed the letter -- the minimum number, perhaps coincidentally, that is required to maintain a filibuster under Senate rules.   PITTSBURGH (NYT) -- The National Transportation Safety Board ended a week of hearings Friday into the crash of USAir flight 427, with assurances from the board that it will crack the case, but also with contradictory assertions by the parties about what could have caused plane to go down last Sept. 8, killing all 132 people aboard.   Boeing said there was no evidence that of problems with the mechanical systems of airplane, a 737-300, despite a consensus that the rudder somehow swung hard to the left and stayed there.   The Air Line Pilots Association said it wasn't the crew, which appears from the limited data available to have followed procedures to the end. And the airline said it wasn't the maintenance or training.   But all parties agreed that they had to find an answer.   ``Everybody involved can't stand to walk away and say, `undetermined,''' said Robert C. Oaks, a recently-retired Air Force General who became USAir's safety chief two months ago. The investigation has already cost millions of dollars, he estimated, but would continue.   ``People are dedicated, not by pressure, not by force, but by professional inclination,'' said Gen. Oaks, the third to last of 30 witnesses, who testified Friday morning.   WASHINGTON (NYT) -- The House Majority Leader, Rep. Dick Armey, set off a controversy on Capitol Hill Friday when he used a sexually derogatory term in reference to Rep. Barney Frank, a homosexual member of Congress.   Before the day was over, Armey had apologized to the Massachusetts Democrat for referring to him as ``Barney fag,'' but not without taking to the floor to lambast the media for reporting the remark, which he had tried to squelch, and blowing out of proportion what he called a mistaken mispronunciation of Frank's name.   Occurring in a week when political tensions in Congress were on the rise, Democrats seized on the remark and took to the microphones to denounce it as indicative of the Republicans' strategy of divisiveness.   For his part, Frank was clearly upset but very reserved in his reaction. He said he accepted Armey's suggestion that it was a slip of the tongue, but that the incident was another example of the ``meanness'' of the new Republican majority.   ``But I could not accept that it was wholly accidental,'' Frank said after listening to a tape of the interview. ``... I just had to believe that it was somewhere in the back of his mind.''   Armey was discussing his forthcoming book on freedom, which is to be released in April, when he launched into a discussion about all the controversy over Speaker Newt Gingrich's book advance.   ``Newt's a very patient fellow and able to handle a harangue going on around him better than I,'' Armey said. ``I like peace and quiet and I don't have to listen to Barney fag -- Barney Frank haranguing in my ear because I made a few bucks of a book I worked on.''  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950127.0212 type=story > <HEADLINE> AGASSI CONQUERS KRICKSTEIN IN BIZARRE SEMIFINAL </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> MELBOURNE, Australia  (BC-TEN-AUSTRALIAN-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"

ATTN) BEVERLY SILLS TO NARRATE `GYPSY BARON' WORST-BOSS CONTEST BRINGS FLOOD OF ENTRIES MATH TEACHER TAKES FORMER STUDENTS ON CRUISE (lb) c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  NEW YORK _ Beverly Sills is going back on stage _ but this time to talk, not to sing. She will narrate the concert version of Johann Strauss' operetta ``The Gypsy Baron'' during the New York Philharmonic's ``Mostly Vienna'' series on July 13, 14 and 15.  The operetta's cast _ which will sing in German, while Miss Sills delivers her narration in English _ will be the soprano Julia Migenes, the mezzo-soprano Rosalind Elias, the tenor Stanford Olsen and the bass-baritone Jan Opalach.  Miss Sills maintains that her stint as a narrator is a one-time thing. ``I thought it would be fun to put on a pretty dress and some makeup again,'' she said. ``I am not getting paid for this. Just because my price is right doesn't mean that I'm going to be available for every engagement that comes along.''  ``The Gypsy Baron'' will be another milestone for the Philharmonic's music director, Kurt Masur: In four seasons with the orchestra, he has never conducted an opera in concert with the Philharmonic.  Miss Sills said that her involvement began over a lunch with Masur at a Chinese restaurant. ``We talked and talked and talked,'' she said, ``and he got on the phone one day after that, and I thought he was going to invite me to lunch again, so I was ready to say yes to anything. Before I knew it, he slipped in `The Gypsy Baron.' ''  c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  Jim Miller has received 2,400 nominations for candidates for his third annual worst-boss-of-the-year contest. Miller, a co-author of ``The Corporate Coach'' (St. Martin's Press, 1993), set a June 30 deadline to choose the nation's best and worst bosses.  In the ``worst'' category, which draws about four times as many nominations as the ``best'' category, one boss thanked employees for a 92 percent increase in production not by handing out raises but by passing out moldy food and canned goods whose expiration dates had long passed. Another ordered his assistant to dismiss anyone who called in sick.  ``The contest has turned out to be therapeutic relief for people who are frustrated,'' said Miller, who runs BT Miller, a management consulting firm in Arlington, Texas. ``I've become the Dear Abby or Ann Landers of working conditions.''  Which category of boss does Miller fall into?  ``He's terrific,'' said his assistant Sharon Wells. ``I get paid every other Friday, but I'd say that regardless.''  c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  If 36 people board boat A at point B for a cruise in harbor C, what is going on?  Judith Engel, a mathematics teacher at the Bronx High School of Science, refrained from asking brain-teasers like that one yesterday. But she did take 36 friends and former students on a cruise around New York Harbor.  They boarded the Amberjack V _ which Ms. Engel had rented for the day, complete with captain and crew _ at Pier 17 at the South Street Seaport.  She said she organized the cruise to celebrate her friendship with the passengers she invited, former students from her 40 years at the school. ``My interview was June 12, 1955,'' Ms. Engel said. She was better at numbers than names that day: She called the principal by the mathematics chairman's name, but she still got the job.  Since then, she estimated, she has taught 5,000 students under five principals in three buildings. ``Because of her, I was a dual major in math and English,'' said one of the passengers, Barbara Nixon of Wilton, Conn., a corporate treasurer who began her career like Ms. Engel, as a math teacher.  ``There was an English teacher who scared the life out of us, but her classroom was relaxed and she was always willing to help you through a problem instead of saying, `You should have known that.'

In New York, Mayor Rudy Giuliani just quarterbacked a seven-day trial suspension of his city's 8.25 percent sales tax on clothing and shoes. The results were astounding. According to New York's Economic Development Corporation, apparel sales skyrocketed 94 percent during the one-week tax holiday. Eliminating the tax permanently, it estimated, would generate 17,000 new jobs.

Mancusi, the business editor of The Boston Globe, will join the Cambridge, Mass. office of Weber Shandwick as a senior vice president, the firm announced Tuesday.  Weber Shandwick, one of the world's largest public-relations firms, said Mancusi will assume the leadership of its New England corporate practice in late November.  ``We are deeply grateful for Peter's hard work and commitment to building a strong business section,'' said Martin Baron, the Globe's editor. ``We will move as quickly as possible to find a replacement. Distinguished business coverage is a high priority for the Globe.''  Mancusi, 48, has served in a variety of Globe positions since first joining the newspaper in 1979, including political editor and city editor. He left the Globe in 1993 to become a litigator at the Boston law firm Bingham McCutchen LLP, then known as Bingham Dana. Mancusi returned four years later to the business pages, becoming editor of the section in March 1999. During his tenure, he helped launch sections on technology and biotechnology.  ``The nearly four years I've spent editing the Globe's business section have been among the most rewarding of my career,'' Mancusi said. ``I'm going to miss the paper, and especially the people here. The good news, for me, is that I'm staying in Boston and getting the chance to work with a first-class operation like Weber Shandwick, helping to build their corporate practice.''  Mancusi, a Brookline resident, is a graduate of Northeastern University and Boston College Law School. He was also a John S. Knight journalism fellow at Stanford University.
