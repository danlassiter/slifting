"15774"	"we"	"held"	" Two decisions of this Court securely support the conclusion that the Eleventh Circuit lacked jurisdiction instantly to review the denial of the County Commission's summary judgment motion: Abney v. United States, 431 U. S. 651 (1977), and United States v. Stanley, 483 U. S. 669 (1987). In Abney, we permitted appeal before trial of an order denying a motion to dismiss an indictment on double jeopardy grounds. Immediate appeal of that ruling, we held, fit within the Cohen collateral order doctrine. 431 U. S., at 662. But we further held that the Court of Appeals lacked authority to review simultaneously the trial court's rejection of the defendant's challenge to the sufficiency of the indictment. Id., at 662-663. We explained: </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"
"15775"	"we"	"held"	" In Stanley, we similarly refused to allow expansion of the scope of an interlocutory appeal. That civil case involved an order certified by the trial court, and accepted by the appellate court, for immediate review pursuant to s1292(b). Immediate appellate review, we held, was limited to the certified order; issues presented by other, noncertified orders could not be considered simultaneously. 483 U. S., at 676-677. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"
"18495"	"we"	"held"	" Such has been the rule even when the parties to a sales contract specifically contemplated interstate movement of the goods either immediately before, or after, the transfer of ownership. See, e.g., Wardair Canada Inc. v. Florida Dept. of Revenue, 477 U. S. 1 (1986) (upholding sales tax on airplane fuel); State Tax Comm'n of Utah v. Pacific States Cast Iron Pipe Co., 372 U. S. 605 (1963) (per curiam) (upholding tax on sale that contemplated purchaser's interstate shipment of goods immediately after sale). The sale, we held, was ``an activity which . . . is subject to the state taxing power'' so long as taxation did not ``discriminat(e)'' against or ``obstruc(t)'' interstate commerce, BerwindWhite, 309 U. S., at 58, and we found a sufficient safeguard against the risk of impermissible multiple taxation of a sale in the fact that it was consummated in only one State. As we put it in Berwind-White, a necessary condition for imposing the tax was the occurrence of ``a local activity, delivery of goods within the State upon their purchase for consumption.'' Ibid. So conceived, a sales tax on coal, for example, could not be repeated by other States, for the same coal was not imagined ever to be delivered in two States at once. Conversely, we held that a sales tax could not validly be imposed if the purchaser already had obtained title to the goods as they were shipped from outside the taxing State into the taxing State by common carrier. McLeod v. J. E. Dilworth Co., 322 U. S. 327 (1944). The out-ofstate seller in that case ``was through selling'' outside the taxing State. Id., at 330. In other words, the very conception of the common sales tax on goods, operating on the transfer of ownership and possession at a particular time and place, insulated the buyer from any threat of further taxation of the transaction. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"19765"	"we"	"held"	" The Court correctly notes, see ante, at 20, and n. 5, that our opinion in Sioux Nation prominently discussed precedents establishing Congress' power to waive the res judicata effect of judgments against the United States. We never suggested, however, that those precedents sufficed to overcome the separation-of-powers objections raised against the 1978 Act. Instead, we made extensive comments about the propriety of Congress' action that were as necessary to our holding then as they are salient to the Court's analysis today. In passing the 1978 Act, we held, Congress </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"25609"	"we"	"held"	" Sparf &AMP; Hansen, supra, the case on which the Government relies, had nothing to do with the issue before us here. The question there was whether the jury could be deprived of the power to determine, not only historical facts, not only mixed questions of fact and law, but pure questions of law in a criminal case. As the foregoing quotation from Justice Chase suggests, many thought the jury had such power. See generally Alschuler &AMP; Deiss, supra, at 902-916. We decided that it did not. In criminal cases, as in civil, we held, the judge must be permitted to instruct the jury on the law and to insist that the jury follow his instructions. 156 U. S., at 105-106. But our decision in no way undermined the historical and constitutionally guaranteed right of criminal defendants to demand that the jury decide guilt or innocence on every issue, which includes application of the law to the facts. To the contrary, Justice Harlan, writing for the Court, explained the many judicial assertions of the jury's right to determine both law and fact as expressions of ``the principle, that when the question is compounded of law and fact, a general verdict, ex necessitate, disposes of the case in hand, both as to law and fact.'' Id., at 90 (emphasis in original). He gave as an example the 1807 treason trial of Aaron Burr in which Chief Justice Marshall charged the jury that ```levying war is an act compounded of law and fact; of which the jury, aided by the court must judge. . . . (And) hav(ing) now heard the opinion of the court on the law of the case(,) (t)hey will apply that law to the facts, and will find a verdict of guilty or not guilty as their own consciences may direct.''' Id., at 67 (quoting 2 Burr's Trial 548, 550 (D. Robertson ed. 1875)) (emphasis in original). Other expressions of the same principle abound. See United States v. Battiste, 24 F. Cas. 1042, 1043 (No. 14,545) (CC Mass. 1835) (Story, J., sitting as Circuit Justice) (the jury's general verdict is ``necessarily compounded of (both) law and fact''). As Thayer wrote at the end of the 19th century: ``From the beginning . . . it was perceived that any general verdict, such as . . . not guilty, involved a conclusion of law, and that the jury did, in a sense, in such cases answer a question of law.'' Thayer, supra, at 253. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

Species often arise, he held, when barriers like mountains or deserts prevent the interbreeding of populations. In time, groups that become isolated drift apart genetically and physically to form new species, meaning that they are so dissimilar that they cannot successfully procreate. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"

"125653"	"he"	"held"	" In his book, ``Identity's Architect,'' Friedman describes Erikson arriving at a hospital populated with young, well-heeled patients. (The average age of an Austen Riggs patient dropped to 21 as the 1960s approached.) With increasing confidence, Erikson dispensed with psychiatric diagnoses such as``psychosis'' and ``borderline'', preferring to view his patients as negotiating a perilous but normal ``identity crisis'' on the threshhold of adulthood. The best a therapist could do, he held, was to build on a patient's strengths and, over a period of many years, if necessary, guide him or her through the shoals. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
