The goal seemed so simple: to immerse ourselves as much as possible in the grave, hard splendor of the island, as the redoubtable traveler Dorothy Carrington wrote in her 1971 meditation on the history and anthropology of Corsica, Granite Island. The problem, of course, was how to see it all and do it all in 11 days -- a challenge given the island's profusion of natural wonders. There were, we read, glorious pleasure ports, primordial mountain fastnesses, mysterious menhirs, a distinctive cuisine and wines that demanded respect. But the barriers seemed formidable.

, I suspect,	 The much-parodied French fascination with Lewis comes in large part, I suspect, from their habit of seeing Lewis' sweetly destructive naif as a representation of something essentially American, just as Americans sentimentally (and inaccurately) believe Maurice Chevalier to represent the French soul. But love him or hate him, Lewis has remained a prodigious form-giver for half a century, and this collection does him honor. An inveterate pack rat and self-documenter, Lewis has shared dozens of rare clips from his archives as supplements on these discs, most of which also include audio commentaries from Lewis (with the singer Steve Lawrence acting as his unlikely interlocutor). </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz

, she said,	 Lee, an author of the book, Sizing up the Senate: The Unequal Consequences of Equal Representation, said one difficulty was that larger states often gave up fighting over the money. Because the amounts involved mean much more to the smaller states, she said, they have a greater incentive to hold their ground. In Alaska, for example, the $54.9 million it received in first-responder grants in 2003 and 2004 is a small fraction of the $777.6 million awarded to California, the most populous state. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz

, they posited,	 Prescott divides his time between a teaching post at Arizona State University and a staff job at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, making him the first Nobel laureate employed by the Fed. From 1980 through 2003, he had served as an adviser to the Minneapolis bank while holding a regular job as a professor of economics at the University of Minnesota. Kydland has taught almost continuously at Carnegie Mellon since 1978, but is on leave this academic year at the University of California at Santa Barbara. There was one catch in their work that has riled a faction of the economics profession. The Prescott-Kydland finding assumed that demand was always at a high level. Everyone who wanted to work did so at the prevailing wage and all production could be sold at the existing market price. Supply, in effect, created its own demand. Thus, they posited, changes to the economy came not from fluctuations in demand, but from shocks. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz

In the meantime, Garson was arrested, but Ambrosio relied on Weinstein's report. Only after Gorelik's former wife asked him to pay her legal fees and submitted Siminovsky's bills did he find evidence of phone calls that bolstered his suspicions, said Patricia A.

But, he said, the politics leading up to that will be intricate and unhurried because many -- including himself -- who generally oppose the Sharon government nevertheless support evacuating settlements and disengaging from the Palestinians until Israelis perceive there is a Palestinian leadership willing to negotiate peace. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz

It's about this team always being my team and this always being my game, Brandi Chastain said about her life in soccer during a telephone interview Sunday before the U.S. women's national team beat New Zealand, 6-0, in Cincinnati. The game was the fourth in a 10-game tour celebrating the team's gold medal at the Olympics in Athens.  Chastain is the author of a seminal moment in women's soccer, when she ripped off her jersey, revealing a black sports bra, after scoring the decisive penalty kick in the United States' victory over China to win the 1999 Women's World Cup at a sold-out Rose Bowl. Now she is the co-author of a book, It's Not About the Bra, with Gloria Averbuch, which will be released Tuesday. (Coincidentally, one of Averbuch's daughters, Yael, is a member of the U.S. under-19 women's national team, which will play in the world championships next month in Thailand.)  The book tells part of the story of women's soccer through the eyes of one of its most recognizable players, who, like some of her Brazilian opponents, has become known to millions of girls by only her first name. Her longtime teammate Mia Hamm is often perceived as reserved, but Chastain, 36, has long been recognized as a boisterous and exuberant California girl.  The subtitle of the book is How to Play Hard, Play Fair, and Put the Fun Back into Competitive Sports, and Chastain offers the parents and the coaches of young players sensible advice, advice that was so often forgotten as youth soccer exploded on the American landscape.  The game of soccer was a vehicle for me, she said. My parents were incredible. They only wanted me to have fun. I have stood on the podium at some amazing tournaments, and you can't put a price on those things. But what I think is so great about team sports is that you get to deal with loss and pain, because that is what life's all about. Nothing ever goes perfectly.  And what happened to that bra?  Initially someone offered a lot of money for it, more money than I had at the time, she said. I never thought it would be worth something, but I also didn't want people to think the whole thing was a gimmick, that is wasn't spontaneous, because it was. Right now, it's in a drawer at home, and I pull it out when I haven't done the laundry in a while.  WORLD CUP  Impressive Victory for U.S. Men's Team  A veteran U.S. men's team played perhaps its best game since the 2002 World Cup with a savvy and dominating performance Saturday night in El Salvador. The 2-0 victory was only the fourth by an American men's team in 15 World Cup qualifiers played in Central America (the other three were in Honduras).  Striker Eddie Johnson tallied his first international goal at the senior level. He was a late substitute for Brian McBride, who scored the game's first goal. Landon Donovan, making his 56th appearance for the United States, wore the captain's armband for the first time because Claudio Reyna was injured.  A victory Wednesday night against Panama in Washington would send the United States to the final round of qualifying in the CONCACAF region. Three teams will automatically advance to the 2006 World Cup in Germany.  MLS  Real of the West  You can call them Al, as in re-AL, like that team from Spain. Major League Soccer's new team in Utah was named Real Salt Lake over the weekend, and its chief executive, Dave Checketts, said the club would have some kind of relationship with Real Madrid but provided no details.  SHIRT ON THEIR BACKS  The Dallas Burn, which next season will be known as F.C. Dallas 96, plans to wear jerseys similar to the horizontal hoops made famous by Glasgow Celtic of Scotland. MLS also announced a new sponsorship deal with Adidas last week worth about $150 million over 10 years to supply all 12 teams. The Burn players now wear jerseys made by Atletica, but that contract expires after this season. By 2006, all MLS teams will wear Adidas. Current contracts with New England (Umbro), the MetroStars (Nike), San Jose (Nike), Chicago (Puma) and Los Angeles (Nike) do not expire until after the 2005 season. D.C. United, Columbus and Kansas City already wear Adidas gear. Chivas USA and Real Salt Lake will join the list next year.  HONG RETIRES  Galaxy defender Hong Myung Bo, 35, of South Korea, announced he would retire after the season.  METROSTARS  Members of the New Yorkers, men who played in the recent Homeless World Cup in Sweden, were introduced at the MetroStars' game Saturday. The next homeless tournament will be in New York next summer.  PLAYOFFS  The league's schedule maker was incredibly prescient. In the Eastern Conference, Chicago is at New England; in the Western Conference, San Jose plays at Dallas on the last weekend of the regular season with the final playoff berth at stake in both conferences. The Fire and the defending league champion Earthquakes would each make the playoffs with a victory or a draw. Dallas can qualify with a victory. If New England wins, it will be tied with Chicago at 8-13-9 and 33 points, but the Revolution will move on with a 2-1-1 record in head-to-head play, the first tiebreaker.  HALL OF FAME  Michelle Akers, Paul Caligiuri, Michael Windischmann and Eric Wynalda were inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in Oneonta, N.Y., The MetroStars defeated the Chicago Fire, 2-0, in the Hall of Fame game on Monday. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20041012.0003 type=story > <HEADLINE> 'GAME DAY GUIDE' HELPS BIG 12 FANS ENJOY MORE THAN FOOTBALL </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> HOUSTON </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz

, she says,	 Lovebirds are the cover story of this slim magazine for pet-bird fanciers. The brightly colored, chattery little parrots are native to Africa and Madagascar. There are nine species, including the peach-faced lovebird, which offers more than 75 variations. (You may spot peach-faced lovebirds in Valley treetops; they escaped or were released and seem to be thriving in the urban wilds.) Owner and breeder Angel Garvin describes lovebirds as having the personality of a larger parrot with the activity level of a finch. Although lovebirds make wonderful pets, she says, They can be very aggressive. I believe they should be in a one-bird home, or a home with birds they were raised with. They should not be around small children or small pets that may incur the lovebird's jealousy. You'll also read about ways to break pet birds of the nasty habit of biting. Birds generally bite when they want to be left alone, and a key to avoiding nips is learning to read the bird's body language so you'll know when it's in the mood for solitude. Other pieces look at the Senegal dove, know for its peaceful ways and unusual laughlike cooing, and budgerigars, the colorful parakeets known as budgies. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
