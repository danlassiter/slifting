Wednesday night, Ms. Moore, now divorced from Huggins though still embroiled in litigation against him, opens in a production of Cole Porter's ``Anything Goes'' at Montclair State University in Upper Montclair, N.J. ``I'm just trying to survive and keep on going, and I'm much better,'' she said during a rehearsal break Tuesday. The show runs through Aug. 14.   At Montclair State, Ms. Moore is revisiting a happier past. She graduated from the university in 1966 and received an honorary doctorate there three years ago.   ``When I was a student here, it was a small state teachers' college; now it's a huge university,'' she said. ``To me, we've been on the same path, but separately, growing and staying in the same field. It's like I came home to Mommy.''   c.1994 N.Y.

Simpson were in rare agreement Tuesday, telling a court that Simpson's right to a fair trial could be compromised by the public disclosure of certain evidence and documents in the case.   Their comments came in response to a motion filed by news organizations, seeking access to photographs of the bodies of the two people Simpson has been accussed of killing -- his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald L. Goldman -- as well as conversations held in the judge's chambers.   The issue is important because with Simpson's trial scheduled to start in six weeks, prosecutors and defense lawyers are growing more sensitive to the possibility that potential jurors could develop unshakable perceptions based less on actual evidence in the case than media coverage.   In his remarks to Judge Lance A. Ito of the Los Angeles Superior Court, Robert L. Shapiro, Mr. Simpson's lead counsel, argued that the court ``must act as a sanctuary'' to insure that the weight of evidence is not exaggerated and that procedural issues do not shape public opinion.   WASHINGTON (NYT) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton says she had no illusions about how hard the struggle for universal health insurance would be. In a long and reflective session with reporters on the opening day of the health care debate, Mrs. Clinton argued that just reaching this moment was a victory in a bitter 60-year struggle.   ``I personally am thrilled to be where we are at this point,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``I think what's occurred in the last 18 months has been much more positive than negative.'' Moreover, she asserted, ``this is an issue that's not going to go away, no matter what happens.''   But the First Lady also argued that the struggle had underscored the difficulty in passing ambitious social legislation in the modern political era.   Not only did all the old ideological tensions come into play -- ``I see some of these signs about socialism that I think have been around since Social Security,'' she said -- but the administration and its allies have also been confronted with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of state-of-the-art lobbying. And, she said, they had to confront opponents who were whipping up much more than simple disagreement.   ``What I do not like and find regrettable is the amount of hatred being injected into our political system,'' she said, naming no names. ``This personal, vicious hared that for the time being is being aimed at the president and to a lesser extent myself is very dangerous to our political system. And those who are encouraging it should think long and hard.''   WASHINGTON (NYT) -- Senate and House lawmakers have agreed on a measure instructing the Clinton administration to seek the lifting of the arms embargo against the Bosnian government in October.   If the Security Council should fail to approve the measure within two weeks, American military forces would be barred from enforcing the arms ban.   The compromise measure, which was proposed by Sen. Sam Nunn and is attached to a bill authorizing military spending, is intended to stave off calls for an immediate lifting of the arms embargo while setting a deadline for action.   Clinton administration officials have said that they planned to seek a lifting of the arms embargo this fall if the Bosnian Serbs refused to go along with a peace settlement, but they objected to the deadline imposed by the congressional measure.   Still, some administration officials conceded that the measure could be a useful prod in dealing with Western European allies who are reluctant to take tough action against the Serbs should efforts to forge a peace settlement remain stymied.   (NYT) -- Abner J. Mikva, the chief judge of the Federal Court of Appeals here, has emerged as the probable successor to Lloyd N. Cutler as White House counsel, administration officials said Tuesday.   The officials said Mikva, who is 68 years old, is at the top of a short list of candidates for the job. They said he had indicated that he would be willing to accept the post, and said his appointment could be announced by the end of the week.   Mikva, a former member of Congress and the Illinois legislature, was appointed to the federal bench in 1979. If chosen by President Clinton as the new White House counsel, he would bring years of political and legal savvy to a staff that has been faulted for being short on both.   Cutler, the 76-year-old Democratic eminence who replaced Bernard W. Nussbaum in early March, has won general praise for helping the White House find its feet after months of battering over Whitewater. But Cutler agreed to take the job only on a temporary basis, and he intends to step down by the end of September, when the federal limit of 130 working days for such special appointments expires.   MIAMI (NYT) -- The Coast Guard Tuesday intercepted a group of 27 Cubans who fled their country after allegedly hijacking a government boat and killing a Cuban navy lieutenant, according to Cuban diplomats, who demanded that the United States bring the refugees to justice.   The Coast Guard Cutter Monhegan picked up the men, women and children 60 miles southwest of Key West, Fla., after the 50-foot cargo ship was spotted by volunteer civilian pilots who search the Florida Straits for Cuban refugees, said Petty Officer Jeff Hall, a Coast Guard spokesman in Miami. The Cubans were to be brought to Florida, but Tuesday evening it was not yet clear what would happen to the boat, which was taking on water, Hall said.   Nelson Guzman, first secretary of the Cuban Interest Section in Washington, said the vessel was a civilian ship that was being used by the military when the naval officer was killed and four sailors forced to jump overboard as the group took the boat and fled their country from the port of Mariel, just west of Havana, Monday afternoon.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19940809.0163 type=story > <HEADLINE> A DECISION ON A QUARTERBACK </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> BERLIN  (BC-FBN-GIANTS-450&AMP;ADD-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199408.gz"

Times News Service  When President Clinton designated 1.7 million acres of Utah red rock county as a national monument last month, he spoke of the need to preserve places of beauty and solitude.  It was a familiar refrain; on Earth Day (April 22), Clinton said that low-flying aircraft over national parks could ``mar the natural beauty of the parks and create significant noise problems as well.''  Before long, the Department of Transportation proposed regulations for reducing noise from sightseeing aircraft over Grand Canyon National Park, resulting in a shouting match between environmentalists and the air tour business.  Public hearings were held on the rules in Las Vegas and Scottsdale, Ariz., and the Federal Aviation Administration is expected to issue final regulations by year's end.  The proposals would extend the ban on air tours to 87 percent of the park from the current 45 percent, and would prohibit commercial sightseeing planes from operating over the allowable park areas from 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. during the summer season and 5 p.m. to 9 a.m. during the winter. There are no restrictions on flight times at present.  The proposals would also limit flights to about 70,000 a year, the same number the FAA said were flown over the park between Aug. 1, 1995, and July 30, 1996. Those flights carried 682,500 passengers, the agency said, resulting in $115.9 million in revenues for the air tour operators.  The United States Air Tour Association in Alexandria, Va., challenges those numbers. It said its 18 members flew 117,000 flights over Grand Canyon National Park last year, and carried about 800,000 of the park's 4.5 million annual visitors. Dan Anderson, the association president, said 20 percent of the passengers were physically challenged, and thus otherwise would see little of the park. Air tours, he asserted, actually protect the environment because ``they leave behind no trails, no trash and no footprints.''  On Oct. 3, the association voted to seek the removal of Federico Pena, the transportation secretary, saying that he catered to environmentalists at the expense of the air tour industry.  Bill Schulz, a spokesman for Secretary Pena, said, ``At President Clinton's direction, Secretary Pena has taken a balanced approach that has fully recognized the concerns of air operators while seeking to preserve the public's enjoyment of our country's most treasured national parks without excessive aircraft noise.''  The Grand Canyon proposals grew out of a National Park Service report to Congress in September 1994 that recommended revisions of the regulations of aircraft operating over Grand Canyon National Park, to restore and maintain quiet in the park. Now, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said last July, ``When the final rule is fully implemented, visitors will be able to experience the immense quiet that Maj. John Wesley Powell and his expedition found when they encountered the Grand Canyon over a hundred years ago.''  The Federal Aviation Administration estimated that the proposed regulations could cost the air tour industry as much as $6.6 million a year in projected lost revenue over the next 10 years. So it is not surprising that the U.S. Air Tour Association adamantly opposes most of what has been proposed, although it maintains its major objection involves flight safety.  According to Anderson, the attempt to maintain the current number of flights, in an ever-shrinking area in which air tours can operate, will compromise passenger safety. ``That plays well for environmental extremists,'' he said, ``who would use this proposal as a trap to selfishly reduce visitor access by air.''  In 1986, when the National Park Service tried its hand at managing air space in the Grand Canyon, Anderson said, 26 people were killed in a midair collision between a helicopter and a commercial sightseeing airplane. ``Since new regulations went into effect in 1988, which air tour operators helped design,'' he added, ``there has not been a single accident in that air space.''  Several sightseeing planes have crashed near the park in recent years, including 1989 and 1992 crashes that each killed 10 people. But those accidents, Anderson said, were outside the FAA-designated air space, and therefore are irrelevant to the question of whether the current regulations at Grand Canyon have improved safety.  Two years ago the Park Service told Congress that 95 percent of the visitors to Grand Canyon said air tours did not detract from their visit. And to address the concerns of visitors who did find the flights a distraction, the air tour association itself in 1993 asked the FAA to shift one of the main air routes to avoid flying over Hermit's Rest, a popular viewing spot for visitors on the ground.  Those who complain the loudest about the air tours, Anderson said, are ``the quite powerful environmental lobby'' and a handful of the 53,000 people who hike and take river trips in the park each year.  But Alston Chase, the former college philosophy professor at Ohio State University who has often been critical of National Park Service management, is not so sure. While there are arguments on both sides, he said, ``The Park Service does have the legitimate authority to decide what's appropriate, and in my opinion it's appropriate to severely restrict overflights. The sound of planes does intrude on the experience that most people go to the Grand Canyon to enjoy.''

Times News Service  Pan Am World Airways plans to adopt an unusual fare structure when it ends its introductory fares on Nov. 24.  Unlike many airlines that offer a variety of fares for travelers who book 21 days or 7 days before a flight, Pan Am's fares for each flight will rise as its planes fill up.  For example, fares between New York's Kennedy Airport and Miami will start at $99 one way. After a certain number of seats are sold, the fares will rise to $110, then to $132 and finally to $165. First-class fares are $231 one way.  Between New York and Los Angeles, one-way fares will start at $253, then rise to $319 and top out at $385. First-class fares are $495.  The fares are nonrefundable, but Pan Am, unlike many other airlines, does not charge a fee to change a flight. The airline also offers refundable tickets at significantly higher prices.  The introductory fares, which are in effect until Nov. 24, are $99 one way between New York and Miami, and $198 for first class. Between New York and Los Angeles, one-way fares are $199 for economy and $398 for first class.  Pan Am, (800) 359-7262, is using wide-body Airbus A-300 aircraft and will serve meals on its flights. The airline intends to expand its route network to include other major cities.  c. 1996 N.Y. Times News Service  Walt Disney World has borrowed from so many cultural sources that it has finally gotten around to one it put a dent into: the old-fashioned mid-Atlantic beach resort. Disney's Boardwalk, a waterfront village that recalls the mood at a 1930s ocean resort, opened Oct. 1 at Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Fla.  The village, on Crescent Lake, has two lodging choices: the Boardwalk Inn, a 378-room deluxe hotel with rates from $225 for two adults and two children, and Boardwalk Villas, a 532-unit time-share property, with rates from $210. They both feature striped awnings and balconies, fan-back wicker chairs, palms and (of course) a boardwalk. It's all designed to recall how it used to be at places like Atlantic City before casinos came along to woo back some of the people who were going to Florida theme parks on vacation.  Along the new boardwalk are restaurants (with ice cream, pizza, Mediterranean fare, seafood and steaks) a sports bar affiliated with ESPN, an old-time dance hall and a sing-along club.  Guests have free use of tennis courts and a croquet lawn; a health club is $7 a day or $20 a family for the entire stay, and a children's activity club is $4 an hour with a three-hour minimum. One pool, Luna Park, has a water slide and carousel bar, another is surrounded by water-spraying pachyderms (descendants, no doubt, of Lucy, the giant walk-in elephant along the Jersey Shore in Margate). Call (407) 934-7639.  c. 1996 N.Y. Times News Service  There are few things as grand, or as rare to see, as a ceremonial royal Thai barge, a long golden ribbon with its dragon figurehead, its ornate, canopied throne and its rows of red-clad oarsmen.  On Nov. 7, King Bhumibol Adulyadej will mark his 50th year on the throne with a procession of 52 barges manned by more than 2,000 oarsmen who have been drilling for months.  The barges will glide slowly down the Chao Praya River in Bangkok, past the Temple of the Emerald Buddha and the Grand Palace to the glittering Temple of Dawn where the king will present ceremonial robes to the monks.  It is a tradition that dates back hundreds of years, from the days when the king and queen raced each other down the river in separate barges to the chants of their oarsmen. Their subjects rooted for the queen because her victory would signal a plentiful harvest.  In the modern ceremony, the king and queen ride together, and in Thailand today, it is not so much the harvest as the level of foreign investment that affects their subjects' prosperity.  Visitors who are prepared to battle Thailand's legendary traffic jams should reserve tickets through the Tourism Authority of Thailand in New York at (212) 432-0433 or in Bangkok at (662) 226-0060 extension 144.

Times News Service  Walt Disney World has borrowed from so many cultural sources that it has finally gotten around to one it put a dent into: the old-fashioned mid-Atlantic beach resort. Disney's Boardwalk, a waterfront village that recalls the mood at a 1930s ocean resort, opened Oct. 1 at Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Fla.  The village, on Crescent Lake, has two lodging choices: the Boardwalk Inn, a 378-room deluxe hotel with rates from $225 for two adults and two children, and Boardwalk Villas, a 532-unit time-share property, with rates from $210. They both feature striped awnings and balconies, fan-back wicker chairs, palms and (of course) a boardwalk. It's all designed to recall how it used to be at places like Atlantic City before casinos came along to woo back some of the people who were going to Florida theme parks on vacation.  Along the new boardwalk are restaurants (with ice cream, pizza, Mediterranean fare, seafood and steaks) a sports bar affiliated with ESPN, an old-time dance hall and a sing-along club.  Guests have free use of tennis courts and a croquet lawn; a health club is $7 a day or $20 a family for the entire stay, and a children's activity club is $4 an hour with a three-hour minimum. One pool, Luna Park, has a water slide and carousel bar, another is surrounded by water-spraying pachyderms (descendants, no doubt, of Lucy, the giant walk-in elephant along the Jersey Shore in Margate). Call (407) 934-7639.  c. 1996 N.Y. Times News Service  There are few things as grand, or as rare to see, as a ceremonial royal Thai barge, a long golden ribbon with its dragon figurehead, its ornate, canopied throne and its rows of red-clad oarsmen.  On Nov. 7, King Bhumibol Adulyadej will mark his 50th year on the throne with a procession of 52 barges manned by more than 2,000 oarsmen who have been drilling for months.  The barges will glide slowly down the Chao Praya River in Bangkok, past the Temple of the Emerald Buddha and the Grand Palace to the glittering Temple of Dawn where the king will present ceremonial robes to the monks.  It is a tradition that dates back hundreds of years, from the days when the king and queen raced each other down the river in separate barges to the chants of their oarsmen. Their subjects rooted for the queen because her victory would signal a plentiful harvest.  In the modern ceremony, the king and queen ride together, and in Thailand today, it is not so much the harvest as the level of foreign investment that affects their subjects' prosperity.  Visitors who are prepared to battle Thailand's legendary traffic jams should reserve tickets through the Tourism Authority of Thailand in New York at (212) 432-0433 or in Bangkok at (662) 226-0060 extension 144. There will also be a dress rehearsal _ no king, but less traffic _ on Oct. 29. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19961020.0115 type=story > <HEADLINE> WHAT IN THE WORLD IS WITH `CARMEN SANDIEGO'? </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> BOSTON (BC-CARMEN-DIEGO-TV-ART-2TAKES-$ADV20-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"

"82369"	"he"	"asserted"	" Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform in Washington, which has long argued for more controls on immigration, criticized dual nationality as a sign of a reluctance on the part of immigrants to assimilate. All immigrants, he asserted, should naturalize and maintain allegiance only to the United States. ``We are of the view that you ought to get on board or get out,'' he said. ``At some point, you start looking like Rome, with an influx of alien hordes who never get on board.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"

"83664"	"he"	"asserted"	" Board member Jerry Falk said the station's new policy puts it ahead of PBS, which is in the process of revising its guidelines on fund- raising. He said the Mondavi controversy was one of public perception because, he asserted, the station had maintained editorial control all along. The policy, he said, will prevent similar cases in the future. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"83849"	"he"	"asserted"	" ``I think the last charter gave the council too much power,'' former Mayor Ed Koch declared.

DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. c.2002 New York Times News Service  Some of the dust has cleared in the closely watched governor's race in Pennsylvania. But there is still plenty of murk about the outcome.  Barbara Hafer, the state treasurer, pulled out of the contest for the Republican nomination last week, unable to gain much traction in the polls or compete in money raising after top party leaders backed Attorney General Mike Fisher. They had concluded that Fisher's more conservative political bent would be a bigger draw in November than Hafer's moderate bent, especially since she favored abortion rights.  Republicans need not worry about a costly, draining primary fight. But doubts linger as to whether Fisher has the political heft to win in November. Early in the campaign, party leaders were so worried about his ability to carry the day in the fall, as well as Hafer's ability, that they cast about for a third, stronger candidate, without success.  Now, though Hafer is gone, Fisher remains. The Republican leaders take little solace in the fact that the candidates vying for the Democratic nomination _ former Mayor Edward G. Rendell of Philadelphia and State Auditor General Robert P. Casey Jr. _ are mired in a primary fight that could be costly and draining. Both Democrats are regarded as good campaigners and money raisers, so Fisher most likely will have his work cut out whatever the outcome.  WRONG NAME MAY MAKE AD MORE EFFECTIVE  You can call him Gary.  Or you can call him George.  Whatever you call him, his name is Gary George, and he is a Wisconsin state senator. He hails from Milwaukee and is running for governor.  Problem is, on billboards in 13 cities across the state, he is ``George Gary for Governor.''  For this he paid $50,000.  Maybe more.  He'll find out come Election Day.  It might have been a real bargain _ if the flip-flopped name ends up generating a publicity windfall.  He says he is ``perplexed'' and swears he did not cook up the ``mistake'' to gain name recognition.  The billboard company, North Woods Advertising says it is ``trying to figure out'' how things got so backed around.  FLORIDA BLACKS UNITE TO CUT VOTE REJECTION  Black political leaders in Florida say that get-out-the-vote efforts significantly increased black turnout in the state on Election Day 2000. But they also note that predominantly black precincts had three times as many rejected ballots as mostly white precincts, and that those rejections helped elect George W. Bush.  So last week a number of the state's prominent blacks and civil rights organizations banded together on a drive to reduce the ballot rejection rate in future elections. They called a meeting of black voters in the Fort Lauderdale area _ the first of a number of similar meetings scheduled around the state _ and vowed to end disenfranchisement with education campaigns about voting procedures, voting machines and voting rights.  On Election Day 2000, they asserted, there were far too many instances in black precincts of voting list discrepancies, too many arbitrary disqualifications, too many faulty voting machines and ballots. But they declared that come future election days, especially in 2004, black voters would know what qualified as a genuine discrepancy, be able to recognize a phony disqualification and be adept at marking and casting ballots. Should they still have a polling place problem they cannot solve, they will be able to turn to friendly poll watchers for help.  The big lesson of Election Day 2000, said State Rep. Chris Smith, a Democrat, is that without vigilance, there can be elections when ``Election Day happens before Election Day.''  Among groups represented at the meeting, attended by some 800 people, were the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, the People for the American Way Foundation and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc.  LEGISLATORS STUDY SEXUAL HARASSMENT  Last summer, an unsigned memorandum was circulated in the offices of some state legislators in Columbia, S.C. It urged college-age legislative assistants to wear skimpy clothes.  The House speaker, Rep. David Wilkins of Greenville, was not amused. He ordered an investigation.  The memorandum's author was never found. But never mind. In the South Carolina legislature, it turns out, they get it. Or at least most do.  Last week, at the urging of Wilkins, 90 of the 124 members of the House attended a class designed to ``sensitize'' them on matters of sexual harassment. The teacher, Mary Snead, sent over by the state Human Affairs Commission, talked at length about what constituted harassment, putting special emphasis on offensive remarks and jokes. Then she offered up the ``Spouse Rule'' as a good safeguard.  ``Always ask yourself,'' she told her students, ``Would I make this comment if my spouse were standing next to me?'' After class, Wilkins sent word that he was very proud of the legislators who had attended. Earlier, similar classes were offered to House employees, pages and members of Gov. Jim Hodges' staff. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020112.0137 type=story > <HEADLINE> SACK OF FAVRE STIRS FEELINGS AND MEMORIES </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-FBN-NOTEBOOK-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"

"146053"	"he"	"asserted"	" SANTIAGO, Chile -- President Bush warned Saturday that Iran's reported move to accelerate its alleged nuclear weapons program is a very serious matter, and called on the Iranians to give up any nuclear ambitions they may have. Bush is here meeting with his counterparts from the 21-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, or APEC. Leaders discussed an array of global and regional issues, ranging from currency matters to how best to combat global terror and AIDS. Police and protesters clashed at several points across Santiago and at least three people were wounded by what was apparently stray gunfire. Of the thousands who turned out to demonstrate -- mostly peacefully -- some were opposed to the terms of global trade, for which APEC is a symbol to many. Others were protesting the visit of Bush and the Iraq war he ordered last year. Bush used the summit, his first overseas trip since winning re-election, to try to rally global partners around diplomatic efforts to address North Korean and Iranian nuclear aspirations, two strategic challenges he will face early in his second term. Bush said he was particularly concerned about reports that surfaced in recent days suggesting that Iran has accelerated a uranium enrichment process that could produce the raw material for nuclear bombs. Iran had said earlier it would voluntarily suspend its enrichment operations. It is days away from an international meeting to consider its actions. This is a very serious matter, the world knows it's a serious matter, and we're working together to solve this problem, Bush told reporters during a brief photo session following a one-on-one meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. Bush praised diplomatic efforts aimed at pressuring Iran by Britain, France and Germany. They do believe that Iran has got nuclear ambitions, as do we, as do many around the world, said Bush. In a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Bush asked for Moscow's support in pressing Iran. A senior administration official told reporters after the meeting that Putin had agreed to help maintain the pressure on Iran. They did agree that we needed to work to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, said the official, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity. (Optional add begins) Iranian officials claim the nuclear program is strictly for the production of electricity, a use that is allowed under the international Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, of which Iran is a signatory. Tehran's claims, however, have been dismissed by Bush, and a number of other world leaders remain skeptical that the oil-rich Persian Gulf power is pursuing nuclear power for purely civilian purposes. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the nuclear non-proliferation arm of the United Nations, meets Nov. 25 in Vienna to assess the situation. A bad report from the IAEA could set the stage for a U.N. Security Council debate over whether to impose sanctions against Iran. We are concerned about their desires, and we're concerned about reports that show that, prior to a certain international meeting, they're willing to speed up processing of materials that could lead to a nuclear weapon, Bush said. While he hasn't used the phrase recently, Bush grouped Iran, North Korea and pre-war Iraq together in what he called an axis of evil that threatened, he asserted, to put weapons of mass destruction in the hands of the sort of terror groups that attacked the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. (Optional add ends) Bush has sought a diplomatic solution to the issues with Iran--where Bush has watched Europeans take the diplomatic lead for the moment--and North Korea. There, Bush is working with leaders from Russia, China, Japan and South Korea through the so-called six-party talks--including the United States and North Korea. The talks have been stalled since June, however, and Bush used one-on-one meetings here Saturday with with Koizumi, Putin, Chinese President Hu Jintao and South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun to try to develop a common strategy for moving ahead. The six-party talks are, will be, the framework in which we continue to discuss the mutual goal we all have, which is to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons, said Bush. The leader of North Korea will hear a common voice. U.S. intelligence analysts believe North Korea may already have as many as eight nuclear weapons in its possession. Bush wants Pyongyang to dismantle the weapons, and facilities needed to make more, in exchange for a package of regional security agreements and economic aid. North Korea has said the United States must go further, providing a specific non-aggression pledge and the exchange of diplomatic liaison offices as a first step toward full diplomatic relations. Bush has said additional steps could be possible once North Korea dismantles its nuclear weapons program, a position North Korea has so far dismissed. It wasn't known how soon talks might be resumed. All five who are here are ready to go, said a second senior administration official who brief reporters on background. There's enough on the table for North Korea to show up and talk seriously about this. (Story can end here; optional add follows) Beyond nonproliferation concerns, Bush addressed a range of economic and other matters in a series of one-on-one meetings on the edges of the APEC summit. With the U.S. dollar plumbing record lows against the Euro and slumping against the Japanese yen, Bush told Koizumi he was committed to reducing the federal budget deficit, which hit a record $415 billion in the fiscal year that ended Oct. 1. Large deficits put downward pressure on the greenback by increasing foreign borrowing by the U.S. Treasury. I also explained to him (Koizumi) that my nation is committed to a strong dollar, Bush said, And I assured him that in my upcoming contacts in working with Congress, we'll work to reduce our short-term and long-term deficit. In his meeting with Putin, Bush voiced concern over recent moves to trim press freedoms and the authority of local governments across Russia, moves that have alarmed U.S. policymakers in recent months and have been taken as a sign of growing authoritarianism. Putin responded by treating Bush to a tutorial on Russian history - with special mention of the tactics used by Joseph Stalin - and explaining that Russia must chart a course from communist authoritarianism toward democracy in a way that reflects the country's unique culture and its torturous past. It wasn't clear that Bush fully embraced the explanation: an aide said the exchange would lead to further conversations to come. And in his meeting with Hu, Bush and the Chinese leader swapped invitations to visit each other's country, perhaps in the next year. Bush also nudged Hu over China's exchange rate - viewed by some analysts as being too inflexible to reflect the strength of China's economy. Hu said he was moving toward a more flexible approach, but no details were made public. In a speech to corporate leaders gathered on the edge of the APEC summit, Bush praised the political and economic strides the region has made over the past several decades, a time when nearly half of the organization's members have transitioned from authoritarianism to democracy. Twenty years ago when people thought about the Asia-Pacific region, they couldn't imagine such prosperity and such wealth, and such freedom, said Bush. With some 2.5 billion people, the APEC countries account for about half of global trade and a bit more than half of global economic output. (Story can end here; optional add follows) On a second track of nonproliferation diplomacy, Secretary of State Colin Powell left Santiago Saturday for the Middle East, where he was to huddle in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el Sheik for a meeting with his Persian Gulf counterparts. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss ways regional countries can try to prevent the flow of militants into Iraq, where many have joined the insurgency there, and otherwise pitch in to help Iraq move toward January elections. Iran was to be represented at the meeting, however, providing an opportunity, potentially at least, for face-to-face talks with Powell on the nuclear matter.
