They will move in the ``e'' entertainment news file. For questions, contact Stuart Levine at the Daily News, (818) 713-3696.  MILLER-NET (Los Angeles) _ Dennis Miller is cracking wise so fast and (literally) furiously that questions are lost to hilarious rants interrupted only by his characteristic giggle. The O.J. Simpson trial, the sorry state of ``Saturday Night Live,'' Hugh Grant's Hollywood peccadillo _ even his own attempts at acting _ nothing is too far off Miller's radar screen. For example, this is the way he describes his character in ``The Net,'' the Sandra Bullock computer thriller opening Friday: ``I'm like the expositional eunuch coming in the middle of the story. It allows her to vent all her paranoia. I nod, don't get (sex) and croak. That was my part. Bingo.'' And he says this of his performance in the role: ``I come in the first day and they go `You gotta croak today.' I go `Christ, what I'm going to do? So I just remember thinking to myself `Just shut your eyes and gurgle.' That was the operative word.'' By Janet Weeks.  MILLER-SIDE (Los Angeles) _ Dennis Miller seems to have an opinion on just about everything. And he's not afraid to share. By Janet Weeks.  NET-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``The Net'' is like a computer program that never quite does its tasks properly, but does them so fast that you're still breathlessly impressed. Three stars. By Bob Strauss.  SCACCHI-COUNTRY (Los Angeles) _ Greta Scacchi's most recent films have been a classic Russian play reset in the Australian Outback and a French historical drama directed by an American best-known for his English and Indian period pieces. For the highly cosmopolitan star of ``Country Life'' and ``Jefferson in Paris,'' none of it seemed very exotic. Born in Italy, raised in England and Australia, Scacchi made her first movie in India (James Ivory's ``Heat and Dust'') and has been continent-hopping ever since. It's left her with an adaptable, perceptive sensibility that's enabled her to play everything from an Icelandic artist marooned in Hollywood (Robert Altman's ``The Player'') to a British colonial acting naughty in Kenya (``White Mischief''). By Bob Strauss.  WATERWORLD-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ The bean counters at MCA-Universal will be debating for months to come whether ``Waterworld'' is worth $172 million. But for fans of Kevin Costner, futuristic action-adventure and/or spectacular production design, ``Waterworld'' is certainly worth the going price of a movie ticket. Three stars. By Yardena Arar.  DUMBO-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Disney is back in the Vietnam comedy business with ``Operation Dumbo Drop.'' The very absurdity of this _ Hollywood's most apple pie studio is the only one with enough guts to make fun of America's most controversial modern war _ almost dwarfs the rather large absurdity that the movie's about. Which is: how do a handful of U.S. soldiers deliver an elephant to a remote mountain village? Three stars. By Bob Strauss.  KIDS-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ They lie, they steal, they do drugs. They're violent and they have unprotected sex with little regard for the consequences _ and, for the boys, even less for their partners. The ``Kids'' in Larry Clark's debut feature are definitely not your run-of-the-mill movie adolescents. Wandering through Manhattan on a hot summer day, they exhibit all the morality and animal cunning of jungle predators; their language is crude and laced with obscenities, their focus on self-gratification all-consuming. Two stars. By Yardena Arar.  DOUBLE-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Born in Hong Kong and raised in Canada, ``Double Happiness' '' Jade Li has spent most of her 22 years trying to reconcile her family's traditional Chinese values with her own western-style dreams. Jade (Sandra Oh) buys hot buns filled with red beans for her loving, if demanding father (Stephen Chang) and dutifully allows herself to be fixed up with eligible Chinese professionals whom her parents see as husband material. However, her heart isn't in the mating ritual; what she really wants is to win an Academy Award. Three stars. By Yardena Arar.  COUNTRY-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Transferring Anton Chekhov's play ``Uncle Vanya'' from the Russian hinterlands to the Australian Outback doesn't sound like too much of a stretch. But the way Michael Blakemore does it with the film ``Country Life,'' the breaking point is reached pretty darn soon. The best thing to be said for stage veteran Blakemore's approach to the material is that it ain't pretentious. Played broad, theatrically and at a farcical pitch, the thing does become amusing once you get over what a travesty it all is. If you ever get over it, that is. Two stars. By Bob Strauss.  DOGS-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Tommie is a young, gay New Yorker. If you care at all about how he spent his summer vacation in Provincetown, Mass., then go see ``Lie Down With Dogs.'' Otherwise, take your entertainment dollar elsewhere. Cutesy and self-indulgent, this is an overgrown home movie that attempts little beyond an anecdotal portrait of the East Coast gay Riviera, and it's nowhere near as funny as writer-director-star Wally White seems to think it is. One star. By Yardena Arar.  HYSTERIA-THEATER (Los Angeles) _ It's a Freudian slip-up. Newly imported from England, Terry Johnson's Olivier Award-winning ``Hysteria,'' now being staged at the Mark Taper Forum, presumes to analyze the morphine-induced dreams of the father of pyschoanalysis himself, as he finally succumbs to his long battle with cancer. Yet while the play toys with some provocative ideas, it's mostly an indecipherable tangle of frantic psychodrama, self-conscious surrealism and infantile humor. One star. By Daryl H. Miller.  BOSTON-POPS (Los Angeles) _ Hard as it might be to imagine, new Boston Pops conductor Keith Lockhart is, at 35, the same age as Arthur Fiedler was when he took over the 110-year-old symphony orchestra. ``Everyone remembers him as a grandfatherly guy with white hair,'' said Lockhart, who wonders if he'll match the longevity of Fiedler's 50-year career conducting the Boston Pops, who perform at the Hollywood Bowl this weekend. By Diana Lundin.  TVCOLUMN-RICHMOND (Los Angeles) _ Weekend reviews of ``Black Fox,'' on CBS Friday night starring Christopher Reeve; ``Sahara,'' on Showtime Sunday night starring James Belushi; and ``The Real Deal,'' to be shown throughout the weekend on Comedy Central. By Ray Richmond.  POP-BEAT (Los Angeles) _ By Fred Shuster.  THEATER-BEAT (Los Angeles) _ By Janet Weeks.  CLASSICAL-BEAT (Los Angeles) _ By Lynette Rice.  ART-BEAT (Los Angeles) _ By Lori Moody.  KID-BEAT (Los Angeles) _ By Barbara Wood. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950727.0222 type=story > <HEADLINE> `DUMBO' FOUR TONS OF FUN THAT TREATS VIETNAM FAIRLY </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> LOS ANGELES (BC-DUMBO-REVIEW-LADN) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
