(Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  We have a dream destination and the opportunity to travel presents itself. Travel guide in hand, we're off to make a dream into a reality.  Unfortunately, sometimes travelers end up wishing they'd given as much care to picking a travel guide as to picking a destination.  Not every travel guide is right for every traveler, and having a bad one _ or one aimed at a different sort of traveler _ can greatly reduce the pleasure of your travel experience.  In choosing a guidebook, check around to find a series which speaks to your educational background and economic level. Once you find a series you like, however, be sure to check the specific guide you're interested in. Uniformity is elusive, and even a good series may have a few lemons.  The following list of suggestions omits Mobil and AAA, which aren't complete travel guides, and Let's Go and Berkeley, which are more for the backpacking set. Fielding's is also omitted because, at the time of this writing, the editorial staff was reorganizing. -0- Access  Access guides are for independent information fanatics who like to charge into a new city and discover an offbeat museum, a trendy wine bar or a local trattoria.  They're lightweight, with information organized in color-coded paragraphs _ blue for hotels, black for sights.  With bite-sized information bits that are readable, up-to-date and impeccably well-organized, Access guides have a logic and design superior to any other.  They're perfect for that weekend in New York or a business trip to Montreal. They don't supply in-depth knowledge, but they're relatively expensive. Think of them as tour guides whom you don't have to tip. Berlitz Travellers  The most literate guides on the market, flush with wit, irony and opinion.  Berlitz guides read like a letter to a friend about to embark on a trip: ``Eat here, try this little pension, avoid this tourist trap.''  Restaurant and hotel choices are often up-and-comers, as opposed to the usual suspects.  On the downside, Berlitz books must be read, not browsed, which may be too much work for some travelers. Birnbaum's  Birnbaum's has dropped a number of titles and emerged competitive once again. The remaining books excel in descriptions, as opposed to mere listings, and demonstrate the touch of someone who has actually been there.  User-friendly and clearly written, these guides are aimed at travelers who are curious about a culture and want to really explore it.  Heading to Europe for two weeks? Consider one of these for both planning and taking along. Blue Guides  If you're the type who goes for 14th-century chapels, stately country houses and ivy-clad monuments, the Blue Guides are the books for you.  Expertly written, they say absolutely nothing about the best places to eat or sleep, but are dense with historical minutiae. Half-dead Irish hamlets come to life with arcane bits of information. And the driving directions are admirable. Cadogan Guides  The heft of a novel, the comprehensiveness of an encyclopedia and a chatty style, courtesy of one or two authors at most.  Cadogan Guides are superb to take along, especially with a companion to read them aloud as you drive.  And armchair travelers will gain much from them as well. The selected accommodations always have a personal or unusual twist.  On the other hand, these are weighty tomes, not for browsers. Compass American Guides  Imagine a long, friendly essay about your state, written by your favorite local newspaper columnist and illustrated with superb color photographs.  That, in essence, is what Compass guides are all about. They'll hold you captive for an hour or so with their wonderful sense of place. Read them in January before going on that trip next July. Eyewitness Guides  ``The guides that show you what others only tell you'' is an accurate boast.  These 400-page paperbacks are packed with first-class photography, aerial and three-dimensional maps, eye-catching graphics and a comprehensible design.  What's more, they accommodate browsers and in-depth readers alike.  But while I'm seduced by these, it's fair to note that others find them short on information and more like a flashy CD-ROM than a book. Also, good paper stock leads to awkward weight and a $24.95 price tag. Fielding Worldwide  Fielding has been resuscitated under the guidance of publisher Robert Young Pelton, and the results are guides that are often sharp, energetic and savvy.  Fielding guides are especially good for cruises and the Caribbean, and make comparing cruise ships or islands a breeze. The detailed hotel listings are especially welcome.  Overall, Fielding gets my award for the most radically improved middle-of-the-road guidebook series. Fodor's  These are what you buy when there's nothing else on a particular destination. Their content and prose have improved radically, yet they're still rather dull.  That said, the newer guides, such as ``Sunday in San Francisco,'' show an increased hipness, and Fodor's Affordables are a good attempt at corralling over-30s with tips on reasonably priced hotels and restaurants.  As for Fodor's Exploring series, they're a poor man's Eyewitness Guides. They may cost a few bucks less, but it's like settling for a Pontiac when you could have a BMW. Frommer's  Frommer's aren't bad. But frankly, they're what I look at before buying something else.  There's too much descriptive filler and not enough opinion in these long-winded tomes, and the sightseeing details tend to be lousy. However, the hotel information is close to encyclopedic. Insight Guides  The ultimate armchair-traveler's guides. Superb photographs and good text make these must-reads for trip planners.  Don't even think of packing them, however. The weighty Insight Guides are great for clobbering would-be muggers, but short on specifics such as worthwhile restaurants and shops. In terms of hard facts, they're fanciful, and at times flat-out wrong.  But for firing up your imagination before a trip, they're like issues of National Geographic, with text written for intelligent adults. Knopf Guides  Pretty to look at and good for history buffs, these guides make a bid for the upscale travel market.  The photography is splendid, but the arch, slightly pretentious prose makes me think of Conde Nast Traveler.  So while they stand head and shoulders above many others, Knopf Guides are a little too high-minded for me. Lonely Planet  In South America and Asia, nearly every youthful traveler clutches a Lonely Planet like a fresh $100 bill sent from Dad.  This series sets the pace for budget travel and for Third World destinations. Its writers have slept in those ratty hotels with monkeys running overhead, and actually know how to avoid land mines in Laos.  The books also give you a real insider's perspective on a country, so use Lonely Planet guides even if you're staying at the Ritz.  But beware: They're short on in-depth sightseeing, and their western Europe selections are strictly for Deadheads on sabbatical. Michelin  Michelin Green Guides get you from the Louvre to the Luxembourg Gardens with an ample dose of French history and culture along the way. They're as dry as fine wine, but unbeatable when it comes to in-depth driving tours in France, Italy and Switzerland.  The Red Guides are strictly names, ranks and ratings of hotels and restaurants, based on Michelin inspectors' findings.  Indispensable if you're a gastronome who really knows something about the properties and the Michelin rating systems. Otherwise, they add up to an expensive, snobbish and useless investment.  To find a place to stay or eat, use Berlitz or Birnbaum's instead. Moon Handbooks  Perfect for the more adventurous, these are long on history, sightseeing and nitty-gritty information, and very price-specific.  Is there anything to complain about? Not much. Moon books are great for a couple spending a week in the Grand Canyon on foot or in a four-wheel-drive, or for an intrepid pair traveling for a month in Thailand. The Rough Guides  Rough Guides are written in England, which is both a blessing and a curse.  It's a blessing because English travel writers lob opinions like Scud missiles. If they don't like something, they'll trash it. On the other hand, the guides are geared toward the English, and the cultural gap can seem very wide at times.  Base your choice on destination. The more foreign the place, the better the Rough Guides are.

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Alan Alda in a scene from ``Jake's Women.'' By IAN SPELLING Distributed by New York Times Special Features  A couple of years ago Alan Alda stepped out onto a London stage to take his last curtain call for the Neil Simon play ``Jake's Women.'' Alda had played the lead in the California and New York productions of the show, earning a Tony Award nomination for his work.  As he took his final bow in London, the actor figured he was saying goodbye to Jake forever. What he didn't know was that his phone would ring one day with an offer to reprise the role in a TV movie based on the play.  ``I was thrilled when I heard they were going to do it for TV because I loved doing the play so much,'' Alda says from his car phone during a drive into Manhattan from his home on Long Island, N.Y. ``I remember that the cast and I would sit together in this dingy basement in the theater for about 30 or so minutes before the show, talking, getting up to speed on one another, inspiring each other to do our best, even if we'd come in not terribly inspired to go on.  ``When we got the chance to do it as a movie I thought, `This is great! I'll have another three months of enjoying doing this material.' If they do a CD-ROM of `Jake's Women,' I'll do that too.''  The movie, which will air March 3 on CBS, features Alda as Jake, a writer who overanalyzes everything, observes far too much and tends to slip into a fantasy world in which he plays out conversations with his sister Karen (Julie Kavner); his late wife Julie (Mira Sorvino); his current wife Maggie (Anne Archer); his therapist Edith (Joyce Van Patten); his daughter Molly (Ashley Peldon at 11; Kimberly Williams at 21); and his girlfriend Sheila (Lolita Davidovich).  When the frustrated-in-every-way Maggie asks for a trial separation, Jake buries himself even further into his daydreams. Many of his imaginary conversations are with Julie, whom he has never stopped loving. She eventually implores Jake to get on with his life.  ``The heart of the story is really Jake's struggle to understand what these women in his life are complaining about,'' Alda says. ``It's something I recognized about myself, and I think a lot of other men will realize it too.  ``Once you know what the complaints are, then trying to do something about them can become an interesting life's work. That's what I like about Neil's theme, and what I like about what he's done in the play and movie, which is to make this painful, fall-to-pieces situation funny.  ``Neil has always been able to do that well and I think that, for this one, he's taken some very personally painful moments from his life _ and probably from a lot of people's lives _ and given us the chance to see them in a funny light. That softens the blow a bit, but it's no less painful or powerful for that.''  Getting actors to come together for a movie can be a strange experience, Alda says, especially when those actors are portraying family members. The key is to create an instantaneous sense of family on the set, even if some of the players drop in only every few days to shoot a scene.  ``I had to make Julie my sister, Kimberly my daughter and Mira my beloved, dead wife,'' Alda explains. ``Fortunately, they were all such good actresses, it wasn't that hard.  ``Whenever we could, we did on the movie what we did with the cast from the stage show, which was sit around and talk. We'd go to lunch or we'd stay late and talk.  ``We all tried to get to know each other. In this case I almost had to do it one lady at a time because there were so few scenes with more than a few of us together at once.''  Once Alda had completed work on the TV movie, he resumed his role as the host of the three-year-old PBS science program ``Scientific American Frontiers.'' He also took on two film projects: ``Flirting with Disaster,'' which will be released in March, and a star-packed, still-untitled musical by Woody Allen, which has no scheduled release date.  ``Disaster,'' a comedy, was directed by young filmmaker David Russell, who earned critical acclaim for his controversial, low-budget debut film, ``Spanking the Monkey'' (1995).  ```Flirting With Disaster' turned out great,'' Alda says enthusiastically. ``It mainly concerns the efforts of Ben Stiller and his wife, played by Patricia Arquette, to find his real parents as soon as possible.  ``Mary Tyler Moore and George Segal have raised him, and Lily Tomlin and I are a pair of people who may or may not be his parents.''  In the Allen musical, Alda shares scenes with Tracey Ullman, Drew Barrymore and Goldie Hawn. The actor cracks up when asked about the character he plays and whether or not he sings in the film.  ``I play Drew Barrymore's father and, yes, I sing,'' he says. ``So that makes me, at one time, married to Tracey (who plays Barrymore's mother), even though I'm now married to Goldie Hawn.  ``We've finished the first go-round. Woody organizes his shoots so he can film it once and then go back and shoot a lot of it again.''  Alda's own directing endeavors got off to a most auspicious start with numerous episodes of his long-running TV series ``MASH'' (1972-83) and his feature-film debut, the hit 1981 comedy ``The Four Seasons.'' But after the critical and box-office indifference afforded ``Betsy's Wedding'' in 1990, Alda's directing career seemed to stall.  ``Honestly, it didn't stall,'' Alda says with a tinge of defensiveness. ``I just didn't want to direct anything for a while.  ``I think about it every once in a while. When I really want to, I'll go back to it. People keep sending me scripts and I occasionally think of things I might make, but until I really, really want to do something, I won't because I don't want to do something just to have my name on the movie screen.''  Alda, who recently turned 60, tries not to let work encroach too much on the time he spends with his wife of 39 years, Arlene, their three daughters and three grandchildren. Yet he plans to continue his career for many years to come.  Revealing that he is on his way into Manhattan today to accept a lifetime-achievement award from the Museum of Radio and Television, Alda stresses that there are still plenty of challenges ahead.  ``There's a lot I haven't done, actually,'' he says. ``You got me talking about directing, and I am looking forward to directing again, but I want it to be something that doesn't have to be a big commercial hit.  ``I'd love to do some sort of experimental film. What? How? I don't know. But it would be interesting to do something different.  ``It would be wonderful to do something people might not expect from me.'' c.1996 Ian Spelling  (Ian Spelling is a New York-based free-lance writer.)

Includes a photo of Edward Furlong in ``Terminator 2'' By CINDY PEARLMAN World rights except Chicago. (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Even by the unorthodox standards of teen-age actors, Edward Furlong has had a bizarre time of it the past five years.  Beginning at age 13, when he was plucked from obscurity _ and from the steps of a Pasadena, Calif., Boys Club _ to star in the megahit ``Terminator 2'' (1991), Furlong has soared to the top, stealing scenes from Arnold Schwarzenegger himself. But he has also endured flop films, a highly publicized court case against his mother, a controversy over his romantic involvement with an older woman and, of course, the expectation that his early success wouldn't last beyond puberty.  Somehow, however, Furlong seems to have made it through largely intact. He enjoys a reputation as one of the few current ``hot'' teen stars who can actually act. Moreover, in an interview at his New York hotel room, he seems surprisingly unspoiled. Thin and fragile-looking at 130 pounds, he looks every bit like what he is _ an apparently sweet kid who has lived a hard life but, at age 18, stands on the verge of a promising adulthood.  He still has the enthusiasms of the young, including a fascination with laser discs, which he prefers to VCR tapes. ``I'm so into discs, it's nuts,'' he says. One of his dreams came true with his earnings from ``Terminator 2,'' he adds: ``I was able to go out and buy myself a new sound system. With a laser-disc player. And a powerful woofer. It was like I was in heaven.''  But there's another side to this particular teen-ager. After all, on Feb. 23 he'll hit the multiplexes in ``Before &AMP; After,'' directed by Barbet Schroeder and co-starring two undeniable Hollywood heavyweights, Meryl Streep and Liam Neeson.  Based on the best-selling book by Rosellen Brown, ``Before &AMP; After'' is about a perfectly happy couple whose lives are shattered when their son is accused of murdering his girlfriend. Furlong has a particularly challenging role, spending a good portion of the movie completely mute.  ``First, the girl is discovered dead and I run. You know Harrison Ford is not the only fugitive now,'' Furlong jokes.  When he returns home, his father (Neeson) has freaked out and destroyed key, incriminating evidence found in his son's car trunk. His mother (Streep) is weeping and demands the truth.  Furlong's character responds by withdrawing.  ``I go mute for many scenes. I just won't talk,'' he says.  The acting challenge was formidable, Furlong says, but he didn't find it too difficult.  ``It's so intense. I've heard a lot of actors say it's really, really hard to give someone the total silent treatment in a scene. I actually found it to be pretty fun. Liam was amazed that I didn't once laugh. I didn't even crack a smile when the cameras were rolling.''  Dealing with his prestigious co-stars was another thing entirely.  ``Liam and Meryl are such great actors that it blows your mind,'' he says. ``I just kept thinking, `Edward, stick to the scene. Don't think about that it's Liam and Meryl.'  ``It was actually very exciting. I kept looking at Meryl and saying, `That is Meryl Streep. THE Meryl Streep.' Then there's Liam and I'm going, ```Schindler's List.''' Amazing. I was so stoked.  ``Now my friends ask if I was scared, and I say, `Not really.' I've been working with great actors so far. I worked with Arnold. Then there was Kathy Bates in `A Home of Our Own' (1993). It is more of an exciting feeling (to) meet these people than `Oh my God.'''  The turns his life has taken still amaze the actor. The day a casting agent saw him sitting on the steps of the Boys and Girls Club of Pasadena, Edward Walter Furlong was a shy, thin 13-year-old whose mother, Eleanor Torres, was experiencing a difficult period. At the time, Furlong was living with his aunt and uncle.  ``I'm sitting on those steps at the Boys Club and this woman kept smiling at me,'' he says. ``I remember thinking, `Who the heck is this woman?' So finally she came up to me and said, `Can I ask you a question?'  ``That sounded kind of serious, so I said, `What did I do?' She said, `You didn't do anything. I just wanted to know if you want to try out for a movie.' I said, `Wow, sure.' I couldn't believe it. It was pretty weird,'' he says.  Furlong went home that night and told his aunt and uncle that someone wanted him to try out for ``Terminator 2.'' ``I even said to them, `I don't know if this is legit. Maybe this woman just wants me for kiddie porn or something.'''  Nevertheless, Furlong went in to audition.  ``I wasn't really nervous. I just kept going on, reading this scene with the casting director and ad-libbing. Then they said to talk about myself. They asked me what kind of shoes I wear. I said, `I'd really like to wear Air Jordans, but I can't afford them.'''  Three more auditions later, he had the part.  ``The night I got the part, Jim (``Terminator 2'' director James Cameron) sent this box to my house with a note saying, `Welcome aboard.' Inside was a pair of Air Jordans. It was the same pair I wanted. It was really cool.''  The movie was a $200 million hit, and suddenly Furlong was in demand. His subsequent movies have included ``Pet Sematary II'' (1992), ``A Home of Their Own,'' ``American Heart'' (1993), ``Brainscan'' (1994) and, with Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon, the film version of Truman Capote's ``Grass Harp,'' scheduled for a May release.  But his family life was more troubled. A custody case between his mother and aunt ended with his mother regaining custody in 1993. Furlong responded by returning to court and finally being legally emancipated _ taking full control of his own affairs as a legal adult at age 15.  ``The big question everyone has is the money,'' he says. ``Who is in control of it? Well, I haven't gone nuts or anything. My stereo and my car (a Saab convertible) are the only two things I've splurged on. See, I'm thinking about the future.  ``I mean, who knows?'' he says. ``I could be like a lot of kid actors, who one day are doing movies and the next day are out robbing video stores. Who knows?''  Then there's the matter of Jackie Domac. The two first met on the set of ``Terminator 2,'' where Domac (then 29) was the 13-year-old's stand-in and then tutor. Furlong says the two became a couple three years later, and he moved in with her that year.  The two still live together, to all appearances very happily.  ``She is my first crush. I totally believe in love at first sight,'' he says.  As for their age difference, last year Furlong told Interview magazine, ``I think it's damn cool that I got a 29-year-old. But in terms of the generation thing, me and Jackie always sit down and talk about this. It's such a fragile subject, but at the same time you really can't help it when you love somebody.''  The two are often seen at Metallica concerts together, or hanging out at malls, where he sometimes is mobbed by teen girls who scream for ``Edward!''  ``It's amazing. Sometimes I can't even walk around or I'll get crushed. It's scary,'' he says. ``I've been chased through a subway system. Then the next day I was in McDonald's and I wasn't even recognized. This is a crazy business.''  Crazy, but apparently not unmanageable for a cool 18-year-old. Even the press furor over his private life doesn't faze Furlong, he says. Leaning back on the couch, he smiles.  ``I never did read much of it,'' he says. ``I don't care. I'm really happy now. I'm a happy guy.''  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.)
