Helena knows that people need faith, perhaps even a miracle. Nobody cares what's happening in Canada, she concedes, but that wire story about the quints has an irresistible angle: a modern-day Nativity for our troubled times. The circus begins.

"9918"	"he"	"concedes"	" Dr. Stephen McNees of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, who has tracked records of economic seers for years, says they do pretty well generally.

"14191"	"he"	"concedes"	" Bergsten envisions such a fund, along with a ``fundamental surveillance role for the IMF.''

"28084"	"he"	"concedes"	" Lin does have his heart set on a one-bedroom apartment. But he is willing to make some concessions. A budget of $250 a month for dating could be trimmed, he concedes, though ``roses every now and then would be nice.''

Brown Jr., shown, appears to be ready to deal with pot holes after a news conference. ``We're on the threshold of all our tomorrows,'' he said in his victory speech. Tom Campbell, a California State Senator and a moderate Republican, was elected to represent the state's 15th District in Congress, even though Democrats contend he is a ``Newt clone.''

Corrigan, a brash aviator who captured the imagination of a Depression-weary public when he took off from Brooklyn on a nonstop solo flight to Los Angeles and landed his improbable airplane in Dublin a day later, died on Saturday at a hospital in Orange, Calif. He was 88 and had been lionized for more than half a century as Wrong Way Corrigan.

The company's current renaissance began only after the Guccis were bought out by the Bahrain-based investment bank Investcorp. Years of family feuding had brought down the great dynasty. In October, Investcorp took Gucci public. The shares have since soared from the initial offering price of $22 to about $36, valuing the company at well over $2 billion. (Fred R.

While in New York on Wednesday, he said he will be more of a slugger Thursday night: ``I adjusted my style for this fight. Not only for Jesse James Leija, but for the fans.

Backed by its potential for growth and revenue, and with an increasing number of enthusiasts on the nation's slopes, snowboarding has gained widespread acceptance by ski areas that shunned it only 10 years ago. But nine major resorts and a handful of minor ones among the 520 or so ski areas in the United States continue to ban them, including Park City, Utah, which will stage the 2002 Olympic Winter Games.

Likewise, the flowing roofline, more reminiscent of a coupe than a sedan, gives the car a streamlined profile that is still readily recognizable as a Mercedes. The Mercedes SLK, below, a roadster for about $40,000, will arrive in early 1997.

(Jack Vartoogian/New York Times Photo)  (NYT4) UNDATED -- Dec. 13, 1995 -- HOME-IMPROVEMENT, 12-13 -- Time can take its toll on furniture, and even well-made pieces may need maintenance and repair. Repairs to valuable heirlooms or prized antiques should be left to professionals. Simple repairs can usually be tackled by the average do-it-yourselfer, but fashioning intricate parts, veneering or reupholstering may require the help of a professional. (Edward R.

In his new book, ``The New American Ghetto,'' photographer and sociologist Camilo Jose Vergara documents the deep human need to shape space. In Vergara's view, interior design has become an important anchor in neighborhoods where there is little that might be construed as a public realm. In such surroundings, he argues, interiors ``bring order and coherence and beauty.''

Zipkin, the New York socialite and confidante of Mrs. Reagan, died, the contents of his large Park Avenue apartment had to be sorted out for an upcoming Sotheby's Arcade auction. ``The deal was to clear out the apartment and leave it broom clean,'' says Michael Grogan, a Boston auctioneer who organized the cleanup. At the Holiday Inn in Dedham, Mass., on Dec. 2, treasure-hunters sift through items not consigned to friends or to Sotheby's.

In his new book, ``The New American Ghetto,'' photographer and sociologist Camilo Jose Vergara documents the deep human need to shape space. In Vergara's view, interior design has become an important anchor in neighborhoods where there is little that might be construed as a public realm. In such surroundings, he argues, interiors ``bring order and coherence and beauty.''

Brown Jr., shown, appears to be ready to deal with pot holes after a news conference. ``We're on the threshold of all our tomorrows,'' he said in his victory speech.

Corrigan, a brash aviator who captured the imagination of a Depression-weary public when he took off from Brooklyn on a nonstop solo flight to Los Angeles and landed his improbable airplane in Dublin a day later, died on Saturday at a hospital in Orange, Calif. He was 88 and had been lionized for more than half a century as Wrong Way Corrigan.

The company's current renaissance began only after the Guccis were bought out by the Bahrain-based investment bank Investcorp. Years of family feuding had brought down the great dynasty. In October, Investcorp took Gucci public. The shares have since soared from the initial offering price of $22 to about $36, valuing the company at well over $2 billion. (Fred R.

While in New York on Wednesday, he said he will be more of a slugger Thursday night: ``I adjusted my style for this fight. Not only for Jesse James Leija, but for the fans.

Backed by its potential for growth and revenue, and with an increasing number of enthusiasts on the nation's slopes, snowboarding has gained widespread acceptance by ski areas that shunned it only 10 years ago. But nine major resorts and a handful of minor ones among the 520 or so ski areas in the United States continue to ban them, including Park City, Utah, which will stage the 2002 Olympic Winter Games.

Likewise, the flowing roofline, more reminiscent of a coupe than a sedan, gives the car a streamlined profile that is still readily recognizable as a Mercedes. The Mercedes SLK, below, a roadster for about $40,000, will arrive in early 1997.

SPENDING  ABOUT-CARS-INFINITI-Q45-ART-NYT (Detroit) _ Shortly after my early test drive of the redesigned 1997 Infiniti Q45, a new advertising campaign began for the model, the flagship of Nissan's luxury-car division. ``Everything has changed, but the soul,'' the headline proclaimed.

"90432"	"he"	"concedes"	" It would be better, he concedes, if more countries would send several contenders. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"97226"	"he"	"concedes"	" It is not going to be easy, he concedes, as the Arab world is in a surly mood and the fight on terror has none of the clarity that rolling back the invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein of Iraq had for many Arabs. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"
"103694"	"she"	"concedes"	" It would be a lot easier, she concedes, to marry a rich friend and have no worries. ``But,'' Coutant Peyre adds, with a grin and a small, theatrical sigh, ``I am not in love with any of them.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"105282"	"he"	"concedes"	" It might already be too late for McGinest to change New England's mind about keeping him around next season, but there have been glimmers of his past dominance in recent weeks. His season was marred by the frustration of trying to return from back surgery. His recovery time was supposed to be quicker, less debilitating, but his physical limitations affected his abilities on the field. It has been in only the past month, he concedes, that he's begun to feel like his old self. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"107901"	"he"	"concedes"	" Yet, he concedes, the nationalists' argument for centuries-old neutrality still has a powerful attraction for the country's older, rural, often German-speaking population, weaned on ideas of Swiss invincibility and superiority. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"111089"	"he"	"concedes"	" It is, he concedes, a probability more remote than ever, given the violent Israeli incursion into the West Bank and the headquarters of the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, ordered by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"114094"	"he"	"concedes"	" The policy and biological energy institutes represent new areas where, he concedes, he is a neophyte. At TIGR, where he is still chairman of the board, he intends to decode more genomes, particularly those that throw light on one of his deepest interests, evolutionary biology. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"115207"	"he"	"concedes"	" He might have had that chance at General Foods, where, he concedes, he bounced up the ranks without a hitch. But in 1985, after five years there, General Foods was acquired by Philip Morris, and Dolan says he had no interest in working for a cigarette maker. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"116170"	"he"	"concedes"	" ``Who else will build the houses? We have to build them ourselves,'' he said. ``This is fine. It's spring. The weather is good.'' But when winter comes, he concedes, ``it will be a problem.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"117218"	"he"	"concedes"	" The Whalers might still be here, Victor figures, if Karmanos, the state, and the city all could have developed a better spirit of cooperation. The fans, he concedes, could have been more faithful. He also thinks the media could have been more Whaler-friendly. Ultimately, though, it was the promise of far more lucrative gates in Raleigh, after a couple of years in Greensboro, that lured Karmanos to North Carolina. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"117225"	"he"	"concedes"	" But, he concedes, ``one has to pass'' and the tribes are ready to make the case why their proposal is superior. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"119443"	"he"	"concedes"	" Well, he concedes, possibly an older woman would be able to cope with the realities of his business. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"127278"	"he"	"concedes"	" Those little things, he concedes, have helped bring about a wave of change in private ferry service. ``You don't have to be any sort of ferry fanatic to see that ferry service in New York makes sense,'' he says. ``Ferries have a role to play again. Maybe they're headed into a different kind of glory day.''  </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20021004.0160 type=story > <HEADLINE> WALL STREET SUFFERS; NEW YORK WINCES </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 10-04-02 15:55:00EDT (BC-JOBS-COLUMN-$ADV06-NY) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"127370"	"he"	"concedes"	" Liggett now expects Konami to earn 8.3 billion yen, or $69 million, in the year ending in March 2003, 18 percent above his earlier estimates, on revenue of about 237 billion yen. The earnings figure, he concedes, is conservative and may rise as Konami's U.S. distributor, Upper Deck, releases more cards. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"129729"	"he"	"concedes"	" Kennesaw State University computer scientist Brit Williams performed the technical evaluation on Georgia's touch screen system before it was purchased, and he was in charge of testing the equipment upon delivery. Fraud is possible, he concedes, but it would take a conspiracy of many. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"131134"	"he"	"concedes"	" Levkovich favors scenario No. 2. One reason, he concedes, is that scenario No. 1 appears unrealistic, and No. 3 is just too gloomy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"132222"	"he"	"concedes"	" ``I joined Bela's salle in 1977,'' Cohen recalls. ``I was already over 30, but under his tutelage enjoyed my best results.'' But the drive for Olympic gold also brought cheating, he concedes, sometimes through rigged judges, sometimes through illicit equipment, as in 1972 when a Soviet fencer was disqualified for wiring his epee to set off the electronic recording machine at will. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"132336"	"she"	"concedes"	" From 1995 to 1999, said Packard, the school nurse, a whooping cough epidemic here hospitalized some infants and left some children with chronic asthma. (The disease can be fatal in infants.) Forest's grandson Deven came down with whooping cough two years ago and, she concedes, passed the disease to 10 other children, including an infant. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"132710"	"he"	"concedes"	" Yet in many ways, he concedes, he is still an outsider, even as a Jew. ``As Isaac Deutscher put it, I'm a non-Jewish Jew,'' he said. ``I'm not a Zionist, I don't live in Israel, I don't speak Hebrew, I don't know Jewish culture, I am not religious. I became a Jew through Auschwitz. It was an accident, but it was also fortunate. I got to know the real face of the century. My life became richer for it. If it were not blasphemy, I would say I was lucky to have known Auschwitz.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"137970"	"he"	"concedes"	" Though Kelley initially blasted ABC for moving the series -- its subsequent performance was, he concedes, ``disastrous'' -- he admitted, ``We wondered, why isn't our audience passionate enough to follow us to Mondays? ... Perhaps it was because we weren't compelling enough for them to follow us. I hear that. That's the challenge -- to make it compelling again for viewers.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200307.gz"
"140228"	"he"	"concedes"	" The trouble, he concedes, is that this would require the government to overhaul not just its policy toward the east, but its entire economic program. With Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder facing an uphill battle for re-election in 2006, Milbradt, who is a member of the Christian Democratic opposition, said he was skeptical that the government would seize the moment. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"140651"	"he"	"concedes"	" Still, he concedes, most people in Garden City probably have no interest in coming out here. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"141945"	"she"	"concedes"	" Not the absolute best, mind you. Striving for perfection, in Wellington's view, is silly. Her clothes, she concedes, are not high fashion -- but Harry likes them, and they are appropriate for work. Neatness was never a priority, either. There was a time when we took stall showers because we were piling our dirty dishes in the bathtub, she recalled. But Harry didn't mind. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"145020"	"she"	"concedes"	" OK, she concedes, maybe her new name does help her seem like a hot property to young studio execs who have never heard of the Chicago Seven, much less Running on Empty. But in Hollywood, heat is an elusive quality that sometimes depends less on skill and achievement than on a player's perceived place in the order of things. An intimate link to fashionable young stars -- even via parenthood -- can go a long way. I'm sure people say, 'You can't have two kids who think like that and act like that without having parents who also have something going on,' Gyllenhall (pronounced JILL-en-hall) admitted. And so people reconsider you. But she also added -- perhaps a bit defensively -- that at other times, her name has opened doors for her children. There's a familial clan thing going on without exception, she said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"147242"	"he"	"concedes"	" He also expects specialty clothing and textiles operations to continue to survive in New York, North Carolina, France and Italy. But, he concedes, China will gain over the long run. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"147447"	"he"	"concedes"	" That, he concedes, is going to take some time. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"151701"	"he"	"concedes"	" Logue says State's Street's operating revenue grew 14 percent last year, faster than any of its competitors. Expenses remain a problem, he concedes, though there will be no slashing and burning going on here. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"151710"	"he"	"concedes"	" Logue says State's Street's operating revenue grew 14 percent last year, faster than any of its competitors. Expenses remain a problem, he concedes, though there will be no slashing and burning going on here. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"153424"	"he"	"concedes"	" Yet, he concedes, Every company, even GE, is still on a journey when it comes to really getting racism knocked. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"154246"	"he"	"concedes"	" Free and Jeffries-El officially parted ways in 1978. World played another 10 seasons. In later years, he concedes, he struggled with drugs and alcohol. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"154859"	"he"	"concedes"	" Such an approach probably isn't taught in Creative Writing 101, he concedes, and it's not one he ever advised anyone else to try in his teaching days. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"157723"	"he"	"concedes"	" But, he concedes, it's tricky. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
"162652"	"he"	"concedes"	" What Seth turns up about Shanti and Henny, through letters and interviews and finally a will, is both poignant and painfully revelatory. The letters, he concedes, were private -- eyes-only letters, as he puts it. But for a writer, they were also a find. And their discovery presented twin obligations to story and family. There's a duty to the living not to hurt them, Seth explained. And there's a duty to write things as they are. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"165417"	"she"	"concedes"	" Simmons isn't surprised that she's a lightning rod for criticism. She blames part of it on her own attributes: Any 6-foot-tall, talkative, loudmouthed woman, she concedes, would intimidate her peers. Her relationship with Russell Simmons, considered the godfather of hip-hop, and her position at Baby Phat, one of the most popular urban clothing lines, don't help matters. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"166861"	"he"	"concedes"	" Moreover, when I suggest he might be more effective in the fight outside public office, he concedes, In some ways maybe. But having said that I know, from a lot of personal experience, that there is no post that comes anywhere close to president of the United States when you want to influence people. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"167223"	"he"	"concedes"	" An acclaimed literary critic in his own right, he is curious about the reception Terrorist will receive. He cares what reviewers say, he concedes, but not to the extent that it influences his writing. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"168214"	"he"	"concedes"	" Maybe, he concedes, if David -- who has been resistant -- agrees to marry him, he will feel differently. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"168280"	"he"	"concedes"	" Yet Martin says his complaint is not now nor ever was solely about money. Forty million dollars is a big number, he concedes, but it's attached to one small question that looms over everything else. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"169441"	"he"	"concedes"	" Still, he concedes, if the operation is too challenging, I won't bother with it and, anyway, it's not fair for me to hold the [O.R. staff] captive with my musical preferences. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
