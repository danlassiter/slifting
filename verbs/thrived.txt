"131294"	"he"	"thrived"	" Never was O'Neal's absence so vividly exposed. Yao was averaging 4.3 points and hadn't scored more than 10 in a game. But against a soft middle of Samaki Walker and Slava Medvedenko, he thrived, going 9 for 9 from the field in 23 minutes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"

Who's the team in this regional you don't want to play? We wouldn't want to face Boston College. The Eagles were outstanding in the ACC tournament, knocking off North Carolina and giving Duke a scare in the title game. Then the NCAA selection committee shipped them all the way to Salt Lake City to play on a Thursday morning. No wonder BC was listless before ousting Pacific in double overtime. Craig Smith, who had 22 points and 16 rebounds in the second round against Montana, is a big-time player. 2. How about the one player you don't want to go up against? That would be Georgetown's Roy Hibbert. At 7-foot-2 and 280 pounds, it's safe to say there isn't anyone else like him in the Sweet 16. And if he plays like he did Sunday against Big Ten champion Ohio State - 20 points, 14 boards, five blocks - the Hoyas will be hard to beat. 3. So which of the lucky Florida Gators gets to guard this guy? He won't do it alone, but 6-11 Joakim Noah will spend a lot of time on Hibbert. That's good for Florida because the sophomore is playing the best basketball of his career. Noah will have to deliver again if the Gators are to make it to the Elite Eight. 4. Boston College is playing Villanova, its former Big East rival. Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese was not pleased when BC, Miami and Virginia Tech bolted for the ACC. Will Tranghese be in Minneapolis to pull for his Wildcats? Nope. Tranghese has decided to sit this one out. There remain some hard feelings over expansion but these two schools, we're told, still get along. That said, if UConn meets BC in the Final Four, it will be an all-out war. 5. Speaking of Villanova, how's Allan Ray's eye? For a few scary hours during the Big East tournament, the Villanova guard thought he'd sustained serious damage when he was poked in the eye. But Ray not only returned to action last week, he thrived, scoring 44 points in two NCAA tournament games, including 25 in last Sunday's 82-78 win over Arizona. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"

The colony was founded in the fourth century B.C. as a military fortress protecting Rome -- not always successfully -- and over the centuries it grew into the principal port shuttling goods to and from Rome, via barges pulled by oxen, and soldiers out to the empire. As a commercial and military center, it thrived, with an estimated 100,000 people by the second century A.D. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
