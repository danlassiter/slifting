"50248"	"they"	"failed"	" New York, Feb. 29 (Bloomberg) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. plans to use a little-known loophole in the U.S.'s telephone accounting regulations that will require the seven regional Bells to provide Internet customers with free local connections to AT&AMP;T's network, the New York Times reported. The loophole is an exemption passed by the Federal Communications Commission in 1983 that frees from access charges computer connections made to assigned numbers over local telephone lines. Although local telephone companies tried to have the exemption removed in 1987 and 1989, they failed, in part because of consumer opposition to paying higher rates for on-line and electronic database services, the paper said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"

WASHINGTON (moving in ``w'' category)  NATIONAL - GENERAL (Moving in ``a'' category)  ATTACKS-NEW YORK (New York) -- There is incredible sadness at Firehouse 288 in Maspeth. It's in the eyes of Firefighter Joe Tarantini and in his voice. He doesn't smile. Doesn't sleep. Doesn't know how he's still managing to function. Even during the day, I see the faces, Tarantini said. I just keep seeing them. I see them running up a set of stairs doing what they're doing, and it haunts me. Tarantini was working Thursday at Firehouse 288, about seven miles east of Manhattan, where 19 firefighters are missing in the wreckage of the World Trade Center. Among the missing from this station is Lt. Ron Kerwin, 42, whose parents and a brother live in Ahwatukee Foothills near Phoenix. If this was a test from God, I failed,Tarantini said, because whatever faith I had before is gone. By Judi Villa. 20 inches.

ENTERTAINMENT (Moving in ``e'' category)  SUMMERMOVIES (Phoenix) -- Tom Hanks is one of the brighter bulbs in Hollywood, so it's no surprise that he has a unique theory on why certain movies hit and others don't. Like computers, Hanks says, films are binary. They're either ones or zeroes. ``If it's a zero, it ain't working; if it's a one, it does work,'' he said during an interview last year. ``It's like this weird cosmic thing decides whether or not the public is interested in the movie you've made. You can't force them.''  This past summer's offerings tend to drive home Hanks' point. Some movies tickled the public's fancy, while others flopped like a mackerel on the Santa Monica Pier. With that in mind, here's a look at the hits, the misses and the surprises of the summer. By Bill Muller. 50 inches. art available.  LIFESTYLE (moving in ``l'' category)  STYLECOUNCIL (Phoenix) -- QUESTION: My girlfriend is always trying to take me shopping and give me a ``clothes makeover.'' She's got good taste and all, but I like the way I dress. What's up with this? THE STYLE COUNCIL DECREES: As Huey Lewis once said, the power of love is a curious thing. Of course, this particular behavior has little to do with love. This is pride. Have you ever noticed the way women look each other up and down when they meet? Yeah, that's because they're sizing each other up, gauging the potential for competition. That's exactly when you, dear reader, become a part of your girlfriend's outfit: a walking, talking, living doll. An attractive man, properly turned out, is one heck of an accessory. By looking like a catch yourself, you make all the other women think she has got more and is worth more because you're with her, and the fact that she dressed you up that way just marks her territory even more. By David Proffitt. 21 inches.  SHIRTSLEEVE (Phoenix) -- You spend $120 on a designer shirt, $8 more to get it cleaned, starched and pressed, and then you look like a two-bit slob because you can never get the sleeves even when you roll them up. On the scale of fashion annoyances, it's up there with wearing mismatched socks and splashing your pants at the bathroom sink. In other words, a minor clothing inconvenience. Unless, of course, you are Mauro Taliani, designer of the ``thinking shirt.'' Taliani, an Italian designer for Corpo Nove, found a way to fuse fabric, fanciful metal and the latest in folding technology to develop a shirt that rolls up its sleeves should it get too hot. But wait, there's more. The shirt never needs ironing; just a once-over with a hair dryer to chase away wrinkles. The heat from a dryer causes the metal to return it its original, smooth shape. Yes, this is the biggest advance for lazy men since the invention of the remote-control holster. And all for just $3,750 per garment. By Scott Craven. 16 inches. art available.  CHAIRS (Phoenix) -- This year's CHAIRity fund-raiser for Valley domestic violence shelters has been scaled back, but it will still feature unique works of art that you probably wouldn't want to sit on. By Doug Carroll. 12 inches. art available.  GOODY (Phoenix) We hear a lot about the importance of protecting our kids from seeing the horror of terrorist attacks unfold. What we don't hear as much is how nice it is when kids protect us. By Bill Goodyknootz. 15 inches.  COMMENTARY (moving in ``k'' category)  SLUG (dateline) -- Here is where the story description goes.

Not only did he serve time for monkeying around with a presidential election, he failed, it turns out, in the most important operation of his career: To successfully assassinate Ibn Awad, a billionaire ascetic who may (or may not) have 12 Soviet backpack nuclear devices. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"

If the Israelis thought they could force us to flee this way, they failed, she said defiantly. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
