The document calls on China's Parliament to rescind the powers of Prime Minister Li Peng's government relating to unconstitutional arrest procedures that have allowed the police to detain without charge up to one million Chinese each year.   The importance of this and several other petitions that have emerged this week is that they not only test official tolerance for free speech for the first time in a year, they also seek to place before the government a new agenda for political reform.   So far, the government has tolerated it.   MEXICO CITY (NYT) -- The arrest on murder charges of the elder brother of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has brought a surge of public support for the beleaguered presidency of Ernesto Zedillo, but it has also left some Mexicans wondering if political conflict will deepen as a result.   By ordering the prosecution of a member of one of the former president's families, Zedillo broke a basic rule of Mexican politics that allowed powerful officials and governing-party leaders to amass illicit wealth and commit other crimes with impunity.   Government officials said he intended both to solve the assassination here last fall of a former governing-party leader, Jos'e Francisco Ruiz Massieu, and to convince his skeptical countrymen that no one would remain above the law.   (NYT) -- A Palermo judge Thursday ordered Guilio Andreotti, a former prime minister of Italy and the symbol of its now-collapsed political establishment, to stand trial next September on charges that he acted as a protector and friend to the Sicilian Mafia during his long years in power.   The ruling by Judge Agostino Gristino sets the stage for a remarkable courtroom drama in which prosecutors will seek to prove that Andreotti did favors for the Cosa Nostra -- Italy's most notorious criminal organization -- in return for political support for his Christian Democratic Party in Sicily.   Andreotti, 76 years old, has denied the charges, based largely on testimony from former Mafia members who are now cooperating with the state. In a statement Thursday night to the news agency AGi, he called the upcoming trial ''unjustified,'' and added: ''The only advantage of a trial is that it allows the winitness to be examined and cross examined.''   MOSCOW (NYT) -- Russia reeled Thursday over the news that the country's best-known, most popular television personality was gunned down by hitmen in his apartment stairwell late Wednesday night.   The murder of 38-year-old Vladimir Listyev, who was recently put in charge of Russia's newly reorganized public television network, for a moment lifted the thin veil covering the corruption that has insinuated itself into the country's largest and most visible industries -- including television.   And in a country already on edge over the war in Chechnya and upcoming elections, the mysterious death plunged journalists, businessmen, politicians and the public into a frenzy of accusations and conspiracy theories. The only dispute was whether organized crime, big business, or murky political forces -- or a combination of all three -- were responsible for Listyev's death.   Many businessmen, politicians and journalists have been shot or bombed in the past year, but the murder of Listyev, who is as famous here as Larry King or Dan Rather are in the U.S., struck a new chord.   In a joint act of protest, all major television stations cancelled their regular programming Thursday night, including prime time news shows, and at 7 p.m. simultaneously aired a special memorial program about Listyev.   WASHINGTON (NYT) -- The White House intensified an attack Thursday on resurgent Republican isolationism and warned that cuts in aid to Jordan already approved by a House panel could imperil the Middle East peace process.   Saying that Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel had telephoned President Clinton to express alarm about the potential cuts, Clinton's spokesman said the $225 million cut would force the Administration to renege on a vital commitment in the volatile region. He portrayed the move as among the most dangerous in a series of House Republican-led efforts that he said would leave the United States disengaged.   The spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said the sharp reduction of the Jordanian aid package would amount to ``yanking out one of the pillars of American leadship in the world by taking away our ability to support and nurture the peace process that is changing so dramatically the Middle East.''   VIENNA (NYT) -- On the day that the last United Nations troops left Somalia, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali all but announced formally in a speech this morning that the age of optimism that blossomed after the end of the cold war is now over. Within a few months, he suggested, peacekeeping troops in Bosnia could also be on their way home.   Speaking to a group of international military strategists and diplomats, the secretary general said, however, that the collapse of peacekeeping the former Yugoslavia -- prompted by the demand of Croatia that United Nations troops begin to withdraw at the end of this month -- would provide a kind of opportunity to demonstrate that peacekeepers cannot stay indefinitely in places where people do not want to help themselves.   ``If there is not the political will among the protagonists, we cannot achieve peace,'' Boutros-Ghali said.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950302.0267 type=other > <DATELINE>  (BC-KEYRATES-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Here are the daily key rates from The New York Times.   --------------------Thursday --- Wednesday ---Year Ago   PRIME RATE ---------- 9.00 ------ 9.00 ------- 6.00   DISCOUNT RATE ------- 5.25 ------ 5.25 ------- 3.00   FEDERAL FUNDS(x) ---- 5.94 ------ 5.56 ------- 3.26   3-MO.

Times News Service  SENATE REPUBLICANS DEMAND SENATE DISCLOSURE ON FOSTER FILES  WASHINGTON (NYT) _ Setting the stage for confrontation, Senate Republicans Wednesday demanded a more complete disclosure from the White House of the files removed from the office of Deputy White House counsel Vincent W. Foster Jr. after he died.  Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, the chairman of the special committee conducting hearings into how the White House handled Foster's papers after his suicide two years ago, suggested that he would go to court if the White House refused, and raised the prospect of a constitutional clash.  ``Would you believe Richard Nixon if he said his lawyers would decide what was relevant to disclose and what wasn't?'' D'Amato asked at the conclusion of Wednesday's hearing. ``Of course not. I'm serving notice that we will seek to obtain access to the files. I don't believe we should let President Clinton's lawyer make the call about what's relevant.''  Republicans have complained that many pages submitted by the White House from Foster's files have been edited _ redacted, in Washington parlance _ so heavily that they are blank, and others contain just a word or sentence.  CHICAGO ASKS WHY SO MANY DIED DURING HEAT WAVE  CHICAGO (NYT) _ Like the grisly toll from some distant war zone, the number of dead fromlast week's murderous heat wave here climbed to 436 Wednesday _ and the medical examiner is not finished counting.  But while the weather has cooled, the debate about why so many died has inflamed this city's usually combustible politics, with Mayor Richard M. Daley and other officials trading angry allegations over who is to blame for not doing enough to save the poor, the infirm and the aged from the consequences of Chicago's most crippling seige of summer heat in memory. Weather and politics are frequent partners in this city. In 1979, Michael Bilandic, a veteran Chicago pol, was turned out by voters who were convinced he had not done enough enough to dig the city of a snowstorm, an act of God to which Chicagoans are more accustomed. Now, critics like John Steele, an alderman from Chicago's South Side, where many of the heat victims perished, are arguing that the Daley administration mishandled the heat wave by not implementing fast enough the city's ``skimpy'' heat emergency plan.  ``Overall, the city administration dropped the ball,'' Steele said. ``I'm looking for a lot of answers, the whole city is.''  ANOTHER SIMPSON DEFENSE WITNES DISCREDITED  LOS ANGELES (NYT) _ O.J. Simpson's defense continued to sputter Wednesday, as the latest in a lengthening parade of witnesses was either discredited or offered ammunition for the prosecution.  John Meraz, the man who towed Simpson's Bronco away from a police department facility, reiterated he saw no blood inside the vehicle, nor fingerprint powder on the door. But prosecutors showed photographs taken the day before that documented both. Meraz might have missed them, they suggested, because he was indebted to Simpson or was not wearing his glasses.  Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark implied that the defense had helped Meraz in the wrongful termination suit he has filed against the tow yard, which discharged him for removing Simpson's dry cleaning receipts from the car as souvenirs. She also suggested the defendant had not pushed charges against Meraz in exchange for his sympathetic testimony.  AFTER A CENTURY, A BLACK CADET IS VINDICATED  GREENVILLE, S.C. (NYT) _ A former slave from South Carolina who more than a century ago was beaten by fellow cadets at West Point and then drummed out of the corps will finally receive the Army commission that his descendants have sought for years.  Acting on a request from Congress, where Sen. Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina had pushed for the posthumous commission, President Clinton is to award it at a White House ceremony next Monday to the family of the onetime cadet, Johnson C. Whittaker.  Also to be turned over then is what Whittaker's granddaughter Cecil Pequette described Wednesday as the real award: his Bible, which was seized as evidence for his court-martial in 1881 and has been stored in the National Archives ever since. ``The Bible was given to him by his mother when he went to West Point,'' Mrs. Pequette said, ``and it contains his jottings about his loneliness. The Bible had been a comfort to him during his ordeal.''  TEEN SMOKING IS UP SHARPLY, SURVEY SHOWS  WASHINGTON (NYT) _ There has been a sharp increase in smoking among young teen-agers in the United States, according to a survey of 50,000 8th-, 10th- and 12th-graders, and fewer of them believe smoking is hazardous to their health.  The shift has alarmed authorities on drug abuse because it makes it clear that after more than a decade of unchanging rates of smoking among youths, significant increases have begun ``despite the accumulating evidence of smoking's lethal effects, despite the many new restrictions on cigarette smoking, and despite the fact that smoking has fallen considerably among adults,'' said Dr. Lloyd D. Johnston of the University of Michigan Survey Research Center, the director of the study.  ``We are now in a period of clear and continuing increase in cigarette smoking among teens,'' Johnston said. ``This is extremely bad news for the health and longevity of the next generation.'' The new figures will be bolstered by other figures to be released on Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Dr. Michael Eriksen, head of the centers' Office on Smoking and Health. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950719.0537 type=story > <HEADLINE> REGULATORS GRABBED THE PHONES, BUT NO OTHER ACTION WAS NEEDED </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WASHINGTON (BC-MARKET-REACT-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"

"44404"	"he"	"suggested"	" As Pataki described it Wednesday, cuts in education aid seem all to the good. The problem with our schools, he suggested, was ``an education bureaucracy'' that stifles creativity, not a lack of money for teachers and classrooms. To prove his point, he cited a well-worn statistic that ``only about half the money the state sends to local schools ever gets to the classroom.'' The figure is accurate only if libraries, supplies, transportation, maintenance, security, and cafeteria service are deemed irrelevant to the classroom. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"

After the wall came down, Germany debated about what to do: Tear down the palace? Rebuild the castle? The palace was closed and soon covered with graffiti. The site of the old castle was used for temporary exhibitions. In one, artists painted a trompe l'oeil castle on a canvas, a ghostly version of the old castle.

This might be one explanation, she suggested, for the high rate of divorce in modern societies. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020121.0174 type=story > <HEADLINE>     DERMATOLOGY TOOL MAY DETECT HEART TROUBLE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> SAN ANTONIO (BC-DIABETIC-TEST-HNS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"

Before that revolution, there seemed to be no middle ground in economics between laissez-faire fatalism and heavy-handed government intervention _ and with laissez-faire policies widely blamed for the Great Depression, it was hard to see how free-market economics could survive.

Like literature, music can be judged by the kind of world it portrays and the ideas it represents. For Adorno it becomes an intellectual drama, a form program music.

"163868"	"he"	"suggested"	" Stock and bond markets braced for today's job growth report, which strategists hope will signal a near-term end to Federal Reserve interest rate increases but also fear that it may not. The market's concern is that the Fed will interpret a big February job number as a sign of inflationary economic growth, leading to an extension of the Fed's anti-inflationary policy of higher rates. Economists anticipate 210,000 new jobs, compared with 193,000 in January. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Gary Tapp said the market has stayed at a high plateau so far this year. But he added that the chances are greater than 50-50 that the market will have a tough time sustaining this higher plateau until the Fed stops raising interest rates. And that, he suggested, probably won't happen until the Fed sees evidence of both slower growth and lower inflation numbers. In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield stayed above the two-year yield for the second straight day, effectively ending for now the yield inversion that had worried many analysts. New York Federal Reserve President Timothy Geithner added to the market's uncertainty, however, by suggesting the Fed may have to raise rates to stay competitive against higher central bank rates in Europe and Japan. Elsewhere, the price of crude oil futures rose 0.8 percent to $60.47 per barrel after Iran refused to suspend its nuclear program, and violence threatened to spread in Nigeria's oil fields.

But while Brustein initially viewed Odets as an intensely dramatic, exciting and verbally electric playwright, he now compares his plays to vintage movies that eventually become yellow-looking and crackly sounding.

He has revived the slide presentation about global warming that he first began giving in 1990 and taken that slide show on the road, and he has now turned that presentation into a book and a documentary film, both called An Inconvenient Truth.
