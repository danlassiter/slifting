"770"	"he"	"allows"	" ``Anything to help,'' says Reiner, managing a small grin. He has, he allows, become adept at public relations in the 23 years since we first made his acquaintance on All in the Family, a television situation comedy that was so controversial he was invited to appear on Phil Donahue's Dayton-based talk show to discuss its impact on America. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199407.gz"
"17069"	"he"	"allows"	" Musically, Stewart says his music could work for anyone from today's young alternative rock fans to more seasoned types. Lyrically, he allows, ``I can see how it would appeal to people in their 30s, 'cause I'm singing about dysfunctional relationships and when you're 18 that's something you don't really know. You're singing more about lust for teen-age sex.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"

"48368"	"he"	"allows"	" A remarkably balanced historian, Ambrose is neither a revisionist nor an apologist. Yes, he allows, Lewis always condescended to the Indians, lied when convenient and on one occasion stole from them. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"

"49829"	"she"	"allows"	" Moderator Irwin Gratz, of Maine Public Radio, gamely tries to keep the discussion focused, noting that ``people seem to be seeking contradictory things.'' But, when it's time to boil down the conversation _ summarized on sheets of paper hanging on the walls _ into a coherent set of questions for the candidates, the moderator and his media colleagues basically throw up their hands. Jeannine Guttman, managing editor at the Press Herald, decides to abort the effort, assuring folks that the newspaper will transmit ``the whole wall of questions'' to the candidates. The benign chaos of the evening is aptly summarized by Andrea Boland, a 48-year-old title examiner, who sheepishly turns to a reporter. The process, she allows, ``seems kind of clumsy and awkward.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"

"100022"	"he"	"allows"	" ``My work is not rich in laughter,'' Steiner concedes. ``I regard the  threshold of human identity and decency to have been heavily lowered (in  the 20th century).'' Yet, he allows, ``I couldn't teach without a leap  of hope . . . that there is a chance in certain domains of making being  a little less savage.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"

"140632"	"he"	"allows"	" I favor his policies and ideas over Kerry's, George says. Bush had done not real well these past few years, he allows, but circumstances were tough. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"171509"	"he"	"allows"	" Levenson's new book, Resurrection and the Restoration of Israel: The Ultimate Victory of the God of Life (Yale University Press), is a frontal challenge to this account. But the reasons that it has become a staple of modern Jewish apologetics, he allows, are not hard to find. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171898"	"he"	"allows"	" Rolland expresses astonishment that some people are nostalgic for the leaner, less ripe California style of the 1970s. There were good bottles then, he allows, but very few. I came to the U.S. in 1984 or '85 and I did a lot of tasting, he said. Now a young guy like me coming couldn't taste all the good wines in a week. Back then you could in an hour. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
