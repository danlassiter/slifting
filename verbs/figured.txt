Your time will come.   Robbie Capp, a free-lance book editor who loves Broadway songs, has always had to sing along at home with the likes of Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand because she could never find an amateur chorus specializing in American musical theater.   This year, she figured, with all the revivals around, it was time for a serious effort. She approached Andrew Colton, the director of the 92nd Street Y School of Music, with her dream and, voila, the Broadway at the Y Chorus was created.   It will begin life next month with Neil Ginsberg, a conductor, at the helm and will be open to singers of all levels who love Broadway songs. Well, singers of almost all levels. ``If they sing off-key, I might suggest a ceramics course,'' Ms. Capp said.   For those on-key, there will be 12 two-hour rehearsals ending with a public performance. It costs $150 to participate. And even before the first rehearsal, Ms. Capp is thinking big. Her goal?   ``An annual sing-along with 100,000 voices, on the Great Lawn of Central Park,'' she said.   President Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea, now vacationing on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, are expected at a barbecue Thursday night to be given by Paul Beirne, a money manager with Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. in New York, and Thomas Lee, a leveraged-buyout specialist, who entertained the Clintons at a similar event last year.   Beirne said the barbecue is to be at the home of Susie Tree, a friend on the Vineyard, and that the 150 guests are to include both friends of the Clintons and members of the press corps.   What is Beirne's connection? He was a student at Santa Clara University with Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, and -- double whammy -- Thursday is her 33rd birthday.   NEW YORK -- Maybe it's a first, but no matter. An 87-page book of photographs called ``The Seasons Observed'' (Harry N. Abrams, $24.95) is to go on sale at cosmetics counters later this month, as well as in bookstores.   An exhibition of the photographs will open on Sept. 14 at the Holly Solomon Gallery in the SoHo section of New York City. The gallery will also sell the pictures.   The photographs are the work of Evelyn H. Lauder, so there's no need to explain the cosmetics connection, or the whys and wherefores. Mrs. Lauder, the senior corporate vice president of Estee Lauder, is donating her royalties to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, and many department stores are following suit with from half to all of their profits.   An originator of the pink-ribbon campaign to increase awareness of breast cancer, Mrs. Lauder has already raised $18 million for a breast cancer center for Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and for research into the disease.   Not so incidentally, Mrs. Lauder said, the family company will soon introduce a new cosmetics color -- you guessed it -- ``Pink Ribbon.''  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19940831.0324 type=story > <HEADLINE> DEBATE RAGES ON WHAT BOOKS SHOULD BE ALLOWED IN SCHOOLS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WASHINGTON  (BC-SCHOOL-CENSORSHIP-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199408.gz"

Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry, gave the dollar an initial boost by saying he'd like to see the yen climb to 110 per dollar, a level it last reached in January 1994. The U.S. currency rose further after Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the U.S. will work with its partners in the Group of Seven industrialized nations to bolster the dollar. Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer also said he hopes the dollar's upward ``correction'' will continue. ``Summers's and Tietmeyer's comments show that the G-7's call for an orderly reversal of the dollar's declines has not been satisfied yet,'' said Marc Chandler, senior analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in New York. The dollar was last quoted at 104.03 yen against yesterday's 102.39, and at 1.4884 marks, slightly higher than 1.486 late yesterday. Published 15:09. (See story: NI FRX) Technology Shares Fall, Prompting Concerns That Rally Is Ending, by Tom Murphy  New York: Investors dumped technology stocks as a week of bad news about computer-company earnings and slower semiconductor orders and software sales raised concerns that the 10-month rally in technology shares is ending. Several analysts reduced their ratings and earnings expectations for such high-profile companies as Apple Computer Inc., Oracle Corp., Electronic Arts Inc. and Cypress Semiconductor Corp. The jitters were triggered by Oracle's fiscal first-quarter earnings report. Shares of the biggest seller of data-management software fell 16 percent after the company posted a disappointing 39 percent rise in revenue --below the 50 percent growth of recent years -- although earnings met expectations. ``Oracle has been one of the leaders of this technology rally and you're seeing a sell-off not just in Oracle but the whole sector,'' said Christopher Mortenson, analyst at Alex.

An efficient pork producer, they figured, could reap fat profits even in period of wildly gyrating prices -- they're up 60 percent this year. In just four years, Premium has risen to become the nation's third-biggest pork producer after Murphy Family Farms and Carroll Foods. But success has a price: It's mired in more than $454 million in debt and, under pressure from financial backers led by Morgan Stanley &AMP; Co., Premium is searching for buyers or joint-venture partners for large parts of its operations. ``This isn't one of our higher-yielding returns, but we have deep pockets and a long-term view,'' said Robert Niehaus, a partner at Morgan Stanley. ``This one gets a lot of our time and attention.''

Big fund outfits like Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price slashed their budgets in half this year, with one fund company cutting its budget by 58 percent, says Robert Moss, president of Competitrack, which keeps tabs on financial advertising. Tiny operations that don't do much advertising to begin with apparently increased their spending in many cases, Mr. Moss adds. But not enough to counter the cuts by the big guys: In the first six months this year, ad spending by the 40 mutual fund companies tracked by Competitrack dropped 18 percent over the same period in 1994. ``It's the first year since Competitrack began collecting data in 1988 that you've seen a year-over-year decline,'' says Charles Flynn, an analyst at Chicago's Financial Research Corp., which does research on mutual funds.

Toshiba Corp. and six other electronics makers reached a compromise with Sony Corp. and Philips Electronics NV on standardizing the format for a more powerful compact disc which is expected to replace the video cassette and CD-ROM. It marks the end of a yearlong battle and means consumers won't have to choose between two incompatible formats as they did in the VHS vs Betamax scrap of the 1980s. ``This way there are no losers, and the biggest winner is the consumer,'' said Richard Doherty, director of the Envisioneering Group, a consumer electronics and computer market research firm in Seaford, New York.

The chief executive officer of the Washington-based Black Entertainment Television thought the young Arkansas Democrat would fight for minority business interests. Two and a half years later, Johnson is angry. ``I can't point to one Clinton program that is aimed at dealing with the problems and concerns of black business,'' he said. ``They don't care if black businesses go down the tubes.'' Other black executives say they're disappointed by what they see as a lack of economic development programs aimed at black Americans -- something Clinton promised when he was running for president in 1992. Now, with 1996 around the corner, they're looking for alternatives. Last week, Jesse Jackson re-emerged as a possible contender after black businessmen banded together and paid off his campaign finance debts.

Production surged a larger-than-expected 1.1 percent, the Federal Reserve said, well above analyst expectations of a 0.4 percent rise. Signs of a stronger output would undercut arguments for the Fed to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy. ``You could even argue a tightening'' in interest rates if the trend continues, said Richard Yamarone, an economist at Mountain Econometrics in Maplewood, New Jersey. ``This ought to put the nail in the argument the Fed will be easing'' when policymakers next meet on Sept. 26, said Robert Dederick, economic consultant at the Northern Trust Co.

But rancher Richard Fullington doesn't need that kind of land; he can handle 10 head of his herd on a square foot. But Fullington has another problem. The 'pokes who are building his new ranch facilities are moving way too slow, and he has customers knocking down the door. All of this is odd to Fullington. ``For 25 years, I'd tell people what I did for a living, and they'd look at me kind of strange,'' Fullington said. ``Now they want to talk about it and buy it and eat it.'' Get out those little lassos and follow along here. Fullington is a snail rancher. By BEVERLY BUNDY. Story has moved in ``d'' food and dining category.

FILM-REVIEW-TO DIE FOR  UNDATED _ Easily the most coherent of Gus Van Sant's films, ``To Die For'' focuses on an ambitious TV journalist wannabe named Suzanne Stone (Nicole Kidman), a ruthless career woman willing to do ANYTHING to get what she wants. While the trailers hawk the film as a dark satire, it's much darker than first impressions might allow. It also has some of the most convincing portrayals of high school losers ever put on film. Their performances give ``To Die For'' a gritty realism that makes it almost too uncomfortable to watch. But nonetheless, you should do your best to try. By TODD CAMP.

FOLK-JOHNPRINE  DALLAS _ John Prine is a realist at heart and, by 1991, after more than 20 years as a folk-rock singer-songwriter, he had come to believe his career had hit on a comfortable plateau. He had his loyal cadre of fans, enough to pack small halls in any city and to buy enough copies of whatever music he released to give him a decent living. But that, he figured, was that. He was over 40, a former ``new Dylan'' whose popularity peaked in the '70s, and he had no fantasies about ever playing stadiums or being a household name. Then came 1991's ``The Missing Years'' and the evolution of a radio genre called adult alternative. All of a sudden, Prine was about as popular as he had been back in the days of ``Sam Stone.''

Certainly John Larroquette is pleased that NBC renewed ``The John Larroquette Show'' for another season. Apparently, it was a very close call, but he knows that his show's mediocre ratings have been more a result of the tough competition than the quality of his series. Larroquette says that NBC executives suggested that the series _ in which Larroquette plays John Hemingway, a recovering alcoholic managing a St. Louis bus terminal _ might have been too, well, edgy. ``It was never a question of quality, but some areas of taste, and the kind of humor I find hilarious, but it seems normal sane people don't,'' he says.

Lo and behold, I got pregnant during that vacation. (I have often remarked to my husband that we might have had more children if we had taken more vacations).''

DINO'S DICTION NEEDED WORK  The celebrity scholar Bruce Bellingham of San Francisco has noted a discrepancy in the official Dean Martin record:  A 1988 video clip of Martin, televised after his death, showed him talking about the need for his nationwide tour with Sammy Davis Jr. and Frank Sinatra. ``This country has not seen us,'' said Martin. ``They've seen rock and roll and this other chazerai.'' The last word, ``chazerai,'' literally means pig food in Yiddish; more commonly, it has come to refer to junk.  Martin's biographer Nick Tosches, whose 1992 book was titled ``Dino: Living High in the Dirty Business of Dreams,'' wasn't listening hard enough. He quoted the singer: ``They've seen rock and roll and all this other ... not that I ...''  Martin was ``in good spirits but he was having trouble finishing sentences,'' concluded the author. In a pig's eye.  WHEN THE BLOOM IS OFF THE ROSE  While serving a federal prison sentence for mail fraud and tax evasion, Webster Hubbell, former partner of Hillary Clinton in the Rose Law Firm, has been working on a tell-maybe-all book, ``Friends in High Places: The Compromises of a Power Player.''  The volume will be published by HarperCollins, says the Washington Post, which describes it in its catalog as ``the most intimate look yet at the character of our president, his wife, his circle and perhaps this entire political generation.''  And if that isn't hot enough, here's what the book cover will say: ``In 1976, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Vincent Foster Jr. and Webster Hubbell were the rainmakers in the Rose Law Firm. In 1996, one of them is in the White House, one is dead and one is in federal prison.''  Hubbell is said to be less than happy about the blurb. His agent, Michael Carlisle of the William Morris Agency, told the Post that the book is simply ``a personal memoir.''  The amount of Hubbell's advance hasn't been disclosed, but the Post says that he's needy. His house in D.C. is on the market.  ROBERT SCHEER WASN'T AILING  A recent item, gleaned from Esquire, erroneously reported on a hospital visit from film maker Oliver Stone to journalist Robert Scheer, who was said to be awaiting cancer surgery.  Scheer called yesterday to set the record straight: He never had cancer, his surgery was minor, and Stone, ``a hell of a nice guy,'' never visited him in the hospital, because he was in Asia at the time.  Their names were spelled correctly.  WHO SAID WHAT  ``I always wondered if `Little Women' would have done as well if Alcott had called it `Big Women.''  _ Playwright Wendy Wasserstein during a Random House panel discussion on Louisa May Alcott.  ``I like love scenes. If they are done right, they can say a lot about the characters that you can't say in other scenes. When you are naked, you don't have a lot to hide behind. The way I approach a love scene is to let the other actor know, `Obviously, we are not really having sex, but you shouldn't feel inhibited with me, because this should be as true as any scene that we are doing. And I want to be able to feel as free with you. We are not going to take this home afterward.'

Gussow, 72, asked recently as she pulled weeds in the riverside garden here, which supplies her with herbs, fruits and vegetables year-round. ``And we couldn't know where food came from, I figured, unless it was grown closer to home.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"

I grew it in a container (Japanese maples are the best container trees I've ever grown) on Capitol Hill in Washington and made it the centerpiece of my Atlanta garden in 1989. A couple of years ago, I confessed in a column that I had beheaded that 15-year-old tree because it grew a short trunk, then spread branches horizontally _ instead of growing a trunk several feet high and then weeping dramatically.

Until her first book tour this summer, Zane, who lives with her husband and children outside Washington, had refused to make public appearances, in part to preserve her domestic life. In an age of Internet stalking, sitting for pictures, she believes, exposes her to fewer dangers than revealing her identity would. Her oldest child, a 17-year-old son, knows what she does for a living, and had managed not to share her identity with his friends until, Zane said last week, he saw a really cute girl at school reading one of my books, and he just couldn't help himself and said, 'Hey -- that's my mom!' Soon, young women started ringing her doorbell late at night for autographs, and Zane decided it was time to move. </P> 	nyt_eng_200408.gz

"154980"	"I"	"figured"	" As I crawled into bed next to my wife the other night, I was thinking of another woman. My wife was OK with that, actually. It was Judy Miller who was on my mind, because about the time I was tucking in, I figured, she was settling down for her first night in a jail cell. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"155915"	"she"	"figured"	" Lippman chose journalism as a way to pay the bills while pursuing her dream of writing literary fiction. Lippman said that her short stories and sketches, many set in the newsroom, were well regarded in writing workshops she took, but when the time came to try her hand at novels, I was a great starter but not very good at finishing. Mysteries, she figured, would impose the disciple of a beginning, a middle and an end. There's no such thing as an unfinished mystery novel, she said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"156636"	"he"	"figured"	" The slide began, he figured, with the 1987 players' strike that split the team. That was followed by the team's 1988 sale by the Nordstrom family to Ken Behring, the real estate developer from California, and the draft of linebacker Brian Bosworth, two of the more loathsome characters to grace a Seattle playfield. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"157097"	"we"	"figured"	" We were all getting so used to the spectacle, it didn't seem unusual that on the night of Feb. 22, the onrushing whitewater didn't expire until it reached our doorsteps. Just another really big day, we figured, on the North Shore. But the swell grew to near-historic levels that evening. Worse yet, around midnight, two separate wave trains combined as one: the rare and potentially lethal rogue wave. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"157107"	"she"	"figured"	" Bernice Sims, now 78, wanted to record the violent confrontation between protesters and Alabama state troopers and other law enforcement for posterity, for her grandchildren and great-grandchilden who, she figured, wouldn't believe the sacrifice she and others of her generation made to put an end to discrimination against African-Americans. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"159350"	"I"	"figured"	" Reporting to my class at the aquarium with such lore bubbling in my head, I opted to cast off my own cynicism about dolphins living in captivity. Frankly, I figured, I could use a new friend, and lord knows a little spiritual healing wouldn't hurt either. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"159822"	"he"	"figured"	" You start to second-guess a little, he admitted. But then you also say, maybe there's a reason why I'm not playing. Maybe I'm not good enough. If Mroz took last season off, he figured, he could get bigger and stronger, study up on the game, then take over as No. 1 when Cowan graduated. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"160365"	"I"	"figured"	" I compiled a list -- Englishcreekgardens.com, Greathomeideas.com, Abirdshome.com and Glasshouseworks.com -- and assumed smugly my search was over. All I had to do, I figured, was some comparison shopping for the best price (which ranged from $408 to nearly $700) and shipping rates. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"162580"	"she"	"figured"	" Her A-Z Personal Uniforms project came in response to another need. At the gallery, she knew she had to meet a more stylish standard of dress, but felt stymied by the time-and-money complexities of throwing together an outfit every day. A uniform, she figured, would do the trick. And so she designed a series of seasonal garments, ranging from modest jumpers to silk-adorned tulle dresses, that could be worn for months at a time. (In 1993, pants entered the repertory.) </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"162859"	"I"	"figured"	" On my way out of town last week, at the beginning of a three-hour drive to Pittsburgh, I stopped at the local flower shop for five helium balloons in a variety of bright colors, each trailing a six-foot ribbon. That way, I figured, Hannah could grab any one of them on her own without having to wait for a tall person to pull it from the ceiling. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"163618"	"he"	"figured"	" Some players who aren't playing have legitimate reasons. Oscar Robles, for example, isn't playing for Mexico because he is fighting for the utility infield job with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Out of sight, out of mind, he figured, and no one can blame him. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"166840"	"I"	"figured"	" Hey, it's her money, I figured, and told her I would help when it came time to pick a new car. I didn't count on the wreck speeding the process along. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"170194"	"she"	"figured"	" Pearce and Ripatti wandered the beach, not far from Rincon, their favorite surf spot. After they'd been split up as partners, Pearce had realized he felt something for Ripatti. At a party during a relay race to Las Vegas one night, he had told her there had to be something between them. They'd started dating. They'd fallen in love. As the two walked, Pearce noticed a fishing float protruding from the sand. He started digging, deeper and deeper until he hit a box. Ripatti stood, arms crossed. This was some Mafia drop-off, she figured, or something revolting she wanted nothing to do with. That's Sammy Two Eyes' money or dope or something, she told him. Or it's a dead cat. I don't want to mess with that. Pearce, headstrong as always, didn't listen. He opened the box, which was filled with gold coins. And a pair of wine glasses. And a little tiny box. He handed it to her and told her to open it. Inside sat a diamond-encrusted ring. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"173859"	"she"	"figured"	" AUSTIN, Texas -- Nanci Boice knew her Christian faith would inform her perspective in her future job as a licensed counselor. But the university where she was taking courses to prepare for that job didn't seem to address spirituality -- something that certainly meant a great deal to her and, she figured, her clients. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"174188"	"he"	"figured"	" Toward that end, Parcells was atypically placid after the Cowboys' 42-17 loss to New Orleans on Sunday night. It was time, he figured, to let off the gas a little. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
"174458"	"he"	"figured"	" Motivated by the tragedy, Dacey decided to study psychology, earning his doctorate at Cornell. If he could help others face their fears, he figured, maybe his own loss would seem less horrific. It's that old, 'God gives you lemons, you make lemonade out of it,' he says. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
"174491"	"he"	"figured"	" That's kind of the way I've looked at the NFL, Nugent said, adding, You never know what's going to happen next. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20061226.0218 type=advis > <HEADLINE> PHOTO-UPDATE-NYT </HEADLINE> <TEXT> The following photos have been sent as part of the New York Times News Service photo package for Tuesday, Dec. 26, 2006.
