"23521"	"they"	"imply"	" Regardless of clear constitutional qualifications for congressional representatives and senators that apply to all states, Thomas and his dissenting colleagues argue that the states are not bound by Article 1, Section 2, which explicitly enumerates those qualifications. In effect, they imply, the 10th Amendment overrides any part of the Constitution that the states wish to override. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
