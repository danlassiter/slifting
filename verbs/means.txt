"75676"	"it"	"means"	" I skipped the weekly cocktail party, which is held at the owner's hillside house on the other end of the island, and decided to test room service. For dinner, there were usually three selections each for appetizer, main course and dessert.

This signals the staff that there's something you want. Employees drive by in mini-mokes throughout the day, checking for yellow flags.

The best companies are pushing for greater discipline and accountability in their performance management systems. From the employees' perspective, it means, expect to be measured to a greater extent than before. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"

HEROES, FATHERS AND A TIME FOR REMEMBERING  DRENNAN-MEMORIAL-DAY-LIFEBEAT _ If there is anything good to be said about a dark night, it's that when you are in the middle of it, you can see where the lights are. And from what I can tell, if there is anything good to be said about war, it's that when you are in the hell of it, you discover the heroes. Long after the war ends, however, a different kind of discovery begins: the process of measuring the ongoing effects heroes have on the lives they touch with their courage. By Beth Drennan. 750 words.  (ART ADV: Photos of the author's father, Staff Sgt. Harry Horton Jr., his crewmate, Sgt. Edward F. Sobolewski, a headshot of Theo Hennekens and a picture of Horton's fake French passport are available on Wieck, Newscom or by calling the Syndicate Photo Desk at 212-499-3339.)  GRANDTALES: ``NO'' MORE GOODIES  GRANDPARENTING-COLUMN-LIFEBEAT _ ``No'' is an intriguing word to a 20-month-old toddler, like my grandson, Matt. Uttered by his mother or father it translates to ``Don't do that.'' From the mouth of his grandmother or grandfather, it means, ``We have to say this because your parents told us to, but when you don't listen we'll laugh.'' Not long ago my daughter confronted me. ``You're the kind of grandmother who gives her grandchild candy when his parents say no.'' ``I'm glad you have that straight,'' I retorted. ``No sense harboring any unnecessary bad feelings due to misunderstandings.'' By Ellen Blum Rosenthal. 700 words.  (ART ADV: Photo of Ellen Blum Rosenthal is available on Wieck, Newscom or by calling the Syndicate Photo Desk at 212-499-3339.)  DRUG MIX-UPS: ARE YOU AT RISK?  DRUG-MIXUPS-LIFEBEAT _ Xanax, Zantac. Benadryl, Bentyl. A whopping 20 percent to 25 percent of prescription errors are due to name confusion between sound-alike or look-alike drugs. The primary cause? Physicians' poor handwriting and pharmacies' inability to decipher it. In most mix-up cases, you'd only feel like something was not quite right: Drowsiness, headache, dizziness, insomnia, diarrhea and vomiting are the most common adverse drug reactions. But the consequences of taking the wrong drug could be fatal if you've been prescribed too high a dose or if it interacts badly with something else you're on. By Michelle Meyer. 600 words.  (ART ADV: Photo of prescription bottle is available on Wieck, Newscom or by calling the Syndicate Photo Desk at 212-499-3339.)  BOTOX UNLIMITED  BOTOX-APPROVAL-LIFEBEAT _ I've lied. Not about most things. But when it comes to revealing my age, like many women, I feign being mathematically challenged. Recently, though, the Food and Drug Administration announced the long-awaited approval of the use of Botox for cosmetic use, causing some to rejoice and others to frown. Obviously those who received the injections that reduce the appearance of wrinkles didn't actually frown because their faces are partially paralyzed. But that's the beauty of Botox.

"133729"	"it"	"means"	" Colmer had spent years on the House Rules Committee, including being chairman since 1966, fighting to bottle up a raft of progressive legislation, including any civil rights bills. As Colmer was quoted in a 1980 obituary, he saw the committee as ``a cooling off vehicle, especially in a time of great national excitement, distress and emotion.'' If you really need that translated, it means, in part, keeping black people in their place. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"

It would be the first title for the franchise that moved to Gwinnett three years ago. It would be sweet reward for a stressed-out guy, who started debating when to pull the trigger on plane tickets last Friday, with the Aces were up 3-2 in their semifinal series. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"

It is a message that resonates well with an impressionable young man who is 17 or 18. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
