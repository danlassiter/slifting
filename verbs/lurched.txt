"156007"	"I"	"lurched"	" Up rocks, through crevices, across a tumbling stream, I lurched, kicked, scraped, huffed, splashed, spat, climbed, groaned, jumped, cursed. I caught up because these lovely humans had stopped to inspect their good Ordnance Survey maps and to munch sandwiches. None of the group seemed surprised as I stumbled up. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"172818"	"we"	"lurched"	" Usually to get a bunch of people to do something potentially so embarrassing, there has to be a large amount of alcohol involved. But if anyone in this bunch was lubed, she didn't let on. We shrugged, we lurched, we stomped, we shimmied. We looked like fools, I'm sure (the video's on www.campgetaway.com), but we laughed and high-fived a lot. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
