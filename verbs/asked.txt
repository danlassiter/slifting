He stepped in an elevator at the downtown Hilton en route to his room, and was asked by a man in an Arkansas Razorbacks sweatshirt how long it would take to walk to the Kingdome.

"19117"	"he"	"asked"	" But one question deeply troubled Figueres. How can we have a universal family, he asked, if the rich continue to exchange one hour of their work for 10 hours of the work of the poor? Today, a generation later, some insist that the maldistribution of wealth is worsening. Areas still exist in Mexico where nobody has seen a doctor in a year and one child in 80 may get a chance at college. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"19212"	"she"	"asked"	" Comparing the House Republicans' legislative agenda to a freight train, she asked, ``Do I think the train is going to stop for the little person that's yelling in the middle of the tracks?

"20740"	"they"	"asked"	" Again and again, their attention returned to sports. Why, they asked, weren't there professional women's football and baseball teams? How could anyone know what women were capable of if no one encouraged girls to be tougher and run faster? One girl pointed out that some boys on her high school football team were smaller than some of the girls who would like to play. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"

"23472"	"he"	"asked"	" Take the government's need for money to cut the deficit. Why not, he asked, sell now off-limits lakefront property along the shores of various federal impoundments to the highest bidder. And make those new owners sign irrevocable pledges never to come, hat in hand, to the government if their land floods, sort of a ``You bets your money; you takes your chances'' sort of deal.

"23566"	"he"	"asked"	" As an example, Jones cited his having to use a crutch. Should using the crutch be considered part of his normal stance?

"24939"	"he"	"asked"	" The radio show host, Dan Pierce, went on to question Gingrich's conservative credentials.

And almost every hand went up. These guys made a distinction. Fatherhood meant taking responsibility, providing security and affection, being there, which they'd never seen.

"30575"	"he"	"asked"	" ``It was just after the war, and Martinu wanted to write something very joyful, to have it performed in Prague,'' Firkusny said. ``He came to me every day to show me how it was going. He said he was worried he could not find the right spirit; gloom kept creeping in. Even when he thought he had the right mood for the finale, there would suddenly come this minor key. On the day he brought me the final page, he asked, `Have you seen The Times?' I hadn't. Masaryk had committed suicide, and it was the end of the government in Czechoslovakia. So his minor keys were a premonition.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"

"42312"	"they"	"asked"	" On Sunday, thousands of New York Jews went to Madison Square Garden, still in pain. They were searching for a way to disperse dark clouds that envelop them because of the young Jewish man who gunned down Rabin, saying he had done God's work. While they sang a lilting song of peace, other people were on West 125th Street, walking mostly in silence past the incinerated shell of Freddy's clothing store.

Memo to Don Imus: Two things a radio face should never do are make Don Rickles' speech or wear his tuxedo. But now you know, says the Burned-Out Newspapercreatures Guild, and this is BONG Bull No. 366!  COPY! Mitch Wagner (mitch(underscore)wagner(at)cw.com), senior editor at Computerworld magazine, asks:  ``It would really, really be helpful if I knew what the heck a copyboy was and what they did. I mean, I know that they were putatively boys who were kept on staff to run copy back and forth, and that many of them were newspapermen-in-training, and that they were also called on to do other goferish jobs, such as sobering up reporters after a binge. But beyond that... where did they come from? What did they do while not copyboying? And when did there stop being copyboys? Were there any copygirls?  ``And was the Chief Copyboy ever a copyboy, actually, or is this entirely an honorific?''  The Chief Copyboy replies: Frank Ducceschi, major player at the Port Angeles (Wash.) News and I are the only guys I know personally who really were copyboys, both of us at the (Phoenix) Arizona Journal, which went bust c. 1965. We were students at Arizona State and the pay was $1 an hour, or $31.05 take-home for 40 hours.  Copyboys did whatever an editor said. Carry copy. Get coffee. Run office pools. Type boring agate. Fill gluepots. Cut copy paper from press scrap, change ribbons and paper on tty machines, also blades in wirephoto machines, which made pix on filmy tissue-like wirephoto paper that if someone flicked an ash into a wastebasket full of, got a dandy fire in about a minute, enough time to be far away. Blasting a blazing wastebasket with an extinguisher exploded flaming bits all over the newsroom, which always lightened things up.  There were copygirls at some papers but modern sensitivities made the term untenable, and newspapers found out about unpaid internships which all but did in the title. When they existed, copyboys lived for the chance to do a small story, a phone intvu or some handout rewrites, maybe move up to cub reporter. At the thinly staffed Journal this came easier than most; the city editor was distractible and often a no-show. Either way, many nights that left me as city editor. I never had the guts to pad my resume with the brevet promotion, a sign in itself that I lack executive mien.  One of the two copy editors, a male couple ex of the N.Y. Daily News, used to call me ``Eddie'' all the time. He said he didn't give a damn what my name was, I looked like an Eddie.  MISSISSIPPI BURNING. Mississippi state Rep. Tommy Horne, I-Meridian, has sponsored a bill disallowing any newspaper in that state from publishing unsigned editorials if it refuses to publish unsigned letters to the editor. The Hon. Mr. Horne's constituents must have tired of writing their opinions on unguarded fences and alley walls.  BIG STUFF FIRST. As Frank Dobisky (72764.3542(at)compuserve.com) tells it, his friend the late Mike Knapp was state editor at the Sandusky (Ohio) Register, requiring supervision of a string of country correspondents. One, a guy named Harry, who was in his 80s, was a particularly tough customer and Mike was told not to worry about him. But being young and idealistic, Mike was determined to turn Harry into a first-rate correspondent and spent time teaching him the trade, watching Harry's improvement with pride.  One day, on deadline, Harry called Mike, yelling into the phone, ``Hey, Knapp, I've got six dead chickens out here.''  Mike, frantic and trying to get the paper out, yelled back, ``Harry, I'm on deadline -- why are you bothering me with dead chickens?'' But being a good newspaperman, he asked, ``How'd they die?''  ``Drowned.''  ``Drowned?'' Mike asked.  ``Yeah, it was all that water.''  ``What water, Harry?''  ``Well, fire destroyed the grist mill, and the dam broke and flooded the area.''  Knapp dropped everything, pulled together a great story on deadline and after he got it into the paper, he asked Harry, ``Geez, Harry, great story, but the why the hell call to tell me you got six dead chickens?''  ``Well, Knapp,'' Harry said, ``you told me always to give you the fatals first.''  JOB SECURITY. Seth Sklarey (crissiet(at)ix.netcom.com), recalled, ``Back in the late 1960's just after graduating college I headed to L.A. with a friend, an old time con man and former hard drinking newsman. I noticed some fat partially toothless guy who obviously had a rough life selling the L.A. Times. I remarked to my friend `What ever happened to the kids like in the 1930's movies, who yelled Extra, Extra, read all about it?'''  My friend replied, ``He's one of them. They're still here, he's just gotten older.''  PEN PALS WANTED. Holly Kerfoot, king of the original wire-service clients tickled by the creation of BONG, avers that The Post and Courier in Charleston, S.C., now has its own electronic mailbox (pcdesk(at)postandcourier.com) and welcomes chat from copy editors or sub-editors around the world, ``to share ideas, gripes, jokes, etc.'' And there's also the paper's home page, Charleston.net, a gorgeous and oft-lauded site, he said.  EVERYONE'S A CRITIC. It says in ShopTalk, an Internet newsletter for the broadcast side, that in response to TV critic Tom Shales' Washington Post review of Dateline NBC's Sunday Edition, in which he called the newsmagazine ``junky, gimmicky, and riddled with promos and teasers...,'' the network took out a quarter-page ad in the TV section of The Post. Under the headline, ``Deep Thoughts by Tom Shales,'' the ad listed comments Shales had made in other reviews about other newsmagazines:  Nightline: ``...Neo-news, non-news, a sugary news substitute....''  20/20: ``...Tawdry-tawdry....''  48 Hours: ``...Just doesn't work....''  60 Minutes: ``...May not be so much in the glorious tradition of Edward R. Murrow as it is in the less-glorious tradition of `Wyatt Earp,' `Kojak,' and `Batman.'''  ``Thank you, Mr. Shales,'' the ad read, ``for putting us in such good company.'' Shales said the ad baffled him. An NBC News spokeswoman said that the network only hoped that Shales ``takes the ad as seriously as we take his reviews.''

The Further Adventures of Herman ``Speed'' Graphic, Ace Photographer for the Chagrin Falls Commercial Scimitar, and his Faithful Companion, Typo the Wonder Pig.  PANEL ONE: Scratching his head over the math in an expense report, Speed is startled as Typo enters the photo lab in sunglasses, a beret and ascot tie, an Armani jacket thrown over his shoulders, saying, ``All quiet on the set please!

PANEL THREE: Speed asserts, ``Typo! This is a newspaper office, not a sound stage! Cut it out!''  Typo gasps, ``Ooh, Boss! Don't say `cut' or the directors' guild will be all over you! Here, gimme that trenchcoat, the deathbed gift from an ancient mystic wire service executive editor on a fog-shrouded eastern island! Try on this spacesuit!''  PANEL FOUR: Speed growls, ``Typo, either you cut out this ridiculous stunt or I'm cutting, er, canceling you out of my bar tab at the Bait Shop!''  Resignedly, Typo shouts out the door through a bullhorn, ``All right, Shannen Doherty mode! Break! Take ten, everybody! Spielberg, get me Legal on the blower, please!

Memo to Don Imus: Two things a radio face should never do are make Don Rickles' speech or wear his tuxedo. But now you know, says the Burned-Out Newspapercreatures Guild, and this is BONG Bull No. 366!  COPY! Mitch Wagner (mitch(underscore)wagner(at)cw.com), senior editor at Computerworld magazine, asks:  ``It would really, really be helpful if I knew what the heck a copyboy was and what they did. I mean, I know that they were putatively boys who were kept on staff to run copy back and forth, and that many of them were newspapermen-in-training, and that they were also called on to do other goferish jobs, such as sobering up reporters after a binge. But beyond that... where did they come from? What did they do while not copyboying? And when did there stop being copyboys? Were there any copygirls?  ``And was the Chief Copyboy ever a copyboy, actually, or is this entirely an honorific?''  The Chief Copyboy replies: Frank Ducceschi, major player at the Port Angeles (Wash.) News and I are the only guys I know personally who really were copyboys, both of us at the (Phoenix) Arizona Journal, which went bust c. 1965. We were students at Arizona State and the pay was $1 an hour, or $31.05 take-home for 40 hours.  Copyboys did whatever an editor said. Carry copy. Get coffee. Run office pools. Type boring agate. Fill gluepots. Cut copy paper from press scrap, change ribbons and paper on tty machines, also blades in wirephoto machines, which made pix on filmy tissue-like wirephoto paper that if someone flicked an ash into a wastebasket full of, got a dandy fire in about a minute, enough time to be far away. Blasting a blazing wastebasket with an extinguisher exploded flaming bits all over the newsroom, which always lightened things up.  There were copygirls at some papers but modern sensitivities made the term untenable, and newspapers found out about unpaid internships which all but did in the title. When they existed, copyboys lived for the chance to do a small story, a phone intvu or some handout rewrites, maybe move up to cub reporter. At the thinly staffed Journal this came easier than most; the city editor was distractible and often a no-show. Either way, many nights that left me as city editor. I never had the guts to pad my resume with the brevet promotion, a sign in itself that I lack executive mien.  One of the two copy editors, a male couple ex of the N.Y. Daily News, used to call me ``Eddie'' all the time. He said he didn't give a damn what my name was, I looked like an Eddie.  MISSISSIPPI BURNING. Mississippi state Rep. Tommy Horne, I-Meridian, has sponsored a bill disallowing any newspaper in that state from publishing unsigned editorials if it refuses to publish unsigned letters to the editor. The Hon. Mr. Horne's constituents must have tired of writing their opinions on unguarded fences and alley walls.  BIG STUFF FIRST. As Frank Dobisky (72764.3542(at)compuserve.com) tells it, his friend the late Mike Knapp was state editor at the Sandusky (Ohio) Register, requiring supervision of a string of country correspondents. One, a guy named Harry, who was in his 80s, was a particularly tough customer and Mike was told not to worry about him. But being young and idealistic, Mike was determined to turn Harry into a first-rate correspondent and spent time teaching him the trade, watching Harry's improvement with pride.  One day, on deadline, Harry called Mike, yelling into the phone, ``Hey, Knapp, I've got six dead chickens out here.''  Mike, frantic and trying to get the paper out, yelled back, ``Harry, I'm on deadline -- why are you bothering me with dead chickens?'' But being a good newspaperman, he asked, ``How'd they die?''  ``Drowned.''  ``Drowned?'' Mike asked.  ``Yeah, it was all that water.''  ``What water, Harry?''  ``Well, fire destroyed the grist mill, and the dam broke and flooded the area.''  Knapp dropped everything, pulled together a great story on deadline and after he got it into the paper, he asked Harry, ``Geez, Harry, great story, but the why the hell call to tell me you got six dead chickens?''  ``Well, Knapp,'' Harry said, ``you told me always to give you the fatals first.''  JOB SECURITY. Seth Sklarey (crissiet(at)ix.netcom.com), recalled, ``Back in the late 1960's just after graduating college I headed to L.A. with a friend, an old time con man and former hard drinking newsman. I noticed some fat partially toothless guy who obviously had a rough life selling the L.A. Times. I remarked to my friend `What ever happened to the kids like in the 1930's movies, who yelled Extra, Extra, read all about it?'''  My friend replied, ``He's one of them.

EVERYONE'S A CRITIC. It says in ShopTalk, an Internet newsletter for the broadcast side, that in response to TV critic Tom Shales' Washington Post review of Dateline NBC's Sunday Edition, in which he called the newsmagazine ``junky, gimmicky, and riddled with promos and teasers...,'' the network took out a quarter-page ad in the TV section of The Post. Under the headline, ``Deep Thoughts by Tom Shales,'' the ad listed comments Shales had made in other reviews about other newsmagazines:  Nightline: ``...Neo-news, non-news, a sugary news substitute....''  20/20: ``...Tawdry-tawdry....''  48 Hours: ``...Just doesn't work....''  60 Minutes: ``...May not be so much in the glorious tradition of Edward R. Murrow as it is in the less-glorious tradition of `Wyatt Earp,' `Kojak,' and `Batman.'''  ``Thank you, Mr. Shales,'' the ad read, ``for putting us in such good company.'' Shales said the ad baffled him. An NBC News spokeswoman said that the network only hoped that Shales ``takes the ad as seriously as we take his reviews.''

There were copygirls at some papers but modern sensitivities made the term untenable, and newspapers found out about unpaid internships which all but did in the title.

Mr. Horne's constituents must have tired of writing their opinions on unguarded fences and alley walls.  BIG STUFF FIRST. As Frank Dobisky (72764.3542(at)compuserve.com) tells it, his friend the late Mike Knapp was state editor at the Sandusky (Ohio) Register, requiring supervision of a string of country correspondents. One, a guy named Harry, who was in his 80s, was a particularly tough customer and Mike was told not to worry about him. But being young and idealistic, Mike was determined to turn Harry into a first-rate correspondent and spent time teaching him the trade, watching Harry's improvement with pride.  One day, on deadline, Harry called Mike, yelling into the phone, ``Hey, Knapp, I've got six dead chickens out here.''  Mike, frantic and trying to get the paper out, yelled back, ``Harry, I'm on deadline -- why are you bothering me with dead chickens?'' But being a good newspaperman, he asked, ``How'd they die?''  ``Drowned.''  ``Drowned?'' Mike asked.  ``Yeah, it was all that water.''  ``What water, Harry?''  ``Well, fire destroyed the grist mill, and the dam broke and flooded the area.''  Knapp dropped everything, pulled together a great story on deadline and after he got it into the paper, he asked Harry, ``Geez, Harry, great story, but the why the hell call to tell me you got six dead chickens?''  ``Well, Knapp,'' Harry said, ``you told me always to give you the fatals first.''

But being a good newspaperman, he asked, ``How'd they die?''  ``Drowned.''  ``Drowned?'' Mike asked.  ``Yeah, it was all that water.''  ``What water, Harry?''  ``Well, fire destroyed the grist mill, and the dam broke and flooded the area.''  Knapp dropped everything, pulled together a great story on deadline and after he got it into the paper, he asked Harry, ``Geez, Harry, great story, but the why the hell call to tell me you got six dead chickens?''  ``Well, Knapp,'' Harry said, ``you told me always to give you the fatals first.''

Under the headline, ``Deep Thoughts by Tom Shales,'' the ad listed comments Shales had made in other reviews about other newsmagazines:  Nightline: ``...Neo-news, non-news, a sugary news substitute....''  20/20: ``...Tawdry-tawdry....''  48 Hours: ``...Just doesn't work....''  60 Minutes: ``...May not be so much in the glorious tradition of Edward R.

But now you know, says the Burned-Out Newspapercreatures Guild, and this is BONG Bull No. 366!  COPY! Mitch Wagner (mitch(underscore)wagner(at)cw.com), senior editor at Computerworld magazine, asks:  ``It would really, really be helpful if I knew what the heck a copyboy was and what they did. I mean, I know that they were putatively boys who were kept on staff to run copy back and forth, and that many of them were newspapermen-in-training, and that they were also called on to do other goferish jobs, such as sobering up reporters after a binge. But beyond that... where did they come from? What did they do while not copyboying? And when did there stop being copyboys? Were there any copygirls?  ``And was the Chief Copyboy ever a copyboy, actually, or is this entirely an honorific?''  The Chief Copyboy replies: Frank Ducceschi, major player at the Port Angeles (Wash.) News and I are the only guys I know personally who really were copyboys, both of us at the (Phoenix) Arizona Journal, which went bust c. 1965. We were students at Arizona State and the pay was $1 an hour, or $31.05 take-home for 40 hours.  Copyboys did whatever an editor said. Carry copy. Get coffee. Run office pools. Type boring agate. Fill gluepots. Cut copy paper from press scrap, change ribbons and paper on tty machines, also blades in wirephoto machines, which made pix on filmy tissue-like wirephoto paper that if someone flicked an ash into a wastebasket full of, got a dandy fire in about a minute, enough time to be far away. Blasting a blazing wastebasket with an extinguisher exploded flaming bits all over the newsroom, which always lightened things up.  There were copygirls at some papers but modern sensitivities made the term untenable, and newspapers found out about unpaid internships which all but did in the title. When they existed, copyboys lived for the chance to do a small story, a phone intvu or some handout rewrites, maybe move up to cub reporter. At the thinly staffed Journal this came easier than most; the city editor was distractible and often a no-show. Either way, many nights that left me as city editor. I never had the guts to pad my resume with the brevet promotion, a sign in itself that I lack executive mien.  One of the two copy editors, a male couple ex of the N.Y.

Tommy Horne, I-Meridian, has sponsored a bill disallowing any newspaper in that state from publishing unsigned editorials if it refuses to publish unsigned letters to the editor. The Hon.

As Frank Dobisky (72764.3542(at)compuserve.com) tells it, his friend the late Mike Knapp was state editor at the Sandusky (Ohio) Register, requiring supervision of a string of country correspondents. One, a guy named Harry, who was in his 80s, was a particularly tough customer and Mike was told not to worry about him. But being young and idealistic, Mike was determined to turn Harry into a first-rate correspondent and spent time teaching him the trade, watching Harry's improvement with pride.  One day, on deadline, Harry called Mike, yelling into the phone, ``Hey, Knapp, I've got six dead chickens out here.''

Under the headline, ``Deep Thoughts by Tom Shales,'' the ad listed comments Shales had made in other reviews about other newsmagazines:  Nightline: ``...Neo-news, non-news, a sugary news substitute....''  20/20: ``...Tawdry-tawdry....''  48 Hours: ``...Just doesn't work....''  60 Minutes: ``...May not be so much in the glorious tradition of Edward R.

Shales said the ad baffled him. An NBC News spokeswoman said that the network only hoped that Shales ``takes the ad as seriously as we take his reviews.''

Memo to Don Imus: Two things a radio face should never do are make Don Rickles' speech or wear his tuxedo. But now you know, says the Burned-Out Newspapercreatures Guild, and this is BONG Bull No. 366!  COPY! Mitch Wagner (mitch(underscore)wagner(at)cw.com), senior editor at Computerworld magazine, asks:  ``It would really, really be helpful if I knew what the heck a copyboy was and what they did. I mean, I know that they were putatively boys who were kept on staff to run copy back and forth, and that many of them were newspapermen-in-training, and that they were also called on to do other goferish jobs, such as sobering up reporters after a binge. But beyond that... where did they come from? What did they do while not copyboying? And when did there stop being copyboys? Were there any copygirls?  ``And was the Chief Copyboy ever a copyboy, actually, or is this entirely an honorific?''  The Chief Copyboy replies: Frank Ducceschi, major player at the Port Angeles (Wash.) News and I are the only guys I know personally who really were copyboys, both of us at the (Phoenix) Arizona Journal, which went bust c. 1965. We were students at Arizona State and the pay was $1 an hour, or $31.05 take-home for 40 hours.  Copyboys did whatever an editor said. Carry copy. Get coffee. Run office pools. Type boring agate. Fill gluepots. Cut copy paper from press scrap, change ribbons and paper on tty machines, also blades in wirephoto machines, which made pix on filmy tissue-like wirephoto paper that if someone flicked an ash into a wastebasket full of, got a dandy fire in about a minute, enough time to be far away. Blasting a blazing wastebasket with an extinguisher exploded flaming bits all over the newsroom, which always lightened things up.  There were copygirls at some papers but modern sensitivities made the term untenable, and newspapers found out about unpaid internships which all but did in the title. When they existed, copyboys lived for the chance to do a small story, a phone intvu or some handout rewrites, maybe move up to cub reporter. At the thinly staffed Journal this came easier than most; the city editor was distractible and often a no-show. Either way, many nights that left me as city editor. I never had the guts to pad my resume with the brevet promotion, a sign in itself that I lack executive mien.  One of the two copy editors, a male couple ex of the N.Y. Daily News, used to call me ``Eddie'' all the time. He said he didn't give a damn what my name was, I looked like an Eddie.  MISSISSIPPI BURNING. Mississippi state Rep. Tommy Horne, I-Meridian, has sponsored a bill disallowing any newspaper in that state from publishing unsigned editorials if it refuses to publish unsigned letters to the editor. The Hon. Mr. Horne's constituents must have tired of writing their opinions on unguarded fences and alley walls.  BIG STUFF FIRST. As Frank Dobisky (72764.3542(at)compuserve.com) tells it, his friend the late Mike Knapp was state editor at the Sandusky (Ohio) Register, requiring supervision of a string of country correspondents. One, a guy named Harry, who was in his 80s, was a particularly tough customer and Mike was told not to worry about him. But being young and idealistic, Mike was determined to turn Harry into a first-rate correspondent and spent time teaching him the trade, watching Harry's improvement with pride.  One day, on deadline, Harry called Mike, yelling into the phone, ``Hey, Knapp, I've got six dead chickens out here.''  Mike, frantic and trying to get the paper out, yelled back, ``Harry, I'm on deadline -- why are you bothering me with dead chickens?'' But being a good newspaperman, he asked, ``How'd they die?''  ``Drowned.''  ``Drowned?'' Mike asked.  ``Yeah, it was all that water.''  ``What water, Harry?''  ``Well, fire destroyed the grist mill, and the dam broke and flooded the area.''  Knapp dropped everything, pulled together a great story on deadline and after he got it into the paper, he asked Harry, ``Geez, Harry, great story, but the why the hell call to tell me you got six dead chickens?''  ``Well, Knapp,'' Harry said, ``you told me always to give you the fatals first.''

Seth Sklarey (crissiet(at)ix.netcom.com), recalled, ``Back in the late 1960's just after graduating college I headed to L.A. with a friend, an old time con man and former hard drinking newsman.

I remarked to my friend `What ever happened to the kids like in the 1930's movies, who yelled Extra, Extra, read all about it?'''  My friend replied, ``He's one of them.

But now you know, says the Burned-Out Newspapercreatures Guild, and this is BONG Bull No. 366!  COPY! Mitch Wagner (mitch(underscore)wagner(at)cw.com), senior editor at Computerworld magazine, asks:  ``It would really, really be helpful if I knew what the heck a copyboy was and what they did. I mean, I know that they were putatively boys who were kept on staff to run copy back and forth, and that many of them were newspapermen-in-training, and that they were also called on to do other goferish jobs, such as sobering up reporters after a binge. But beyond that... where did they come from? What did they do while not copyboying? And when did there stop being copyboys? Were there any copygirls?  ``And was the Chief Copyboy ever a copyboy, actually, or is this entirely an honorific?''  The Chief Copyboy replies: Frank Ducceschi, major player at the Port Angeles (Wash.) News and I are the only guys I know personally who really were copyboys, both of us at the (Phoenix) Arizona Journal, which went bust c. 1965. We were students at Arizona State and the pay was $1 an hour, or $31.05 take-home for 40 hours.  Copyboys did whatever an editor said. Carry copy. Get coffee. Run office pools. Type boring agate. Fill gluepots. Cut copy paper from press scrap, change ribbons and paper on tty machines, also blades in wirephoto machines, which made pix on filmy tissue-like wirephoto paper that if someone flicked an ash into a wastebasket full of, got a dandy fire in about a minute, enough time to be far away. Blasting a blazing wastebasket with an extinguisher exploded flaming bits all over the newsroom, which always lightened things up.  There were copygirls at some papers but modern sensitivities made the term untenable, and newspapers found out about unpaid internships which all but did in the title. When they existed, copyboys lived for the chance to do a small story, a phone intvu or some handout rewrites, maybe move up to cub reporter. At the thinly staffed Journal this came easier than most; the city editor was distractible and often a no-show. Either way, many nights that left me as city editor. I never had the guts to pad my resume with the brevet promotion, a sign in itself that I lack executive mien.  One of the two copy editors, a male couple ex of the N.Y. Daily News, used to call me ``Eddie'' all the time. He said he didn't give a damn what my name was, I looked like an Eddie.  MISSISSIPPI BURNING. Mississippi state Rep. Tommy Horne, I-Meridian, has sponsored a bill disallowing any newspaper in that state from publishing unsigned editorials if it refuses to publish unsigned letters to the editor. The Hon. Mr. Horne's constituents must have tired of writing their opinions on unguarded fences and alley walls.  BIG STUFF FIRST. As Frank Dobisky (72764.3542(at)compuserve.com) tells it, his friend the late Mike Knapp was state editor at the Sandusky (Ohio) Register, requiring supervision of a string of country correspondents. One, a guy named Harry, who was in his 80s, was a particularly tough customer and Mike was told not to worry about him. But being young and idealistic, Mike was determined to turn Harry into a first-rate correspondent and spent time teaching him the trade, watching Harry's improvement with pride.  One day, on deadline, Harry called Mike, yelling into the phone, ``Hey, Knapp, I've got six dead chickens out here.''  Mike, frantic and trying to get the paper out, yelled back, ``Harry, I'm on deadline -- why are you bothering me with dead chickens?'' But being a good newspaperman, he asked, ``How'd they die?''  ``Drowned.''  ``Drowned?'' Mike asked.  ``Yeah, it was all that water.''  ``What water, Harry?''  ``Well, fire destroyed the grist mill, and the dam broke and flooded the area.''  Knapp dropped everything, pulled together a great story on deadline and after he got it into the paper, he asked Harry, ``Geez, Harry, great story, but the why the hell call to tell me you got six dead chickens?''  ``Well, Knapp,'' Harry said, ``you told me always to give you the fatals first.''  JOB SECURITY. Seth Sklarey (crissiet(at)ix.netcom.com), recalled, ``Back in the late 1960's just after graduating college I headed to L.A. with a friend, an old time con man and former hard drinking newsman. I noticed some fat partially toothless guy who obviously had a rough life selling the L.A. Times. I remarked to my friend `What ever happened to the kids like in the 1930's movies, who yelled Extra, Extra, read all about it?'''  My friend replied, ``He's one of them.

EVERYONE'S A CRITIC. It says in ShopTalk, an Internet newsletter for the broadcast side, that in response to TV critic Tom Shales' Washington Post review of Dateline NBC's Sunday Edition, in which he called the newsmagazine ``junky, gimmicky, and riddled with promos and teasers...,'' the network took out a quarter-page ad in the TV section of The Post. Under the headline, ``Deep Thoughts by Tom Shales,'' the ad listed comments Shales had made in other reviews about other newsmagazines:  Nightline: ``...Neo-news, non-news, a sugary news substitute....''  20/20: ``...Tawdry-tawdry....''  48 Hours: ``...Just doesn't work....''  60 Minutes: ``...May not be so much in the glorious tradition of Edward R. Murrow as it is in the less-glorious tradition of `Wyatt Earp,' `Kojak,' and `Batman.'''  ``Thank you, Mr. Shales,'' the ad read, ``for putting us in such good company.'' Shales said the ad baffled him. An NBC News spokeswoman said that the network only hoped that Shales ``takes the ad as seriously as we take his reviews.''

But beyond that... where did they come from? What did they do while not copyboying? And when did there stop being copyboys? Were there any copygirls?  ``And was the Chief Copyboy ever a copyboy, actually, or is this entirely an honorific?''  The Chief Copyboy replies: Frank Ducceschi, major player at the Port Angeles (Wash.) News and I are the only guys I know personally who really were copyboys, both of us at the (Phoenix) Arizona Journal, which went bust c. 1965. We were students at Arizona State and the pay was $1 an hour, or $31.05 take-home for 40 hours.  Copyboys did whatever an editor said. Carry copy. Get coffee. Run office pools. Type boring agate. Fill gluepots. Cut copy paper from press scrap, change ribbons and paper on tty machines, also blades in wirephoto machines, which made pix on filmy tissue-like wirephoto paper that if someone flicked an ash into a wastebasket full of, got a dandy fire in about a minute, enough time to be far away. Blasting a blazing wastebasket with an extinguisher exploded flaming bits all over the newsroom, which always lightened things up.  There were copygirls at some papers but modern sensitivities made the term untenable, and newspapers found out about unpaid internships which all but did in the title. When they existed, copyboys lived for the chance to do a small story, a phone intvu or some handout rewrites, maybe move up to cub reporter. At the thinly staffed Journal this came easier than most; the city editor was distractible and often a no-show. Either way, many nights that left me as city editor. I never had the guts to pad my resume with the brevet promotion, a sign in itself that I lack executive mien.  One of the two copy editors, a male couple ex of the N.Y. Daily News, used to call me ``Eddie'' all the time. He said he didn't give a damn what my name was, I looked like an Eddie.  MISSISSIPPI BURNING. Mississippi state Rep. Tommy Horne, I-Meridian, has sponsored a bill disallowing any newspaper in that state from publishing unsigned editorials if it refuses to publish unsigned letters to the editor. The Hon. Mr. Horne's constituents must have tired of writing their opinions on unguarded fences and alley walls.  BIG STUFF FIRST. As Frank Dobisky (72764.3542(at)compuserve.com) tells it, his friend the late Mike Knapp was state editor at the Sandusky (Ohio) Register, requiring supervision of a string of country correspondents. One, a guy named Harry, who was in his 80s, was a particularly tough customer and Mike was told not to worry about him. But being young and idealistic, Mike was determined to turn Harry into a first-rate correspondent and spent time teaching him the trade, watching Harry's improvement with pride.  One day, on deadline, Harry called Mike, yelling into the phone, ``Hey, Knapp, I've got six dead chickens out here.''  Mike, frantic and trying to get the paper out, yelled back, ``Harry, I'm on deadline -- why are you bothering me with dead chickens?'' But being a good newspaperman, he asked, ``How'd they die?''  ``Drowned.''  ``Drowned?'' Mike asked.  ``Yeah, it was all that water.''  ``What water, Harry?''  ``Well, fire destroyed the grist mill, and the dam broke and flooded the area.''  Knapp dropped everything, pulled together a great story on deadline and after he got it into the paper, he asked Harry, ``Geez, Harry, great story, but the why the hell call to tell me you got six dead chickens?''  ``Well, Knapp,'' Harry said, ``you told me always to give you the fatals first.''  JOB SECURITY. Seth Sklarey (crissiet(at)ix.netcom.com), recalled, ``Back in the late 1960's just after graduating college I headed to L.A. with a friend, an old time con man and former hard drinking newsman. I noticed some fat partially toothless guy who obviously had a rough life selling the L.A. Times. I remarked to my friend `What ever happened to the kids like in the 1930's movies, who yelled Extra, Extra, read all about it?'''  My friend replied, ``He's one of them. They're still here, he's just gotten older.''  PEN PALS WANTED. Holly Kerfoot, king of the original wire-service clients tickled by the creation of BONG, avers that The Post and Courier in Charleston, S.C., now has its own electronic mailbox (pcdesk(at)postandcourier.com) and welcomes chat from copy editors or sub-editors around the world, ``to share ideas, gripes, jokes, etc.'' And there's also the paper's home page, Charleston.net, a gorgeous and oft-lauded site, he said.  EVERYONE'S A CRITIC. It says in ShopTalk, an Internet newsletter for the broadcast side, that in response to TV critic Tom Shales' Washington Post review of Dateline NBC's Sunday Edition, in which he called the newsmagazine ``junky, gimmicky, and riddled with promos and teasers...,'' the network took out a quarter-page ad in the TV section of The Post. Under the headline, ``Deep Thoughts by Tom Shales,'' the ad listed comments Shales had made in other reviews about other newsmagazines:  Nightline: ``...Neo-news, non-news, a sugary news substitute....''  20/20: ``...Tawdry-tawdry....''  48 Hours: ``...Just doesn't work....''  60 Minutes: ``...May not be so much in the glorious tradition of Edward R. Murrow as it is in the less-glorious tradition of `Wyatt Earp,' `Kojak,' and `Batman.'''  ``Thank you, Mr. Shales,'' the ad read, ``for putting us in such good company.'' Shales said the ad baffled him. An NBC News spokeswoman said that the network only hoped that Shales ``takes the ad as seriously as we take his reviews.''

The Further Adventures of Herman ``Speed'' Graphic, Ace Photographer for the Chagrin Falls Commercial Scimitar, and his Faithful Companion, Typo the Wonder Pig.  PANEL ONE: Scratching his head over the math in an expense report, Speed is startled as Typo enters the photo lab in sunglasses, a beret and ascot tie, an Armani jacket thrown over his shoulders, saying, ``All quiet on the set please! Lighting, a little less on the pale extra! Makeup! Refreshments!''  PANEL TWO: Speed demands, ``Typo! What is this!?'' Typo elucidates, ``Shh, Boss! Did you see how the pig did at the Oscars? Seen the trades? I've got 'em believing I taught the kid everything he knows! We're shooting a pilot and I just found out what a Key Grip and a Best Boy are! I'm on the Inside!''  PANEL THREE: Speed asserts, ``Typo! This is a newspaper office, not a sound stage! Cut it out!''  Typo gasps, ``Ooh, Boss! Don't say `cut' or the directors' guild will be all over you! Here, gimme that trenchcoat, the deathbed gift from an ancient mystic wire service executive editor on a fog-shrouded eastern island! Try on this spacesuit!''  PANEL FOUR: Speed growls, ``Typo, either you cut out this ridiculous stunt or I'm cutting, er, canceling you out of my bar tab at the Bait Shop!''  Resignedly, Typo shouts out the door through a bullhorn, ``All right, Shannen Doherty mode! Break! Take ten, everybody! Spielberg, get me Legal on the blower, please! Lucas, no robots on the set, I said!''  PANEL FIVE: Speed declares to a sulking pal, ``I don't mean to spoil your fantasy, Typo!''  Typo replies, ``Drama, Boss, it's a drama! And it isn't that! I'm just wondering what to tell Features Editor Hyperba Lee's agent when she finds out what she's wearing for the love scene!''

Curious what a Portuguese shepherd would keep with him for sustenance so far from the nearest village, I asked, through gestures, whether I might have a peek inside.

Dr. Patrick Walsh, a urologist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, who wrote an editorial accompanying Johansson's study, said the patient population in Sweden was different from that in the United States. The men there are older, Walsh said, and so they are more likely to die with, and not of, their cancers.

The N.Y. Times News Service Night Supervisor is Patricia Ryan. (212-556-1927).  INTERNATIONAL  (Will move in ``i'' news file.)  CHINA-U.S.-RIGHTS (Beijing) _ After seven months of secret diplomacy, U.S. and Chinese officials seem to be within striking distance of a breakthrough in their long-standing dispute on human rights, which centers on the fate of thousands of political and religious dissidents held in prisons, labor camps or just at home under heavy guard or surveillance. By Patrick E. Tyler.  CHINA-STUDENTS (Beijing) _ Students returned to Beijing University from the New Year's holiday to find that their normally chaotic central bulletin board, in the past a center of protest, covered with official tributes to Deng in a move by university officials to pre-empt any upsetting student initiatives. By Seth Faison.  RUSSIA-BREAD (Moscow) _ Russian bread, a rich black symbol of the health of the motherland, has suddenly come under siege. Not long ago, Moscow's chief food inspector, Vladimir Nikitin, announced after a routine tour of the city's many new small bakeries that one quarter of the 2,500 tons of bread made in Moscow each day is ``unsuitable for use as food.'' Viktor Petrenko, director of Bread Factory No. 9, said, ``if we lose the battle for bread we will lose our heritage.'' It is simply impossible to exaggerate the role of plain, chewy black bread in the life of Russia or its people. By Michael Specter.  WASHINGTON  (Will move in ``w'' news file.)  CAMPAIGN-FINANCING (Washington) _ A rising chorus of prominent Democrats and Republicans predicted Sunday that Attorney General Janet Reno would ultimately have no choice but to recommend the appointment of a new independent counsel to investigate the growing number of questionable campaign fund-raising practices.

Theologians, scientists, and ethicists could hardly believe it _ a scientist in Scotland has actually cloned an animal. And now, they asked, what lies ahead for the human race? By Gina Kolata.  SHANKER-REACT (Undated) _ The educational philosophies espoused by Albert Shanker, the longtime president of the American Federation of Teachers, were not singular. The goals articulated by him were not unique, but the authority and eloquence with which he delineated his visions and crusaded to turn them into reality were perhaps nonpareil in the world of American education, many educational leaders said Sunday.

NYC-HOUSING (New York) _ Facing stiff reductions in federal aid, the sprawling New York City Housing Authority says it is exploring turning over some of its high-rise buildings to private managers.

"89285"	"he"	"asked"	" One of the local village health workers trained by Eigege, Amos Yusef, also made a pitch for assistance. Yusef pleaded alternatively with his mentor and the other visitors to give him and other volunteers bicycles. Global 2000 had always given bicycles to village volunteers, he said.

"90622"	"they"	"asked"	" When I met him, Chandler didn't disappoint me. At 72, even after a legendary goring by a recalcitrant musk ox, he was tall, athletic, and very smart. He regaled me with stories about a 1960s-era East Coast shopping trip, flush with swag from a Times-Mirror stock offering, when he tried to buy the Globe. (He had to settle for the Baltimore Sun, the Hartford Courant, and Newsday.) He recalled a hilarious meeting at what could only be the Somerset Club, where the assembled Brahmins condescended to him as a ``California surfer guy.'' Chandler picked up the story: ``Inevitably, they asked, `Where'd you go to school?' I said, `I went to Andover.' `You went to Andover? Chauncey, come over here!' It was crazy! All of a sudden I was OK in their eyes. And then I said I went to Stanford. `Well, it's not Harvard, Otis, but Stanford's all right . . .' '' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"

Soon we were tasting one filled with candied melon and peanut, another with red bean. As a cake was firming up in one of the circular molds on the griddle, he asked, ``How do you get it out?''

"92036"	"we"	"asked"	" ``Sometime over the summer, we asked, `What else can we do to help?' or they asked us, `Can you do something else to help?''' Silverman recalled in an interview. ``And when we said we'd be willing to do more, they told us to give to the county.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"

"106104"	"he"	"asked"	" Some of the seminal work began quietly more than 20 years ago. Dr. Claude Bouchard, who now directs the Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University, had previously studied obese people by putting them in a metabolic ward where he could keep track of what they ate and how many calories they burned.

At best, I was told, they were ``deviants.'' But there are two kinds of deviants _ deviants who believe what everyone else around them believes and the only difference is that they act on it, and deviants who believe in things no one around them does. If they were deviants, I asked, why did an American hospital worker here tell me he was appalled to see Saudi doctors and nurses around him celebrating on 9/11? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"107434"	"I"	"asked"	" I was told this was not the true feeling here. I was told the hijackers were actually educated in America. I was told they were sent by Mossad or the CIA. I was told in one session that the Jews control the U.S. government and that was the real problem, a statement that prompted me to walk out. I was told the hijackers were responding to Arab anger over blind U.S. support for Israel's brutality to Palestinians. If that was the case, I asked, why did Osama bin Laden say that what motivated him was a desire to drive the U.S. out of Arabia and topple the corrupt Saudi ruling family?

"114726"	"they"	"asked"	" With vivid memories of US complicity in the toppling of elected governments in Chile, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic, politicians throughout Latin America had good reason to question the depth of Washington's support of democracy. Critics around the world blasted the Bush administration for hypocrisy.

"118813"	"I"	"asked"	" I caught up with McCullough a few days ago at Northeastern University, where he received an honorary degree. Isn't it inevitable, I asked, that someone will write something really nasty about Adams, now that you have been so nice to him?

"119961"	"he"	"asked"	" But there's another agenda here that could lead to a fairly drastic change in the NBA's current racial balance. This season, Jerry Reynolds, the director of player personnel for the Kings, heralded the rise of European players. He talked about the lack of fundamental skills of young players in this country and derided the myth of the so-called street edge of the inner-city player.

"121602"	"he"	"asked"	" A result, as Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said last week, is that ``a major battle is brewing'' upon the Senate's return. Gramm, sponsor of the administration's legislation in the Senate, gave a depiction of the issue that shows why the two sides are so far apart. Why, he asked, should department workers protecting the nation not be like the Marines, who go where they are told and can be discharged for poor performance? By contrast, he said, Border Patrol agents cannot be easily moved around the country to respond to security needs without going through an elaborate transfer process, and civil service workers are very hard to dismiss. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"122047"	"he"	"asked"	" Thomas also pooh-poohed Westacott's argument about the golden rule. ``What happens to philosophers?'' he asked with a laugh, ridiculing the notion that there was a serious moral choice between following the wishes about the person being gossiped about or the person listening to the gossip.

"122674"	"they"	"asked"	" Several readers objected, saying that buy-and-hold investing isn't a good strategy for everyone. For example, they asked, what about someone who invested in high-flying growth stocks at the market top in March 2000?

"123458"	"he"	"asked"	" When a team underachieves like the Mets have, there are always questions raised about whether players care about what is happening on the field. The Mets players have been offended by characterizations that they are indifferent, and yet some of their priorities do seem misplaced. When one player learned last week _ in the midst of the losing streak _ that the Mets would be off Thursday, the last day of games before the strike deadline, he asked, ``Are we going to get paid for Thursday?'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"

But that wasn't going to get in the way of Mia Kaminsky's mission. The curly-headed 26-year-old quickly surveyed the hard-drinking crowd and set off toward a very vocal group of guys.

A good cook was not one of them.  Her custard was always curdled. Her fried chicken was always hard and tough, and her pie crust always soggy.  Boiling _ that was her forte. Boiled potatoes, peas, green beans. She was best at cooking things that could be put in a pot with a piece of salt pork and water, and boiled for several hours.  The most exotic thing she ever cooked was ``hash.'' Ground beef cooked with potatoes and onions until it was mush.  Her mother and sisters were great cooks. Granny never seemed to notice that she wasn't a very good cook, and naturally, we did our best not to indicate that everything she cooked wasn't the best we ever had.  My sister Darla slipped up one day when Granny was ``teaching'' her how to make banana pudding, despite the fact that even though Darla was just a kid, she already knew how to make banana pudding. A much better banana pudding than her grandmother. We all did.  Darla just went along, as if she didn't know how.  When Granny told Darla to add the egg yolks to the hot milk and sugar mixture }7:4ed) Darla tried to ignore her.  She was spooning some of the hot mixture in with the egg yolks when Granny kept telling her to just to pour them into the pan. Darla was beginning to get exasperated.  ``If I do it that way, it will come out just like yours!'' Darla finally blurted out.  We immediately froze with horror.  There was no hope that Granny hadn't notice. A disturbing little cloud was already shadowing her face.  What did Darla mean, she asked, ``just like mine?''  ``I mean . . . it won't be . . . it'll be... uh, nothing,'' Darla said. ``I'll just stir in the eggs.''  But it was too late. Granny turned to me with a questioning look.  I stared back, blankly, trying to look normal, trying not to betray the fact that Darla had just let out the biggest cat we had in the bag.  ``Uh. . . I don't know what she's talking about.'' Wow. That was original.  I quickly searched my brain for a way to divert her attention away from Darla's failure to keep her big trap shut.  ``You remember that pudding you made one time with the pineapple in it?'' I said enthusiastically. ``That was really good.''  Darla was studiously stirring the custard, which was beginning to curdle nicely.  ``Hey, you know what would be good for dinner Granny? Hash! We haven't had that in a long time. I'll go crawl under the house right now and find some potatoes and an onion.''  Yeah, I'd gladly crawl under a house chock full of granddaddy long legs rather than stay in that kitchen another minute.  Maybe while I was gone, Darla would tell Granny that her tuna salad tasted like cat food, too, and clear all the skeletons out of the pantry.  It wasn't that we were afraid of making Granny mad. I don't remember ever seeing her angry. She was always easy-going, never complained, never had an unkind word to say about anybody.  Not that she didn't have plenty to complain about. She existed on a small social security check and whatever she could grow in her garden.  It took her all year to save up enough money to buy each of her eight grandchildren a pair of socks for Christmas.  No, we were afraid of hurting Granny's feelings. We didn't care if she couldn't boil water (although she did excel at that). We'd eat chicken fried to the consistency of jerky rather than do that.  Granny gave Darla the benebidof a doubt.  Things settled down, and Granny continued to make grainy banana pudding, mushy green beans and soggy pies.  And relished every bite.

NY-CROWN-HEIGHTS-TRIAL (New York) _ Through 12 years and two trials, lawyers for Lemrick Nelson Jr. denied that he stabbed an Orthodox Jew named Yankel Rosenbaum during the 1991 racial unrest in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. On Monday, in the opening of the third trial in the killing, Nelson's legal team tried out a new defense. Nelson did stab Rosenbaum, they said, but not because he was Jewish. Rather, Nelson, who was then 16, stabbed Rosenbaum because he was drunk and swept up in the chaos of the moment, said his lawyer, Richard Jasper. Therefore, Nelson was not guilty of violating Rosenbaum's civil rights, which is the crime he is being tried for ``not homicide, not manslaughter, not assault.'' By Andy Newman.

She ignored them. ``It wasn't natural,'' Sue Harmon said Thursday. The last contact they had with her was at the funeral, and then they were not allowed to even speak with her alone. Just like the police, the Harmons say they have always had doubts about Melinda Raisch's version of their son's death. ``There were a lot of questions about the veracity of her story,'' John Harmon said. Why would intruders kill one person, they asked, and leave another alive as a witness? ``It just doesn't hold water,'' John Harmon said. Although they liked their daughter-in-law, the Harmons said they always thought that she and their son were too young when they married. They were teens when they met at a church camp in New York state. They were barely in their 20s when they married. The couple moved from New York to Olathe after their marriage in 1977. ``It never leaves you,'' Sue Harmon said of the pain of losing a child. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200312.gz"

They say that journalists' liberal bias has colored the reviews of the Democratic convention and his speech.  But do journalists really want John Kerry to defeat George W. Bush? It depends where they work and how you ask the question, at least according to the unscientific survey we conducted last weekend during a press party at the convention. We got anonymous answers from 153 journalists, about a third of them based in Washington.  When asked who would be a better president, the journalists from outside the Beltway picked Kerry 3-1, and the ones from Washington favored him 12-1. Those results jibe with previous surveys over the past two decades showing that journalists tend to be Democrats, especially the ones based in Washington. Some surveys have found that more than 80 percent of the Beltway press corps votes Democratic.  But political ideology isn't the only possible bias. Journalists also have a professional bias: They need good stories to make the front page and get on the air. Campaign reporters are often accused of going after any candidate who's pulling far ahead and threatening to consign their work to oblivion.  So we asked our respondents which administration they'd prefer to cover the next four years strictly from a journalistic standpoint. We expected the Washington journalists to strongly prefer Kerry, partly because they complain so much about the difficulty of getting leaks from the Bush White House, but mainly because any change in administration means lots of news.  Sure enough, the Washington respondents said they would rather cover Kerry, but by a fairly small amount, 27-21, and the other journalists picked Bush, 56-40. (A few others had no opinion.) The overall result was 77 for Bush, 67 for Kerry.  Why stick with the Bush administration? You can't ask for a richer cast of characters to cover, one Washington correspondent said. Kerry will be a bore after these guys.  Since presidential relatives are such a rich source of embarrassing stories, we asked the journalists to predict which ones would make the most interesting news. The clear favorites were the Bush twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, probably because of their proven track record (brushes with authorities over under-age drinking). They got 74 votes. Teresa Heinz Kerry was next, with 39.  Liberals complained in 2000 that Bush got off easy because he was better than Al Gore at charming reporters. So we tried to test for a likeability bias. With which presidential nominee, we asked, would you rather be stranded on a desert island? Kerry was the choice of both groups: 31-17 among the Washington journalists, and 51-39 among the others.  Bush's religious streak would drive me nuts on a desert island, one Florida correspondent said.  TOO RICH FOR MY TAX CUTS  In his speech at the convention, Bill Clinton delighted the crowd by complaining about the unnecessary tax cuts he had received. At a breakfast with Florida delegates, the actor Ben Affleck got into specifics, explaining that the Bush tax cuts had provided him with $1 million last year that he didn't need.  It was a smart strategy to please the Democratic faithful in Boston, but it may raise a question for some voters: If you're so opposed to your tax cut, why not give it back?  We asked Affleck if he had considered sending the $1 million back to Washington. No, he said. I'm not Jesus Christ of the tax code. I can't completely martyr myself.  'PARADISE LOST' FOR THE MODERN DAY  If you think that today's staged political conventions aren't what they used to be, you're not looking back far enough. Pitt Harding argues that the gathering in Boston was remarkably similar to the first and greatest convention of them all: the assembly of the fallen angels in Paradise Lost.  Harding, a Milton scholar at Jacksonville State University in Alabama, does not mean to suggest that there is anything demonic about Democrats. He is a Democrat himself. But he can't help pointing to certain parallels and wondering if Kerry should have borrowed Thursday night from the poem's most charismatic orator.  When the devils convene in Pandemonium, a hall even more chaotic than the FleetCenter, their base is energized with rage against the militarist they blame for unfairly defeating them and ruling dictatorially. There are deep divisions in the party -- some want all-out war with God, others are doves -- but Satan unites them with two classic techniques.  One is his rhetorical skill: He spake: and, to confirm his words, out-flew/Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs/Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze/Far round illumin'd hell.  Just like delegates waving placards, but it would look even better on television.  The other technique is a scripted convention. Satan doesn't want any surprise votes or divisive debates on the party platform. He allows a few rivals to give speeches early in the gathering, but prime time is reserved for a speech by his aide Beelzebub, who straddles the hawk-dove divide by proposing a coalition-building compromise: Send someone to the newly created creatures on earth to seduce them to our party. But who will undertake the dreadful voyage to reach these swing voters? Before anyone else volunteers, Satan accepts the nomination.  In his acceptance speech, he describes the horrors of the trip ahead and rouses the conventioneers with Milton's best red-meat line, one with just the sort of locution that would sound natural from Kerry: I abroad/Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek/Deliverance for us all.  What better line for a nominee about to embark on a coast-to-coast bus trip? </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20040731.0088 type=story > <HEADLINE> BUSH, KERRY AND THEIR BICYCLES </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> CRAWFORD, Texas </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"

NEW YORK -  Dear Diary:  One recent afternoon, I was waiting in line at the silver counter at Tiffany. A woman ahead of me had just bought a bracelet and was filling out a gift card. She looked up and asked the salesclerk, How do you spell 'bar mitzvah'? The salesclerk didn't hear her. I intervened.  I explained: Well, 'bar mitzvah' is for a boy. 'Bas mitzvah' is for a girl. So you should say 'Happy bas mitzvah.' She thanked me, then I asked, Do you know if they are Sephardic or Ashkenazic?  Her face dropped. Oh my, I have no idea. Does it matter? she asked.  I replied: No, not for the purpose of a gift. But if they are Ashkenazic, it's bas mitzvah, Sephardic is bat mitzvah.  So how do I spell it? she asked. I told her. She smiled and said: I'm visiting from Milwaukee. Thank you for all this information, it's so interesting. She looked a bit sheepish and said, I don't know any of this; I'm a Catholic.  I said, So am I.  Surprised, she asked, My goodness, how do you know all this information?  My husband, Craig, was returning to Ohio from a conference in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and was scheduled to catch a connecting flight at Kennedy Airport. A serious storm developed in Pennsylvania, and his flight was delayed and eventually canceled.  By this time, it was late in the evening and hotel rooms were scarce, but he did find one available five minutes from the airport. The taxi driver, a recent immigrant, was unsure of the hotel location. So my husband called me at home on his cell phone. I quickly logged on to the hotel's Web site and obtained the address for the driver.  Quite a few minutes later, the phone rang again. We've been circling, and spotted it once on the other side of the expressway, but can't get there from here, my husband said. I logged on again and relayed driving directions, turn by turn, to my husband, who passed the information on to the driver. The hotel was reached.  The apologetic driver refused to charge a fare. He received a nice tip and everyone was happy. I never imagined that I would be guiding a New York cabby from my computer in Ohio.  To the man (and the sexist in me presumes it is a man) who left the dozen red roses on the 5:26 train to Port Washington out of Pennsylvania Station: my wife appreciated them. After I collected the healthy kiss that a dozen unexpected roses is guaranteed to earn, I told her the truth -- roses looking lost and forlorn in an empty car at the last stop. My apologies, but Lost and Found did not seem appropriate. And if your intended recipient did not believe your story of lost roses, you can always show her/him this little note.  I recently joined an Internet people locator service in hopes of finding old friends who graduated with me from PS 144 in Brooklyn in January 1944. It gave me the names of six people who were in my class, and listed mine with them.  I did not recognize any of the names. No Billy Bikoff, no Abe Rosenblatt. About a week after joining, I got a phone call from a PS 144 grad whose name I did not recall. He said he'd come into town and we could have lunch and reminisce.  On the day arranged, he showed up at my apartment, and we went to a local spot for lunch. I immediately asked about my boyhood pals; he'd never heard of them. He asked about his friends. Nope, I never knew them. How about Mr. Gross? I asked. Great teacher. In fifth and sixth grade.  No, I said, in Brooklyn on Howard Avenue and Prospect Place.  It turns out that 144 is one of many repeated numbers in the school system.  At a recent matinee of Wonderful Town at the Al Hirschfeld Theater, my husband and I took the opportunity to show our children, Naomi and Perry, ages 8 and 11, the hidden Ninas in the Hirschfeld drawings on the lobby walls.  I explained to them that when I was about their age, on every Sunday, my family would eagerly pore over the newspaper, which usually ran a drawing with a theater review, and we would inevitably receive phone calls from friends who would either tell us how many Ninas they had found or ask whether we had found any more.  This story was all very exciting to our children, since my name is Nina. They ran from drawing to drawing, finding the hidden Ninas. A man who had been standing nearby ventured over to the kids to find out what their excitement was all about. They explained the rules of the game and he thought it was marvelous. To my surprise, he had never heard of this phenomenon. (I, of course, was shocked that the whole world didn't know about the artist's including the name of his daughter in his drawings.)  The man raced over to his wife and kids, pulled them over to the drawings, and started to explain the game to them. I was pleased to know that in a matter of minutes, a New York tradition had not only been passed to another generation, but to another family, who were clearly not from New York.  - NINA KELLER </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20040815.0072 type=story > <HEADLINE> WEATHER </HEADLINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"

"168476"	"he"	"asked"	" Robert W. Wilson, a longtime City Opera benefactor, said, It has probably discouraged customers. Why, he asked, would people want to go into a substandard opera house? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"
"168500"	"she"	"asked"	" It's the hobby of the high-strung. What's fear to Henin-Hardenne? Her only trepidation is letting up. Borne of her tortured complexity, frivolity equates to weakness. Sharapova retreats from a match with ease. Go ahead, she is itching to be Punk'd. She can dish out what she takes. When one reporter badgered her about the decibel levels of her grunts, she asked, What newspaper are you from? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"
"168836"	"he"	"asked"	" Spillane took issue with those who complained that his books had too much sex. How could there be sex, he asked, when so many women were shot? He noted the conspicuous role women played among his victims: Mary (abandoned), Anne L. (drowned in a bathtub), Lola (fatally stabbed), Ethel (whipped before she was shot), Marsha (shot) and Ellen (like Mary, given the heave-ho). </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"
"168837"	"she"	"asked"	" In I, the Jury, Hammer became so angry at a female psychiatrist that he shot her in her stark naked stomach. (Stark naked was a phrase that Spillane rather liked.) As she died, she asked, Mike, how could you? To which Hammer replied, It was easy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"
"171164"	"he"	"asked"	" Concern over the operation's legality was reflected in an e-mail sent Jan. 30 by Kevin T. Hunsaker, a senior counsel in Hewlett-Packard's legal department and the company's chief ethics officer, to Anthony R. Gentilucci, the company's manager of global investigations. Referring about a Boston-area private detective the company had hired, Ronald R. DeLia, he asked, How does Ron get cell and home phone records? Is it all above board? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171178"	"he"	"asked"	" When Martin Indyk, the former Mideast negotiator and U.S. ambassador to Israel, told Ahmadinejad that his country did everything possible to destroy efforts to bring peace between Israel and the Palestinians, Ahmadinejad shot back, If you believe Iran is the reason for the failure, you are making a second mistake. Why, he asked, should the Palestinians be asked to pay for an event they had nothing to do with in World War II, saying that they had nothing to do with the systematic killing of Jews -- if those killings, he added, happened at all. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"172095"	"I"	"asked"	" As my husband and I walked past the cottage toward the gazebo at the back of the gardens, I asked, Can we get married again? Here? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172777"	"I"	"asked"	" When I got here 8 years ago, I asked, 'how do we measure this program?,' said Dan Davis, Ford's director of racing technology. They said 'win on Sunday, sell on Monday ... and everybody else does it. It's a test of manhood, testosterone.' I said, 'That's interesting, how do I go to upper management and tell them I'm spending their money wisely?' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172897"	"he"	"asked"	" But after two to three years, the effectiveness of these drugs wane. What would happen, he asked, if the drug works for a few years, people eat a lousy diet, and then resveratrol loses its effectiveness? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173260"	"he"	"asked"	" David Barna, the chief spokesman for the National Park Service, agreed. With the budget shortage, he asked, do we fix the gutters on Independence Hall, so it won't be destroyed, or do we put millions into restoring these beach houses, which weren't even their architects' most important works? Leasing, he said, is beginning to sound promising. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173340"	"she"	"asked"	" In a speech two years ago, she asked, Did my early struggles for survival impel me towards empathy with similar struggles of others, even further afield, more vulnerable, grappling with poverty and insecurity? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173468"	"he"	"asked"	" In an interview later, he asked, Do we want to go into '08 with a C-minus general at the DNC? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173500"	"they"	"asked"	" Professor Robert Solow of MIT, a Nobel laureate himself, and other liberal economists continued to raise questions about Friedman's theories: Did not Reagan, and by extension Friedman, they asked, revert to Keynesianism once in power? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173538"	"they"	"asked"	" Professor Robert Solow of MIT, a Nobel laureate himself, and other liberal economists continued to raise questions about Friedman's theories: Did not President Reagan, and by extension Friedman, they asked, revert to Keynesianism once in power? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173833"	"they"	"asked"	" An interesting and not unexpected aspect of the Matsuzaka portion of the posting game arose Tuesday. It didn't take long for the conspiracy theorists to emerge. What if, they asked, the Red Sox were unable to sign Matsuzaka but negotiated a working agreement with Seibu. Japanese teams have had working agreements with major league teams. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173875"	"they"	"asked"	" Chris Rosenbloom, Ph.D., R.D., is a professor of nutrition in the College of Health and Human Sciences at Georgia State University.

BUSH (Amman, Jordan) -- The first meeting in a scheduled two-day summit meeting between President Bush and Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki of Iraq was canceled at the last minute on Wednesday evening, as Iraqi legislators and Cabinet officials loyal to anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr said Wednesday that they had suspended their participation in the government because al-Maliki had ignored their previous request to cancel his meeting with Bush in Jordan. On Wednesday, the joint session in Amman was abruptly called off while Bush was in the air, flying to Amman from Riga, Latvia. Bush and al-Maliki still intend, however, to have breakfast on Thursday morning. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.  With photos NYT25-26.  (Editors: The previously skedded story IRAQ folds into this article.)  IRAQ-POLICY (Washington) -- Anticipating the final report of the Iraq Study Group, which is to be delivered to President Bush next week. Staff bylines TK.  (Scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in i news file.)  CHEAP-LAPTOPS (Cambridge, Mass.) -- When computer industry executives heard about a plan to build a $100 laptop for the developing world's children, they generally ridiculed the idea. How could you build such a computer, they asked, when screens alone cost about $100? Techincal advances have allowed the project, One Laptop Per Child, to win over many skeptics over the last two and a half years. The cost is now closer to $150. For all its promise, the effort, conceived by Nicholas Negroponte, a prominent computer researcher, has become a focal point of a debate over the value of computers to both learning and economic development. By John Markoff.  With photo.  PLASTIC-SURGEONS-SWITCH (Undated) -- Five years ago, cosmetic medicine was primarily the domain of plastic surgeons, facial surgeons and dermatologists -- medical school graduates who undergo several years of specialized training in facial skin and physiognomy. But now obstetricians, family practitioners and emergency room physicians are flocking to the beauty business, lured by the lucre of cosmetic treatments that require same-day payments and by a medical lifestyle without bothersome midnight emergency calls. By Natasha Singer.  NY-POLICE-COMMISSIONER (New Yorker) -- With a self-confidence that strikes some New Yorkers as imperious, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly has overseen the city streets for five years as something of a global warrior against terrorism. He has created a network of police agents stationed overseas, recruited former CIA officers, and built a 1,000-member terror unit that is without precedent here. Yet over the last few days, Kelly has had to return to an earlier, less novel role: The public face of a police department involved in yet another fatal shooting that has produced the combustible mix of race, politics, and the police's use of deadly force. By Patrick Healy.  With photo.  WALMART (Undated) -- Everyone expected Wal-Mart to own the holiday season -- a reasonable assumption, given that the nation's largest retailer can offer the deepest discounts to consumers who are willing to camp outside its stores for door-buster deals. But this heartwarming storyline has turned into heartburn for investors. The company's sales for the month of November, to be reported Wednesday, are expected to fall for the first time in a decade. Its share has slipped 6 percent in the past month. And it has turned off many shoppers with trendy Seventh Avenue fashions and disruptive store renovations. By Michael Barbaro.  TERROR-SETTLE (Washington) -- The Justice Department agreed Wednesday to pay $2 million to a Portland, Ore., attorney wrongly linked to the 2004 terrorist bombings in Madrid, Spain, and issued a formal apology for the suffering caused by his mistaken arrest. The settlement caps a two and a half-year ordeal for the lawyer, Brandon Mayfield, in which he went from suspected al-Qaida operative to a symbol to many of government overzealousness in the war on terrorism. By Eric Lichtblau.  IRAN-U.S.-LETTER (Beirut, Lebanon) -- Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, told the American people on Wednesday that he was certain they rejected Israel, the war in Iraq and curtailed civil liberties, and he urged them to work with him to reverse President Bush's policies. The call came in the form of a six-page letter in English addressed to Noble Americans that discussed the many wars and calamities caused by the U.S. administration. It suggested that Americans were hoodwinked into accepting their government's policies, especially support for Israel. By Michael Slackman.  SCOTUS-CLIMATE (Washington) -- The Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday in a case about the Bush administration's refusal to regulate automobile emissions that contribute to global. By Linda Greenhouse.  ANCIENT-COMPUTER (Undated) -- A century ago, pieces of a strange mechanism with bronze gears and dials were recovered from an ancient shipwreck off the coast of Greece. Historians of science concluded that this was an instrument that calculated and illustrated astronomical information, particularly phases of the Moon and planetary motions, in the second century B.C. The Antikythera Mechanism, sometimes called the world's first computer, has now been examined with the latest technology. A team of British, Greek and American researchers was able to decipher many inscriptions and reconstruct the gear functions, revealing, they said, an unexpected degree of technical sophistication for the period.

Cloud.  (Scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in i news file.)  With inset at fold:  BUSH (Amman, Jordan) -- Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki of Iraq and King Abdullah II of Jordan canceled a meeting with President Bush at the last minute on Wednesday, against the backdrop of a boycott of the Maliki government by a radical Shiite cleric and the disclosure of a classified White House memo that was highly critical of al-Maliki. Bush and al-Maliki were still scheduled to have breakfast together here on Thursday morning, and to hold a joint press conference afterward. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.
