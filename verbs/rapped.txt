"129746"	"they"	"rapped"	" Mizell himself was a subject of many of the band's rhymes. In the song ``Jam Master Jay'' from the band's first record, they rapped, ```Behind the turntables is where he stands / Then there is the movement of his hands / So when asked who's the best, y'all should say: / `Run-DMC and Jam Master Jay''' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"155589"	"he"	"rapped"	" Now that he's got a name, West also has an image and maybe even an image problem. Because his lyrics sometimes hint at social and political protest, he is often invoked as the answer to whatever is supposedly troubling hip-hop. (At Live 8 in Philadelphia, he rapped, Drug dealer buys Jordans, crackhead buys crack/ And George Bush gets paid off o' all o' that.) And because his public appearances suggest that he doesn't underrate his own music, he's also known as a big-headed new star, the kind of sore winner who protests about not getting enough awards. In other words, he's thought of as both a solution and a problem, which means he must be doing something right. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
