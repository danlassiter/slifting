"102615"	"they"	"spar"	" ``Tape'' is a reunion story that tests the limits of responsibility, memory and friendship. Vince (Hawke), an Oakland volunteer fireman who supports his altruistic career by dealing drugs, has traveled to Lansing for his high school friend Jon's debut in a local film festival. But as they meet in Vince's motel room, the undercurrent of animosity is undeniable. Jon rejects Vince's amiable, but possibly loaded, offer to get high and Jon condescendingly voices his regret that Vince never made more of himself. They banter, they spar, they even wrestle, until the source of Vince's long-held annoyance surfaces. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
