"170176"	"you"	"lie"	" This being the Teamsters, a union of 1.4 million truck drivers and loading dock workers, no one expected the campaign to be warm and fuzzy and full of politesse. The Hoffa camp has branded Leedham a three-time loser who spends every day tearing down our union, while Leedham has accused Hoffa of outrageous lies, saying, When you can't run on your record, you lie, spin and go negative. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"

While the school board will technically be in charge of collective bargaining, the superintendent will have more authority over the budget. I don't consider UTLA a threat, Reed said. There are going to be a lot of issues that have to be worked out between the board and superintendent with respect to how to make the budgetary aspect of the settlement fit. School board member David Tokofsky said he welcomes Johnson's return to UTLA but believes everyone needs to be realistic about district finances. If he brings an emphasis on reality, it's all the more welcome, Tokofsky said. If anybody thinks there's 20 percent to pay for salary benefits, class-size reduction and local control, to use Wayne Johnson's 1989 words: 'They lie, they lie, they lie.' Duffy said there is money to meet teachers' demands if the district cuts its bureaucracy. His goal is for LAUSD and UTLA negotiators to come up with a plan to dismantle the bureaucracy. In order for us to drag this district into the 21st century, the bureaucrats need to understand that breaking the bureaucracy is a critical element, Duffy said. He is scheduled to have dinner this week with Brewer -- a retired Navy admiral -- and plans to express his views and concerns. Duffy said he also plans to question Brewer about statements last week that one of Brewer's first priorities will be to get ineffective teachers out of the classroom. The ball's going to be in his court. He's going to understand lingo that has to do with war. You can have war. You can have peace. It's entirely up to you, Duffy said. But he and the other people in the district need to understand that teachers are ... angry, and they want to be regarded as professionals, and they're not going to accept anything different. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20061030.0037 type=story > <HEADLINE> GALA CELEBRATES RETURN OF ICONIC OBSERVATORY </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> LOS ANGELES </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
