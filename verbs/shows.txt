"54023"	"he"	"shows"	" It was done, he shows, by average Germans, not just some SS troopers in jackboots. They could commit this monstrousness of thought and act because for more than a century German anti-Semitism entrenched into German culture _ by officialdom, churches, schools, families _ grew around the ``concept'' that Jews were non-human enemies, vermin carrying death to all nations. From this came what he calls the ``eliminationist'' lust to drive them entirely out of society. From there, it was a short step toward annihilation; vermin. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"

The American general commanding the largest ground offensive of the Afghan war said new intelligence showed that Taliban and Al Qaeda forces holed up in eastern mountains had been joined by hundreds of fighters after local leaders called for a holy war against the United States. (Staff byline TK)  (EDS: An early version of this story will move by 3 p.m. ET.)  TERROR-MACEDONIA (Skopje, Macedonia) _ The war on terrorism here is taking a murky turn here with the killing of seven Pakistanis, but so far the case has raised more questions than it has answered. By Ian Fisher.  MIDEAST (Dateline TK) _ Developments: Israeli forces swept through the Gaza Strip in a hunt for militants and faced Palestinian accusations they tried to wipe out a dozen security chiefs in a missile strike in a burst of deadly reprisals. By James Bennet.  WEST-BANK-CONCERT (Jerusalem) _ The Israeli conductor Daniel Barenboim, music director of the Berlin State Opera, postponed a concert planned for Wednesday in Ramallah, after the Israeli government refused to approve the trip, saying it could not guarantee his safety. By Joel Greenberg.  TERROR-U.N. (United Nations) _ U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan speaks at the Council on Foreign Relations Wednesday night, saying that terrorism and poverty are not necessarily linked, and most conflict is caused by bad governance. Annan also says he is urging the Security Council to look ahead and intervene earlier in potential trouble spots, not merely react. By Barbara Crossette.  INDIA-UNREST (Ahmedabad, India) _ Scene from a cemetery where the bodies of charred children were brought by truck for burial. Plus other developments on the government's compensation for victims. By Celia W. Dugger.  INDIA-ROY (Ahmedabad, India) _ Award-winning novelist Arundhati Roy was convicted of criminal contempt of India's Supreme Court after she suggested the panel wanted to ``muzzle dissent'' By Celia W. Dugger.  CHINA-MILITARY (Beijing) _ China is increasing its military spending this year by 17.6 percent, or $3 billion, bringing the publicly reported total to $20 billion, the finance minister announced on Wednesday. By Erik Eckholm.  ZIMBABWE-ELECT (Harare, Zimbabwe) _ Examining the legal and logistical barriers the government has put in place that may keep MDC supporters from casting their votes on election day. By Rachel L. Swarns.  MILOSEVIC-WARCRIMES (The Hague, Netherlands) _ The judge in the war crimes tribunal denies former Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic's request to be released while preparing his case. Other developments. By Marlise Simons.  WORLD-BRIEFS (Undated) _ World news in brief.  UNITED STATES _ General (``a'' code)  CALIF-ELN (Los Angeles) _ Leading Republicans say Bill Simon Jr.'s upset victory in the Republican primary may dash the hopes of the GOP to defeat Gov. Gray Davis. The White House, humiliated by loss by Richard Riordan, scrambles to make amends with Simon. By Richard L. Berke.  SCI-UTERUS-TRANSPLANT (Undated) _ Saudi Arabian doctors perform the first uterus transplant in a human being. Though only successful for three months, the surgery is considered a hopeful advance for some women, particularly in the Muslim world, which frowns on surrogate motherhood. By Denise Grady.  SCI-DIRTY-NUKES (Washington) _ The Senate Foreign Relations Committee holds hearings on the threat of ``dirty nukes.'' By James Glanz.  SCI-ANTHRAX-VACCINE (Washington) _ The Institute of Medicine reports on the efficacy and safety of the licensed anthrax vaccine. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.  SCI-MARROW-STEM-CELLS (Undated) _ Researchers say adult bone marrow may produce stem cells _ a possible way around extracting them from embryos. By Nicholas Wade.  SCI-ASSISTED-REPRODUCTION (Undated) _ Studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine find that infants born through assisted reproduction have substantially higher rates of low birth weight and birth defects, even when factors like multiple births are accounted for. By Gina Kolata.  SCI-HUMAN-ORIGINS (Undated) _ A new genetic analysis shakes up the predominant ``Out of Africa'' theory of human migration.

UNITED STATES _ Washington (``w'' code)  BUSINESS (``f'' code)  ENRON (Washington) _ A ledeall on developments in the collapse of Enron and the investigations. By Richard A. Oppel Jr.  ECON-OUTLOOK (Woodbridge, N.J.) _ The U.S. economy has recovered unexpectedly quickly, with most analysts agreeing that respectable GDP growth began a quarter earlier than expected. What's behind the quick turnaround? Consumers did not shrink from spending after Sept. 11 as many forecasters had predicted _ instead they starting buying with patriotic fervor. Perhaps more important, productivity gains have been strong since the third quarter of 2001. Companies that learned to produce more with fewer workers should be able to carry those lessons of efficiency into the future, when unemployment returns to more normal levels. By Daniel Altman.  MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST (Washington) _ The endgame in the Microsoft antitrust case begins Wednesday. At a hearing before Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the U.S. District Court in Washington, the Justice Department and Microsoft will make their case that their antitrust settlement is good for the economy and consumers. The judge must approve or reject the deal, and her questioning may shed some light on how she will eventually rule. Still, more than five weeks hearings on the additional antitrust sanctions that the nine dissenting states are seeking will begin next week, which means this final phase has a long way to go. By Stephen Labaton.  STEEL-RUSSIA (Moscow) _ The Koreans, Brazilians and Chinese may be annoyed at President Bush's new steel tariffs, but the Russians are apoplectic. This isn't just a trade spat, they say, it's a profound political betrayal of a country that had bent over backwards to help America with cheap oil and support in Central Asia, and now feels stabbed in the back. By Sabrina Tavernise.  HEWLETT-COMPAQ (San Francisco) _ More on the fight to win approval for Hewlett-Packard's proposed acquisition of Compaq Computer. By Chris Gaither.  SUPERLUXURY-CARS (Geneva) _ Cars that start at $100,000? European car makers are finding robust growth in the superluxury car market, and have introduced a new Rolls-Royce, a new Bentley and other revamped, venerable models in pursuit of that profitable niche. Some were shown at the Geneva Auto Show this week. By Edmund L. Andrews.  KOREA-BANKS (Seoul, South Korea) _ The South Korean government announces a plan to return the banks it took over in the latest economic crisis back to the private sector _ but not to get out of the bank-owning business completely. By Don Kirk.  WORLD-BIZ-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Short items on business news from around the world.  ENTERTAINMENT/ARTS (``e'' unless otherwise indicated)  MCEWAN-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ian McEwan's remarkable new novel ``Atonement'' is a love story, a war story and a story about the destructive powers of the imagination. It is also a novel that takes all of the author's perennial themes _ dealing with the hazards of innocence, the hold of time past over time present and the intrusion of evil into ordinary lives _ and orchestrates them into a symphonic work that is every bit as affecting as it is gripping. It is, in short, a tour de force. Reviewed by Michiko Kakutani.  AUSTRALIA-CUBE (Sydney, Australia) _ Cubism, or at least a cube, has adopted the art critic Robert Hughes as a subject. Hughes, 63, the New York-based author and art critic for Time magazine, is the subject in his native Australia of an artwork he might scrutinize as a reviewer. It dramatizes the highway crash that nearly killed him on May 28, 1999, and continues the controversy provoked here by his outspoken responses to the charge of reckless driving that followed that accident. By John Shaw.  ABRAHAM-AUSTRIA (New York) _ Raimund Abraham, the architect of the Austrian Cultural Institute, which opens here next month, has compared the building's tilting zinc facade to the slicing blades of a guillotine. The imagery may be severe but it serves Austria's ambition to shed its quaint Old World reputation _ land of marzipan sculptures and flouncy waltzes _ and update it with something unmistakably contemporary. But on March 1, a month before the building's debut as Austria's showcase abroad, Abraham, who has been living and teaching in New York City for 30 years, renounced his Austrian citizenship and became an American. The move was a carefully deliberated reaction to a government that he feels is out of keeping with the culturally open-minded country he loves. By Julie V. Iovine.  (With an ``l'' lifestyle code)  WILSON-MISSISSPPI (Undated) _ Going home to Mississippi with Cassandra Wilson, the jazz vocalist, who has lived for the last 19 years in New York. Last August, after a string of eclectic albums that prompted Time magazine to name her America's best singer, she returned to Mississippi to record her 14th album, ``Belly of the Sun,'' in a converted train station in Clarksdale. The album is due out on March 26. By John Leland.  (With an ``l'' lifestyle code)  COMMENTARY (``k'' code)  Op-Ed columns by William Safire and Bob Herbert.
