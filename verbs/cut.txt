According to a survey by state officials conducted in 1994, just as the effort to enlist the private sector in policing the shops was getting under way, 90 percent of them worked in sweatshop conditions that flouted state and federal wage and safety laws. Even sewing shops that stay within the law rarely offer their employees paid vacations or health benefits. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"
