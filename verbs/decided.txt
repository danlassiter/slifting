"24744"	"he"	"decided"	" After laying off for the most part last season, Charlotte owner George Shin,according to sources in that city, is again applying the heavy hand. After initially turning down the job, former San Antonio general manager Bob Bass accepted the post of Hornets personnel director, only a couple of days after Indiana assistant George Irvine interviewed for the post ... Don't weep too much for the Pacers. They'll have some flexibility in the offseason, starting with the fact that the contracts of Vern Fleming,Haywoode Workman,LaSalle Thompson and Sam Mitchell are up. Workman has the best crack at being re-signed, while Fleming (a salary slot of $1.7 million) and Thompson ($2.15 million) will be gone. Mitchell was a solid role player at $850,000 but it's clear Indiana needs more scorers to take the pressure off Reggie Miller. Rik Smits is too foul-prone, Derrick McKey can't or won't step up, and Byron Scott had a horrendous postseason. Look for both Scott and Duane Ferrell to be left unprotected in the expansion draft ... Many clubs put their heads together in Chicago to draw up some early mock drafts, and the consensus at the moment is that Golden State will use the No. 1 pick to take Joe Smith. That, of course, is subject to last-minute changes (see Orlando, circa 1993, and its flip-flop on Chris Webber and Anfernee Hardaway) ... How big is Bobby Hurley in Jersey? He sprained his ankle playing pick-up basketball and it made headlines ... After Miami general manager Dave Wohl canvassed the colleges testing out coaching candidates, he decided, sources said, on Cincinnati's Bob Huggins. But Huggins has been offered a lucrative 10-year extension from Cincy that he plans to sign in the coming days. You can be sure there are escape clauses galore in the document, because even though Huggins passed this time, many feel he'll make the jump to the NBA in the next five years. Remember, Huggins already has fielded past overtures from heavy hitters like Jerry West ... Sasha Danilovic was expected to sign with the Heat sometime in July but is unhappy with Miami's assessment of his financial worth ... Remember the name Dejan Bodiroga,because he's hoping to be in the NBA next season. Bodiroga, a Serb who played in Milan last season, just turned 22 and can play three positions _ the point, 2-guard and small forward. (He's projected as a 2-guard in the NBA.) He was unable to attend the Chicago predraft camp because he was with the Serbian national team. The Celtics have seen him, and like him _ perhaps as their second-round pick?. His absence in Chicago obviously hurt him and could make him available there ... Everyone loves Ed O'Bannon's presence, and his enthusiasm, but it's no secret he has a bad knee, and that could hurt him dearly on draft day ... Just wondering, but doesn't a three-year contract extension for Jan Volk make it easy for him to mind the store while Carr is busy coaching? In fact, I'll upgrade my bet that Carr will take the job. Last week I offered a hot fudge sundae; this week, I'm throwing in lunch at the Ritz. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950610.0413 type=story > <HEADLINE> MANTLE'S STORY COULDN'T BE WRITTEN TODAY </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> BOSTON (BC-BBA-RYANCOLUMN-BOS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

Times News Service  NEW YORK _ When the curtain comes down on the matinee of ``Crazy for You'' on Sunday, Pia Zadora, who joined the cast of the Broadway musical last week, will dash off _ to the altar. She is getting married on that day to Jonathan Kaufer, a director and screenwriter.  ``The show ends at 5:45, I'll wipe off the makeup, slip on my new dress and say `I do,' at 7 p.m.,'' she said the other day. ``I have an hour, so I can even take a nap.''  The wedding, in a little town house in Manhattan, will be very small, she said; just family and close friends.  The couple originally planned to be wed in Los Angeles in May and then in August, ``but we couldn't get it together,'' she said.  ``Then this show came up,'' she said, ``and we wanted to get settled before the school year started and other men proposed to me.''  She has two children, Kady, 10, and Kristofer, 8, from her marriage to Meshulam Riklis, the financier, which ended in divorce nine months ago. She noted that Kaufer, 40, is only six months older than she, a marked contrast to her first husband, 71.  But she and Riklis have remained friendly. ``We were married for 17 years and together for 21, so when we were divorced, he offered to adopt me,'' she said.  c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  NEW YORK _ New York Jets quarterback Boomer Esiason has ventured into new terrain: he has written a children's book, ``A Boy Named Boomer,'' that has been published by Scholastic Inc.  Intended for children in the first and second grades, it is a compilation of recollections of his childhood, ranging from family outings to his realization that he had a talent for sports to his embarrassment over a Valentine's gift he gave a girl.  ``Every story in it is true,'' Esiason said the other day during a break from football practice. ``I wonder if that girl, Cindy Huner, has a child who will read the book.''  He agreed to do the project on the condition that proceeds go to the Boomer Esiason Heroes Foundation that he established two years ago to finance research into cystic fibrosis. His 4-year-old son, Gunnar, has the disease.  ``I also wanted to show kids that someone they might look up to such as a football player does normal things,'' he said. ``The message is that I was a normal little boy with no silver spoon in my mouth. I had the same quirky things they have going for them.''  He said he hopes the book will be a hit, but added, ``I don't know if I want to go any further with writing than this. This is safe. My critics will all be 6 years old and they don't know any better.''  c.1995 N.Y. TImes News Service  Elsa Klensch, who has had a weekly show about fashion on CNN since the day the station went on the air, June 1, 1980, estimates that she has seen 10,000 fashion shows, and probably interviewed 500 designers over the years.  Finally, she decided, it was time to distill some of what she has learned into a practical guide for women. She has written a book called ``Style'' that has been published by the Berkley Publishing Group.  ``Everywhere I go, I am deluged with questions,'' she said the other day. ``I wanted to do a book that would help women understand how to put themselves together. You really can improve your position in the world by having style. It sets you apart, makes you an individual.''  Style, she explained, is not synonymous with fashion. ``Fashion is what designers produce twice a year,'' she said. ``Style is how a woman interprets that fashion and makes it her own.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950820.0133 type=story > <HEADLINE> CONSOLATION FOR DAWES </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> NEW ORLEANS (BC-GYM-U.S.-FINALS-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"

"58158"	"I"	"decided"	" If I had ever seen someone put canvas on a canoe, I might have tried it. On the other hand, some library research indicated that it would have required evicting both cars from the garage for a period of a few months, constructing a pair of simple clamps to hold the canvas suspended off the floor, putting eye bolts into the sides of the garage (to hang the canvased canoe), and purchasing several pieces of chain and a chain-fall (or come-along) to stretch the canvas while putting a few hundred pounds of something into the canoe to push it down into its canvas hammock, soon to be its canvas skin. Then there would be a month or more while the canvas filler (a smelly, oil-based compound) dried. Given the household opinion about what garages are and are not for, I decided, with some regret, that canvasing, compounding, and painting a canoe was something I'd do better to observe than to perpetrate, which was when I met Bill Clements, boatbuilder. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"

Texans will have just as many children, but the slowing economy may squelch the torrent of people moving here to find work, in turn slowing housing construction and the spread of suburbs. ``The slowdown of the economy is happening in many parts of the state,'' said Steve Murdock, director of the Texas State Data Center. Texas would add about 3.3 million people by 2010 in the research center's moderate-growth scenario, reaching a population of 24.2 million. Tarrant County would add about 200,000 and reach 1.7 million. By JEFF CLAASSEN and JENNIFER AUTREY.  TRUCKERS-SUIT  UNDATED: A class-action lawsuit filed Tuesday in Brownsville accuses the U.S. Department of Transportation of racial discrimination over the past six years against Mexican trucking companies for denying them access to U.S. trade allowed by the North American Free Trade Agreement. Filed in federal District Court, the suit asks for $4 billion in lost revenue for nearly 200 Mexican nationals who have applied for permits in the past six years to drive their trucks into the United States or to operate U.S.-based trucking companies. By KAREN BROOKS.  PRIEST-TRIAL  FORT WORTH, Texas _ Conservative Episcopal priest Samuel Lee Edwards will face a rare church trial in the Fort Worth Diocese on charges of pastoring a church in a diocese 1,400 miles away without a license. Edwards is accused of ignoring an order from the Rev. Jane Holmes Dixon, the acting Bishop of the Washington, D.C., Diocese who refused to approve Edwards' request to pastor Christ Episcopal Church in Accokeek, Md. In a fight that heightened the international dispute between those who want to preserve church traditions and those who desire innovations, a standing committee of the Fort Worth diocese considered three charges against Edwards. The committee dismissed two of the charges, but said the priest will face the charge of violating canon rules against officiating more than two months without a license in a diocese without authority. Edwards was licensed in the Fort Worth Diocese but not in Washington. By BRETT HOFFMAN.

An epiphany on the home front, if you will. I was late to the marvel of Martha when I first encountered her 15 years ago. I had been working in Europe, and the GIs I wrote for there didn't care if they had 300-count Egyptian cotton sheets in the barracks; well, maybe they did but their sergeants didn't, so it was a don't-ask, don't-tell situation. So it's 15 years ago, I'm just back in the States and on my desk appear two videotapes of a blonde in Laura Ashley, spinning sugar and showing off the smokehouse her brother built behind her historic farmhouse. She's serving soup out of a pumpkin from her garden, and her china cabinet houses the Horchow collection. It was disbelief at first sight. By BEVERLY BUNDY.  E N T E R T A I N M E N T  FILM-ASTIN  UNDATED: Sean Astin has a secret, which he reveals kind of sheepishly. The 29-year-old actor, who is one of the stars of the ``Lord of the Rings'' trilogy, heard about the movie before he had ever heard of the J.R.R. Tolkien books on which the films were based. ``I studied history and English at UCLA,'' he says, during a phone interview, ``so it's appalling that I'd never even heard of the books, on one hand. But I also feel like I was able to recognize where Tolkien was borrowing from other fables. From Norse mythology and Greek mythology and history and prehistory.'' By ROBERT PHILPOT.  TOLKIEN'S-LEGACY  UNDATED: British critic Germaine Greer may have won the prize for condescending commentary when, in 1997, she wrote, ``It has been my nightmare that Tolkien would turn out to be the most influential writer of the 20th century. The bad dream has materialized.'' More than a quarter of a century after his death, J.R.R. Tolkien remains one of the most widely read figures in literary history _ and also one of the most reviled. And with the release Wednesday of the motion picture ``The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,'' based on the first part of his epic fantasy trilogy, he is back in the forefront of literary debate.

Toyota, which holds more than 40 percent of the Japanese market, expects sales to rise 2 percent when including subsidiaries, Daihatsu and Hino. Exports are expected to fall 10 percent, but Toyota will offset the decline by increasing output at its plants overseas by 16 percent. Honda, meanwhile, expects global sales to rise 6 percent in 2002.  JAPAN: SONY LEADS GAME MAKERS  The Sony Corp. has sold 1.5 million PlayStation 2 video game consoles since Thanksgiving, giving it a lead over Nintendo, which markets the GameCube, and Microsoft, with its Xbox. Since introducing the game console in March 2000, Sony has sold more than 20 million units, about a third of those in the United States. However, in November, Nintendo and Microsoft started selling their own game machines, which have sold more than 1 million units each. In response, Sony has lowered the price of its consoles in some markets.  JAPAN: GOLDMAN MAY BE FINED  Japan's top financial market watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, asked the government to punish the Japanese subsidiary of Goldman, Sachs, accusing it of violating rules on selling stocks short. The commission accused the broker of failing to declare more than 2,300 of those trades between late 1998 and July 2001. The findings are the result of a four-month investigation.  CHINA: TV RIGHTS GRANTED  The Star TV unit of the News Corp. has been granted rights for a new Chinese language entertainment channel in a small area of China's Guangdong Province. Similar rights were granted to the company's 38 percent-owned Phoenix Satellite Television affiliate in October. AOL Time Warner was also granted the rights in October. The rights, which allow cable systems in the Pearl River delta north of Hong Kong to distribute Star TV's new channel, are considered commercially insignificant because of the limited size of the Pearl River delta market. As part of the agreement, the Fox Cable Networks unit of the News Corp. will carry China Central Television's English language channel CCTV 9 in the United States. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20011219.0226 type=other > <DATELINE>  (BC-SILICON-DATA-COX-1223) </DATELINE> <TEXT> DATA SHOW JUMP IN SILICON VALLEY UNEMPLOYMENT With SILICON-SLUMP mainbar; DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (a) national and (f) financial categories; For release Sunday, Dec. 23 c.2001 Cox News Service  With a recession and the tech industry slump, five times as many people are out of work in Silicon Valley than were out of work a year ago.

The Court of Cassation, the country's highest appeals court, postponed until Jan. 16 a decision on whether to overturn his conviction on charges of defaming Egypt by suggesting parliamentary elections have been marred by vote fraud. He was sentenced to seven years in prison.  EUROPE  MILOSEVIC PROSECUTOR WANTS ONE TRIAL  The prosecutor of Slobodan Milosevic filed an appeal of a ruling by the U.N. war crimes tribunal that the former Yugoslav president should face two trials rather than one. Carla Del Ponte had argued that the conflicts and charges of war crimes in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo all belonged in one trial because they were part of the same strategy by Milosevic to create what he saw as an ethnically pure Greater Serbia. The court ruled last week that the links among Milosevic's indictments were ``too nebulous'' to deal with in one trial, and that two trials would be fairer for Milosevic and more manageable.  RUSSIA: TALKS WITH U.S. ON IRAQ  U.S. and Russian officials opened talks at the Foreign Ministry on the situation in Iraq, including sanctions against Saddam Hussein's government and aid to the country's citizens. A Foreign Ministry statement said that the Kremlin was ready for serious work with Washington on problems in Iraq but that Russia's support for suspending economic sanctions had not changed. John S. Wolf, an assistant secretary of state, is representing the United States in the talks.  ESTONIA: PREMIER TO STEP DOWN  Prime Minister Mart Laar said he would resign on Jan. 8 after a disclosure that one party of his three-party governing coalition had deserted to the opposition. The defection of the Reform Party leaves Laar with the support of his own Pro Patria Union and the coalition's third member, the Moderate Party. Laar's decision means Estonia's Cabinet also must resign.  CZECH REPUBLIC: FEARS OF TERROR ATTACK  The government said it would like Radio Free Europe to move its headquarters away from downtown Prague. Prime Minister Milos Zeman said the government feared the network, which broadcasts to Iran, Iraq and Central Asia, as well as to the former Soviet bloc, could be the target of a terrorist attack. Since Sept. 11, Czech paratroopers and armored vehicles patrol the headquarters. Some analysts noted that the government does not like the independence of the radio's Czech-language broadcasts and believes the broadcasts to the Middle East have hurt its commercial contacts there. Officials of Radio Free Europe, which is financed by the U.S. Congress, say they will consider a move if it will not affect their broadcasts.  ASIA  INDIA: NO EXCEPTIONS ON SACRED COWS  The government of India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, completely banned the slaughter of cows, even those that are sickly or produce no milk.

, he said,	 In the interview, Saeed said Iraq had used companies to purchase equipment with U.N. blessing, and then secretly used the equipment in its unconventional weapons program. One such firm, he said, was Leycochem, a construction materials company based in Cologne, Germany, that has long done business in Baghdad and other Middle Eastern countries. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz
, he said,	 Most of the time, he said, no research or development was going on at those places while he visited, because his work involved preparing the rooms to be used for such dangerous research. Saeed said that his company had specialized in filling cement cracks in the floors and walls of such facilities, lining their floors and walls with layers of epoxy paste and other substances that would prevent leaks and enable them to be easily decontaminated, and injecting cement walls and floors with additives to resist chemical corrosion. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

He said that he did not know what the boxes contained. ``But my assumption is that there was radiation there,'' he said. ``Why else use the lead?'' These particular wells contained no water, he said, and part of his work involved sealing the ventilation pipe that emerged from the ground next to the wells.

After his imprisonment _ he said he did not know the precise reason _ he fled the country with $18,000 and two kilograms of gold, ``a fraction of what I own,'' he said.

The Meikle gold mine near Carlin, Nev. is one of many operated by Barrick Gold. Barrick is the world's No. 2 producer, after AngloGold. Workers in the mine in Nov. 1996.

It is the season, after all, of greeting cards. A coming-of-age story set on an island off Maine during the first year of American involvement in World War II, the show is ostensibly based on a 1971 novel by Herman Raucher.

That's all there is to say, really.'' What distinguished Heifetz from other violinists was a command of the fundamentals as perfect as Joe DiMaggio's swing or the form of an egg. The perfection was caused by birth that endowed Heifetz with reflexes and small-muscle coordination ``faster and more responsive than those of any other famous violinist,'' according to the critic Henry Roth.

Yet Chow is one of several people here who are determined to polish the image of this down-at-the-heels gambling haven.

TOP  Lede story:  ATTACK-AFGHAN (Kabul, Afghanistan) _ Some 100 days after a terrorist attack on America riveted the world's attention on Afghanistan, and two months after the start of an American-led bombing campaign began to topple the Taliban regime, Afghans here prepared Friday for the installation of an interim government that they hope will begin an era of peace and stability after 22 years of war. Dignitaries from around the country and world flowed into Kabul in anticipation of Saturday's ceremony, which will transfer power from President Burhanuddin Rabbani to Hamed Karzai, 44, a Pashtun and American ally who will serve as chairman of an interim authority that will govern the country for six months under an agreement negotiated in Bonn, Germany, earlier this month. By Amy Waldman.  (We plan to move the story by 9 p.m. ET in ``i'' news file.)  Top center story:  AMERICAN-TALIBAN (Washington) _ Administration officials said Friday that John Walker, the American who fought with Taliban forces in Afghanistan, will probably face at least one charge that will carry the death penalty. President Bush said that he had not made a decision on how to charge Walker, who is expected to be returned to the United States soon. Bush said that he had not ruled out a charge of treason, but said that the National Security Council would provide guidance on what to do in the case of all the people captured in Afghanistan, including Walker.

Latin American and European government leaders on Friday joined protesters in Buenos Aires and academics in American universities who put at least part of the blame for Argentina's problems on the lending agency and the Clinton and Bush administrations.

The forces of light, led by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and other mayors across the state, are trying to stop the legislation, which would foster more darkness for stargazers who want unobstructed night skies.

DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. c.2001 New York Times News Service  MICHIGAN TO CURB GIFTS FROM OUTSIDE PACS  Emily's List, a national organization that supports candidates who are women and favor abortion rights, played a major role in last year's Senate race in Michigan. It raised more than $1 million for Debbie Stabenow, the Democrat who unseated the Republican incumbent, Spencer Abraham.  In next year's race for governor in Michigan, Emily's List plans to support state Attorney General Jennifer Granholm, a Democrat.  But Granholm need not expect to get $1 million, or any amount close to that. In fact, all she can expect is a relatively paltry $34,000.  That is the new cap the Republican-controlled Michigan Legislature imposed on such gifts a few days ago, saying that outside political action committees were gaining too much influence in Michigan politics, particularly those committees that raise money for specific candidates and causes. Gov. John Engler, a Republican, has promised to sign the measure, which is being studied by legislators in other states who are concerned about the campaign finance tactics of outside groups.  Ellen Malcolm, the president of Emily's List, calls the new cap ``one of the most blatant power plays seen in a long time'' and contends that ``Republicans have made a tremendous miscalculation.'' She has suggested that donors who originally planned to funnel money to Granholm through Emily's List instead send their gifts directly to Granholm.  Democrats are given a reasonable shot at reclaiming the Michigan governor's chair next year. But first, they must sort themselves out in a primary, which polls indicate could be a bruiser.  KERRY FORMS PAC, BOWING TO THE `TRUTH'  Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., is a big supporter of campaign fund-raising caps like the one just passed in Michigan. He has won three terms without accepting a penny from political action committees.  But a few days ago he announced that he was forming his own PAC, the Citizen Soldier Fund _ not to raise campaign cash for himself, understand, but to raise cash for fellow Democrats he would like to see elected or re-elected.  Still, a PAC is a PAC, and cynics were quick to point out that Kerry was seriously considering a run for president in 2004, a difficult undertaking without a PAC in the current campaign finance climate.  As leader of the PAC, they noted, he will be able to crisscross the country raising and distributing money, and in the process will be able to raise his own profile and engender considerable political good will for himself.  Kerry did not see it that way. He insisted that cold political reality forced him to establish a PAC.  ``I've come to acknowledge the unpleasant and unfortunate truth,'' he said, ``that campaign finance and other critical reforms will remain stymied in Congress until Democrats obtain real working majorities in Washington and in state legislatures across the nation. It has become necessary for every leader of this party to employ all legal and appropriate means to assist Democratic candidacies at all political levels.''  EARLY POLLS LOOK HUMBLING FOR GORE  Al Gore keeps saying he has not decided whether to run for president again in 2004.  But a lot of Democratic voters have reached a decision on that matter, if a new CNN/USAToday/Gallup Poll has it right.  Asked whether the party's 2004 standard-bearer should again be Gore or ``someone else,'' 66 percent of poll respondents said ``someone else.''  And there is more.  Two other new polls _ by Bloomberg and Fox News/Opinion Dynamics _ indicate that even if Gore should be renominated, he would lose again, by a ratio of more than two to one, if President Bush should again be the Republican nominee.  SNIPING IN 2001 WITH AN EYE ON 2002  Early this month, when holiday decorations began showing up in the Arizona attorney general's office building in Phoenix, senior office managers looked around at all the Santa Clauses, blinking strings of lights, nativity scenes and menorahs and issued a memo.  It was permissible, they said, to put up ``reasonable decorations'' in private offices and cubicles. But in public spaces, like lobbies, hallways and conferences rooms, care should be taken not to display decorations with ``a religious significance'' because some state workers or members of the public might find them ``offensive.''  That was too much for the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, a conservative watchdog group based in New York. Last Monday, it sent a letter to Arizona's attorney general, Janet Napolitano, accusing her senior managers of ``political correctness gone crazy'' and of trying to ``cleanse the workplace of all religious expression.''  Napolitano, the leading Democratic candidate in next year's nip-and-tuck governor's race in Arizona, countered that her managers were simply trying to capture ``the right balance'' in holiday decorating.  Not good enough, declared Matt Salmon, a former congressman who is the leading Republican candidate in the governor's race. On Tuesday, he accused Napolitano of issuing a ``Soviet-style directive'' and promised that should he become governor he would ``protect Christmas from wacky liberal ideas.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20011222.0117 type=story > <HEADLINE> DOCTOR TO FACE CHARGES IN OXYCONTIN CASE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-OXYCONTIN-ARREST-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

, he wondered,	 An amused UMass alum checked in with an observation in the wake of the George O'Leary/Notre Dame situation. How is it, he wondered, that Rick Pitino could have presented himself in the Celtics' media guide for years as being a teammate of Julius Erving at UMass as well as the captain of the UMass team as a senior? Well, there is a bit of truth in there. Pitino was a freshman when Doc was a senior, but they never were real teammates. In fact, Erving is listed as a letterman for the years 1970 and 1971 on the school's Web site, while Pitino is listed as one in 1973 and 1974. Also, the Web site notes that the captain of the UMass team in 1974 was none other than Boston College coach Al Skinner. There is no other name listed . . . Ex-Celtic Thomas ``Big Ham'' Hamilton continues to run roughshod over the NBDL, leading the loop in rebounding by a wide margin. He's also second in blocked shots. Another interesting story in the minors is taking place in the Continental Basketball Association. (Same name, new league.) Leon Smith, the first-round 1999 pick who never made it, is playing and playing well for the Gary Steelheads, averaging 16.5 points and 16.4 rebounds a game. Smith went to the NBA right out of high school and remains one of the Poster Boys for an age limit. Another story is playing out in California at JUCO powerhouse Los Angeles City College. A lot of pro personnel men raised their eyebrows when 6-foot-10-inch Tony Key applied for last June's NBA draft out of Centennial High in Compton, Calif., where he had played for one year. Four high schoolers, of course, went in the first eight picks. A fifth, Ousmane Cisse, went in the second round, but the team that chose him, Denver, renounced him. Key was the sixth and went nowhere. And because he declared for the draft, he can't play for an NCAA Division 1 college. So he ended up at LACC and has had his ups and downs playing for the 16-1 squad, according to coach Michael Miller. Key already has been suspended, missing two games. Miller sees talent there, but he also sees a kid who needs direction and better advice than what he's gotten. ``Could he make it in the NBA? Yeah, it could happen,'' Miller said. ``But based on what he's done so far? No. He'd have to get a lot hungrier.'' Key is averaging more than 15 points and 8 rebounds a game for LACC. He was a starter until he was suspended. Since being reinstated, he is coming off the bench. ``He's got some rough edges,'' Miller said. ``He's dealing now with where the lines are drawn, what you can and can't do, what his accountability is. To his credit, he was suspended indefinitely, but he fought his way back.'' Miller says a handful of NBA scouts have been to see his team, but he says Key needs to show more to make a real statement. (Key toyed with playing in Europe, but decided he'd be able to showcase his talents better in the US.) ``With his size, and with his hands, you'd think a guy like that should dominate at this level,'' Miller said. ``He has done some good things for us, but he hasn't done that. He hasn't dominated.'' . . . There's some potentially positive news coming out of Charlotte on two fronts. First, George Lynch has been cleared to start running on a treadmill and shooting baskets. He is looking at a late January return date for the Hornets. On the business front, the Charlotte Observer reported that owners Ray Wooldridge (35 percent) and George Shinn (65 percent) may now be open to selling the team. They have always been dead set against that, which is the primary reason they're looking at other cities. If they sold the team to local business interests, there's a much better chance the new owners would be able to get an arena referendum passed because, unlike Shinn and Wooldridge, they presumably would not be universally loathed. However, any new owner would still have to face the unpleasant reality of playing at least two more years in the revenue-porous Charlotte Coliseum . . . The Grizzlies are in town Sunday night for their only appearance of the season. They've had an interesting schedule the last few days. They were in New York Thursday (and beat the Knicks), and logic would dictate that they would then come on to Boston. But no.

Still, it will be the only chance this season to see the flamboyant Jason Williams as well as rookies Pau Gasol and Shane Battier, both of whom are starting and playing well.

, he said,	 More than anything these days, Jeff Julian worries about his wife, Kimberly. ``She's been so great through all of this, but it's been tough on her. She spends so much time doing research,'' said Julian, who wishes for nothing short of a miracle this Christmas. The 40-year-old from Vermont, a former New England Open champ and twice a card-carrying member of the PGA Tour, has been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis _ more commonly called Lou Gehrig's disease _ and while it's an insidious illness, he is keeping his spirits up. ``I feel fine. Everything is pretty much the same, though my speech is getting a little worse. I have my good days and bad days.'' But even when the days are bad and the muscles ache and the helplessness tries to take over, Julian fights back with his best weapon _ ``I go golfing, nearly every day. On the golf course, I feel good.'' Julian has settled down in his wife's hometown of Branson, Mo., and the weather has cooperated thus far, which is good because you can only spend so much time doing homework on ALS. That has allowed Julian to golf a lot with his father-in-law and spend his evenings exploring playing possibilities for 2002. It's important to try, he said, to not give up, and golf is what keeps him going, so letters have gone out for possible sponsor's exemptions, including the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. He has to go that route because he failed to keep his PGA Tour card this past season, but Julian knows tournament directors get piles of requests so he's not building up his hopes. There has been contact with an ALS foundation in Boston and Julian has talked of playing in some tournaments to help heighten awareness of the disease, including one in his former hometown of Quechee, Vt., in June. ``I just want to try and keep playing, to keep active in golf and hopefully be of some help. I'm getting tons of calls and letters and the Tour has been very supportive. It makes it a lot easier if I stay positive.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

Conrad writes that the two main characters in ``Rope'' murder their best friend because ``they believe, as his intellectual superiors, that they are entitled to do so.'' In ``Shadow of a Doubt'' Uncle Charlie coolly disposes of wealthy widows, whom he dismisses as ``fat, wheezing animals.''

The director's most candid self-portraits, he argues, can be found in two roles played by Charles Laughton: the poisonous judge in ``The Paradine Case'' and the aesthete ``who relies on piracy and murder to subsidize his lust for things of beauty'' in ``Jamaica Inn.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

For her, a job at Fred Alger Management _ to pay for clothes filling four bedroom closets. And a constant game of sparring. They argued, he said, about everything. ``That's what kept us going. We were oil and water, black and white. In public, she called me Moroney _ short for moron. The neighbor girls called us the Bickersons.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

, he said,	 His son Hugh, now the general manager of Schramsberg, said the 1998 wines, now being released, would be the first not to carry the designation ``Napa Valley Champagne'' in the 36 years since production began. When his parents started the winery, he said, no one in the Valley was making sparkling wine from pinot noir and chardonnay, the grapes used in Champagne, nor were they using the methode champenoise, the French technique for producing the wine. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

A clerk in the gift shop at Scandinavia House in Manhattan gave a graphic demonstration when I stopped there to pick up a bottle of glogg mix (for research purposes). With much arm waving, she advised dumping the elixir into a big pot and adding red wine and brandy. Then, she said, ``you close your eyes and pour in vodka or schnapps.'' From her pantomimed pouring, more definitely seemed to be better. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

, he said,	 The Rev. Lyndon Rogers, the pastor at Iglesia Cristiana Principe de Paz in North Austin, estimates fewer of his congregants, mainly immigrants from Mexico and Central America, will return home for the holidays. Still, he said, the terrorist attacks have prompted the same soul-searching among some migrants as among Americans. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

, she writes,	 Simeti goes on to postulate the liberation of bearing a son. In medieval Europe, she writes, a queen rarely held power in her own right. She might hold it as mother to the heir when, as frequently happened and as happened to Henry, the king dies and leaves her as regent. In fact it was in the year and a half between Henry's death and her own that Constance obtained her son's position as Holy Roman Emperor by taking what was then the bold step of putting him under the Pope's protection as security against the German barons. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz
, she writes,	 Returning south with her (loathed?) husband: The queen must ``have entertained the idea of seeking refuge in a Palermo convent.'' No chronicler, she writes, thought it important to record the long trip from the abbey near Milan to Jesi, but the author does _ by intuition. Admittedly so; and she concedes that she made up a nurse to accompany Constance so she would not be lonely and a learned woman doctor to care for her. There is much more of this; it is like being hauled through cobwebs. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz
, he said,	 Langdon said he was frustrated at the need to assign many of his auditors to ferret out dubious tax shelters, which can be easily missed in the accounting records that big companies attach to their returns. And, he said, it is unfair that some companies that are caught have to pay their taxes, plus interest and the 20 percent penalty, while those that elude detection benefit from their misconduct. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

, they asked,	 Sikander grew up with miniatures everywhere. They were kitschy and omnipresent in the tourist bazaars. When she decided to study miniatures, her peers were shocked. Why, they asked, would she be interested in something so old-fashioned and uncreative? To study miniatures, it was thought, was to learn to imitate the old masters. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz
, she said,	 Sikander has not returned to Lahore, where her family lives, since she came to the United States. The first few years, she said, she was too busy with work. Then her immigration application got swallowed up in the bureaucracy. Then just as she and her fiance, Salman Kokkar, a Pakistan-born, Florida-raised business consultant, planned to go to Lahore to marry in November, the war in bordering Afghanistan had already begun. The wedding has been postponed for the moment. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

It asks the usual questions: Are you carrying any fruits, plants, large amounts of foreign currency, special electronics or weapons? But there was one box that unnerved me a bit. It asked: Are you carrying any ``radioactive materials?'' Hmm, I wondered, how many people (i.e. smugglers) are going to check that box? Can you imagine going through Moscow customs and the couple in front of you turning to each other and asking: ``Dear, did we pack the nuclear waste in your suitcase or mine?'' Or, ``Honey, is the plutonium in your purse or the black duffel?'' I don't think so. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

, he said,	 Punishments were not always in the stadium. One resident said that over the last five years, he twice saw adulterous couples being stoned to death, once in the stadium and once in a city square. At least five times during those years, he said, men caught in homosexual acts were propped against any convenient old wall, which was then toppled onto them by a tank. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

, she added,	 Perlmutter said that while the company remained committed to helping its families cope with their grief and financial needs, a company with 57,000 employees also had to be mindful of the broader financial consequences. What's more, she added, company officials also had to weigh difficult issues of equity in determining what health benefits to offer these 295 families. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz
, they said,	 But to some families, such concerns sounded bloodless, not at all in keeping with the company's assurances of solidarity and shared communal grief. These deaths were of a category apart, they said, and the idea of implicitly comparing victims of terror with more ordinary on-the-job deaths was offensive. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

, she added,	 Perlmutter said that only the company's $10 million contribution would be used to pay for the health insurance, and, she added, it was possible that Marsh &AMP; McLennan would increase its contribution to the MMC Victims Relief Fund. ``We haven't made any final decisions,'' she said. ``We're continuing to assess this and monitor this.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz
, she said,	 A Minneapolis sculptor, Jane Frees-Kluth, said she had heard plenty of derisive comments from colleagues about the project, but she does not agree with them. Maybe she is just more comfortable with kitsch, she said, having grown up near the 55-foot statue of the Jolly Green Giant near Le Sueur, Minn. But she also regards Mary Richards, the news producer at the fictional WJM-TV in Minneapolis, as an appropriate art subject for the city. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

, he said,	 More than once, he said, as he stood alongside public officials at news conferences in Washington, he inwardly groaned because old answers about anthrax were still being given and he'd been realizing that even information a week or two old could no longer be trusted. Some officials were still saying, for example, that a certain number of spores _ 8,000 to 10,000 was the commonly quoted figure _ were needed to contract inhalation anthrax.

, it seemed,	 Nguyen, who died Oct. 31, was not the harbinger of a feared new mass attack _ but neither, it seemed, would the evidence about her infection provide the break in the investigation that Ostroff and others had hoped for. One of the FBI's theories had been that Nguyen might have unwittingly crossed paths with the bioterrorist. Now, all they knew for sure was that she had somehow been infected with anthrax in a place the health officials could not find and in a way that had left no trace. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

, he said,	 Kruger said many softwaremakers are closely watching the response to XP. In the past, he said, softwaremakers have been reluctant to lock their software to one machine because it may tempt hackers to break the lock. What's more, it may create a competitive disadvantage to those firms who do lock their software. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz
, he said,	 Even with their eyes closed for prayer, it was not possible Tuesday for the worshipers to forget where they were. The heavy machinery scraped through the concrete and steel rubble. The generators blasted. The radios crackled. At one point, it looked as if some human remains had been unearthed in the pit nearby. One firefighter, his boots digging into the dirt near the outdoor altar, recalled the last time he had been at that spot. That was just after Sept. 11, and he had helped pull a body from the debris. He could tell it was the same place, he said, because he remembered the broken facade of the building now facing him. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

He said the militants had played a major role in the degradation of this nation of 140 million Muslims, along with venal politicians. This, he said, meant that Pakistan faced an ``internal challenge'' along with the external one, from India. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

, he said,	 The biggest revelation in his research, he said, was how true to her life Murdoch's novels were. Bayley cooperated with the biographers, even though ``Iris was extremely secretive,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``It was only after she was very ill, and after she died, that we thought that she wouldn't mind at all.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

During the Vietnam War, several experts noted, U.S. military officials at first refused to grant captured Vietcong the protections of prisoners of war. But that decision was quickly reversed, they said, when it became clear that Americans, too, would become prisoners during the conflict. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

Michael J. Kelly, an international-law specialist at Creighton University School of Law, in Omaha, said a line-by-line comparison showed many instances. For example, he said, the president's assuming the authority to make the final decision on the disposition of each case is in direct conflict with the third Geneva Convention's provision that no prisoner be tried by a court that fails to offer ``the essential guarantees of independence and impartiality.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

Paust of the University of Houston Law Center, who has taught at the Army's military law school, said the president appeared to have concluded that attacks on civilian targets like the World Trade Center made the attackers unlawful combatants. But that analysis, he said, would give terrorists the ability to claim that under international law attacks on military targets like the Pentagon and the USS Cole might be permitted as lawful attacks during war. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

, he said,	 Our society needs its Eminems because they are our polarity responders. They do what they're not supposed to. Eminem is the smart-aleck school kid who, when an authority figure says, ``I don't want to hear one more word out of you,'' replies ``one more word.'' In classic mythology, characters like Eminem, who buck the conventions of society to follow their own path, are not the villains but the heroes. Joseph Campbell, in discussing the story of the Holy Grail, which he considers one of the defining myths of Western civilization, described the wasteland as a place where people do and believe what they are told, where any spark of rebellion or individuality is instantly crushed. The hero, he said, is the person who possesses the attribute of spontaneity, and this spark, once ignited in one individual will flare up in thousands of others. (``Every single person is a Slim Shady lurking,'' as Eminem raps.). In the myth, Campbell continues, the knights split up and begin their journey where the forest is darkest and there is no path because where a path exists it is someone else's. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz
, he rants,	 While some parts of the album are pure stupidity (like the sophomoric skit ``Ken Kaniff''), some of the album's most criticized moments are its most redeeming. In ``Kim,'' for example, Eminem doesn't exactly rap, he rants, playing both murderous husband and cheating wife. The emotions he goes through as the husband vacillate wildly between hate and love, madness and sanity, hurt and hurting. Criticizing Eminem for this song is like getting upset at Anthony Hopkins for killing all those people as Hannibal Lecter. Eminem is playing a character, a very flawed one, and it is to his credit as a writer and performer that he plays it so convincingly. True, the character may have an element of the real Eminem in him, but for some that is often what art is for, finding a constructive outlet for certain anti-social tendencies. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

A Department of Public Safety dive team located Ira Clutter's body shortly before 11 a.m. about a half mile from where he was last seen Saturday, said Kristen Everett, a spokeswoman for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. ``It appeared like he fell from a large rock. He was found in 24 feet of water near the bottom,'' Everett said. ``Investigators found a skid mark real close to where he was found. We believe he was exploring the shore line and he fell in.'' 600. Rebeca Rodriguez  KWANZAA-POPULARITY  UNDATED: For storytellers, such as DeCee Cornish who promote African culture, the increasing popularity of Kwanzaa is a double-edge sword. Kwanzaa's popularity has risen dramatically over the past 10 years _ along with the purchasing power of blacks. Cornish and other Kwanzaa enthusiasts worry that the true meaning of the holiday, which started Wednesday, might be eclipsed by all the commercialization and marketing to the black community.

VOICES-TECHNOLOGY  UNDATED: The words are spoken in a clipped soprano voice, followed by someone laughing in the background and several mechanical clicks. ``Don't forget, your sister is visiting this weekend,'' Nora's mother said on her answering machine. ``Love ya.'' The ``love ya'' part is often played three or four times a day, sometimes more when Nora is struggling to cope with the loss of her mother, Elizabeth, who died in her sleep last year at age 74. Because of e-mail, voice messages and other technological aids, the void between this world and the next is being narrowed. Recorded bits of a voice or words allow people to hold on to something of a deceased loved one, similar to pictures and clothing lovingly treasured by past generations. By ELLENA FORTNER MORRISON  TEEN-TRIAL  FORT WORTH, Texas _ The teen-ager said she didn't know she was pregnant _ she still fit into her size 12-14 clothes and hadn't experienced any physical changes associated with pregnancy. She didn't know, she said, until the baby _ weighing almost 8 pounds and 19 inches long _ fell into the toilet one morning. ``I caught his head,'' the girl, now 17, testified in court last week. Prosecutors, however, contend that the baby born that summer morning in a south Fort Worth home was breathing _ or at least had taken a breath _ before he was placed in a shoe store bag at the bottom of a messy closet. The teenager has been charged with capital murder and a judge will decide Wednesday afternoon if she should stand trial as an adult.

America is about survival, and if it takes a new spin to bring rejuvenation, well, that's just fine. So at the end of this very traumatic American year, we raise a toast to a survivor, the comeback kid of the cocktail hour _ the all-American martini.

, she said,	 More stunning than the explicit pictures themselves, she said, was the condition of the 2,000-year-old structure, still adorned with elaborate mosaics, a remarkably intact stucco ceiling and even an indoor waterfall. Once the place had been an early Esalen where men and women floated in hot and cold tubs looking up at the sky and out on the sea. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz
, she said,	 Jacobelli became more and more animated, flushed even in bitterly cold weather, as she approached the ruins. Though the first excavations here began in the 1950s, ``when we started in 1985, all you could see was the top floor,'' the floor above the baths, she said, adding, ``Everything else was totally covered with dirt.'' She pointed out the spot where she first crawled into the baths through the roof, ``like a mouse,'' after digging through layers of volcanic rock and ash. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz
, she said,	 What they were able to piece together, Jacobelli said, convinced her that the pictures were meant to be funny. Because Romans tended to regard sex primarily as an act of aggression, she said, some of the acts depicted would at the time have been considered more comical than erotic. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz
, she said,	 On the upper floor, in any case, she said, there were several large apartments but no evidence that the place had ever been used as a brothel. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

, he said,	 Among them is Mazen Arrabi, who has been almost frantic with worry since he learned he was on the list. Although his parents are from Jordan, he said in a telephone interview, he was born and reared in the United States and looks ``like a California surfer.'' He runs a lawn service and, he said, the idea that he would be linked in even the most tenuous way to the Sept. 11 attacks makes him physically ill. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz
, he said,	 He speculates he landed on the FBI list as a result of someone trying to settle an old score by feeding erroneous information to law enforcement authorities. Shortly after the attack, he said, he was interviewed by FBI agents for two hours. They were polite, he said, and he hasn't heard from them since. But he was so upset by the encounter that he could not even bear to watch any news about the attack for more than a month. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz
, he said,	 A better way to conduct the investigation, he said, is for the government to be open about why and how they are compiling watch lists. In this case, he said, it would have helped to involve the Arab American community.. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

, he said,	 Along the way, he said, his wife's work as a judge and later, as director of Middle Ground, a local organization that works for prison change, spurred an interest in the law. She began bringing him law books to read, and soon, he said, other inmates began consulting him for legal advice. By the time he was paroled, he said, he and his wife had worked on six federal lawsuits against the state Department of Corrections that led to changes in prison rules on mail, visiting rights and other issues. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

, he settled,	 But having tasted London life, he settled, and 25 Brook St. remained his home until his death in 1759. The house then passed to his manservant, John du Burk, who also inherited Handel's clothes and bought his furniture (for the sum of 45 pounds). From circumstantial evidence it seems likely that du Burk ran the house as some kind of private hotel. But by the beginning of the 20th century it had been turned into an art shop; the interiors were stripped and remodeled by an owner who considered central London property ``far too valuable to be left to rot because some genius of a past age happened to have lived there.'' By the end of the century it had been bought by an insurance company, which leased the ground floor as a shop and used the upper floors as office space. But a campaign was already under way to reclaim the property and turn it into a Handel museum. It was organized by Stanley Sadie, a Handel scholar and the editor of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

I showed the script to some professional screenwriters, and they said the lead character was too unlikable. I thought about changing it, but I decided that would not be the truth.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz
, he admits,	 People always wondered what he could have been thinking to do such a thing, he says. The truth is, he wasn't thinking anything, he says. He was drunk and stoned. Yeah, he admits, it was true he and his friends had broken the lock on the switch two days earlier, but he would not call the derailment premeditated. Someone yelled, ``Let's throw the switch,'' and they did. Then they ran. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz
, she added,	 A graduate of the Parsons School of Design, Drake apprenticed with Angelo Donghia before establishing his firm, Drake Design Associates, in 1978. He describes himself as a traditionalist at heart. But even his most ardent fans would say that he uses that term loosely. In an interview last week, Margaret Russell, the editor-in-chief of Elle Decor, described Drake's Manhattan residence as ``over the top, glamorous and swanky.'' In general, she added, ``he likes to push things a little bit.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

, they explained,	 The family did not travel to Gainesville for a ceremony to honor Eraste at a Florida football game this season. It was not from ill will toward the football program or coach Steve Spurrier, they explained, but reflected commitments to their other children. Sister Camille is a cheerleader and student-government president at St. Thomas More High School, where Eraste ran for more than 700 yards and 12 touchdowns his senior year. At the school, they have renamed a weight-lifting award for him. The 40-yard markers were set off in blue to honor his old number. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz
, he said,	 In 1995, the year before he left, he told the Jesuit magazine Ixtus that canonization would be ``a recognition of a cult, not a recognition of the physical, real existence of the person.'' Sainthood, he said, cannot be conferred on a symbol. Schulenburg was removed from his post by the Vatican, and threatened with excommunication, but continued to campaign against canonization. Two years ago he wrote to the pope that Juan Diego had been a device to convert the indigenous people of the Americas to the Europeans' church. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz
, he added,	 In explaining why he felt that a psychoanalyst should sit unobtrusively behind his patients' couch, Sigmund Freud explained that he did not want patients to be influenced by his physical reactions and facial expressions. What is more, he added, ``I cannot stand being stared at eight hours a day (or longer) by others.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz
, you do,	 The experience of ``going on'' ``Fresh Air'' is positively disorienting for people used to confronting their interviewers. You enter a studio alone, sit down facing a wall or a control room window and put on a headset. When the satellite up-link is established and the familiar voice of Terry Gross suddenly wafts out of the void into the otherwise silent studio, you do, indeed, feel almost ``on the couch.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz
, I think,	 Partly because Gross realizes that ``Fresh Air'' is an increasingly rare alternative to the otherwise sound-bitten world of broadcast, she has little interest in television. But she also just loves radio as a medium, and you can feel it when she interviews you. ``I've never seen radio as the minor leagues, where I'm just really preparing to be in the show that really counts, namely, television, which is, I think, what people often assume,'' she said. ``I've never felt that way. To the contrary, I think I am really lucky to work in this invisible world.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz
, I believe,	 Past and present merged powerfully when George Washington addressed a crowd of Americans soon after Sept. 11 (in words that the actor drew from original sources and his own imagination). ``We are now, on this continent, facing grave danger, a mortal enemy, a great empire,'' he declared. ``Give me leave to say, as my opinion, that my first wish is to see the plague of war banished from off the earth. The friends of humanity will deprecate war wheresoever it may appear, and we have seen enough of its evils in this country to know that it must not be wantonly or unnecessarily entered upon. But as we will never, I believe, speak for the world, we must remember that to be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace. We must rely upon the goodness of the cause, and the aid of the Supreme Being, in whose hand victory is, to animate and encourage us to great and noble actions.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz
, he said,	 Acknowledging that the terrorist threat is more diffuse, he said, ``You can still take a complex problem and one that perhaps is fuzzier at the edges in some respects than that nice crisp Cold War experience and attack it in a systemic manner.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

, he said,	 People seemed eager to send images of their children, vacations, pets and hobbies to others, using pictures they took themselves. And with prices falling, many of them bought digital cameras to do so. ``The price points have come down significantly,'' said Carl Steidtmann, chief economist for Deloitte &AMP; Touche. ``And it's really `Photography for Dummies.' It makes the whole process of photography a lot easier.'' At the same time, he said, digital cameras are so computer-friendly that it is simple for people to attach the images they create to e-mail messages or Web sites, which they can do from a home computer. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz
, he said,	 The photography industry heavily promoted digital technology this year, as did many retailers. ``We advertise digital, digital, digital, and the business advertises digital, digital, digital,'' said David Katz of the Camera Co., an independent retailer in Norwood, Mass. He said sales rose at least 22 percent this year, and ``we did surprisingly well with point-and-shoots and traditional cameras.'' By Dec. 22, he said, ``we ran out of everything.'' </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20011226.0222 type=story > <HEADLINE> MAN WHO THREATENED JET WITH BOMB IN SHOE IS SMALL-TIME BRITISH </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> LONDON (BC-SHOEBOMB-BRITAIN-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

At least four times in the last six years, Saudis trained or recruited in Afghanistan, Chechnya, Kosovo or Bosnia have been among the terrorists who carried out bombings of American targets _ in Saudi Arabia, Kenya, Tanzania and Yemen.

It was the latest sign that the Internet has entered a reconstruction phase similar to the ones that followed every other frenzied introduction of a new technology, from railroads to automobiles to personal computers.

BOSKIN-ECONSCENE (Undated) _ In 1997, a commission appointed by the Senate Finance Committee concluded that the annual Consumer Price Index computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics was probably 1.1 percent too high, and perhaps even more. The Boskin commission's findings, named after its chairman, Michael Boskin, made headlines in the financial press, and many took its conclusions as gospel. But perhaps they shouldn't have.

RUSSIA-AIR-TRAVEL (Moscow) _ While airlines around the world are struggling with a sharp decline in traffic, there is one place where air travel is growing strongly: Russia. In a land of notoriously bad roads, where traversing the country by train takes the better part of a week, Russian travelers have little choice but to fly. And considering Russia's spotty safety record, the 5 million Russians who fly each year are not easily spooked. By Sabrina Tavernise.

More stunning than the explicit pictures themselves, she said, was the condition of the 2,000-year-old structure, still adorned with elaborate mosaics, a remarkably intact stucco ceiling and even an indoor waterfall. The eight frescoes, recently restored, will be shown to the public for the first time starting on Jan. 19. By Melinda Henneberger.  THRILLERS-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``Blackwater Sound,'' by James W.

As seen on the cover of the November Elle Decor, Drake has unleashed his most riotous impulses in his own home, a Manhattan loft done in throbbing pink, Tyrian purple and chrome yellow, the last thrown into high relief by a zebra-and-leopard-patterned rug. ``People don't come to me for beige or for Laura Ashley sweet,'' he told the magazine last fall. And now it appears that Drake, who has designed three residences for Michael Bloomberg, could exercise his signature audacity on Gracie Mansion, a wooden house built in 1799, which has served as the official mayoral residence since 1942.

Watching them takes you away from everything. If the birds are OK, maybe we will be, too. A few weeks ago, I stood watching chickadees and pine siskins darting in and out of a few simple hanging tube feeders at the Ashland Nature Center in Hockessin, Del. I went there to find out how to attract birds to my home, but one thing led to another and I soon found myself tailing Jim White, the center's resident birder, peering at migrating snow geese through borrowed binoculars.

, he concedes,	 Gay extends his half-empty, half-full approach to other areas. Yes, he concedes, the Victorians were pious, but even then most people did not practice the religion of their baptism. ``Indifference is the great malady of Christians in our times,'' a Paris priest complained in 1845. And again, the bourgeoisie embraced work as both a divine duty and an instrument for social improvement, but the notion of leisure first appeared in the 19th century, too. Similarly, societies for the suppression of vice acted as watchdogs of public morality, yet this was a period in which the concept of privacy, whether at the ballot box or in the home, took root. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

He insists he is not ``trading in nostalgia,'' but he is evidently persuaded by his own advocacy. Bearing in mind what followed, he notes, ``I can only reiterate that the Victorian age was an admirable century, and that the bourgeoisie may take much of the credit for that.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

, it snaps,	 Review: Hard to know how many ways there are to say ``delightful,'' but every single one of them applies to this intoxicating French comedy romance. Joyously directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, it snaps, crackles and pops with imagination and heart. Amelie (Audrey Tautou) is a shy waitress living in Montmartre who decides to do some secret do-gooding. But she's unable to do for herself what she so easily does for others. Jeunet's ever-inventive direction deserves a lot of credit, but so does his star. She's a sprite, a pixie, a gamine, a waif. She may even remind you of a certain other Audrey. One named Hepburn.

A senior Spanish police commander estimated recently that ``probably 50'' real members of al-Qaida had been jailed in the European sweeps. He expressed confidence that many others ``fled and are now fearful because of the information we have.''

New Yorkers, whose view of Giuliani is fuller and more complicated than that of most other Americans, were eternally grateful for that gift of freedom from fear. But they also knew his quest for order could take him further than they necessarily wanted to go, like his wars on jaywalking and street vendors.

But they also saw the ones in which he stonewalled on a tough question or insulted the questioner. He had, they learned, little gift for seeing the other person's point of view. His emotional talents were blunt, and they betrayed him when the moment called for a sense of humility and accommodation. That was particularly true in his relations with the city's minority communities, and in his response to incidents of police brutality.

The film is a milestone on many counts. It almost single-handedly rekindled an interest in animation as an art form. It revived the musical form both on stage and screen. It helped reinvigorate the Mouse House as a major studio player. And it was the first animated feature to earn a Best Picture Oscar nomination. But does it stand the test of time? You betcha. Accompanied by FILM-BENSON. By TODD CAMP  FILM-BENSON  UNDATED: Last month, writer/director/composer/actor Robby Benson sat with his 8-year-old son and watched Disney's 10th-anniversary IMAX release of ``Beauty and the Beast: Special Edition.'' ``You're talking to a very content father. Disney has given me another gift,'' says the 45-year-old Dallas native, whose rumbling bass voice brings the Beast to life. ``They gave me the same gift with my daughter, and now they've given me this gift with my son.'' Benson says his son ``absolutely adored'' the movie and now proudly strides into football practice declaring, ``Now you listen to me, my dad's the Beast.'' Benson says that's an indication of the power of the film's storytelling. ``I teach film at the college level, and I always say that _ because there are films that I've been in that hold up and films that I've been in that just don't _ it really comes down to one thing, and that's story.

Say it and you think of young guys sporting black T-shirts and permanent scowls, amps cranked to 11, angering the neighbors with, these days, covers of Korn or Creed. Then there's the corner house on a quiet street just south of Texas Christian University in southwest Fort Worth. Had you come to the door and listened last Sunday, you would have heard a few Beatles covers and some of the most original, intelligent and melodic music ever to come out of the city. Space Opera, the city's biggest band in the late '60s and early '70s, was once again hunkered down where they had been practicing since 1969, and once again tuning up for an upcoming hometown gig. By DAVE FERMAN  BOOKS-WATER  UNDATED: The average American, regardless of race or social status, most likely has no clue where his or her water comes from. Jeffrey Rothfeder addresses this complex topic in a way that is comprehensible to everyone. From the introduction on, you can't help but wonder: Why hasn't anyone told me about this before? For Rothfeder postulates that we are in the middle of a global water crisis, and it's likely to get much worse in the near future. By A. SIMS.

, he said,	 As he explains it, the disappearance of the universe is a gradual process. The faster a galaxy flies away from us, the dimmer and dimmer it will appear, as its light is ``redshifted'' to lower frequencies and energies, the way a police siren sounds lower when it is receding. When it reaches the speed of light, the galaxy will appear to ``freeze,'' like a dancer caught in midair in a photograph, in accordance to Einstein's theory of relativity, and we will never see it get older, said Dr. Abraham Loeb, an astronomer at Harvard. Rather it will simply seem dimmer. The farther away an object is in the sky, he said, the younger it will appear as it fades out of sight. ``There is a finite amount of information we can collect from the universe,'' Loeb said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz
, he argued,	 As an organism like the black cloud cooled, he argued, it would think more slowly, but it would always metabolize energy even more slowly, so its appetite would always be less than its output.

, he explained,	 ``The Hawking radiation kills us because it gives a minimum temperature below which you cannot cool anything,'' Krauss said. Once an organism cools to that temperature, he explained, it would dissipate energy at some fixed rate. ``Since there is a finite total energy, this means a finite lifetime.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz
, he said,	 Dyson, however, says this argument applies only to so-called digital life, in which there is a fixed number of quantum states. Creatures like the black cloud, which could grow along with the universe, he said, would have an increasing number of quantum states, and so there would always be more rungs of the ladder to step down. So the bottom need never be reached and life and thought could go on indefinitely. </P> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

They have been selling for about four to five times face value, he estimated, not surprising since they include the Winter Games' version of ``The Producers,'' the ladies' figure skating finals.

Rail travel is available on the historic steam-powered Heber Valley Railroad from Heber City to a new stop at Soldier Hollow at Wasatch Mountain State Park, the busiest site in terms of events, including cross-country skiing and biathlon.  The Heber Valley Railroad dates back to 1899, when it served early settlers in the valley. For decades it hauled freight and livestock. From the late 1930s to the early 1940s, the Heber Valley was one of the country's leading areas for exporting sheep.  With the increasing use of trucks, the 16-mile railroad fell idle. In 1970, it was resurrected for recreational use; it follows the shores of Deer Creek Lake, descending into Provo Canyon and then running along the Provo River to Vivian Park.  The schedule of the 4.5-mile stretch between Heber City and Soldier Hollow will vary but will be coordinated with the Olympic events.  For the convenience of passengers, a 125-foot-long covered platform has been built at Soldier Hollow. From there, passengers can get to the viewing areas by means of a horse-drawn sleigh, which is included in the $30 round-trip train fare.  Information: (435) 654-5601.  Touro Synagogue Gains National Trust Status  Touro Synagogue in Newport, R.I., the only remaining synagogue from the Colonial era, is the first religious building in the select collection of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Dedicated in 1763, the Georgian building designed by Peter Harrison is the oldest synagogue in America. Designated a National Historic Site in 1946, it now qualifies for promotional, financial and technical support as one of the 21 National Trust sites.  The synagogue, named for two benefactors, Abraham and Judah Touro, is still home to an active Sephardic Orthodox congregation, Jeshuat Israel, with more than 100 families. The building is open to public tours when services are not being held.  Built of brick from England, the two-story building with rounded Palladian windows and a four-sided roof stands at a sharp angle to Touro Street, so that the holy ark containing the Torah faces east, toward Jerusalem. Above the ark is a painting from around 1800 of the tablets bearing the Ten Commandments in Hebrew by the Newport artist Benjamin Howland.  The interior of the synagogue, a 35-foot-by-40-foot space, is in a classically spare Georgian style. Twelve columns, each made from a single tree trunk, represent the 12 tribes of Israel and support a balcony for the women's gallery. Five mid-18th-century candelabra hang from the ceiling.  George Washington visited the synagogue in 1781, and in 1790 sent the congregation a famous early promise of religious freedom in a letter _ a facsimile of which is on display _ stating that the United States ``gives to bigotry no sanction.'' The synagogue also served as the seat of the Rhode Island General Assembly and the State Supreme Court in that era.  Through April, tours are offered from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Sunday and at 1 p.m. Monday to Friday. Tours are expanded in the summer.

Shorter Airport Waits For Special Customers  Those long waits in line for airport security screening are being reduced at some airports for very frequent fliers as well as those who pay for seats in first class and, in some cases, business class.  American, Delta, Northwest and United have all added extra lines for these passengers at the airports where they have significant business. Each airline has different rules for which frequent fliers in coach can use the lines, but generally one needs either a boarding pass, or a frequent flier card showing elite status.  American Airlines offers separate lines at O'Hare, near Chicago, and San Diego for Aadvantage frequent flier program members who are at the gold, platinum and executive platinum levels, as well as for first- and business-class international passengers.  Delta has special lines at La Guardia, Kennedy and Newark Airports and in Atlanta, Boston, Cincinnati, Dallas-Fort Worth and Salt Lake City. Its lines are open to gold and platinum frequent fliers and passengers in both first and business class.  Northwest Airlines opened separate lines for its first-class and business-class passengers, as well as those in its two highest frequent-flier tiers, platinum and gold, at its hubs in Detroit, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Memphis and in Seattle, Los Angeles and at O'Hare.  United has separate lines at O'Hare, Newark, Los Angeles and San Francisco for its first-class passengers and those in the three top tiers of its Mileage Plus frequent flier program, 1K, premier and premier executive, and for gold level members of the multiairline Star Alliance program. United has a special line at Seattle-Tacoma only for 1K members and those with no carry-on items. Business-class passengers paying full fare are also eligible to use United's special lines.  Travelers to Santa Catalina Island, 22 miles from Los Angeles and long popular for its clear ocean waters and charming seaside town, Avalon, can now visit seldom seen parts of the island's rugged interior on a recently inaugurated tour.  Using a large, four-wheel-drive SUV, the Cape Canyon Tour, operated by a subsidiary of Discovery Tours, takes up to six passengers on a trip of about four hours along mountain ridges and through a canyon, with views of isolated coves, 2,000-foot peaks, and the Pacific Ocean along the way. About half the tour is on off-road trails.  The tour includes a guided walk through a bald eagle habitat, a visit to the native plant garden at the Catalina Nature Center, and lunch at the Airport-in-the-Sky, which sits on two leveled mountain peaks at an elevation of 1,602 feet. During the tour, passengers will very likely spot wild buffaloes, introduced to the island by a film production company in 1924, and they may see eagles and deer as well. A guide trained in the island's history and ecology is the driver.  The tour departs from Avalon and runs weekends only through the spring, with an expanded schedule expected later in the year. The cost is $79, including lunch; for reservations, call (310) 510-2000.  Santa Catalina Island Conservancy, the nonprofit foundation that owns about 88 percent of the island, offers partially off-road ecology tours in a Jeep starting at $98 a person for a three-hour trip. Passengers may be able to see buffaloes, deer, squirrels and foxes; call (310) 510-2595.  There are no rental cars on the island. Touring information is available at www.catalina.com. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20011231.0254 type=story > <HEADLINE> OFFICIALS SAY OLYMPICS SECURITY IS COMPREHENSIVE, WHETHER VISIBLE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-TRAVEL-OLY-SAFETY-$ADV06-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200112.gz

, he said,	 John Green, a senior fellow for the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, said a policy statement from the National Alliance of Evangelicals could influence Congress. But the real test, he said, was whether the group's leaders could influence their congregants. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he added,	 On the other hand, he added, they don't like environmentalists. They associate environmentalists with the Sierra Club and with people who have nontraditional religiosity. Alliance leaders have a real opportunity here, but the impediment is getting over the image of environmentalists. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 Mohammed Ali, a 40-year-old security guard and father of six who had not been paid for half a year, said U.S. employees of Louis Berger visited the site at least three times. Inspectors contracted by AID visited weekly, he said. All of the companies made their profit, he said, but no one seemed to ensure that the clinic would be properly built. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, she said,	 Helping indigenous people to document themselves with photographs is a longtime technique of anthropologists. The Natural History museum was drawn to the Yunnan pictures because they capture the nexus between culture and environment, said Eleanor Sterling, co-curator of the show and director of the museum's center for biodiversity and conservation. And crucially, she said, the photos were spectacular. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he added,	 The people of Anbar are not represented by those conferences outside of Anbar, al-Shawka said, in a reference to meetings held by other Sunni Arab parties. The Anbar residents, he added, are not those who are living in five-star hotels or following the satellite channels. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20051106.0126 type=story > <HEADLINE> FOR THE RECORD, PROBLEMS ABOUND </HEADLINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, we know,	 We addressed it with the players about how we're the hunted, coach John Tortorella said. And they think they understand. They can say, Yeah, yeah, yeah, we know,' but until you go through it you don't know. We've never been through this before and we're going through the process of learning what it means to have people gunning for us every night. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"159819"	"they"	"decided"	" Executives, they decided, would get a surprise summons to corporate headquarters a couple of hours before Sunday's late afternoon Falcons-Packers game. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"159820"	"they"	"decided"	" Fifty-five thousand employees around the globe, millions of investors and scores of community leaders would be told, they decided, in a delicately choreographed rush of phone calls and e-mails designed to make sure everybody got the same news at roughly the same time. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"160921"	"they"	"decided"	" Albany's answer was to require New York City to help pay the bills for its own residents. The city already spent heavily on public hospitals and clinics for the poor, and state lawmakers reasoned that Medicaid would take over many of those city services. Therefore, they decided, the city could and should help pay for Medicaid. It followed that other counties with far fewer poor people would also be required to pay a share of Medicaid costs, but upstate county officials were quickly surprised by how many of their residents signed up for the program, and by the cost. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"

"162813"	"he"	"decided"	" Meissonier, to his credit, did manage at least one stinging one-liner. Infuriated by Courbet's role in toppling the Vendome column, crowned by a statue of Napoleon, during the violent days of the Paris Commune, he fantasized about the appropriate punishment. Courbet, a heavy drinker and smoker, should be chained to the base of the column, he decided, and forced to copy the bas-reliefs that covered it, while having always in front of him, but beyond his reach, beer mugs and pipes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"163436"	"I"	"decided"	" The next day, a massage in yurt No.9, with late-afternoon sun streaming in, cost about the same as dinner. But as I listened to elephant seals laughing and the wind whistling, I knew which experience felt richer, and truer to Big Sur country. And I thought again about a certain Mr. Hearst, enjoying the comforts of his tented encampment. His brand of roughing it, I decided, was all the luxury I needed. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"163981"	"he"	"decided"	" Suddenly, he realized he was looking ahead at two dogs running in lead instead of one. Somehow, he decided, one of his black females in heat must have gotten loose and was looking to run along with Salem. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164442"	"I"	"decided"	" When I get home I'm going to make sure I can still juggle, I decided, while dodging a fresh hunk of road kill on the shoulder. Riding on the shoulder is absolutely necessary to survival, but it also means one is constantly on the lookout for animal parts, broken beer bottles, stray pieces of metal and other obstacles that can puncture a thin bike tire in seconds. Worse, I have this fear of daydreaming and not noticing the railroad tie that fell off a truck onto the shoulder, which sends me hurtling over the handlebars, my feet still attached to the pedals by those infernal clips. It just takes so much longer to heal these days. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"165135"	"we"	"decided"	" As the story goes, Bugs had a bit of a skirmish with some Lauderdale hoods and terminated a couple of them. Odd, the Bugs of old was a soft-spoken, well-mannered boy who, we decided, never would have turned to a life of crime if his folks had only bought him a bigger bike. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"166859"	"he"	"decided"	" After his loss in the 2000 presidential campaign, he decided, I'm going to have to dig in for the long haul on this. Did he believe that winning the popular vote gave him a certain mandate or responsibility? He thinks hard about this. Maybe it added an edge. Unconsciously. I've never really thought about it quite that way. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"167680"	"I"	"decided"	" That cook, I decided, would be me. I had to have those beans, although my husband and I were flying home to California the following day and I had doubts about what U.S. Customs might say. Dried beans were no problem to bring back, I was sure, but these beans were so fresh they were glistening. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"167733"	"I"	"decided"	" I don't know, he said. One day, I decided, man, I want to do it. I went and found a car, and that's how it started. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"169198"	"I"	"decided"	" The next trip was planned for Chile. Would I go? My pre-bike smokes may have had comic value for the group, but they would not have much of a place in a country of brutal ascents and thin air. Maybe, I decided, I would stub out the ciggies and actually train. It is hard to resist the unlikely scenario of adults in a common endeavor, pushing on the pedals toward the next wonderful thing. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060810.0105 type=story > <HEADLINE> SHAME ON JOE LIEBERMAN BY MARIANNE MEANS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WASHINGTON </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"170668"	"they"	"decided"	" The company kept several things in mind: Taste trumps nutrition with consumers; not everybody wants to eat light; and healthy is a loaded word. The menu, they decided, would offer no bad choices. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171148"	"he"	"decided"	" Shmiel Jaeger, Mendelsohn discovered, was a big man in Bolechow. He had spent a little time in New York in 1913, but returned to his hometown, where he could be a big fish in a small pond. New York, he decided, was not a lucky place for him. Back in Bolechow he ran the local butchers' cartel and owned two delivery trucks. He had the first telephone in town, and the first radio too. He doted on his wife and his four daughters. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171739"	"he"	"decided"	" The Army, he decided, was the most comfortable place to be. In 2005, he joined the National Guard. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"171742"	"she"	"decided"	" The first trip, she decided, would be to London. I made a brochure and mailed it to every woman I had met in the last 40 years of my life. I took three friends with me as my guinea pigs, and we went to the ballet at Covent Garden, and to the furniture section of the Victoria and Albert Museum. The consensus was that I should do this. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172216"	"he"	"decided"	" In the end, tucking away his apprehensions, Craig took the plunge. International experience, he decided, would look good on his resume. And Infosys would put him through a six-month training course on its campus here in southern India before dispatching him to its development center in Phoenix. Craig would be one of its American faces. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"173126"	"he"	"decided"	" That style, with the I Voted message, led to the only complaint in the history of sticker giving, Hicks said. An irate voter called to complain that his shirt had been ruined after he sent it off to the dry cleaners. Somehow, he decided, it was the secretary of state's fault that he'd forgotten to peel off his sticker. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
