By the cool calculus of nature, even the sacred bond between mother and child may sometimes pull in conflicting directions. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950123.0298 type=multi > <DATELINE> TOKYO (NYT)  (BC-WORLD-BRIEFS-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> The Tokyo stock market Monday suffered a severe aftershock from last week's earthquake, with share prices plunging on fears that the disaster in Kobe would damage the Japan's economy and businesses.   The decline in Tokyo triggered falls in stock markets throughout Asia, as concern mounted that Japanese investors would pull their money out of these other markets to help pay for rebuilding at home.   ``It looks to me like what you would call a stampede,'' Jeff Bahrenburg, the equities strategist for Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. in Tokyo, said Monday after Japan's Nikkei average of 225 stocks plummeted 5.6 percent.   KOBE, Japan (NYT) -- This crumpled city struggled to get back to work Monday, as supply-laden helicopters crisscrossed the gray skies to avoid horrific traffic jams, businessmen pedaled to work on bikes and the city began its first garbage pick-up since last week's huge earthquake.   But in one of Kobe's largest districts it will take far longer for life to return to normal, if ever. Nagata Ward, a gritty industrial center just east of downtown, suffered among the worst damage and worst fires, which means that Kobe's largest minority group, Koreans, absorbed a disproportionate share of the disaster.   What accentuated the blow is the fact that the industry the Koreans dominated and which employed a majority of breadwinners in Nagata -- shoe production -- was nearly destroyed.   JERUSALEM (NYT) -- One after another they were buried, an assembly line of misery and despair.   Death is no stranger here, but rarely does it come calling as ferociously as it did on Sunday when 19 Israelis were killed in a Palestinian suicide bombing, all but one of them soldiers barely old enough to vote.   Monday, by the thousands, Israelis trudged all morning and afternoon to military graveyards across the country to mourn the young victims, console the families and maybe also say silent prayers for themselves and their doubt-ridden country.   The mourners were mostly young -- soldiers in red berets who wept and hugged each other, but who also spoke defiantly of exacting revenge on the Islamic extremists who took responsibility for the bombing at an intersection heavily trafficked by Israeli men and women in uniform.   LONDON (NYT) -- Taking the steady consolidation of the health-care industry to a new scale, Glaxo PLC Monday launched an unsolicited $14 billion offer for Wellcome PLC in a deal that would create the world's largest drug maker.   If completed, the deal between the two British companies would be the largest in a string of mergers and acquisitions among pharmaceutical companies, hospitals and other health-care providers. It would also rank among the two or three largest deals to date in any industry, behind the $30 billion merger of R.J. Reynolds and Nabisco completed in 1989 and neck-and-neck with the $14 billion combination of Time Inc. and Warner Communications in 1990.   TOKYO (NYT) -- In a nation that is widely regarded as very well prepared for earthquakes, something clearly went wrong last week in the city of Kobe. And now, some people are saying that the temblor also exposed what is wrong with the leadership of Japan.   Newspapers and other critics are complaining strongly about the response by the administration of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, who didn't hear about the earthquake until he watched the morning news on television .   In a possible sign of weakening confidence in the government, the Nikkei stock market index dropped more than 1,000 points Monday. And Japanese newspapers are publishing a growing number of accusations that poor preparation, indecision, and bureacratic rivalry may have added to the death toll, which climbed to 5,002 Monday.   TEHERAN, Iran (NYT) -- Amid tight security measures, over 30,000 Iranians took part Monday in funeral ceremonies for former Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan who became one of the chief opponents of the clerical regime in recent years, but was posthumously hailed by senior Iranian officials as ``a highly respected politician.''   Mourners marched for two miles through the streets of North Teheran carrying Bazargan's corpse, draped in a red, green and white national flag, chanting ``This is the day of sorry and anguish.''   ``Security was very heavy,'' said Hussein Shah Husseini, member of the band Society for Defense of Freedoms and National Soveriegnty. ``But the police did their best to cooperate. The fact that so many people came proves that, because Mr. Bazargan was a champion of democracy, people demonstrated their protest to the government simply by their presence.''   BLANTYRE, Malawi (NYT) -- Eight months after he conceded defeat in an election that was forced upon him, Life President Hastings Kamuzu Banda has been charged with ordering the murder of four top officials of his own government. The men were rounded up by the olice and clubbed to death with hammers and crowbars.   The 12-year-old crime, its grisly details itemized in 1,000 pages of new testimony, has absorbed and shaken this little sliver of southeast Africa, a country that prides itself on being a pocket of gentleness in a cruel continent.   ``We're not wanting vengeance in this matter,'' said President Bakili Muluzi, who defeated Banda, when asked the questions of retribution and reconciliation that now confront many new democracies. ``We're not even wanting to use it as a political issue. But according to the laws of Malawi, you kill, you are tried.''   WASHINGTON (NYT) -- President Clinton has sent a highly personal letter to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel that expresses ``disgust and anger'' at Sunday's attack by a Muslim suicide bomber.   The president told Rabin that he was ``personally sickened'' by the celebrations in Gaza carried out by Muslim extremists. Saying that the bombers and their sponsors were determined to destroy the peace process, he told the Israeli leader: ``Together we must find a way to stop these evil deeds.''   MEXICO CITY (NYT) -- Seeking to blunt growing criticism of his leadership, President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon has shuffled his cabinet for the second time in less than a month, firing an Education Minister who had falsely claimed to have both a doctorate and a bachelors' degree.   In a series of changes announced late Sunday night, Zedillo also backed away somewhat from the young, American-trained technocrats who have dominated his government, according a measure of new power to more experienced politicians.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950123.0303 type=story > <DATELINE>  (BC-STATES-MOTOR-PA) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"
