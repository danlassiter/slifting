"169045"	"they"	"saved"	" Anna Mary Robertson Moses, to give her real name, was born not far from Eagle Bridge in 1860. She was a farmer's daughter and lived a 19th-century farm kid's life: chores, school, rollicksome holidays. When she was 12, her parents hired her out to a larger farm, where she eventually met and married a fellow worker, Thomas Salmon Moses. Industrious and thrifty, they saved, bought a farm of their own and had 10 children, five of whom died in infancy. It was only after the death of her husband and an adult daughter that Moses started to paint in earnest. It was 1935, and she was 76. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
