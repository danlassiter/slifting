The case came to light in May when the reclusive family called for an ambulance after the woman's younger brother Russell took a drug overdose as part of a suicide pact with his mother and father.  Ambulance drivers were told Karen Morgan's body was laid out in her parents' room and police moved in to investigate what was thought to be a suspicious death.  Detective Robert Harall told the inquest Morgan's parents had agreed to her living at home since 1980 rather than have her sent to a special boarding school because of a psychiatric condition.  ``It was control of the parents by the children. She dominated them with rituals before she would eat, and certain TV programs she wouldn't let them watch,'' Harrall said.  _REUTERS  GOOD DAY, WIRE WANDERERS!!!!!  Offer not available in any store!

Just look at our cars. There's nothing left, but we are unhurt. This must be a sign from God. God must have meant fo rus to meet and be friends and live together in peace for the rest of our days.''  The priest replies, ``Yes. I agree with you completely. This must be a sign from God.''  The rabbi continues: ``And look at this. Here's another miracle. My car is completely demolished, but this bottle of Kedem wine didn't break. Surely God wants us to drink this wine to celebrate our good fortune.''  Then he hands the bottle to the priest. The priest agrees, takes a few big swigs, and hands it back to the rabbi. The rabbi takes the bottle, immediately puts the cap back on, and hands it back to the priest!  The priest asks, ``Aren't you having any?''  To which the rabbi replies, ``No, I think I'll wait for the police ... ``  A CLEAN, UTTERLY NON-OFFENSIVE JOKE ... REALLY!!!  A man goes into a candy store and asks for 3 boxes of chocolates; 1 large box, 1 medium-sized box and 1 small box. As the candy store owner is gift wrapping them for the man, he asks the man why such an unusual order.  The man explains, ``Well, I have a date tonight. If we have a nice time, when I bring her home I will give her the small box of candy. If we have a very nice time and I think I might want to see her again, I will give her the medium-sized box of candy. If she is very, very friendly and we have a really good time, I will give her the large box of candy.''  His curiosity satisfied, the candy store owner gives the man his 3 boxes.  That night at dinner with his date and her parents, the man asks if he may give the before-meal blessing. He proceeds to give a deeply spiritual, moving, eloquent prayer. After he is finished, his date leans over to him and whispers, ``I didn't realize you were so spiritual.''  He leans back to her and whispers, ``I didn't realize that your father owned a candy store.''

SUFFERING WITH CIVILITY  By DAVID GRIMES  Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune  A group of local citizens has suggested that Feb. 3-7 be proclaimed ``Civility Week'' in an attempt to elevate the tone of public discourse and promote more polite, mannerly behavior in society in general.  I think this is a swell idea and long overdue, given the ever-increasing number of obnoxious jerks you run into nowadays.  In fact, I was so excited about the idea of Civility Week that I decided to start a little early. All day yesterday, I attempted to abide by the rules of civility and decorum as set down by Miss Manners, Amy Vanderbilt and various other droning nags ... er, I mean arbiters of taste and refinement.  Here is my Civility Day diary:  7:15 a.m. _ Roll out of bed and greet the day by belting out theme song from ``Sound of Music.''  7:16 a.m. _ Emit scream of pain as terrified pug dog clamps jaws down on Achilles tendon, dropping me to floor like a deer shot with a high-powered Winchester.  7:20 a.m. _ While attaching compression bandage to throbbing ankle, attempt to explain to dog, in as civil a manner as possible, that biting one's owner is not the polite thing to do.  7:25 a.m. _ Sustain mild concussion from blow to head by rolled-up newspaper wielded by wife, who accuses me of ``being mean'' to the dog.  7:33 a.m. _ Limping and with vision badly blurred, make way into kitchen for steadying cup of coffee.  7:40 a.m. _ Gag, clutch throat and see life pass before eyes.  7:50 a.m. _ As civilly as possible, explain to wife that it would be appreciated if, next time, she warns me that the coffee maker does not contain regular Folgers, as expected, but raspberry-walnut-mocha-fudge decaf, which, while it might be good for unstopping clogged sinks, is hardly what a man wants to be swallowing first thing in the morning.  7:55 a.m. _ Learn from tearful wife that I am an insensitive beast and that she hopes I find the garage comfortable because that is where I will be sleeping tonight.  9:01 a.m. _ Arrive at office where I am immediately pinned to the wall by wild-eyed copy editor who starts shoving boxes of Girl Scout cookies into my face.  ``What'll it be? Samoas? Thin Mints? Chalet Cremes? Trefoils? How many boxes can I put you down for? Ten? Twenty?''  9:10 a.m. _ When offer to buy one box of Do-si-dos, the copy editor looks at me as she might look at something disgusting stuck to the bottom of her shoe.  ``You just don't care if my daughter goes to Bryn Mawr, do you?'' she says icily.  9:20 a.m. _ Slump wearily behind desk and begin retrieving voice-mail messages. First caller demands to know why I hate the pope and insists I apologize to all Catholics; second caller demands to know why I hate cats and insists I apologize to all cat owners; third caller says she loves my column but, unfortunately, has me confused with Tom Lyons.  11:14 a.m. _ Paycheck hurled on desk by heavily perspiring features editor loaded down with nine boxes of Tagalongs. Politely tear open envelope to discover that medical benefits increase and raise works out to net pay hike of 37 cents a week.  6:02 p.m. _ Giddy nearly to the point of hysteria by the day's many civility-enhancing moments, I begin the drive home on U.S. 41, courteously veering around pedestrians and bike riders as often as possible. When I brake to avoid flattening an elderly woman pushing her worldly belongings across the highway in a shopping cart, I am treated to a mannerly single-digit salute by the driver behind me.  10:30 p.m. _ Curl up between lawn mower and leaf blower for a civil night's sleep.

Just look at our cars. There's nothing left, but we are unhurt. This must be a sign from God. God must have meant fo rus to meet and be friends and live together in peace for the rest of our days.''  The priest replies, ``Yes. I agree with you completely. This must be a sign from God.''  The rabbi continues: ``And look at this. Here's another miracle. My car is completely demolished, but this bottle of Kedem wine didn't break. Surely God wants us to drink this wine to celebrate our good fortune.''  Then he hands the bottle to the priest. The priest agrees, takes a few big swigs, and hands it back to the rabbi. The rabbi takes the bottle, immediately puts the cap back on, and hands it back to the priest!  The priest asks, ``Aren't you having any?''  To which the rabbi replies, ``No, I think I'll wait for the police ... ``  A CLEAN, UTTERLY NON-OFFENSIVE JOKE ... REALLY!!!  A man goes into a candy store and asks for 3 boxes of chocolates; 1 large box, 1 medium-sized box and 1 small box.

If we have a nice time, when I bring her home I will give her the small box of candy. If we have a very nice time and I think I might want to see her again, I will give her the medium-sized box of candy. If she is very, very friendly and we have a really good time, I will give her the large box of candy.''  His curiosity satisfied, the candy store owner gives the man his 3 boxes.  That night at dinner with his date and her parents, the man asks if he may give the before-meal blessing. He proceeds to give a deeply spiritual, moving, eloquent prayer. After he is finished, his date leans over to him and whispers, ``I didn't realize you were so spiritual.''  He leans back to her and whispers, ``I didn't realize that your father owned a candy store.''

SUFFERING WITH CIVILITY  By DAVID GRIMES  Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune  A group of local citizens has suggested that Feb. 3-7 be proclaimed ``Civility Week'' in an attempt to elevate the tone of public discourse and promote more polite, mannerly behavior in society in general.  I think this is a swell idea and long overdue, given the ever-increasing number of obnoxious jerks you run into nowadays.  In fact, I was so excited about the idea of Civility Week that I decided to start a little early. All day yesterday, I attempted to abide by the rules of civility and decorum as set down by Miss Manners, Amy Vanderbilt and various other droning nags ... er, I mean arbiters of taste and refinement.  Here is my Civility Day diary:  7:15 a.m. _ Roll out of bed and greet the day by belting out theme song from ``Sound of Music.''  7:16 a.m. _ Emit scream of pain as terrified pug dog clamps jaws down on Achilles tendon, dropping me to floor like a deer shot with a high-powered Winchester.  7:20 a.m. _ While attaching compression bandage to throbbing ankle, attempt to explain to dog, in as civil a manner as possible, that biting one's owner is not the polite thing to do.  7:25 a.m. _ Sustain mild concussion from blow to head by rolled-up newspaper wielded by wife, who accuses me of ``being mean'' to the dog.  7:33 a.m. _ Limping and with vision badly blurred, make way into kitchen for steadying cup of coffee.  7:40 a.m. _ Gag, clutch throat and see life pass before eyes.  7:50 a.m. _ As civilly as possible, explain to wife that it would be appreciated if, next time, she warns me that the coffee maker does not contain regular Folgers, as expected, but raspberry-walnut-mocha-fudge decaf, which, while it might be good for unstopping clogged sinks, is hardly what a man wants to be swallowing first thing in the morning.  7:55 a.m. _ Learn from tearful wife that I am an insensitive beast and that she hopes I find the garage comfortable because that is where I will be sleeping tonight.  9:01 a.m. _ Arrive at office where I am immediately pinned to the wall by wild-eyed copy editor who starts shoving boxes of Girl Scout cookies into my face.  ``What'll it be? Samoas? Thin Mints? Chalet Cremes? Trefoils? How many boxes can I put you down for? Ten? Twenty?''  9:10 a.m. _ When offer to buy one box of Do-si-dos, the copy editor looks at me as she might look at something disgusting stuck to the bottom of her shoe.  ``You just don't care if my daughter goes to Bryn Mawr, do you?'' she says icily.  9:20 a.m. _ Slump wearily behind desk and begin retrieving voice-mail messages. First caller demands to know why I hate the pope and insists I apologize to all Catholics; second caller demands to know why I hate cats and insists I apologize to all cat owners; third caller says she loves my column but, unfortunately, has me confused with Tom Lyons.  11:14 a.m. _ Paycheck hurled on desk by heavily perspiring features editor loaded down with nine boxes of Tagalongs. Politely tear open envelope to discover that medical benefits increase and raise works out to net pay hike of 37 cents a week.  6:02 p.m. _ Giddy nearly to the point of hysteria by the day's many civility-enhancing moments, I begin the drive home on U.S. 41, courteously veering around pedestrians and bike riders as often as possible. When I brake to avoid flattening an elderly woman pushing her worldly belongings across the highway in a shopping cart, I am treated to a mannerly single-digit salute by the driver behind me.  10:30 p.m. _ Curl up between lawn mower and leaf blower for a civil night's sleep.
