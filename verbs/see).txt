"131961"	"you"	"see)"	" Pass, say, a Ford Explorer on the roadway, and you might say, ``Wow, that's a big car,'' but you won't say, ``That's a neat truck.'' According to the federal government, however, the Explorer is a truck. It's a truck for purposes of the Clean Air Act of 1990, passed by Congress to update the laws limiting smog-causing emissions. The act has less-stringent limits for trucks (local contractors need them for work, you see), so getting SUVs classified as trucks is a political feat worth quite a bit to the auto industry. It's also a tricky class maneuver, since the exemption's benefits are passing from working class to more affluent Americans. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
