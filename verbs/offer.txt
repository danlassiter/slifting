"52392"	"I"	"offer"	" ``He would never lie to Newsweek,'' says John, his colleague at the magazine. And Klein seemed so innocent, I offer, when I saw him in Des Moines in January. He and I laughed about how well he fit the character of ``Jerry Rosen,'' the magazine writer in constant contact with the governor of New York, ``Orlando Ozio'' (Mario Cuomo). </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"
"84771"	"we"	"offer"	" Gentle Reader, we offer, with true humility and good intentions, a thought that came to New &AMP; Notable while Miss Manners was on her last book tour (read: media orgy) six months ago: Judith Martin is making a pest of herself. Now she is back to counsel us on our use of fax machines, beepers, e-mail, the telephone. Never one to condemn outright, New &AMP; Notable gives Miss Manners credit for restraint in this volume (her last book, Miss Manners Rescues Civilization, was about 40 times bigger) and for saying that call waiting is rude. But New &AMP; Notable perused these pages sadly, wondering whether Miss Manners thinks we are fools. Don't send letters of condolence by fax machine? Don't tell someone they are HIV-positive via e-mail? Gentle Reader, if Miss Manners thinks boors who do such things will sign up for basic training, she is not as smart as she thinks she is. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
