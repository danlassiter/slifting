But she has not done that part since ``The Bad and the Beautiful,'' in 1952.   Till now. At the age of 78, she's back in her old role in the forthcoming movie ``The Crossing Guard,'' which was written and directed by Sean Penn. It stars Jack Nicholson and Angelica Huston.   ``I was appearing in Los Angeles at the Vine Street Bar and Grill when, unbeknownst to me, the casting director, Bill Dance, came in,'' she said the other day.   ``He wanted me to come to his office to talk about singing in a picture with Jack Nicholson. The next day I went, we talked, and he said: `I love your personality. You've got the part.' ''   Ms. Brooks has found that many things have not changed since her last appearance in films. ``It was like going home again,'' she said.   In addition to her renewed film career, she is appearing at Michael's Pub through Saturday and has two new CD's out: one is a reissue of her old songs and the other is a new album.   NEW YORK -- Neil Simon is being honored by Lenox Hill Hospital at its annual Autumn Ball on Wednesday. And for what? The way he makes people feel better. The theme of the evening is Laughter Is the Best Medicine.   At the benefit, to be held at the Waldorf, Simon will receive the hospital's Medal of Distinction from Alan Alda, a friend and star of his play ``Jake's Women.''   ``Laughter does help, whether it comes from my plays or not,'' Simon said the other day from Los Angeles. ``It's hard to feel badly when you're laughing, and you never see people getting sick at comedies.''   In fact, Simon paid homage to the hospital by mentioning it by name in his play ``Laughter on the 23rd Floor.''   Simon said he had a longstanding personal connection to Lenox Hill. His first wife, Joan, who died of cancer in 1973 at the age of 39, had been a patient there.   ``I get offered all the time to please come to this and that, and I don't want to do them all,'' he said, ``but I didn't think twice about this, even though I have to go across the country.''  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941106.0093 type=story > <HEADLINE> NORTHERN ITALY HIT BY HEAVY RAINS, FLOODING </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> ROME  (BC-ITALY-RAINS-200&AMP;ADDS-ART-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"
