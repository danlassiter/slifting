It imports more from the United States than do most European countries, even after controlling for size, income and resources. What drives the bilateral trade deficit, they find, is America's particularly strong appetite for Japanese goods such as cars and VCRs. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199407.gz"

I love all of it. And I find it useful for my composition to get inside the orchestra doing a huge variety of pieces. I do refuse to conduct anything for recordings except my own pieces; the process simply takes up too much time. And so, I find, does the conducting itself, and for that reason I am about to take a year's sabbatical.

The effects of this radical realignment -- bodies nipped, tucked and lipo-sucked -- are on magazine covers, nitwit talk shows, sober news programs, daytime soaps, nighttime dramas and every type of movie. For the most part, these overtly plasticized personalities are a matter of curiosity and some distaste. I find plastic surgery neither morally nor politically objectionable; what bothers me are the aesthetics, the cavalcade of look-alike noses, stretched cheeks and bulbous breasts. And it is, I find, becoming increasingly difficult to see the actors -- and the acting -- for the plastic surgery. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"

Likewise, my shelves are overloaded with nonfiction titles that, 30 years ago, would have been 225 or 250 pages. I'm not sure why. Fatter spines do look more imposing, and readers may feel, subconsciously, that $30 should buy them a thick, substantial volume.
