Putterman's group has attempted some simple experiments aimed at detecting X-rays, but these have failed, to no one's surprise.

"14535"	"he"	"explains"	" Connery is dressed as if he has just strolled in from a golf course -- slacks, sport shoes, gray sport shirt with sleeves rolled up to reveal barely legible tattoos on his right forearm (they say ``Scotland Forever'' and ``Mum &AMP; Dad''), gray sweater tied around his neck. Although he is fighting jet lag, having flown from his home in Marbella, Spain, the interview begins precisely on time. Part of the Connery mystique stems from his air of panache, romantic brooding and a sense that he plays for keeps. But he cut short a youthful hitch in the British navy (where he acquired the tattoos) because of ulcers. No stranger to anxiety, he is a total pro who always shows up prepared and expects others to be. He is not casual about things going wrong. Hence, he explains, the producing. ``I've been doing it for 20 years,'' he says, grinning a lopsided grin, ``ever since I've had actor, director and script approval.

Pratt is shown preparing for a performance at High Point High School in Beltsville, Md., as part of his Outreach program.

The recent boom got under way in the late 1950s, he explains, with President Eisenhower's heart attack: ``His doctor, Paul Dudley White, didn't prescribe bed rest, he had the president out on the golf course.

"16720"	"she"	"explains"	" The phone rings right away. It's someone at the front desk asking if we'll switch our dinner reservations from the three-star dining room to the smaller, more informal auberge, La Ferme aux Grives, on the edge of the spa property.

(HLW) By LAUREL GRAEBER c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  PARALLEL TIME: Growing Up in Black and White  By Brent Staples. Avon, $11.  The author, an editorial writer for The New York Times, recalls his experiences as the eldest son of a black family in Chester, Pa., a town where obvious forms of segregation had vanished but more subtle divisions between the races were strong. His memoir explores those boundaries and the one between himself and his brother Blake, a drug dealer who died violently. ``It is a complex portrait of a worldly education, written at times with affection, at times with a sting,'' Verlyn Klinkenborg wrote here last year.  A BOOK OF COMMON PRAYER  By Joan Didion. Vintage International, $12.  Charlotte Douglas, a woman with no understanding of revolutions, seeks her 18-year-old daughter, who is trying to foment one. After participating in a bombing and a hijacking, the young woman is believed to be in Boca Grande, a fictional Central American country. Grace Strasser-Mendana, another American expatriate, tells their story. In 1977, our reviewer, Joyce Carol Oates, said that Joan Didion ``has been an articulate witness to the most stubborn and intractable truths of our time, a memorable voice, partly eulogistic, partly despairing; always in control.'' Vintage has also brought another of Ms. Didion's novels back into print: DEMOCRACY ($12), in which the author herself is a character. She narrates the drama of the Victor family, whose life in 1975 involves both politics and murder. The author ``is wonderful not only at hearing her characters but at naming them,'' Mary McCarthy said in the Book Review in 1984.  LISTENING  By Hannah Merker. Harper Perennial, $12.  More than two decades ago, the author went skiing for the first time _ an event that marked the last time she would ever hear completely. Her book assesses the importance of sound and demonstrates how she adjusted to the silence imposed by a devastating accident. Writing in these pages last year, Lou Ann Walker said: ``We feel her loss. ... But we are receptive to the lessons of listening she is teaching us.'' Also reissued is TRAIN GO SORRY: Inside a Deaf World, (Vintage, $13). The author, Leah Hager Cohen, is the daughter of the superintendent of the Lexington School for the Deaf in New York. A hearing child of hearing parents, she describes her life within a culture she could never really be part of. In 1994, our reviewer, Russ Rymer, said the book often reads ``like a love story _ as intimate, tender and troubling a love story as any you're likely to find.''  THE WAY WE KNOW IN DREAMS: Stories  By Gordon Weaver. University of Missouri, $14.95.  Many of the men in this collection are disappointed middle-aged souls who feel powerless to change their fates _ as well they might, since two of the other characters are God and Satan. The result is ``inspired, clever, and unexpected fiction,'' Chris Bohjalian wrote here last year. The men in the stories in WANTING ONLY TO BE HEARD, by Jack Driscoll (University of Massachusetts, $12.95), are even more desperate. Frequently hunters and fishermen, often bereft of female company, they live close to nature _ and to violence. In 1993, Jonis Agee said in the Book Review that ``Jack Driscoll's poetic language gives them a stature that makes their struggle meaningful, tragic and universal.''  MOTHERLESS DAUGHTERS: The Legacy of Loss  By Hope Edelman. Delta, $12.95.  The author, who was 17 when her mother died, draws on clinical research and the experiences of more than 200 other women to analyze the impact of such a loss. Daughters in mourning, she explains, often feel that their own lives are incomplete. This is ``a moving and valuable treatment of a neglected subject,'' Nancy Caldwell Sorel said here last year. Maternal roles are also examined in THE MYTHS OF MOTHERHOOD: How Culture Reinvents the Good Mother, by Shari L. Thurer (Penguin, $12.95). Ranging from the Stone Age to today, this history reveals how society, not biology, has defined women's task as parents. In 1994, our reviewer, Rachel Billington, called it ``positive, sensible and readable.''  ACTS OF LOVE  By Emily Listfield. Penguin, $10.95.  It's a familiar scenario: a gun goes off in a suburban living room, and a marital quarrel ends in death. The question this novel poses is whether Ted Waring deliberately or accidentally killed his estranged wife. The author's ``chilling meditation ... is a sobering reminder that some puzzles are better left unsolved,'' Sarah Ferguson said in the Book Review last year.  THE PROTEAN SELF: Human Resilience in an Age of Fragmentation  By Robert Jay Lifton. Basic Books, $13.  If a foolish consistency is indeed the hobgoblin of little minds, the author has found quite a few large-minded people. Their response to the dislocation of today's world is to become eminently adaptable. In 1994, our reviewer, Richard A. Shweder, found this ``a fascinating and appealing book because it is a near-perfect example of an intellectual stance that skeptics sometimes disparage.'' Human resilience is also evident in THE AGELESS SELF: Sources of Meaning in Late Life, by Sharon R. Kaufman (University of Wisconsin, $11.95). A study of 60 elderly men and women, it demonstrates that strength of spirit and mind often compensates for bodily weakness. It is ``a book that no novelist or indeed any caring person with a fondness for human interiors could resist,'' Paul West said here in 1987.  DROWN ALL THE DOGS  By Thomas Adcock. Pocket Books, $5.50.  Detective Neil Hockaday has to confront his own family's shadowy past when he returns to Ireland to find out about the father he never knew. Last year, our reviewer, Marilyn Stasio, called this mystery's dialogue ``lively and literate.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950507.0026 type=story > <HEADLINE> V-E DAY CELEBRATIONS TURN SOMBER IN BRITAIN </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> LONDON (BC-V-E-BRITAIN-500&AMP;add-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"

(HLW) By LAUREL GRAEBER c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  PARALLEL TIME: Growing Up in Black and White  By Brent Staples. Avon, $11.  The author, an editorial writer for The New York Times, recalls his experiences as the eldest son of a black family in Chester, Pa., a town where obvious forms of segregation had vanished but more subtle divisions between the races were strong. His memoir explores those boundaries and the one between himself and his brother Blake, a drug dealer who died violently. ``It is a complex portrait of a worldly education, written at times with affection, at times with a sting,'' Verlyn Klinkenborg wrote here last year.  A BOOK OF COMMON PRAYER  By Joan Didion. Vintage International, $12.  Charlotte Douglas, a woman with no understanding of revolutions, seeks her 18-year-old daughter, who is trying to foment one. After participating in a bombing and a hijacking, the young woman is believed to be in Boca Grande, a fictional Central American country. Grace Strasser-Mendana, another American expatriate, tells their story. In 1977, our reviewer, Joyce Carol Oates, said that Joan Didion ``has been an articulate witness to the most stubborn and intractable truths of our time, a memorable voice, partly eulogistic, partly despairing; always in control.'' Vintage has also brought another of Ms. Didion's novels back into print: DEMOCRACY ($12), in which the author herself is a character. She narrates the drama of the Victor family, whose life in 1975 involves both politics and murder. The author ``is wonderful not only at hearing her characters but at naming them,'' Mary McCarthy said in the Book Review in 1984.  LISTENING  By Hannah Merker. Harper Perennial, $12.  More than two decades ago, the author went skiing for the first time _ an event that marked the last time she would ever hear completely. Her book assesses the importance of sound and demonstrates how she adjusted to the silence imposed by a devastating accident. Writing in these pages last year, Lou Ann Walker said: ``We feel her loss. ... But we are receptive to the lessons of listening she is teaching us.'' Also reissued is TRAIN GO SORRY: Inside a Deaf World, (Vintage, $13). The author, Leah Hager Cohen, is the daughter of the superintendent of the Lexington School for the Deaf in New York. A hearing child of hearing parents, she describes her life within a culture she could never really be part of. In 1994, our reviewer, Russ Rymer, said the book often reads ``like a love story _ as intimate, tender and troubling a love story as any you're likely to find.''  THE WAY WE KNOW IN DREAMS: Stories  By Gordon Weaver. University of Missouri, $14.95.  Many of the men in this collection are disappointed middle-aged souls who feel powerless to change their fates _ as well they might, since two of the other characters are God and Satan. The result is ``inspired, clever, and unexpected fiction,'' Chris Bohjalian wrote here last year. The men in the stories in WANTING ONLY TO BE HEARD, by Jack Driscoll (University of Massachusetts, $12.95), are even more desperate. Frequently hunters and fishermen, often bereft of female company, they live close to nature _ and to violence. In 1993, Jonis Agee said in the Book Review that ``Jack Driscoll's poetic language gives them a stature that makes their struggle meaningful, tragic and universal.''  MOTHERLESS DAUGHTERS: The Legacy of Loss  By Hope Edelman. Delta, $12.95.  The author, who was 17 when her mother died, draws on clinical research and the experiences of more than 200 other women to analyze the impact of such a loss. Daughters in mourning, she explains, often feel that their own lives are incomplete. This is ``a moving and valuable treatment of a neglected subject,'' Nancy Caldwell Sorel said here last year. Maternal roles are also examined in THE MYTHS OF MOTHERHOOD: How Culture Reinvents the Good Mother, by Shari L. Thurer (Penguin, $12.95). Ranging from the Stone Age to today, this history reveals how society, not biology, has defined women's task as parents. In 1994, our reviewer, Rachel Billington, called it ``positive, sensible and readable.''  ACTS OF LOVE  By Emily Listfield. Penguin, $10.95.  It's a familiar scenario: a gun goes off in a suburban living room, and a marital quarrel ends in death. The question this novel poses is whether Ted Waring deliberately or accidentally killed his estranged wife. The author's ``chilling meditation ... is a sobering reminder that some puzzles are better left unsolved,'' Sarah Ferguson said in the Book Review last year.  THE PROTEAN SELF: Human Resilience in an Age of Fragmentation  By Robert Jay Lifton. Basic Books, $13.  If a foolish consistency is indeed the hobgoblin of little minds, the author has found quite a few large-minded people. Their response to the dislocation of today's world is to become eminently adaptable. In 1994, our reviewer, Richard A. Shweder, found this ``a fascinating and appealing book because it is a near-perfect example of an intellectual stance that skeptics sometimes disparage.'' Human resilience is also evident in THE AGELESS SELF: Sources of Meaning in Late Life, by Sharon R. Kaufman (University of Wisconsin, $11.95). A study of 60 elderly men and women, it demonstrates that strength of spirit and mind often compensates for bodily weakness. It is ``a book that no novelist or indeed any caring person with a fondness for human interiors could resist,'' Paul West said here in 1987.  DROWN ALL THE DOGS  By Thomas Adcock. Pocket Books, $5.50.  Detective Neil Hockaday has to confront his own family's shadowy past when he returns to Ireland to find out about the father he never knew. Last year, our reviewer, Marilyn Stasio, called this mystery's dialogue ``lively and literate.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950508.0111 type=story > <HEADLINE> `FASHION COPS' LURK IN CAPITOL CORRIDORS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-NO-PANTS-CONGRESS-NYTSF) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"

After graduating, she destroyed that early work not because she didn't believe in it, but because ``You leave college and you have no room to keep anything.'' After Slade, she took a bronze foundry course. Her earliest surviving work is a bronze cast of a rubber swim cap; it was difficult, she explains, to make bronze that thin. She turned a squishy bathing cap into a sinister-looking helmet, somehow linking innocent sport and war. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a 200-word sidebar By LAURIE TARKAN c.1994 McCall's magazine (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  A home of one's own is part of the American dream, but it can feel like a nightmare if your neighborhood loses its luster _ if, for instance, neighbors make excessive noise, teen-agers loiter late at night or an undesirable business opens nearby.  Luckily, you don't have to suffer many of these difficulties in silence. Here's what you can do to solve some common neighborhood problems. HOW TO TAKE ON TROUBLESOME NEIGHBORS  Typical complaints against neighbors include noise (attributable to everything from a loud stereo to a barking dog to marital spats), property defacement (by children or pets), trees (a neighbor's tree drops crab apples onto your property), fences (those that are too high block your view or are placed on your property) and eyesores (a yard overgrown with weeds).  But the law is usually in your corner. ``Most people are surprised to learn that anything that really disturbs their home is probably against the local law,'' says attorney Mark Warda, author of ``Neighbor vs. Neighbor'' (Sphinx Publishing, 1991). The majority of towns _ from rural outposts to big cities _ have ordinances specifically preventing annoyances.  Before you explore this route, though, try talking _ nicely. Minor problems can quickly escalate into major ones if they aren't handled with diplomacy. The best approach is to talk to your neighbor in person soon after the conflict arises.  If the problem persists, go to your local library to check which law specifically pertains to your neighbor's actions. In most cases, he probably doesn't know his behavior is a violation and presenting him with a copy of the ordinance will get him to stop.  If this doesn't work, consult a mediator _ an objective third party who is trained in helping people come to mutually agreeable solutions and will contact the neighbor. Mediation proves successful 90 percent of the time. Many counties even offer free dispute-resolution services. WAYS TO KEEP TEENS FROM TERRORIZING YOUR COMMUNITY  Vandalism is almost a rite of passage for some kids. Teens' antics can be as harmless as throwing an egg at a house or as destructive as spraying graffiti on walls.  In many communities, citizens are dealing with the problem head-on. ``When it comes to preventing youth crimes, it's not the police but the neighbors who can really have the most impact,'' says Stephanie Mann, co-author of ``Safe Homes, Safe Neighborhoods'' (Nolo Press, 1993), which details how to organize a neighborhood crime-prevention group.  ``When neighbors get organized, it sends a clear message to kids that they care about the neighborhood and that vandalism and crime won't be tolerated.'' Experts agree that it's definitely tougher to commit crimes where neighbors are unified than where they keep to themselves.  The first step in forming a crime-prevention group is to talk with neighbors. A start-up tactics Mann recommends: Conduct a face-to-face survey of your neighbors that asks about their concerns. Then invite them over for coffee to begin a dialogue about the issues.  As a group, she explains, you can organize cleanups of parks or abandoned lots and encourage neighbors to take good care of their property. (A well-maintained neighborhood is less likely to be attacked than one that appears run-down.)  If an abandoned lot is attracting drug dealers or garbage dumpers, the group can ask city officials to cite the owner for violating blighted-property laws, which prohibit property owners from allowing their land to fall into disrepair.  A neighborhood-watch program can also curb teen crime. These encourage residents to improve home security and report any suspicious activities they observe to the police. AN EFFECTIVE TACTIC FOR BLOCKING UNWELCOME BUSINESSES  You hear that a topless bar is going to open near your house or a homeless shelter, garbage dump or some other facility you believe may threaten your quality of life. Don't start packing.  In thousands of communities, NIMBYs _ which stands for ``not in my back yard'' and refers to groups of residents who fight a neighborhood change they perceive as undesirable _ try to block such developments. ``Overall, NIMBY groups are very successful,'' says Norman Krumholz, a professor of urban planning at Cleveland State University.  To block an unwanted building or use of land, residents typically organize, pass out petitions, appear at city- or town-council meetings and lobby local politicians.  Their most effective tactic is to present evidence that supports their concerns. For example, they might call upon real-estate experts who predict a decline in property values or use statistics to show that the presence of certain businesses increases crime. -0- SIDEBAR: NEGOTIATE LIKE A PRO  The way you discuss a conflict with a neighbor can make all the difference between resolving the dispute and making it worse. According to Jon Weiss, executive director of the Center for Conflict Resolution in Chicago, the following simple tactics will help ensure success:  _ FOCUS ON THE PROBLEM, NOT THE INDIVIDUAL. Try to separate the other person's personality or appearance _ which you may have a negative reaction to _ from the dispute at hand. You'll keep the argument from foolishly veering off into counterproductive personal attacks and will be able to channel all your energies into coming to an understanding.  _ BE RECEPTIVE TO SEVERAL SOLUTIONS. Don't get locked into just one way of solving the problem. The more options there are on the table, the sooner you'll reach an agreement. Be creative and present several solutions. Ask the other person for his or her ideas as well.  _ STICK TO YOUR INTERESTS AND NEEDS RATHER THAN YOUR PRINCIPLES. Instead of saying ``No one should play a radio loudly late at night,'' say ``I have trouble falling asleep at night because your music is loud.'' This prevents the other person from feeling judged and will help keep your conversation on track as to the specific nature of the problem.

By LEE RANDALL c.1994 Family Circle magazine (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  When you can't concentrate on your work, get to sleep or find a moment's peace until you've eaten a piece of chocolate (or some cookies, corn chips or ice cream), that's a craving!  Cravings compel people to go to extravagant lengths for satisfaction _ and carry with them the danger of bingeing and piling on unwanted pounds.  But don't despair: There are sane, sensible strategies for keeping these yearnings at bay. WHY WE CRAVE  Do longings for certain foods stem from our physiology or psychology? There are lots of theories, none yet proven. But one thing experts know for certain is that cravings are not your body's way of making you eat what it needs.  ``There is no evidence that people crave specific foods because of a nutritional deficiency,'' says Adam Drewnowski, director of the human nutrition program at the University of Michigan. ``For example, we don't crave chocolate, which is high in magnesium, because we're low in that mineral.''  But these quirky desires for particular foods may be triggered by other physiological occurrences, according to Drewnowski. ``If you crave chocolate, you may really need its relaxing effect on the body,'' he says. ``Chocolate causes endorphins _ the body's natural painkillers _ to be released in the brain.'' High-fat/high-sugar foods, such as chocolate and ice cream, seem to do this most effectively.  Researcher Sarah F. Leibowitz, a neurobiologist at Rockefeller University in New York City, says that higher levels of certain brain chemicals may confer a ``fat tooth,'' enhancing the appetite for high-fat foods. If this theory is true, scientists might one day be able to develop medications to help control this hunger.  Cravings may also be the result of an inborn reaction to stress. The ``fight or flight'' response makes us desire carbohydrates to replenish energy reserves _ needed when we lived in the wild and faced harsh physical challenges.  But nowadays most stress is psychological _ the pressures of work, family and relationships. We need to find better stress-fighters than eating. DIETING WHETS THE APPETITE  Non-stop dieting may seem like a good way to control your weight, but it turns out that the constant denial actually leaves you more vulnerable to temptation.  David Levitsky, professor of nutrition and psychology at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., says, ``Cravings arise primarily from overly restricted eating.''  Other experts believe that prolonged dieting can also have profound effects on the body, leaving you short on endorphins and less able to handle stress and pain _ so you can't relax.  But does that mean you should wave goodbye to your low-fat eating plan? Not if it's providing you with enough calories, nutrients and carbohydrates, Levitsky says. Eating a balanced diet seems to minimize cravings. HANDLING HANKERING  If you understand your temptations, you can beat them. The first step: Keep a journal of your cravings, when they occur and why. Soon you'll see a pattern showing vulnerable times of day and emotional situations that spark the urge to eat.  It's vital to distinguish between ``the general urge to eat vs. the desperate desire for the taste of lemon meringue pie,'' says Cathy Nonas, administrator of the Theodore B. Vanltallie Center for Nutrition and Weight Management of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York City. ``The first impulse could probably be counteracted by a broad range of foods.''  At times when you want something sweet, for example, but no one food comes to mind, try marshmallows, which are sugary but low in fat. Dying for a luscious texture? Try frozen non-fat yogurt.  On the other hand, if your food journal tells you that stress revs up your appetite, try finding non-dietary ways of managing it. Get more exercise, practice yoga, indulge in a massage, seek therapy _ anything that will help alleviate anxiety.  But at those times when nothing but the food you desire will do, experts suggest you eat it. ``Consider making dietary trade-offs and plan for your favorite treats,'' says Bettye Nowlin, who speaks on behalf of the American Dietetic Association.  ``If you really want cold noodles with sesame sauce, that's what you have to have,'' Nonas says. ``Eat the best-tasting version you can find.'' But if you kind of want Chinese food _ not anything specific _ try steamed broccoli with sauce on the side.  In the meantime, don't wait for a magic pill to come along and eliminate your cravings. Take control of them by figuring out what you really love to eat and when you simply must have some. Soon, you'll be calling the shots, instead of letting the food call you.

By CINDY PEARLMAN Distributed by New York Times Special Features  On May 26 the movie ``Casper,'' featuring everyone's favorite friendly ghost, will open in theaters across America.  Getting the comic-book character ready for this big-screen outing wasn't easy. It took $50 million, two years of special-effects planning, 28 trillion computer bytes and, for executive producer Jeffrey Montgomery, a good sense of humor.  That sense of humor came in handy on the days when the biggest and most mind-boggling question on the set was: Why does Casper have only four fingers?  ``It's easier to draw four fingers,'' explains Montgomery, who is also chairman and CEO of The Harvey Entertainment Co., which publishes the Casper comic books.  Montgomery was the one who sold Steven Spielberg and Amblin Entertainment on the idea that the world needed a new Friendly Ghost movie. But he never imagined how difficult such a film would be to make.  After all the work involved in bringing Casper to the big screen, would Montgomery do it again?  Absolutely. In fact, two of his company's other comic-book characters, Baby Huey and Wendy the Witch, are the stars of films that are currently in development.  And they aren't the only ones. One of the hottest concepts in Hollywood these days involves lifting comic-book characters off the drawing board and splashing them across the silver screen.  ``This is the fashionable trend of the moment,'' says Joe Yanerillo, managing editor of Wizard: The Guide to Comics, a monthly magazine that covers the industry.  ```Batman' and `The Mask' woke everyone up (and showed) that these movies could be huge. You have built-in storylines and exciting plots. Comics are natural movies. And this is just the beginning.''  ``The Mask'' (1994) grossed $120 million and the original ``Batman'' (1989) hauled in $251 million. No wonder dozens of comic-book artists are suddenly taking meeting after meeting in La-La land.  Some recent examples of comic book-based films include ``The Crow'' (1994), ``Richie Rich'' (1994) and ``Tank Girl'' (1995).  What's the thinking behind the trend?  ``Baby boomers long for these movies,'' Montgomery says. ``And the past comic movies have surprised people. They haven't been cheesy but entertaining and high-concept.''  Another reason for the glut of such films: recent advances in special-effects technology.  Jim Carrey, who will soon start filming ``The Mask II,'' saw the incredible potential while making the original film.  ``I feel like a kid in a candy store,'' he said at the time. ``I'm at ILM (Industrial Light &AMP; Magic) watching them morph my body into anything. There are no limits to what you can do.''  Hollywood seems to like comic book-based movies because they usually don't require major brain power.  ``There's a hero and there's a villian,'' Carrey said. ``Comic books are also very visual. The stories are high-concept and understood quickly.''  And the books have loyal readers _ many of whom can't wait to see their old friends come to life on the big screen.  Chris O'Donnell, who plays Robin in the forthcoming ``Batman Forever,'' knows the feeling.  ``I used to run home from school to watch `Batman' (on television),'' he says. ``Now I've got the keys to the Batmobile. It's like my childhood dream come true.''  Lori Petty, who plays Tank Girl in the film of the same name, has been in love with comic-book characters for a long time.  ``I remember stashing away all these comics,'' she says. ``As a kid, you'd read them and then play Superhero Queen of the Universe. As Tank Girl, I'm just living this out on a higher budget.''  Of course there's nothing new about comic-book films.  In the '40s and '50s, films and serials such as the ``Flash Gordon'' series, ``The Adventures of Captain Marvel,'' ``Captain America'' and ``Superman'' kept kids entertained at Saturday matinees.  But those films were usually made on the cheap. The special effects were laughable and the stars were B-list.  Now that's changed. Thanks to high-tech special effects, budgets for comic book-based films can reach $40 million or more.  Comic-book artist Rob Liefeld, 27, recently optioned the rights to his ``Prophet'' character to TriStar Films for a reported six figures.  ``Prophet is on par with Batman. His sales are comparable,'' Liefeld says. ``But he's more like a science-fiction superhero than a classic caped crusader.''  Liefeld says he is now meeting with studio executives about his other comic-book creations, including ``Youngblood,'' ``Supreme,'' ``Brigade,'' ``Trool'' and ``Newman.''  Of course, there's no guarantee of success with such films. The comic-book based flops ``Howard the Duck'' (1986) and ``Meteor Man'' (1993) are proof of that.  But a hit can be especially sweet for many reasons _ including merchandising opportunities. Think about Casper notepads. X-Men underwear. Tank Girl toys.  ``Millions of dollars are on the line,'' says Pamela Rutt, vice president of public relations for Marvel Comics, the company that owns the rights to ``Spider-Man,'' ``The X-Men'' and several other popular characters who will soon be coming to the silver screen.  Here's a rundown of some of the comic-book films you can expect to see in the near future:  _ ``Casper'' (opening May 26) is sort of a teen romance with the friendly ghost falling for ``The Addams Family's'' Christina Ricci. The film includes state-of-the-art special effects from Industrial Light &AMP; Magic.  _ ``Batman Forever'' (June 16) is the third in the modern movie series about the Caped Crusader. This time Val Kilmer steps into the rubber costume. He teams with the Boy Wonder (O'Donnell) and meets new Gotham girl Nicole Kidman. Their mission? To foil the plans of the Riddler (Jim Carrey in an orange wig) and Harvey Two Face (Tommy Lee Jones).  _ ``Judge Dredd'' (June 30) stars Sylvester Stallone in the title role as a futuristic superhero. It is based on a British comic-book series.  _ ``The Fantastic Four'' is a $40 million-plus film in development. Chris Columbus (``Home Alone,'' ``Mrs. Doubtfire'') will reportedly direct a story based on the Marvel Comic superheroes: Mr. Fantastic, the Invisible Girl, the Human Torch and the Thing.  _ ``Spider-man'' will have you climbing the walls soon enough. The lavish, big-budget, special-effects bonanza should start filming next year under the direction of James (``Terminator'') Cameron. Arnold Schwarzenegger has been mentioned as a possibility for the role of the villain.  _ ``Godzilla'' will be directed by ``Speed's'' Jan DeBont. Filming is expected to begin later this year.  _ ``Prophet,'' about a regular guy-turned-superhero, should hit theaters next year. The story revolves around a man who volunteers for a series of experiments and is transformed into a supersoldier.  _ A new ``Superman'' film is reportedly in the works. Producer Jon Peters is talking about finding a younger Superman (sorry, Christopher Reeve). Casting is still up in the air, so to speak.  _ ``The Incredible Hulk'' is reportedly being developed by action producer Gale Ann Hurd. No word on casting as of yet.  Other A-list projects in the works include: ``X-Men,'' produced by ``Lethal Weapon'' director Richard Donner; ``Dr. Octopus,'' based on the Marvel comic series; ``Luke Cage'' or ``Cage,'' also based on a Marvel comic; and ``Blade,'' which director Ernest Dickerson is developing. c.1995 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.) ------------------------------------------------- (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448; fax: 816-822-1444.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Mel Gibson in a scene from ``Braveheart.'' By IAN SPELLING Distributed by New York Times Special Features  Mel Gibson never considered himself a connoisseur of epic films. Nor was he ever much of an expert on Scottish history.  Yet when the script for ``Braveheart'' _ a three-hour saga about the 13th-century Scottish hero William Wallace _ came to the actor's attention late in 1993, he couldn't resist it. Gibson knew right away that he wanted not only to star in the film but also to produce and direct it.  ``It's a great story. It had everything: love, honor, conflict, life and death and all of the stuff,'' Gibson says during an interview at a Los Angeles hotel.  ``I liked the scope and the range of where it took me. I'd already shot it in my head three times before I said I wanted to direct it.''  Executives at Paramount Pictures, the studio that financed ``Braveheart,'' knew from the start how excited Gibson was about the script.  ``Which is always a bad thing,'' Gibson says, ``because they tend to take advantage of that.''  Yet he ended up having a ``really good experience'' with the studio.  ``They were very supportive of me and gave me everything I needed,'' he says.  And he needed a lot. Bringing ``Braveheart'' to the screen meant lavishing well over $50 million on location shooting in Scotland and Ireland, hiring up to 2,000 extras and hundreds of trained horses for some scenes, designing thousands of detailed period costumes and constructing numerous elaborate sets.  There was also the matter of staging two extended, brutal battle sequences between Wallace's ragtag band of Scottish freedom fighters and the more polished, heavily armed forces of the British king, Edward the Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan).  Before beginning production, Gibson pored through history books to learn as much as he could about Sir William Wallace, a figure whose exploits have been steeped in a combination of fact and legend.  He then set out to assemble a cast that, while relatively low on star power, possessed the acting chops to pull off their respective roles.  Among those actors are McGoohan, best known to American television audiences as ``The Prisoner'' in the classic 1960s series of the same name; French actress Sophie Marceau as Longshank's reluctant daughter-in-law, Princess Isabella; newcomer Angus McFadyen as Robert the Bruce, a would-be king of Scotland and supposed Wallace ally; and Catherine McCormack as Wallace's beloved wife, whose murder at the hands of the British compels him to drive the English out of Scotland once and for all.  ``All of these people are wonderful,'' Gibson says. ``I just looked for the best actresses and actors I could find.  ``I was quite fortunate to come up with people who looked as they should and who could behave like the characters.''  The actors apparently felt just as fortunate to be working on a project headed by Gibson.  McCormack says she was pleasantly surprised to find that the 39-year-old star of the ``Lethal Weapon'' and ``Mad Max'' trilogies wasn't nearly as intimidating as she imagined.  ``He made it all very comfortable,'' she explains during a separate interview. ``He's very down to earth, no ego.  ``Most of my scenes were with him, so there was very little direction involved. We sort of just did the scenes, improvised a bit, and if things didn't work we talked it through.  ``It was a great experience working with him. I think he's directed an amazing film.''  Gibson, who made his directing debut with the respectable but imperfect film drama ``The Man Without a Face'' (1993), says that at no time did he feel as if he'd bitten off more than he could chew with ``Braveheart.''  That confidence probably came from the endless preparation he did _ everything from getting himself into ideal physical shape to storyboarding the immense battle sequences in detail.  ``I didn't go in and just do it off the top of my head,'' Gibson says. ``I went in armed to the teeth.  ``I ate my Wheaties, took vitamins, went running, brought a chiropractor along and was as clearheaded as I could possibly be. That was just on a personal level.  ``The everyday work situations also called for planning. Those battle sequences were done first on a table for three weeks with plastic soldiers to make them as cinematic as possible and so that I could organize the strategy.  ``Then it took six weeks just to shoot one battle, because I wanted the audience to feel as if they were really in the middle of those battles.''  When the film is released May 24 it will begin its own battle _ for box-office receipts. Because it comes on the heels of ``Rob Roy'' (the Scottish period piece starring Liam Neeson) and because it has a three-hour running time (which will limit the number of times a theater can show the picture in a given day), ``Braveheart'' could have a hard time attracting large audiences and recouping its production costs.  Gibson, however, quickly dismisses both concerns.  ```Rob Roy' is a totally different film,'' he says earnestly. ``It's a little story, like a Western.  ``It doesn't explore the same territory at all, and it's set in a different time frame.''  And the film's length?  ``I knew `Braveheart' would be longish, and I signed a contract that said I could come in at two hours and 15 minutes. I showed the studio the rough cut, which was three hours and 45 minutes long, and they threw out the contract.  ``They said, `That's OK, just cut some out.' So I cut out an hour. I think we'll do fine.''  He's equally confident about his latest acting project: an animated version of ``Pocahantas'' that the Walt Disney Co. is hoping will be its next blockbuster along the lines of ``The Lion King'' and ``Beauty and the Beast.''  Gibson _ whose last film, the 1994 comedy-Western ``Maverick,'' was a hit both domestically and internationally _ provides the voice of ``Pocahontas''' British captain John Smith. He sheepishly reveals, however, that his big singing number didn't make the film's final cut.  ``I guess they only want me to sing in the shower,'' Gibson jokes. ``The film is good, actually, really well done.  ``Disney always does those animated films pretty well. I did it for my kids and they liked it a lot.''  With two films about to open (``Pocahantas'' hits theaters June 23) and his production company, Icon Productions, at work on several new projects, Gibson has more than a few irons in the fire.  Yet his No. 1 priority for the next few months is something pretty simple.  ``Rest,'' he says, feigning exhaustion. ``Rest. I've got to recharge the old batteries.'' c.1995 Ian Spelling  (Ian Spelling is a New York-based free-lance writer.)

"23225"	"he"	"explains"	" Henry Rollins, varying only slightly from his spoken-word performances, plays a ranting doctor trying to cure Nerve Attenuation Syndrome, a disease that causes people to shake as if their circuits were overloaded. Nerve Attenuation Syndrome, he explains, is caused by information overload. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"23334"	"he"	"explains"	" As an admiring Allen Ginsberg suggests, Bowles' prose is characterized by a bleak implacability. Perhaps that's because readers can't see the smile on his face as he speaks of writing, saying that it isn't what's written that counts, but the style in which it's written. Bowles is almost cheerful when he admits to emotional remoteness, a consequence, he explains, of parents who showed him no love after he was born in Jamaica, N.Y., in 1910. Composer Ned Rorem provides the major assessment of Bowles' other creative body of work _ his music. Spare, compressed, elegant and often jaunty in the manner of Satie and Les Six, his compositions include chamber and vocal works and music for stage productions by Orson Welles, Lillian Hellman and Tennessee Williams. But persuasive and interesting as those commenting on Bowles' life are, it's Bowles himself who remains the major source of revelation. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"23536"	"he"	"explains"	" But the creationists insist that evolution remains an unproved theory that attacks the heart of their faith. In a particularly clear exposition of that position, Paul Lindstrom, who runs the Christian Liberty Academy, tells Balmer that the notion of evolution constitutes a rebellion against God. If the biblical account of the fall of man is not literally true, he explains, then the Christian idea of sin becomes a fiction, and so there is no need for a Saviour. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"23935"	"he"	"explains"	" If you put assets in the name of a future college student, he explains, under standard financial-aid rules the school will deem 35 percent of that money as usable for tuition and thereby reduce the student's eligibility for aid. It may be a better idea to give the money to the parents instead, who will only be tapped for up to 5.65 percent of their savings under the rules. Best to check with your accountant or a financial aid planner. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

"25229"	"he"	"explains"	" Perhaps fittingly in this era of lawyer-bashing, the standout losers could be the lawyers, who get paid by the hour. And then there are those shareholders who hold on to their shares of the newly formed company, which may or may not be deemed a winner after the expensive acquisition is folded into the parent. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950614.0559 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-GRAPHICS-SPECIAL-ADVISORY) </DATELINE> <TEXT> ATTENTION EDITORS:  Due to their file sizes, the following graphics have been posted on PressLink and NewsCom only.

When the monks, from Gyuto Tantric University in India, showed up for a behind-the-scenes tour of the facilities, they told zoo directors that their chants had certain healing powers. Were there any unhealthy animals in the house?  There was, in fact: Shin the snow leopard, wasting away from digestive problems that had ruined her appetite.  The media were called and the monks assembled. The snow leopard was up in a tree, looking depressed. But once the chanting began, the story goes, Shin climbed down 15 feet, sat just in front of the monks and seemed quite captivated by the chanting. When the show was over, she walked away in what seemed to be better spirits. And later that day, Shin actually had some food.  Ann Fraser of KPIX did a full report for Bay Area TV viewers, and an Associated Press story went out across the nation: The monks had saved the snow leopard.  This was just the kind of news _ miracle wrought by holy men _ that appealed to the Religious News Service, which weighed in with its own version of events. The Voice of America did a story, too, and then National Public Radio, whose five-minute piece was broadcast this week. Whereupon, said zoo public relations director Nancy Chan, NBC News called, and then the Sunday Times of London.  Unfortunately, the miracle patient had passed on to that big jungle in the sky last Friday.  ``I just got a call from a reporter in Boca Raton, Fla.,'' Chan said. ``I told her that the snow leopard had died. She said maybe she wouldn't do the story.''  BARBIE GOES ALL, LIKE, SPORTY  The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games has licensed an Olympic edition of the Barbie doll. ``Barbie is always doing whatever people, kids, are interested in,'' said Mattel spokeswoman Lisa McKendall.  The $19.99 plastic figurine series will include Barbies dressed in Olympic uniforms (outfits, in Barbie lingo) of various countries.  GORILLAS IN THE SMOKE?  The Rubbish Rangers of Leal Elementary School in Mission, Texas, have sent word of their latest campaign: By Earth Day, April 22, 1996, they want to have smoking abolished in zoos all over the world.  The Rangers have sent letters to zoos all across the country: ``Smoking pollutes the air and can be hazardous to the animals' and visitors' health. ... Animals should be protected from smoke in their zoo environment.''  At the San Francisco Zoo, smoking is prohibited in all buildings, but allowed in outdoor areas. Officials said that zoo rules are rules that prevail at all San Francisco facilities.  If the zebras want protection from secondhand smoke, said the zoo folk, they'll have to prevail on city bureaucrats.  APES FIRST  Analysts at Inside Media note with surprise this week that advertising for the new movie ``Congo'' includes credits for writer, director, producer, score and editor, but none at all for the actors.  The movie stars Laura Linney and Dylan Walsh, neither of them well-known, and Tim Curry and Ernie Hudson, who are better known.  A source ``close to the film,'' which was based on a novel by Michael Crichton, explained:  ``The focal point for the publicity is that `Congo' is by the author of `Jurassic Park.' And they wanted to emphasize the gorillas.''  HOW TO RAISE MONEY IN THESE GENEROUS TIMES  Michael Musto of the Village Voice describes a recent fund-raiser at a brand-new Manhattan theme restaurant called the Fashion Cafe. The event was organized by DISHES, an acronym for Determined Involved Supermodels Helping to End Suffering, he explains, to raise money to fight pediatric AIDS.  It was highlighted by an auction of clothes that were displayed on mannequins whose heads were covered with paper bags on which likenesses of Sharon Stone and James Carville were painted. In the background, writes Musto, was ``a samba band rollicking through `Everything Gives You Cancer.'

"26610"	"he"	"explains"	" The kitchen is his refuge, the 41-year-old Kerasiotes explains later, after his crisp, puffy (itals)tiropetes(unitals) turn out to be a big hit. The triumph loosens him a little. He made these phyllo-dough triangles, filled with cheese, the day before. Today, as he pulls them out of the oven with a flourish, one little triangle slips unnoticed onto the floor of the stove and spends the afternoon in the hot oven turning browner and browner. Years ago, says Kerasiotes, long before tunnels and arteries and schemes for bridges entered his realm, ``I could never relax.'' So he took up fishing, which is fine for warm weather, but found he needed another source of calm. ``Cooking is the only other thing that's relaxing,'' he says, ``and it's connected to other things.'' Some of these, he explains, have their roots in the kitchen of his boyhood home in Peekskill, N.Y., where his 76-year-old mother and 92-year-old father live today. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

"31773"	"he"	"explains"	" One of Walker's current projects involves regilding an immense 19th-century mirror. Gilding, he explains, involves more than merely slapping on some gold leaf. Preparatory layers culminate in ``bole,'' a mix of clay and rabbit-skin glue that comes in colors and gives the gilding depth. To get the gold on, Walker strokes his face with a brush, to create static electricity that will then pick up the ethereal flecks of 23-karat gold, which the sizing in the bole will pull down flat. To demonstrate the process, Walker gilds a visitor's finger, as if the digit in question were the first step in creating a gilded lady like the one in ``Goldfinger.'' </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950821.0320 type=story > <HEADLINE> THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING KEANU </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-MOVIES-KEANU-BOS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"

Includes a 250-word sidebar By JOHN KEHOE c.1995 A&AMP;E Monthly magazine (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  I like to cook. I like to read. I love to read cookbooks, joyously, uncritically, for sheer pleasure.  But in the kitchen I demand that a cookbook be well written, well ordered, authoritative, that it not presuppose a level of skill among its users unless explicitly stated and that it be handsomely produced.  And it must be more than merely fashionable. Culinary trends come and go. The cookbooks that live up to these criteria are both valuable tools and things of beauty.  What follows is a personal list of in-print books I think are worth attention. -0-  1. ``The Joy of Cooking'' by Irma Rombauer (North American Library, 1989). The cornerstone of the kitchen library.  Utterly American (containing perhaps the definitive recipe for strawberry shortcake), marked by an odd, sly wit, containing a large number of well-detailed recipes and also giving the beginning or nearly proficient cook what he or she needs most: a sense of achievement, confidence and the will to attempt greater challenges.  As essential in the kitchen as a stove.  2. ``The Fannie Farmer Cookbook'' by Marion Cunningham (Knopf, 1990). The other cornerstone.  Deep, if not wide, accessible, dependable, it offers beginners exactly what ``Joy of Cooking'' does but from a different, equally valuable angle. Some people would say both books aren't necessary. I don't.  3. ``The New Basics'' by Shelia Lukins and Julee Rosso (Workman, 1989). The Lukins-Rosso team, of Silver Palate fame, have produced perhaps the only general, wide-ranging cookbook of the past 30 years that even approaches the depth and ease of use of the above-listed classics. Its more contemporary sensibility might make it a bit more appealing to the modern reader.  4. and 5. ``The New James Beard'' by James Beard (Knopf, 1984) and ``The Theory and Practice of Good Cooking'' by James Beard (Random House, 1990). James Beard was arguably the man who made American cooks take their craft seriously. He wrote more than a dozen books, all of them lively and informative, but these are of particular note.  Distinctive recipes and impeccable organization, but the illuminating principle here is the very evident delight Beard took in cooking and, more important, eating.  6. ``The Chez Panisse Menu Cookbook'' by Alice Waters (Random House, 1982). The recipes are detailed and challenging. For those who don't know their way around the cutting board, there are easier places to start. But a serious cook must have this book. Try the ``Baked Stuffed Nectarines,'' a totally marvellous dessert.  7. and 8. ``Jeremiah Tower's New American Classics'' by Jeremiah Tower (Random House, 1986) and ``The Union Square Cafe Cookbook'' by Danny Meyer and Michael Romano (HarperCollins, 1994). Two completely different esthetics _ Tower representing California cuisine in all its initial innocence and purity, the Union Square team standing in for the sophisticated New York City contingent. Both are remarkably successful.  Tower's ``Cream of Fresh Corn Soup, Mendicino Style'' will take your breath away, while Union Square's ``Hot Garlic Potato Chips'' will bring tears of joy to your eyes.  9. ``Martha Stewart's Menus for Entertaining'' by Martha Stewart (Crown, 1994). The caveat about Stewart's books is that she writes for cooking in a fully equipped gourmet kitchen and for cooks with years of experience and a trained staff. Still, she's very good and this book is her best.  10. ``The Frugal Gourmet Cooks with Wine'' by Jeff Smith (Morrow, 1986). Cooking with wine is underappreciated. The result is great food and Smith does it as well as it can be done. The recipe for ``Beef Bourguignon'' alone is worth the price.  11. ``Mastering the Art of French Cooking,'' Vol. 1 by Julia Child (Knopf, 1979). Child is magnifique. Her directions and prose are as clear as a bell, her technique unrivaled. This book is enough to keep a cook busy for years. And there are two volumes.  12. and 13. ``Pierre Franey's Cooking In America'' by Pierre Franey (Knopf, 1994) and ``Simply French'' by Patricia Wells (Morrow, 1991). These two books are good backups for Child. The ``Creamy Cucumber Salad with Curry'' from ``Simply French'' is casual French cuisine at its best.  14. ``Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking'' by Marcella Hazan (Knopf, 1992). Hazan does for Italy what Child does for France and keeps to the same stratospheric standards. Simple, direct, fabulous recipes _ the single best book on ``high kitchen'' Italian cooking now extant.  15. ``Pasta Classica'' by Julia Della Croce (Chronicle Books, 1987). Like this book, pasta is deceptively simple _ the more you eat it, the more you appreciate it. Casual, breezy, but fully informed and beautifully designed and illustrated _ this is a wonderful title.  16., 17. and 18. ``Tommy Tang's Modern Thai Cuisine'' by Tommy Tang (Doubleday, 1991), ``Ken Hom's Chinese Kitchen'' by Ken Hom (Hyperion, 1995) and ``China Moon Cookbook'' by Barbara Tropp (Workman, 1992).  The subtle complexity of Thai food is explicated in an admirably direct manner by Tommy Tang. Barbara Tropp's educated and appreciative take on Chinese cooking is a recommended introduction, after which Ken Hom's slightly more technical and demanding directions are easier to understand and carry out.  19. and 20. ``The Cuisines of Mexico'' by Diana Kennedy (HarperCollins, 1989) and ``Coyote Cafe Cookbook'' by Mark Miller (Ten Speed Press, 1989). Kennedy writes on authentic Mexican cooking in an imperious, even regal manner. Miller writes about the hybrid Southwestern cuisine in an earnest, almost eager-to-please tone. Two unquestioned masters of their genres.  Miller's crackling-with-excitement creativity is showcased in recipes such as ``Blue Corn Trout.'' Kennedy's voice of tradition and authority leads the initiate through the subtle complexities of a mole sauce. Both, highly recommended.  21. ``The Wolfgang Puck Cookbook'' by Wolfgang Puck (Random House, 1995). Infused with the simple joy of cooking fine food.  22. ``Sauces'' by James Petersen (Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1991). Closer to a textbook than a cookbook, this is the definitive volume on the preparation and creation of any sauce, from bearnaise to ketchup. Well written, informative and extremely interesting.  23. ``In the Kitchen with Rosie'' by Rosie Daley (Knopf, 1994). This isn't just a low-fat, heart-smart cookbook _ it's a publishing phenomena, with millions of copies in print. And the food tastes great!  24. ``Eating Well with Burt Wolf'' by Burt Wolf (Doubleday, 1994). Wolf was cooking light before we knew we had to. This is a well-considered, taste-tested route to healthy eating. His TV show is also fun.  25. ``Sundays at Moosewood'' by the Moosewood Collective (Fireside/Simon and Schuster, 1990). For the ever-increasing vegetarian population, this is an excellent, tried-and-true guide to meatless meals.  26. ``The Thrill of the Grill'' by Chris Schlesinger and John Willoughby (Morrow, 1990). This book only fans the flames of one's passion for cooking over an open fire. It contains explicit directions on the proper care and maintenance of the fire and a slew of absolutely impeccable recipes.  27. ``Around the World'' by Shelia Lukins (Workman, 1995). Every now and then, one is seized by the desire to use exotic ingredients such as toasted sesame seeds or apple chutney. When such a moment strikes, be glad Lukins has traversed the globe and collected a great number of wonderful recipes that employ exactly such ingredients.  28. ``Chef Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen'' by Paul Prudhomme (Morrow, 1984). Culinary trends may come and go, but there are exceptions. New Orleans may be the unrecognized culinary capital of America _ and Prudhomme is revered there. The recipes are plainly stated: The book is well organized and the results are memorable in the extreme.  29. ``A Taste of Old Cuba'' by Maria Josefa Lluria de O'Higgins (HarperCollins, 1994). Fascinating as a memoir of a time and place gone forever and equally as enthralling as a cookbook proper, this is an exceptional volume. The recipes _ including those for a totally wonderful ``Garlic Soup'' and a classic, classical ``Flan'' _ are clear, direct and exemplary.  30. ``The Cake Bible'' by Rose Beranbaum (Morrow, 1988). Exactly what it says it is: everything you ever wanted to know about cakes. This is a big, thick, delicious book. It can make one feel full just looking through it.  31. ``Mrs. Fields' I Love Chocolate! Cookbook'' by Debbie Fields (Time-Life, 1994). There are many other chocolate cookbooks. There are other authors perhaps more esteemed than cookie-maven Fields. But this is the book that has the recipe for a ``Double Fudge Chip Cake'' that is heavenly! -0- SIDEBAR: OUT-OF-PRINT, BUT NOT OUT OF MIND  Cookbooks are lately being collected for a variety of reasons. Culinary historians use them as a record of food trends; professional chefs use them as sourcebooks for old dishes to resurrect with a new spin; and book collectors appreciate their rarity and potential profitability. Cookbooks are after all heavily used and easily damaged. A first edition of ``The Joy of Cooking'' in good condition could easily bring thousands of dollars.  I keep an eye out for interesting cookbooks at yard and book sales, depending on whim and circumstances to put into my hands what it may. If I were looking for one title in particular, I could probably find it at one of the bookstores listed below, all of which specialize in ``literature culinaire'' and maintain a stock of new and out-of-print books.  _ Kitchen Arts and Letters, 1435 Lexington Ave., New York, N.Y. 10128; (212) 876-5550.  _ The Cookbook Cottage, 1279 Bardstown Road, Louisville, Ken. 40204; (502) 458-5227.  _ The Cook's Library, 8373 W. 3rd St., Los Angeles, Calif. 90048; (213) 655-3141.  _ Powell's Books for Cooks, 3739 S.E.

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) By KARYN REPINSKI c.1995 Longevity magazine (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Every generation seems to live and die by its own set of beauty myths.  In our grandmothers' era, women counted on the fact that 100 strokes a day would keep their hair shiny and healthy. Similarly, our mothers stocked their cupboards with Jell-O, partly because they believed that consuming gelatin would make their nails grow stronger.  Considering how hungry women are for some hard-and-fast rules about holding onto their looks, who can blame them for buying into these myths?  Indeed, the same could be said of women today. While those old notions may now sound rather foolish, in reality they've been replaced by a whole new crop of beauty myths.  Here are 10 of them and some help separating fact from fiction. -0- MYTH NO. 1: DRINKING LOTS OF WATER KEEPS SKIN YOUTHFUL-LOOKING  Of all the beauty myths, this is the one that most annoys Dr. Seth L. Matarasso, a San Francisco-based dermatologist. ``Women have got to stop drinking 100 glasses of water a day,'' he says.  Acknowledging that water helps clean the kidneys and act as an appetite suppressant, he says that short of bloating you up and temporarily getting rid of some wrinkling, ``it doesn't do a whole lot for the complexion.'' MYTH NO. 2: SOAP IS BAD FOR THE SKIN  ``Women have been bullied: `You use soap on your skin? Oh, my word!''' says Dr. Amy E. Newburger, a Scarsdale, N.Y.-based dermatologist.  Technically a mix of animal fats _ called tallow _ and fruit or vegetable oils _ such as coconut and palm _ traditional soap, which has a high pH, can in fact be drying, particularly to aging skin.  But these days the definition of soap has been expanded to include cleansers formulated with synthetic surfactants, which cleanse skin in a milder manner than true soap.  Moreover, according to David Lozano, vice president of research and development at Physicians Formula, maker of two new Gentle Cleansing Facial Bars, it's possible to add ingredients such as emollients to these bars that are ``benevolent'' to skin. Such soaps are often referred to as ``superfatted.''  If you prefer that ``squeaky-clean'' feeling soap provides, however, there's nothing wrong with using it. One dermatologist says she has some 80-year-old patients with ``gorgeous'' skin who have used it every day of their lives. MYTH NO. 3: SCALP MASSAGE CAN TURN AROUND HAIR LOSS  If it can, it's never been scientifically proven, says Dr. Helene Rosenzweig, a dermatologist based in Encino, Calif.  Proponents of massage _ treatments typically involve rubbing an oil-based formula into the scalp _ claim a myriad of benefits, including an increase in circulation to the scalp, which causes the hair bulb to be flooded with the nutrients necessary for healthy hair growth.  And while dermatologists counter that the scalp is already one of the most vascularized areas of the body, they're admittedly not completely sure how to account for the fact that some placebo patients _ who rub onto their scalps a preparation that doesn't contain any active ingredient _ grow hair in controlled studies of minoxidil.  As long as the only harm from a scalp massage is to the wallet, Rosenzweig _ speculating that there may be a placebo effect or perhaps an anti-stress component _ doesn't discourage patients from having them. Just from expecting miracles. MYTH NO. 4: YOU CAN SHRINK A PORE  ``You can't change the size of your pores, but you can refine them,'' Rosenzweig says. While the size of pores is genetically determined, once you hit puberty, they can look enlarged if they become impacted with keratin, sebaceous material or bacteria.  Luckily, anti-agers such as Retin-A and alpha-hydroxy acids will give pores a good cleaning, thus making them appear smaller. MYTH NO. 5: DRY SKIN CAUSES WRINKLES  Not exactly. The reality is that most of the lines and wrinkles you see in the mirror were caused by the sun. The other 20 percent are the result of facial expressions such as smiling and frowning, both of which have lines named after them.  However, according to Dr. Susan Taylor, a Philadelphia-based dermatologist, ``The skin will appear more wrinkled when it's dehydrated.'' Conversely, the more sheen the skin has, the less noticeable wrinkling will be _ a definite advantage for oilier-skinned women.  A moisturizer will help smooth away crepiness caused by dryness, but _ unless it's formulated with an alpha-hydroxy acid _ it's not likely to make much headway on any sun-induced etchings. MYTH NO. 6: ALCOHOL-FREE IS BETTER  Hardly. ``When people see `alcohol,' they usually think of isopropyl, or rubbing alcohol,'' which imparts a cooling, drying sensation to the skin, says Dr. Mary Lupo, associate clinical professor of dermatology at Tulane University.  This, however, couldn't be further from the truth. From a biochemical viewpoint, she explains, alcohol just means that there's a molecular compound with an OH at the end of it. ``What's at the other end could completely alter its behavior in products.''  For example, cetyl, behenyl or oleyl alcohol are all so-called fatty alcohols, which act as emollients _ ingredients that decrease water loss from the skin, as well as soften it. MYTH NO. 7: EVERYBODY NEEDS A MOISTURIZER  There are no hard-and-fast rules about who needs a moisturizer. But according to Matarasso, you do if you experience the following clinical signs: redness, scaliness or itchiness _ all of which occur more frequently in cold weather.  As common sense would dictate, those with drier skin will get the most relief from a heavier moisturizer, while the mildly dry may want to stick with lighter lotions.  When does it make sense to have two different moisturizers? If you're extremely dry on, say, your hand and only moderately dry on your body, Taylor advises using separate products.  The best way to apply a moisturizer? Following a bath or shower after blotting the skin dry. Says Matarasso, ``If you put moisturizer on dry skin, all it's going to do is moisten your clothes _ it doesn't really stick to you.'' MYTH NO. 8: A SPLIT END CAN BE REPAIRED  Only if you're willing to snip the hair beyond the point of the split, says Dr. Paul Lazar, professor of clinical medicine at Northwestern University School of Medicine.  While some conditioners can temporarily ``glue'' split ends back together, there is no way to permanently reattach the hair shaft when the individual layers of cells separate _ the unfortunate outcome of too-frequent or too-harsh chemical processing, styling or just plain old washing.  Indeed, getting hair squeaky clean is actually an achievement that does more damage than good _ particularly to the ends of hair, which, having been around the longest, are most vulnerable to assault.  When shampooing, concentrate on cleansing the scalp, which is mostly where skin oil accumulates. As the shampoo is rinsed out, it will clean the length of the hair. MYTH NO. 9: IT'S TOO LATE TO START USING SUNSCREEN  It's never too late to start protecting skin from the sun. ``It's the cumulative effect of the sun that's damaging, so by avoiding it, you could halt some of its progress,'' Rosenzweig says.  Furthermore, there is clinical evidence that once you start protecting the skin, it has the ability to repair itself.  That's not to say, however, that it will happen overnight. As Janice Teal, director of Avon's skin-care product development, says, it's a slow, gradual process that can take a couple of years to yield significant changes.  But still, the idea that simply by starting to use a sunscreen a 40-year-old woman whose skin looked 50 could eventually have a complexion that looked its chronological age, is impressive. MYTH NO. 10: ONCE YOU HAVE A FACE-LIFT, YOU'LL NEED ANOTHER  This sounds like a myth that a lot of celebrities have taken at face value, but it has no basis in fact.  What is true is that a face-lift doesn't reverse the aging process. ``It just makes you look better than you would have looked without it from that point on,'' says Dr. Kenneth Rothaus, assistant clinical professor of surgery at New York Hospital-Cornell University Medical College.  As for whether you'd ever choose to do it again, it's really a personal choice.  According to Dr. Daniel C. Baker, associate professor of plastic surgery at New York University School of Medicine, it's not unusual for a woman who's had a face-lift to decide she still looks pretty good _ or at least better than all her friends _ and opt out of the second surgery.

By RUSSELL ATWOOD c.1995 A&AMP;E Monthly Excerpted from A&AMP;E Monthly Distributed by New York Times Special Features  What's the one thing that terrifies you?  Is it snakes gliding across the ground? The scratching of scurrying rats? Are you afraid of the dark? Of tight, suffocating spaces? Of dizzying heights?  Whatever your fear, chances are Hollywood has filmed it because, while no one likes to be afraid, moviegoers the world over will pay to be scared.  A good horror movie (and sometimes even a bad one) can be as exhilarating as a roller-coaster ride, with sharp turns and deadly plummets taking your breath away and making your pulse race.  Horror comes in many sizes, from the giant predator T. Rex in 1993's ``Jurassic Park'' to the small ``whiteheaded fly'' trapped in a spider's web, pitifully screaming, ``Help me, help meeee!'' in ``The Fly'' (1958).  The degree of fright varies too, from the shock of a monster jumping out of the shadows to the chill that sneaks up on us late at night with the creak of a floorboard.  Whatever shape or size, whether real or imagined, all fears have one thing in common: the feeling of helplessness they provoke.  Helplessness is a sore spot for humankind.  As advanced as man has become, he is never far from those ancestors who shivered in the darkness, fearful of beasts and the elements. We've tamed the wild, obliterated superstition and built complex buildings, but one earthquake, one tornado or, in the case of ``King Kong'' (1933), one really big, ticked-off monkey can strip away that facade of superiority and leave us humbled.  ``Kong'' remains one of the greatest horror movies of all time, in large part because of the painstaking animation by special-effects pioneer Willis O'Brien.  Even armed with guns and bombs, man finds himself outmatched by Kong. That theme is still fresh today, evidenced by recent movies such as ``Jurassic Park'' and this year's ``Congo.''  Over the years man has also attempted to subdue the myths and legends that haunt his dreams, reducing creatures like vampires and werewolves to mere psychological explanations.  In ``The Wolf Man'' (1941), Lon Chaney Jr. plays a 20th-century man who arrogantly dismisses the existence of the supernatural. Chaney scoffs when he hears the legend of the werewolf: ``Even a man who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night can become a wolf when the wolfsbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright.''  Then he is bitten by one himself and the curse turns prophetic. The film's horror emanates not so much from Chaney's werewolf visage as from his inability to stop the dread transformation.  In his non-fiction book ``Danse Macabre'' (Berkeley Publishing, 1985), Stephen King asserts that the American horror movie can often serve as an ``accurate barometer of those things which trouble the night-thoughts of a whole society.''  This was never truer than in the 1950s in the aftermath of Hiroshima. Confronted with the reality of the Bomb, we started asking ourselves just what ``those scientists'' were doing and whether or not they should be doing it.  In ``Them'' (1954), ants, transformed by fallout into gigantic monsters, terrorize a small desert community, and an elderly scientist voices our collective fear that ``We have opened a door on an unimaginable power and there will be no closing it now.''  The other big fear of the '50s and '60s that found its way to the screen was the communist threat.  Much has been made of the ``red scare'' subtext of Don Siegel's ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' (1956), in which residents of a small town are being systematically replaced by soulless duplicates hatched from alien pods. But the film remains as chilling today as when it was released.  ``Body Snatchers'' is one of the first movies to demonstrate that as our society becomes more complex, so do our monsters.  The movie is set in Smalltown, U.S.A., bringing horror closer and closer to home. No longer did you have to go to a Transylvanian castle or participate in an archaeological dig in Egypt to meet up with monsters; they were there in your own backyard, maybe already in the house.  The history of horror movies can be seen as a limiting of places where we feel safe, and in 1960 Alfred Hitchcock launched an assault on what many consider the last refuge from intrusion: the bathroom.  The shower scene from ``Psycho'' (1960) reigns supreme in the annals of horror. It took Hitchcock seven days to shoot, using 70 camera setups, for 45 seconds of footage.  The scene opens with the victim (Janet Leigh) at her most vulnerable _ naked in a cascade of water _ and we watch, like bound and gagged voyeurs, as the shower curtain is yanked aside to reveal a flashing kitchen knife.  As the weapon begins its rampant descent, Leigh tries to ward off the blade with her upraised hands. But her actions are futile; she's as helpless as the viewers to stop the attack.  Over the years ``Psycho'' has served as the model for countless imitations, but none can touch the original.  The same is true of Hitchcock's next foray into horror, ``The Birds'' (1963), which established the premise that, given half a chance, nature will rise up and dispense with humankind without hesitation. The film chronicles a mass attack on a California community by our fine feathered friends.  It's a movie that inspired a slew of imitations, pitting man against everything from bloodthirsty rabbits (``Night of the Lepus,'' 1972) to killer worms (``Squirm,'' 1976).  By the late 1960s moviegoers had come face to face with all sorts of monsters, but in ``Night of the Living Dead'' (1968) the greatest monster was revealed to be ourselves.  A space probe to Venus returns to Earth bearing radiation that begins to revive the dead, not as we remember them, but as shuffling, mindless zombies intent on devouring the living.  Director George Romero's cult classic deserves its avid following; shot in black and white on a very low budget, the shoestring production values actually contribute to the authentic feel of the film.  The plot centers on seven people barricaded in a secluded farmhouse who, when they're not fighting the zombies, succumb to claustrophobia and fighting among themselves. In the end, the dead become less threatening than the living.  Two sequels (``Dawn of the Dead,'' 1978, and ``Day of the Dead,'' 1985) followed, but their visceral horror won't be to everyone's taste.  Another movie that you may want to think twice about seeing is William Friedkin's ``The Exorcist'' (1973).  While most horror movies lose their effect after the first viewing, ``The Exorcist'' is one shocker that sustains its impact no matter how many times you see it.  Much of the jolt comes from the taboo lines the film crosses regarding religion; whether you believe in God or not, by the end of the movie you have no trouble believing in the Devil.  The film also touches on society's concern about what is happening to its children. One moment 12-year-old Regan (Linda Blair) is the ideal little girl, the next she's croaking obscenities, spitting up green goop and spinning her head around.  Kids today, what're you going to do with them?  Parenting itself came under attack in the 1980s as people spoke more freely about child and spousal abuse. Horror movies reflected our collective fears about where the American family was headed.  No longer was home synonymous with safety. What use is it to lock the door when the leering maniac with the hatchet is the person closest to you?  In Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation of Stephen King's ``The Shining'' (1980), patriarch Jack Nicholson gets an extreme case of cabin fever while he and his family occupy an isolated hotel with a very nasty history.  Nicholson's descent from loving father to raving lunatic is masterful, and Shelley Duvall plays perfectly the dutiful wife making excuses for daddy's odd behavior.  A pivotal scene in the movie shows Duvall waking her husband from a nightmare and patting his back to soothe him, until he relates the dream: He killed her and his son and chopped them up into little pieces.  Duvall's hand freezes, afraid to touch him, as if he were a stranger.  Horror movies have made us question whether we're safe anywhere _ even in our dreams.  Wes Craven's ``A Nightmare on Elm Street'' (1984) set a standard which none of its imitators or numerous sequels has come close to matching.  From the very opening scene _ a pair of dirty hands forging a special glove with knives for fingers _ the viewer is sucked into a world of surreal images operating on the twisted logic of dreams. A dead girl opens her mouth to speak and a centipede slithers out; perfectly solid, carpeted steps turn to pools of goo when you try to climb them.  Like all great horror movies, ``Nightmare'' attacks our belief that everything is as it seems.  Fear, of course, has been around a lot longer than horror movies. It's something we carry with us all the time.  Watching horror movies, though, gives us the opportunity to take those fears out, examine them more closely and maybe even understand why we give them so much power. -0- SIDEBAR: CHEAP CHILLS  Sometimes not even the biggest budgets and most elaborate special effects can produce a good horror movie.  But very often the opposite proves true: Some of the best horror films have been made for next to nothing.  Here are some of my favorite creepy cheapies:  _ ``Carnival of Souls'' (1962). A low-budget, black-and-white classic, short on special effects but long on eerie atmosphere, about a woman _ the sole survivor of a car accident _ who is pursued by a ghostly figure.  The horror emanates from the woman's inability to escape the phantom and the gradual realization that maybe she didn't survive the car wreck after all.  _ ``Dementia 13'' (1963). While cheesy as a B-movie can get, this low-budget thriller about an ax murderer loose on a country estate in Ireland is still fun to watch because it marked Francis Ford Coppola's debut as a director.  _ ``The Conqueror Worm'' (1968). Vincent Price gives a chilling performance as the corrupt and sadistic witch-finder general, Matthew Hopkins (a real-life witch hunter during the 1600s), who torments two young lovers to the brink of madness.  An obscure movie that's hard to find on television or at the video store, but once you see it you won't forget its horrifying ending.  _ ``Halloween'' (1978). Notable as Jamie Lee Curtis' film debut, John Carpenter's seminal fright fest stands up well, thanks to the director's chilling music, clever camera angles and depiction of the killer as devoid of all compassion and reason.  _ ``Scanners'' (1981). An early film by director David Cronenberg (``The Fly,'' 1986 remake; ``Naked Lunch,'' 1991) about the locked-away powers of the mind and the people who hold the key. Most notable for its clever special effects and its famous scene of a man's head exploding. (Warning: Do not see this movie until one hour after eating!)

Includes a color slide of Jonathan Silverman in a scene from ``The Single Guy.'' By ANITA GATES c.1995 The New York Times Distributed by New York Times Special Features  Jonathan, the title character of NBC's new series ``The Single Guy,'' does not seem to have an enviable life.  All of his close friends got married in the past few years, and he didn't. Now they're determined to save him from bachelorhood. (``You married people have this bizarre need to turn everyone else into married people,'' he says to one woman. ``You're like vampires. Or Mormons.'')  He's a novelist, but from the looks of his East Village apartment, not a wildly successful one. When he gets pay-per-view to watch a fight, the cable installer insults his television set and raids his refrigerator. Then he misses the fight because he's forced into a blind date with a name-dropping magazine editor who oinks when she laughs.  But Jonathan (played by Jonathan Silverman) shouldn't feel alone at all. Prime time is crawling with young, urban single people. They are the central characters in at least eight new sitcoms this season, and the casts of ``Seinfeld,'' ``Ellen'' and ``Friends'' are all back for another year of dating angst and wacky but unwavering friendship in the big city in the '90s.  So what's the big deal about being unmarried? Yes, ``Friends'' was a huge hit for NBC last year, but the new shows can't all be clones. Can they?  Brad Hall, the executive producer of ``The Single Guy'' (and best known for his stint on ``Saturday Night Live''), considers the phenomenon just the latest variation on the theme of the need to belong.  He sees it this way: the '60s, ``all those rural shows, belonging in a small town'' (``The Andy Griffith Show,'' ``Petticoat Junction''); the '70s, the workplace as family (``The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' ``The Bob Newhart Show,'' ``Taxi''); the '80s, real families again (``The Cosby Show,'' ``Family Ties''); the '90s, a loving network of friends. (Hall's wife, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, appears on one of those '90s shows, as Elaine on ``Seinfeld.'')  ``People are always looking for a family unit of some kind, and TV is very cyclical,'' Hall says. ``It's just a need to be in a tribe and to look for support from your peers. And there's tons of comedy in that, because nobody is the same.''  The networks certainly hope that's true. Even the fledgling WB network has an entry, ``First Time Out,'' about young singles trying to make it in Los Angeles.  The question is: Who's watching all these shows?  When the producers of ``Friends'' were trying to sell it to NBC in the spring of 1994, the target audience was no secret.  ``It skews very young,'' said Leslie Moonves, then the president of Warner Bros. Television, which produces the series.  And Kevin Bright, an executive producer, said the show was about ``the time of everyone's life when they're at the beginning of everything.''  As ``Friends'' enters its second year, almost everybody seems to be watching.  ``It has a very broad demographic appeal,'' says Janine Jones, NBC's director of prime-time series publicity. ``The core audience is 18 to 54, but it does branch out and pull in teen viewers.''  NBC hasn't checked into how many of the show's fans are single and how many are married.  ``My feeling is that it offers something for everyone: people who are excited to get to that point in life, people who are at that point and people who can look back and reflect on it,'' Jones says. ``It's an exciting time in someone's life. It's really all about finding yourself and learning about yourself.''  Sounds great. But none of the new series seem to show the single life as particularly appealing.  On CBS's ``Can't Hurry Love,'' Nancy McKeon's character, Annie, a 28-year-old personnel placement interviewer, is described as earning ``under $20,000 a year'' (but somehow living alone in Manhattan) and not having ``slept with anyone in over seven months.''  She meets a handsome young police officer on the subway, but on their first date, the restaurant fireplace burns up her sweater and she loses interest when she learns he goes bird hunting.  Annie also has the bad luck to live across the hall from Jayne Mansfield's daughter, literally. The neighbor, Didi, who answers her apartment door with a supply of condoms in hand, is played by Mariska Hargitay, Mansfield's child by the body builder Mickey Hargitay.  Annie's best male friend, Roger (Louis Mandylor), takes his dates to the mattress department at Bloomingdale's.  There is some hope for love on the Fox series ``Too Something,'' but the characters' living conditions don't look any better.  Eric and Donny (Eric Schaeffer and Donal Lardner Ward) work in a corporate mail room while dreaming about other careers and take turns sleeping on the living room sofa because they've rented their second bedroom to a dog walker.  Eric and a very pretty M.B.A. at the office have eyes for each other. The men's friend Evelyn (Lisa Gerstein), however, is a typical lovelorn single; her boyfriend breaks up with her because he's moving to Budapest, but she soon learns that he only went as far away as Manhattan's Little Budapest (``York Avenue and 79th'').  Fox's other new series about single people, ``The Crew,'' focuses on a group of flight attendants based in Miami. Its uniqueness may lie in the fact that one of the attractive young singles is a black woman and one is a gay man.  On the first episode of ``The Drew Carey Show,'' no central characters come close to having a date. Drew (played by the show's namesake), a personnel interviewer at a Cleveland department store, is even dumped by his car pool. His neighbor Kate (Christa Miller) has just broken up with her live-in boyfriend.  At a press conference this summer, Carey, a stand-up comedian, was asked about the similarities between his show and last year's big sitcom hit.  ``Well, `Friends' is a show about young, good-looking people in their 20s,'' he said. ``And I'm in my 30s and I'm overweight and I'm not that good-looking. And I appreciate the comparison.''  Peter Noah, the creator and executive producer of ``Dweebs,'' on CBS, has a stronger reaction when his new show is compared to ``Friends.''  ``I feel as if we're being shoehorned into this year's premise,'' he says. ``Our characters are single and unattached, but this is not a show about dating or about the adventures of single people.''  The lead characters of ``Dweebs'' are brilliant nerds, partners in a high-tech firm, ``self-imposed exiles'' whose marital status, Noah adds, is ``reflective of their social isolation more than any particular trend.''  These are men with bad posture who have allergies and wear clothes ``the color of mulch.''  ``It's more of a traditional workplace show,'' Noah says, comparing ``Dweebs'' to the series ``Taxi.'' ``And there's a Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs quality to it.''  Snow White would be Carey (Farrah Forke), the small company's new computer-illiterate but socially normal office manager.  The hip, beautiful characters on ``Friends'' might not even speak to the pitiful people on some of this year's new series. But the great thing about all the television singles is their constant availability.  The gang on ``Friends'' seem never to spend an evening with anyone else, and they're always taking on projects as a group, like learning to play poker or stuffing envelopes with Rachel's (Jennifer Aniston's) resume.  And it's clear, from early episodes of several of the new shows, that today's single people stop off at one another's apartments on their way home from dates. Considering the extra subway ride or taxi fare _ and many of these shows are set in New York _ that is true friendship.  (Anita Gates in a New York Times staff writer.)

"43046"	"he"	"explains"	" Stone and Hopkins agree that Nixon was a pugnacious man, a resentful man who had to have enemies, had to have crises, struggles. And had to set up his own failure, to achieve a catharsis. In the film, Nixon's resentment of the Kennedy brothers and the Eastern establishment they represented is not underplayed. Anti-Semitism invades his manner of addressing Henry Kissinger, played by Paul Sorvino. Paradoxically, Hopkins decided that Nixon _ so reined in that he sputters and uses clenched, jerky gestures _ was best portrayed with classical gestures learned from years of playing Shakespeare. It was a way, he explains, of approaching the tragedy he saw swirling about Nixon, back when Hopkins was a young actor newly arrived to make his mark on the New York stage at the time of Nixon's troubles. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"

Philip Rutledge, director of Pennsylvania's division of corporate finance. ``They ask `Why didn't they give it to us at cheaper prices?' '' The answer, in part, is that companies turn to Reg S when they need relatively easy cash without extensive U.S. disclosure. Thus, they accept less for their shares in return. But the spread between prices in the U.S. and the discounted prices for Reg S buyers is a lure to scamsters, says Jerry Isenberg of the SEC's enforcement division. They see a ``built-in profit'' once the 40 days is up, he explains, and devise schemes to abuse Reg S to capture that profit. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"

If it were a fibroid, he explains, the border between the uterine wall and the tumor would be distinct, and the fibroid would slip out like a seed from a grape. But the border of this tumor is messy and tough, marbled with pearly structures that are evidence of glandular infiltration. The pathology department soon confirms the diagnosis. Toaff must slice away at the growth piecemeal, as though he were carving a turkey.

She is wearing white high heels, no stockings, and she tells him about how some bad guys have killed her husband back in Potshot, Ariz. Potshot, she explains, is a desert resort for wealthy Angelenos who come to synchronize themselves with the fundamental rhythms of nature.

His linguistic sleuthing led him, via the Old English verb ``to writhe,'' to a 16th-century Scots translation of Virgil's ``Aeneid'' in which ``wraith'' appears as a word derived from the Old English verb meaning a ghost or the ghostly appearance of a living person. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"

"117589"	"he"	"explains"	" In a director's press note to the restored film, Tornatore, 46, denies longstanding rumors that either its original producer, Franco Cristaldi, or the Miramax executive Harvey Weinstein demanded the cuts. When a 185-minute version of the film was shown in 1988 at a small European festival, he explains, it received a mixed response along with an ambiguous award for ``best artistic contribution to the first part of a film.'' A 150-minute version was subsequently released in Italy but fared poorly at the box office, and the consensus was that the movie needed to be cut to two hours. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"

"121519"	"he"	"explains"	" He begins this dense, often provocative book, for example, with an account of a young girl in Papua New Guinea who grew ill after consuming parts of her grandmother's brain in a funerary rite. That leads to a description of Charles Darwin, who ``hungrily devoured the ideas of a dead man'' by reading Malthus before writing ``The Origin of Species.''

"122529"	"he"	"explains"	" There's nothing seductive or inspiring about Holden, who is forever buried in a paperback copy of ``The Catcher in the Rye.'' (He's named after the book, he explains, to which she asks, ``Your name is Catcher?'') She finds herself drawn to the dark-eyed loner and his self-pitying stories, perhaps seeing her own dashed potential in his fantasies of escape and literary ambition. Or she may be so miserable that any passion beats the petrified boredom of a life unlived. The repressed, obsessive, immature Holden is hardly a fantasy lover, so Justine has to face the possibility that she will hurt her husband and lose a life she suddenly values, if only a little. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"

"124009"	"he"	"explains"	" Cutting back and forth in time to build suspense, Cal juxtaposes his own story with that of his paternal grandparents' courtship and marriage, which, he explains, contains the seeds of his own fate. Lefty and Desdemona Stephanides, we learn, are not only husband and wife, but also brother and sister, who in 1922 fled their small village, as fighting between Greek and Turkish troops reached their mountainside home. They witnessed the terrible burning of Smyrna that autumn and managed to escape on a boat to America by lying about their pasts. The trauma of witnessing so much death and destruction helped ease their guilt over their incestuous romance, and on shipboard they prepared for their new lives in America by inventing new identities for themselves. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"

The Los Angeles-based business turns ordinary snapshots into works of art.  ``When I moved out here six years ago from Florida, I had a barren white wall in my apartment that was perfect to hang art on,'' says Robert Schiff, founder of Photowow.com. But Schiff found the cost of larger, quality art to be $4,000 or more. The sticker shock led him to try using his old photographs, but imaging companies argued that the process was too intense and in the end would be too expensive. ``How can I make this a business?'' Schiff asked himself. It was from these obstacles that he began to realize the potential of Photowow.com.  The company can put your baby's face in a Warhol-style masterpiece or turn your parents' wedding photo into a painting with vintage hand-tint. Photowow.com offers 40 different designs and 15 different types of products, including paintings, pillows and T-shirts.  The process is simple. Take your photos to any of three stores -- in Encino, Los Angeles or Valencia. While there you can decide exactly what you want. In about a week, a proof e-mail will be sent to you for your approval. If you like it, your final print will be delivered in about a week. If not, then you'll discuss changes and the process will start again. You can also follow the same steps either via mail or the Internet.  Prices depend on the style and size. The most popular, the Andy Warhol one-panel pop, starts around $150 and varies depending on options. Until Nov. 3, 10 percent of the proceeds from personalized, custom-framed Warhol-style works of art will be donated to UCLA to provide scholarships for students in the Department of Design Media Arts. To find out more, call (800) 453-9333 or visit the Web site at www.photowow.com. -- Addison Pate  UPDATING AMERICA: Old houses have found a new niche. Instead of being updated and modernized, homes are being lovingly restored by their owners. In California, one of the most popular designs is the bungalow, noted for its low, sheltered porch but often having a second story and numerous additions to make room for married families and their children. To learn more about the bungalow, and how to restore yours, see ``Bungalows'' (Taunton Press; $29.95) by M. Caren Connolly and Louis Wasserman. Don't have a bungalow? Stay tuned. Future books in the new ``Updating Classic America'' series include ``Capes,'' ``Colonials'' and ``Ranches,'' which will be published in 2003. -- B.D.  COUNTRY DIGS: Southern California is known mostly for post-World War II tract houses, but the land was once ranches and orchards, so you'll still find a few farmhouses and red barns in areas such as Granada Hills and Ventura. Whether they've got Victorian or Cape Cod influences, or look more like a saltbox, farmhouses date back to America's roots, evoking warm and cozy feelings that have been captured in Leah Rosch's nostalgic coffee table book ``American Farmhouses: Country Style and Design'' (Simon &amp; Schuster; $35). The author, who is former editor of American Homestyle &amp; Gardening magazine, is a New Yorker who pays tribute to farm life with more than 200 nostalgic photos, by Keith Scott Morton, of both the houses and their barns. Rosch even tackles the question of why barns are painted red. Farmers, she explains, discovered that wood lasted longer with paint, and the only ``paint'' they had was from readily available ingredients, a mix of iron oxide and cows' milk -- which turned a brick red. -- B.D. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20021018.0112 type=story > <HEADLINE> THE REAL DIRT: GARDEN DESIGNERS OPEN UP ABOUT WHAT THEY LOVE AND </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 10-18-02 14:25:00EDT (BC-LOVE-HATE-GARDENING-L) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"

Infertility is common among women who are very thin and lack body fat, a source of estrogen.

"132196"	"he"	"explains"	" In its final hour, ``Adaptation'' pursues novelty in a way that is almost breathtaking. At one point Laroche exclaims to Susan: ``You know why I like plants? Because they're so mutable.'' Mutation, he explains, is the process that creates new orchid species. The grandly baroque climax of ``Adaptation'' takes Laroche's comment to heart. It is a narrative version of a genetic mutation, suggesting what might happen if the disparate storytelling talents of Charlie Kaufman, Donald Kaufman and Susan Orlean were somehow mixed into one peculiar hybrid _ art-house cinema spliced with Hollywood spectacle spliced with literary journalism. The result will not seem beautiful to all viewers, but it is unquestionably new. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"

It is more international, she explains, and more open. In the past, China's modern art exhibits drew the most attention if the authorities shut them down, she said. The banning of the art took precedence over anything else, sometimes even the actual art being banned.

Rice flour tends to be drier than bean flours, so it helps to add a little more fat. Tapioca flour can lessen the grittiness of rice flours.

After soaking in white wine, drying for a week, and then sitting under weights to squeeze out moisture, the pork is hung for up to nine months. His customers, he says, can taste the difference between his intense, and slightly saltier house-cured prosciutto and prime commercial products. I only use salt and pepper, Caruso says.

Of course, it is important to mention that the Greek title of the film is 'POLITIKI Kouzina,' he writes. The word POLITIKI is in capital letters, he explains, because in the Greek language the meaning changes depending on where the accent is placed.

"169507"	"she"	"explains"	" BRADY-ACTOR (Chatham, Mass.) - Since The Brady Bunch debuted on ABC in 1969 and was later reincarnated in multiple reunions, Jan, as played by Eve Plumb, has become perhaps the world's most notorious Brady. She was the troubled middle daughter who uttered those three words that she refuses to say ever again: Marcia, Marcia, Marcia! In real life, Plumb is a bit of an earth-mother type who spends her time painting, gardening, and performing in plays, indie films, and television roles. The painting, she explains, began nearly 20 years ago and has grown to become a career of its own. Her paintings are realist, with an emotional perspective. The Chatham exhibit, which runs through Aug. 24, came about after Kenny Wynne, owner of the Wynne/Falconer Gallery, spotted Plumb's paintings in a Laguna Beach show. At the opening reception last week, 11 paintings were sold. One group of Bradyholics drove from Staten Island with a stack of memorabilia for Plumb to sign. She requested a glass of wine from the gallery owner, and then autographed the entire stack. By Christopher Muther. 1230 words. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"

The painting, she explains, began nearly 20 years ago and has grown to become a career of its own. She studies light and shadow falling on inanimate objects and replicates scenes in a precise fashion. Her paintings are realist, with an emotional perspective. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"

Devanaughn, she explains, draws on the Gaelic words for river goddess and a mischievous creature that sits by the side of the road at night and will haunt you. Both of those images seem in line with our dark and mystical sensibilities. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"

So, as he waits and as he trains and practices and lifts and studies, Harrison knows he can help the team in other ways, knows he has to share his knowledge with those around him. If he can't be 100 percent of the football player he wants to be, he explains, he can still be 100 percent of the man. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"173867"	"he"	"explains"	" Customers at the African Cuisine restaurant in Hyde Park can order dishes from their West African homelands. Some come for the foods of their individual tribes, says owner Roy Ude. Certain West Africans only come here for 'draw' soup, says the Nigerian-born Ude. The word draw means the soups are made with fufu, a dumpling of pounded yams or cassava. When the dumpling is dipped into the soup, he explains, the liquid in the bowl is drawn up by the starchy dumpling, hence the draw. Fufu has to be made to order, says the restaurateur, or it won't taste right. Draw soups include euguzi, a melon seed and spinach soup, and ogbonno, made with dried shrimp and plenty of hot red pepper. They're all listed on a card over the restaurant's bar. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"

He now controls the most feared army in the land and is bent on wiping out cultural differences in the conquered regions of China.
