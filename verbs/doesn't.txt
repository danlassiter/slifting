"15691"	"it"	"doesn't"	" ``Well, it doesn't,'' she purrs as she systematically removes huge hunks of hair from her head. ``I have skimpy hair but with these miraculous hair extenders...'' pause for dramatic effect as she removes first one then another switch of hair attached to some snaggle-toothed contraption that looks like it came from a James Bond movie. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199502.gz"
"19661"	"it"	"doesn't"	" ``No, it doesn't,'' Jones said. ``People don't remember rookies of the year and all that. They remember what you did on the court. Some people win Rookie of the Year, then don't make the playoffs their whole career. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"

"54180"	"it"	"doesn't"	" We see death on television more often than we would like. But there are restrictions. A robber who bursts into a convenience store and shoots a clerk dead makes the store's video camera. Whether it makes the local news is up to a station's news director. Usually, it doesn't, because it is deemed gratuitous and serves no purpose except to appeal to a lurid fascination with death. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"
"56773"	"it"	"doesn't"	" Does its recent history matter? ``If something is great, it doesn't,'' said Robert Monk, head of Sotheby's contemporary art department in New York. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"
"71747"	"it"	"doesn't"	" Kertzman says Job 1 is convincing customers that Sybase is here to stay, no easy task with Oracle and Informix salesmen and saleswomen out banging that drum every day. He says he's looking for more ways to cut expenses, though the big job cuts are probably done. He notes he's sold his company before and would do it again if it seems the right way to go; for now, it doesn't, he says. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"
"92593"	"it"	"doesn't"	" The screen is full of flying objects. Unfortunately, these include the actors, who are lumbered with Luhrmann's frantic hope that pandemonium might somehow pass for passion, which, of course, it doesn't, a truth all too glumly apparent in the attractive but arid presence of the star around whom the spectacle is built, Nicole Kidman. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"112042"	"it"	"doesn't"	" Positioning a product is another daunting hurdle, as de Janasz found when she began to market her Twooth Timer. At first, she tried to sell it to dentists _ the original source of her inspiration, after all _ but was soon grinding her own teeth in frustration. ``They say it belongs in a drugstore, but drugstores say no, it doesn't,'' said de Janasz, a former interior designer. ``Everybody wants one, but there's nowhere it fits perfectly.'' She persevered, though, and has managed to sell 40,000 Twooth Timers in the past three years through retail stores such as the Right Start. ``I've been contacted by a number of women who've had ideas based on experiences with their children and want to know how to bring it to market,'' she said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"125671"	"he"	"doesn't"	" Joel has two pals: fair-weather rebel Pat (Josh Wise) and sweetly sensible Isabelle (Natasha Melnick of ``Freaks and Geeks''), with whom Joel would be flirting if he had any sense. But of course, he doesn't, so his object of desire is Holly Kent (Melinda Sward), paramour of the school's most popular jocks. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"131838"	"he"	"doesn't"	" ``No, he doesn't,'' his wife says, ``and some people think that's a coldness or an indifference, and it's really not. It's a patience that this is going to go the way it needs to go if we just give it the time it needs. And let people do what they can do to get to their level. I've never known him to give up on anyone.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"133488"	"he"	"doesn't"	" ``No, he doesn't,'' Spiner says. ``He's still just a stumbling, bumbling android'' (with a twin brother, if the rumors are true). </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"134799"	"he"	"doesn't"	" Elias added: ``You've got to play hard. He'll let you know that.'' Does Burns communicate this wish in a loud voice? ``Sometimes, he doesn't,'' Elias said. ``But, most of the time, he does.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"144394"	"it"	"doesn't"	" But Kennedy added that it may be wrong to assume a big turnout will naturally favor the Democrats. In our state, it doesn't, because we are so split. It's really a 50-50 state, he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"

"158378"	"he"	"doesn't"	" Brandon's talent to foresee the winners and point spreads of football games gets him moved right into the company's front office, where, as John Anthony, he makes Walter lots of money - until, of course, he doesn't, and the movie predictably charts Brandon's long fall from grace. It's nothing spectacular. The young man just loses his mojo. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
