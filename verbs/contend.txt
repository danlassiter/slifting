Times News Service  EUROPEANS DEMAND SHARE OF CREDIT FOR BOSNIA DEAL  PARIS (NYT) _ The United States may have brokered the deal that finally brought peace to Bosnia, but the European allies who spent nearly four years trying but getting nowhere all demanded a share of the credit.  So there will be a rash of Bosnia peace conferences in Europe in coming weeks: a conference in Paris in early December for a formal signature of the Dayton accords; a conference in London Dec. 8-9 to discuss their implementation, and then a conference in Bonn on possible limits on arms in all the former states of Yugoslavia.  President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, who had to cancel a summit meeting with all the Bosnian parties when he fell ill on the eve of the Dayton conference, may want one in December, some European officials believe.

BRITISH CONSERVATIVES CALL ON CHARLES, DIANA TO DIVORCE  LONDON (NYT) _ Two days after Diana, the Princess of Wales, admitted to adultery and revealed lurid details of her broken relationship with Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, in television interviews, Conservative politicians called for the couple to resolve their very public marital difficulties with a divorce.  The couple married in 1981 and have been legally separated for three years. Details of the breakdown of their marriage _ Charles's continued love for a previous girlfriend and indifference to his wife, and Diana's anguished descent into bulimia and subsequent efforts to find love with an army officer _ have been widely reported in the press and in tell-all books about the royal family for years. But in a television interview on Monday, Diana proved unequivocally that most of the rumors were true.  The spectacle of the possible future Queen of England baring her soul Oprah-style, on television outraged many Conservative politicians, who see the continued, undignified fight between Charles and Diana as a serious threat to the future of the monarchy.  U.S. LAWYERS TO DEFEND SERVICEMEN IN OKINWAWA  (NYT) _ A group of American lawyers plans to help defend three American servicemen imprisoned in Okinawa by challenging the Japanese investigative system that, they contend, may have resulted in coerced confessions from the soldiers in the abduction and rape of a 12-year-old Japanese girl.  The three lawyers, defense attorneys from New York, Tennessee and Georgia, have never met their clients, who come from small towns in Georgia and Texas and families with little money. Their only direct information from the soldiers comes from their handwritten letters and telephone calls to relatives complaining about, ``coaching,'' by Japanese investigators. But financed with potluck fund-raisers and church collections, they are preparing to fly to Japan to assist the soldiers in their defense and in the process, they hope to put the spotlight on Japanese methods of interrogation and trial.  The servicemen pleaded guilty earlier this month to conspiring to abduct and rape a 12-year-old Okinawa schoolgirl in a September incident that has prompted demonstrations and widespread criticism of the U.S. military presence in Japan. U.S. military authorities, who first arrested the three men and have repeatedly made public apologies for the crime, have acted as though they have little doubt that the men are guilty _ something that the defendant's families have said they resent. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19951122.0494 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-NEW-AMERICA-DAILY-BUDGET-NYTSF) </DATELINE> <TEXT> THE NEW AMERICA NEWS SERVICE is a wire service devoted to stories (9 to 10 per week) by and about ``minorities'' _ including ethnic communities, gays and lesbians, women, youths and the disabled.

But the future of the smallest ones is in doubt these days. Most of the business comes from the auto industry and that presents a problem. For years, the Big Three automakers have been under withering pressure from abroad. To compete, GM, Ford and Chrysler have stepped up their modernization, sent work overseas, and consolidated orders from huge parts supply giants like Delphi and Visteon. This does not make for a hospitable environment for the family run enterprise. By Danny Hakim.  With graphic.  (Story has moved.)

IRAQ-RDP (Najaf, Iraq) _ Assassins on Friday killed the most prominent S`iIpe cleric cooperating with U.S. forces in Iraq, exploding a massive car bomb outside the faith's holiest shrine that killed some 95$pumple, hospital officials said, and wounded more than 140 others. The death of Ayatollah Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim, one of the four revered clerics who hold sway over the Shiite Muslim faithful and long a key exile leader of the opposition to the government of Saddam Hussein, sent a wave of fear crashing through the country's majority community. By Neil MacFarquhar and Richard A. Oppel Jr.  An early lede has moved.  IRAQ-REACT (Baghdad, Iraq) _ The car bombing that killed one of Iraq's most important spiritual leaders seemed to cry out Friday for a vigorous response by the American and Iraqi officials charting the country's future, but instead, there was mostly silence. Ayatollah Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim, a symbol of moderation in this restive land, was dead, and a political vacuum gaped open behind him. Religious leaders called for blood and vengeance, and in some places the ayatollah's mourners were already taking to the streets. Yet here in Baghdad, the Iraqi and American officials charged with shepherding this country towards democratic rule mustered only a half-hearted response. By Dexter Filkins.  IRAQ-BRITAIN (London) _ Alastair Campbell, the influential and combative director of communications and strategy for Prime Minister Tony Blair, announced his resignation Friday as controversy raged over his role in portraying the nature of Iraq's threat to the West. By Warren Hoge.  An early lede has moved.  KOREA-TALKS (Beijing) _ The United States, North Korea and four other nations concluded three days of sometimes fiery negotiations here Friday and decided to keep talking, as Bush administration officials decided that the diplomatic track still offered the best hope of resolving the Korean nuclear crisis. Though North Korea repeatedly threatened to test and deploy nuclear weapons if its demands for a nonaggression pact are not met in full, several senior cdehnistration officials said that the six-party negotiations had in some respects ``exceeded our expectations,'' persuading them to push for a new round soon. By Joseph Kahn.  WASHINGTON  (Will move in ``w'' news file.)  DEECEE-CRIME (Washington) _ It has not been a good year for crime fighting in the nation's capital. Indeed, Washington last year reclaimed from Detroit the title of the nation's murder capital, and is on a pace to surpass 2002's homicide total. But when Police Chief Charles Ramsey declared a crime ``emergency'' a week ago, his critics snickered. It's been bad, and getting worse, for a long time, they contend, and the chief ist bm WTC-VOICES (New York) _ Listening to recollections collected and documented by the Port Authority in the days and months after the Sept. 11, 2001, World Trade Center attacks that claimed more than 2,700 lives, 84 of them Port Authority employees, 37 of those Port Authority police officers. By Jim Dwyer and Laurie J. Flynn.  SD-JANKLOW (Dateline TK) _ U.S. Rep. Bill Janklow was charged Friday with second-degree manslaughter in the death of a motorcyclist, killed when the congressman is said to have run past a stop sign at more than 70 mph. If convicted of the felony charge, Janklow could face up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. (Summary from wires) By Michael Janofsky.  FINANCIAL  (Will move in ``f'' news file.)  COMPUTER-VIRUS-ARREST (Undated) _ The FBI on Friday arrested a Minnesota teenager officials said admitted to making a copycat variant of the devastating Blaster Internet worm, even as experts combed over data to hunt down the virus' creator. Jeffrey Lee Parson, 18, of Hopkins, Minn., a middle-class suburb west of Minneapolis, was arrested on one count of intentionally cawsaog or attempting to cause damage to a computer, according to a St. Paul district court clerk. The arrest was the result of a joint investigation by the Secret Service and the FBI. (Summary from wires) By Sarah Kershaw.

TRANSMITTED Aug. 29, 2003  ALASKANS EXPLORE USES FOR SPIKY 'DEVIL'S CLUB'  NATGEO-ALASKA _ In Alaska, the locals call it devil's club _ a spiky plant mostly known for spoiling hikes and crowding out blueberry patches. Even the weed's Latin name sounds ominous: Oplopanax horridus. The plant grows 5 to 8 feet tall and is covered with thorns up to an inch long. ``Even the leaves have little-bitty thorns,'' says Peggy Hunt, an agronomist at the Native Plant Nursery in Palmer, Alaska. ``They go through your skin. You wear jeansunt helping to grow more of the stuff? She and other plant ecologists see potential among the thorns. Devil's club may find a use as a natural ``fence'' _ or as a resource for a treatment for tuberculosis adapted from Native American folk medicine. By Sonya Senkowsky.

TRANSMITTED Aug. 27, 2003  A HARVARD BRAIN BANK FACES SHORTAGE OF 'NORMAL' BRAINS  NATGEO-BRAIN-BANK _ There is a shortqg%(of ``normal'' brains at the Harvard brain bank, scientists say. The bank, officially known as the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center and located at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., is the world's largest brain repository, distributing tissue to neuroscientists in the United States and around the world for research. The federally funded brain bank keeps 3,000 brains _ most from people who suffered from neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's, Huntington's and Alzheimer's, and neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and manic depression. But the nature of research requires that scientists need ``normal'' brains, too, from healthy people of all ages. By Bijal P. Trivedi.

The cream swirls, its tendrils stretching to the rim and thinning out. Black and white meld to milky brown but black patches remain and white tendrils linger. Grab a spoon. Stir. The patches and tendrils disappear. The dynamics of interaction in a coffee cup may apply in the vast expanse of the oceans _ and affect weather around the world as well, according to oceanographer Dan Ru&amp;nick, an expert on the process. ``Even in the cup of coffee (the mixing) is extremely complex,'' says Rudnick, based at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California at San Diego. ``Now imagine it over the global oceans.''

(Harris, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.  FBC-TEXAS -- AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas Coach Mack Brown knows his team needs to face a squad not wearing orange and white after a month of workouts. (Halliburton, Austin American-Statesman)  FBC-AGGIES -- COLLEGE STATION, Texas -- Aggieland hasn't been like this since Jackie Sherrill's first year. The similarities and optimism for Texas A&amp;M coach Dennis Franchione's first year are numerous. But unlike Sherrill, Franchione is unlikely to lose his opener. After all, Arkansas State doesn't boast a future Heisman Trophy winner at quarterback. (Sherrill lost to a Doug Flutie-led Boston College). (Buchanan, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.  FBC-RIX -- TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Chris Rix says he's matured. Teammates say the Florida State quarterback is making attempts to bond with his peers. Relationships, they say, have smoothed, and Rix is ready to lead Florida State back to the top of the polls.

"142278"	"they"	"contend"	" But talk to political analysts in Utah, New York or California, and you are likely to get a very different perspective. The electoral map has slanted the debate this year, they contend, leaving issues ignored or overplayed. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"142517"	"they"	"contend"	" The information in the Harper autopsy and similar data from two other states radically change the debate over the humanity of the standard lethal injection chemicals, lawyers for the inmates here say.

"142542"	"they"	"contend"	" Paisley and his party's current leader, Peter Robinson, have shown little inclination to ease their opposition. Their greatest grievance, they contend, is that the IRA has failed to disarm or to make a permanent commitment to peace, as it pledged to do. But with the Protestant rejection, Sinn Fein says it has no partner to carry out the agreement. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"143194"	"they"	"contend"	" The possibility that the Presbyterian decisions could inspire others is among gravest threats that Jewish leaders see, coming at a time, they contend, when Israel has become more isolated internationally. When they ask me what I'm concerned about, part of it is that it will be creating a momentum that will not be good for anybody, said Rabbi Jerome Epstein, chief executive officer of United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, an association of about 800 congregations nationwide.The controversy stems from policy statements that the Presbyterian Church U.S.A.'s general assembly passed at its biennial meeting in June and July in Richmond, Va. One called for Israel to halt construction of its security barrier in the West Bank. Another authorized the church's investment committee to initiate possible divestment in companies whose business in Israel is found to be directly or indirectly causing harm or suffering to innocent people, Palestinian or Israeli, according to a statement July 20 by Clifton Kirkpatrick, stated clerk of the church's assembly. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"

"145483"	"they"	"contend"	" But in a meeting among 19 Latin American leaders last week, most expressed an interest in strengthening relations with Washington. Political analysts also have said that Bush's victory is the best hope for real progress on a range of pending negotiations, including the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas and migration reforms. A second-term president, whose party controls Congress, they contend, will be in a better position to push through reforms than John Kerry would have been. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"145719"	"they"	"contend"	" Others say they do not believe they are eligible to be returned to active duty, because, they contend, they have already finished the obligations they signed up for when they joined the military. A handful of such former soldiers, scattered across the country, have filed lawsuits making that claim in federal courts. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"148810"	"they"	"contend"	" The defense claims that what Lang did -- taking money to influence Means' college decision -- is not expressly prohibited in the rules and regulations of the Memphis public schools.

"149402"	"they"	"contend"	" But Republicans who are pushing for a tax code overhaul, including many House lawmakers and many of Bush's advisers, have argued for years that the system should tax consumption rather than income. One reason, they contend, is that the current system taxes people who save and invest their income as much as it does people who spend everything they have. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"
"149443"	"they"	"contend"	" Opponents of the changes, many of them loyal alumni, argue that this de-Confederization is erasing beloved traditions in a bid to mimic Northeastern schools. Southern colleges are destroying what made them unique, they contend, and characterizing Confederate images as racist or the South as backward is itself prejudice. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"
"150930"	"they"	"contend"	" Opponents of the proposal, though, maintain that the talk of helping the poor is a smoke screen. Much -- if not most -- of the water, they contend, will actually go to fruit growing projects deeper in the interior, for irrigation, or to shrimp farms, two of the fastest-expanding export industries in this part of the country. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"150948"	"they"	"contend"	" An investigation by the attorney general's office ended with no criminal charges against Norcross, but Rosenberg and Gural are urging the state to release the tapes because, they contend, the conversations offer the public a shocking and valuable education in the arm-twisting and greed that they say fuel New Jersey politics. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"153305"	"they"	"contend"	" Greenspan and other officials have long argued that it is not their job to influence the price of assets, whether stock prices or real estate. Rather, they contend, the central bank's job is to keep inflation low and to promote the maximum sustainable growth without fueling inflation. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"153837"	"they"	"contend"	" Knox and her fellow travelers seek to institute more thorough sex education in the town's public schools. Without it, they contend, the students' sole source of information is Sex Ed, a fact-challenged, hail-fellow pastor named Ed Ainsworth who brings to mind Joe Simpson, the minister father of the pop stars Jessica and Ashlee. He happens to be the most compelling figure in the film. He's the one who oversaw Knox's sexual-purity pledge to her parents (On my wedding night, that night will be my first time), as well as those of other young people in Lubbock, and he has a slightly leering, unctuous, overfamiliar manner with the local teens. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"154454"	"they"	"contend"	" Those involved in the new research say they have found at least a partial answer to the puzzle in something so basic that past studies all but overlooked it. All that is needed for the size and value advantages to exist, they contend, is for some stocks to be overpriced and others to be priced too cheaply. Several researchers have been involved in this line of study. One is Robert D. Arnott, editor of the Financial Analysts Journal and chairman of Research Affiliates, a research and asset management firm based in Pasadena, Calif. An article by Arnott outlining this research appeared in the March-April issue of that journal. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"155830"	"they"	"contend"	" The more the inner workings of the cell are understood, according to Gilder, the more Shannon's theory is useful in deconstructing life itself. Given the cell's complexity and capacity for information exchange, Gilder and other ID proponents maintain, it seems improbable that life could have evolved haphazardly. It's not that Darwin is wrong or irrelevant, they contend, or that processes like genetic mutation and natural selection play no role in how species evolve. But these processes cannot explain everything that biologists ascribe to them. Ergo, some form of higher intelligence - call it God, a Supreme Programmer, or whatever - must have played a role, they say. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"156393"	"they"	"contend"	" The reason, they contend, is that they can offer you T-shirts with the design you want -- your face on the back, say, paired with a cartoon on the front -- that the giant retailer, for all of its $285.22 billion in revenue last year, simply can't match. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"156402"	"they"	"contend"	" They are Internet upstarts, but they say they can take on Wal-Mart. The reason, they contend, is that they can offer you T-shirts with the design you want -- your face on the back, say, paired with a Scott Adams cartoon on the front -- that the giant retailer simply cannot match. In other words, it's all about customization. Robert Beaver, the chief executive of Zazzle.com, said that contrary to rhetoric about how customization can kill profit margins, margins at Zazzle are very good. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"156430"	"they"	"contend"	" The reason, they contend, is that they can offer you T-shirts with the design you want -- your face on the back, say, paired with a cartoon on the front -- that the giant retailer, for all of its $285.22 billion in revenue last year, simply can't match. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"156750"	"they"	"contend"	" That would explain, they contend, why two prehistoric tribes each have a word for a wooden-plank boat very similar to the Polynesian word of that day for the same type of boat. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"157717"	"they"	"contend"	" Gay rights activists say Proposition 22 didn't really ban gay marriage in California, because an earlier law, passed in 1977, had already done that. All the new measure did, they contend, was stop California from recognizing gay unions performed in other states, and their proposal would not undo that restriction. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"

Several other works that have resided in the couple's collection have been claimed by foreign governments, and some of those objects have been the subject of legal action. For much of the last 15 years, the collection has also been dogged by criticism from archaeologists who say that many works were unknown before surfacing in the collection -- a strong indication, they contend, that the objects were unearthed recently and passed through the art market in violation of cultural-property laws. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"

INTERNATIONAL (i code)  MIDEAST (Jerusalem) -- The man many expect to become the new Palestinian prime minister, Ismail Haniya of the radical Islamic group Hamas, today criticized Israeli proposals to restrict the movement of money, people and goods into and out of Palestinian territories under a Hamas government. These Israeli decisions are part of the policy of repression, terrorism and collective punishment against our people, Haniya said. Hamas reflects the choice of our people, who will not be broken by a few measures taken by the Israeli occupiers. By Steven Erlanger.  An early lede has moved.  MIDEAST-BRITAIN (London) -- At a time of heightened religious tensions across Europe, Britain's chief rabbi, Sir Jonathan Sacks, assailed the Church of England on Friday for supporting divestiture from companies whose products support Israeli policies in Gaza and the West Bank. He said the church's move will have the most adverse repercussions on a situation over which it has enormous influence, namely Jewish-Christian relations in Britain. By Alan Cowell.  CARTOONS-RUSSIA (Moscow) -- The central Russian city of Volgograd on Friday shut down a newspaper that published a cartoon seeking tolerance that featured Muhammad, Moses, Jesus and Buddha. By Steven Lee Myers.  HAITI-ELECT (Port-au-Prince, Haiti) -- Developments following an agreement to accept the presidential election victory of Rene Preval. By Ginger Thompson.  PHILIPPINES-MUDSLIDE (Undated) -- A landslide wiped out a village on the Philippines island of Leyte on Friday, burying hundreds of homes and an elementary school in up to 30 feet of mud, according to local officials. As the rescue effort ended for the night, 53 survivors had been pulled from the wreckage and 19 bodies had been recovered, the governor of the region said. About 1,400 people were missing. By John O'Neil and Carlos Conde.  BRITAIN-BROWN (London) -- As finance minister, Gordon Brown would not normally expound on terrorism, British-ism, and the environment. But he is preparing for greater things. People are beginning to ask what he would actually do in office. A news analysis by Alan Cowell.  NATIONAL GENERAL (a code)  NASCAR-HALL-OF-FAME (Daytona Beach, Fla.) -- It doesn't get much better here than Speedweek, when some 300,000 race fans pour into town for the legendary Daytona 500, adrenaline rules and the soundtrack goes something like zoom, roar, ka-ching, ka-ching. Yet something big is missing this year: an assurance or even a hint that Daytona Beach, birthplace of Nascar, home of its founding family and its most cherished annual event, will land the fiercely coveted Nascar Hall of Fame. In a heated Southern rivalry that has cost the contenders millions, Daytona is vying with Atlanta and Charlotte, N.C., for what all three promise will be a far glitzier version of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. By Laura Goodnough.  Editors, this story will also be listed on the Sports Budget.  LOUISIANA-LEVEES (Baton Rouge, La.) -- After weeks of political wrangling and pressure from Washington, the Louisiana legislature has passed what amounts to landmark reform of the levee system in the state, creating a new regional levee authority for all of southeast Louisiana. The measure is intended to substantially reduce the patronage and waste of the current system. By Adam Nossiter.  CHENEY (Undated) -- Harry M. Whittington, who was shot last weekend by Vice President Dick Cheney, emerged from the hospital on Friday to say that he is deeply sorry for all that the vice president has gone through this week. Whittington is being released from the hospital, six days after he was shot by the vice president as the two were quail hunting in Texas, and three days after he suffered a minor heart attack when one of the pellets from Cheney's gun reached his heart. Accidents do and will happen and that's what happened, he said. By Ralph Blumenthal.  WASHINGTON (w code)  CIA-LEAK (Washington) -- Lawyers for I. Lewis Libby, former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, are asking a federal judge to force the special counsel, Patrick Fitzgerald, to turn over evidence ranging from communications between reporters and their sources to highly sensitive intelligence briefings provided to President Bush. In a 32-page response to Libby's requests filed with the court, Fitzgerald said he has turned over more than 11,000 pages of classified and unclassified evidence to the defense. Libby has been indicted in the leaking of a CIA operative's identity. (Summary from wires) By Neil A. Lewis.  FINANCIAL (f code)  HEALTH-INSURE-ONLINE (Undated) -- The weekly money feature: Insurers like Aetna are providing detailed information online to consumers manage medical expenses. By Damon Darlin.  NOCERA-COLUMN (Undated) -- The column: Technology companies at hearings in Washington. By Joe Norcera.  WALMART-JAPAN (Tokyo) -- Wal-Mart's struggling Japanese subsidiary, Seiyu, said it expected to post its fifth consecutive annual loss this year, but said it was pressing forward with plans to revamp its aging stores. By Martin Fackler.  LONMIN-PLATINUM (London) -- Lonmin, the big platinum producer, said Friday that it has had talks that may lead to a bid for the company. Its shares rose as much as 34 percent, valuing the company at $6.87 billion. By Heather Timmons.  RADIOSHACK (Undated) -- RadioShack's chief executive issued an apology to investors and employees in response to scandal surrounding an apparent misrepresentation of his academic credentials. The company also said fourth-quarter profit plunged 62 percent after a disappointing holiday season. It may close up to 700 stores as part of a turnaround plan. By Floyd Norris.  DELPHI-LABOR (Detroit) -- Delphi said it was looking to wrap up labor discussions with its major unions and top customer General Motors by March 30. The auto supplier, which filed for bankruptcy protection in October, said if an agreement was not met by the deadline, it would file a motion in bankruptcy court on March 31 seeking to have its labor contracts thrown out. Delphi had earlier set a Friday deadline on filing the motion after two previous delays. By Micheline Maynard.  DRESDNER-BANK (Frankfurt, Germany) -- A report on the wartime history of Dresdner Bank showed that it controlled a company that helped build Auschwitz and also bankrolled Hitler's SS. By Mark Landler.  BROWNE-LATINOS-TV (Undated) -- The weekly Q&amp;A interview with Don Browne of Telemundo. By Laura Rich.  FOREIGN-DEBT (Undated) -- Guess who's financing the budget deficit of the United States. The government released its calculations this week on net investments in U.S. long-term securities, and found that foreigners had invested $350.8 billion in Treasury bonds and notes in 2005. They were net sellers of short-term Treasury bills, so their total Treasury holdings grew by just $290.9 billion. Even so, the Treasury says that its securities held by the public -- that is, by everyone except the Federal Reserve System and other arms of the government -- rose by $306.4 billion. That means that 95 percent of the deficit was financed overseas. A short Off the Charts feature by Floyd Norris.  RUSSIA-TYCOON (Moscow) -- Boris Berezovsky, the self-exiled Russian tycoon and onetime Kremlin insider, is selling out of businesses he co-owned with a longstanding Georgian partner after unnerving him with calls for an armed coup in Russia. He will sell his share in the Kommersant business newspaper, which is often critical of President Vladimir V. Putin's Kremlin, to his former partner, Badri Patarkatsishvili. By Andrew Kramer.  BIZ-ONLINE (Undated) -- What's Online, a weekly feature.  With  BIZ-OFFLINE (Undated) -- Online's sibling feature, What's Offline.  GM-INVEST (Undated) -- The decision by General Motors to halve its dividend has left many investors unconvinced of the company's ability to solve the chronic problems that threaten its position as the world's largest carmaker. The rush by analysts to renew sell recommendations show how poorly the company is regarded. Yet a brave few dissenters see a glimmer of hope in its recovery efforts. And with the stock clinging to the low $20s after trading above $50 two years ago, they contend, that hope comes cheaply enough to warrant buying the shares. An investing column by Conrad de Aenlle.

"163107"	"they"	"contend"	" The rush by analysts to renew sell recommendations show how poorly the company is regarded. Yet a brave few dissenters see a glimmer of hope in its recovery efforts.

"164413"	"they"	"contend"	" Richards, who is 74, produced the musical Chicago on Broadway in 1975, and then began a 27-year quest to make a movie out of it, he said in the suit. The film, which opened in December 2002, starred Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta Jones and Renee Zellweger, and won six Academy Awards, including best picture. The court papers said that the film was budgeted at $47 million and went over budget by about $10 million, though, they contend, Miramax never consulted the producer to approve cost overruns. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164887"	"they"	"contend"	" The doctor's family says he is. They're suing Burroughs for defamation, saying Running With Scissors is largely fictional. The author, they contend, sensationalized his life to make his story more compelling and, for the pain and suffering of being portrayed as more than a little peculiar, the family wants a retraction and$2 million. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"166205"	"they"	"contend"	" And the need for the new dump will only increase, they contend, as the cleanup progresses. Maurice Falk, the corps official in charge of the cleanup, said at a federal court hearing last week that only 115 houses have been demolished so far. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"169130"	"they"	"contend"	" Independent analysts contend that such a laissez-faire policy, characteristic of Chile's embrace of free-market economics, has contributed to the deepening energy problem. If there were a national strategy, they contend, there would be a greater effort to conserve energy and invest in alternative sources, practices that would probably end soaring corporate profits. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169355"	"they"	"contend"	" The federal government pays at least 50 percent of Medicaid costs in each state and more than 70 percent in the poorest states. Bush administration officials say states have used creative bookkeeping and accounting gimmicks to obtain large amounts of federal Medicaid money without paying their share. Moreover, they contend, some states have improperly recycled federal money to claim additional federal Medicaid money. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169360"	"they"	"contend"	" The federal government pays at least 50 percent of Medicaid costs in each state and more than 70 percent in the poorest states.

"171527"	"they"	"contend"	" American officials discount such dire scenarios. They say the American effort in Afghanistan has been and continues to be a success. The current violence, they contend, is the result of a move by NATO troops and an increasingly strong Afghan central government to extend their authority into remote areas that Taliban fighters and drug traffickers have used as havens. Taliban attacks are largely centered in the country's south, they say, and will be defeated. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"172309"	"they"	"contend"	" The Way to Win, a new book by Mark Halperin of ABC News and John Harris of the Washington Post focuses on the sudden popularity of the centrist approach. Noting that Clinton's style is the politics of the center, they emphasize that Bush's is the opposite -- the politics of the base. Bush, they contend, wins arguments by sharpening the differences and rallying his most intense supporters to his side. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"173275"	"they"	"contend"	" Court officials said they also do not anticipate opposition from Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi, a Sunni Arab. Al-Hashemi, they contend, accepted his post on the assurance that he would not oppose the court's findings. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173353"	"they"	"contend"	" Several political analysts and experts on Hamas said they did not expect the group to resume a large-scale campaign of suicide attacks. Hamas, they contend, undertook a major shift in direction from militant group to political leadership when it won the Palestinian elections in January, and it stands to risk that by resuming a suicide campaign. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"174471"	"they"	"contend"	" In the murky world of western Afghanistan, centuries of Iranian influence have left many local people with a perception of Iran as all-powerful nemesis. Many said their lives would be in danger if they publicly criticized Iran or its Afghan proxies. Behind every suspicious event in the Afghan west, they contend, lies an Iranian hand. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
