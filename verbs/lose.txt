"75793"	"you"	"lose"	" ESPN touts its coverage of the men's and women's Bowling Proprietors' Association of America U.S. Open (Sunday, 1 p.m.) as the most innovative, high-tech show ever done for television. ``We want to get away from the old look,'' said executive producer Terry Lingner. (Warning to Nelson Burton Jr.: don't read any further... this isn't you or your father's game any more). Sensors will be installed in the lanes to detect different angles and ball velocity. Instead of announcers, Marshall Holman and Leila Wagner are roving reporters. And there's the secret weapon: a remote-control gutter-cam that allows it to move behind the ball on a slot-car track to capture every Brunswick roll. If ABC invented Schenkel-ized bowling, ESPN has taken it to the next level, on the cusp of Rollerball. Next, it'll be an event for the X-Games. (And in bowling, X is good.) ``Mad As Hell: How Sports Got Away from the Fans And How We Get it Back,'' by Mike Lupica (G.P.Putnam's Sons, 236 pages, $22.95). A perfect title for a book from the arm-waving hysteric from ESPN's Sunday-morning sitcom ``The Sports Reporters.'' As a sports essayist for the New York Daily News and Esquire magazine, he's a little easier to digest. As an author, he'll ramble with the best of 'em. But since this subject matter is so hot _ how does a fan have so much access to sports yet feel so powerless at the same time? _ even Lupica's pubescent rants are worth considering in hopes of finding a shred of solution. His manifesto to cure sports' various ailments may seem too simplistic, even unrealistic. ``Make the owners sign a prenup _ try to move, you lose,'' he spouts off about how to end franchise shifts that started with Walter O'Malley's moving the Dodgers from Brooklyn to L.A. almost 40 years ago. OK, but... wouldn't the owners tie all that up in the courts? At least Lupica has a soap box. And he can use it for more than just getting up to the sink to floss his teeth. The bathroom reading-room scale: Plenty of grunts and groans, but you feel much better afterward. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"

The U.S. launched airstrikes Monday in a town on the Euphrates River in western Iraq, part of a three-day offensive against insurgents that has killed at least 36 militants since the fighting began, officials said. In Baghdad, Iraq's oil minister narrowly survived an assassination attempt Monday when a roadside bomb blasted his seven-car convoy, killing three of his escorts, officials said. Story will include reaction to counting votes in the Oct. 15 constitutional referendum, making it more difficult for the constitution to fail. (Summary from wires) By Robert F. Worth.  AFGHAN (Kabul, Afghanistan) -- Afghan government troops killed 28 militants in hours of fierce fighting on the border with Pakistan in the first serious attack by insurgents since the Sept. 18 elections, a spokesman for the defense ministry said Monday. Four soldiers were wounded in the battle when the insurgents attacked their base at Shkin, in southeastern Afghanistan, on Sunday night, said a spokesman, Gen. Zaher Azimi. By Carlotta Gall.  EU-TURKEY (Luxembourg) -- Turkey and the European Union formally begin talks on Turkey's historic bid to join the union, setting into motion a process that will likely take a decade or more but could end with the EU extending its borders eastward into Asia to embrace the predominantly Muslim country. By Craig S. Smith.  with:  EU-UZBEK (Moscow) -- European Union nations on Monday imposed sanctions on Uzbekistan, seeking to punish the Central Asian nation for its refusal to allow an international investigation into the bloody crackdown of an uprising in May in the northeastern city of Andijon. By C.J. Chivers.  MIDEAST (Jerusalem) -- More than 30 Palestinian policemen charged onto the grounds of the Palestinian parliament in Gaza City on Monday and fired weapons into the air, demanding more government support in a growing confrontation with the militant Islamic faction Hamas. Less than an hour later, lawmakers endorsed a plan calling on Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, to form a new Cabinet within two weeks. If he fails to do so, the government of the prime minister, Ahmed Qurei, could face a no-confidence vote. By Greg Myre.  INDONESIA-TERROR (Jimbaran, Indonesia) -- Forensic police continued the painstaking search for clues on Monday, sifting through the sand under the tables on the beach here where two suicide bombers killed more than a dozen diners Saturday evening, while on the larger canvas of the vast archipelago, police and counter terrorism units were searching for two highly-educated Malaysians, who have become the must hunted men in Southeast Asia.

Miers, the White House counsel, as his choice to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, his second nominee for the Supreme Court in the past two and half months. Miers, 60, a longtime confidante of the president's, has never been a judge, and therefore lacks a long history of judicial rulings that could reveal ideological tendencies. Her positions on such ideologically charged issues as abortion and affirmative action are unclear. Many of Bush's allies had lobbied the president to choose a conservative justice to replace O'Connor, a key swing vote on the court, in order to place a conservative stamp on the court for years to come. Democrats in the Senate however, have warned that a conservative pick to replace a moderate justice would lead to a drawn-out partisan battle. By Elisabeth Bumiller.  With photos, NYT1,5,8.

The request is the first public confirmation by U.S. prosecutors that DeLay, indicted last week in an unrelated investigation in Texas, is under close scrutiny in the Justice Department's corruption investigation that centers on Abramoff.

NATIONAL GENERAL (a code)  NY-BOAT-CAPSIZE (Lake George, N.Y.) -- Divers from a federal agency were poised to try to raise a tour boat Monday afternoon that capsized and sank in Lake George on Sunday, killing 20 elderly sightseers and injuring several more. At a news conference, an official of the federal agency, the National Transportation Safety Board, said it was too soon to know why the 40-foot, glass-enclosed tour boat, the Ethan Allen, had tipped over on a beautiful, calm day and went down a few hundred feet from the lake's western shore.

And two European carriers -- TAP Air Portugal and BMI, a British company -- said this week that they would become the first to proceed with cellphone service, in three-month trials on flights within Europe next year. By Matt Richtel.  With  PLANES-INTERNET (Undated) -- On nonstop flights from Copenhagen to Seattle, as many as 50 of 275 passengers are using their laptops to check e-mail, surf the Internet, even send pictures to blogs, all at 35,000 feet. The planes they are on belong to Scandinavian Airlines System, one of several non-American carriers that are using Boeing's in-flight, high-speed internet service, called Connexion. Scandinavian's experience highlights a stark reality for American business travelers: to make an office in the sky these days you have to fly a foreign airline. U.S. airlines' financial woes are preventing domestic American travelers from finding hotspots in the clouds, limiting productivity in a society that has become so reliant on Internet access. By Alexei Barrionuevo.  BIZ-TRAVEL-INTERNET (Undated) -- Airlines love Boeing's new wireless Internet system, but not because they can't wait to offer it to passengers. Rather, the technology will help them streamline operations and save money. By Christopher Elliott.  KATRINA-BANK (Baton Rouge, La.) -- Those first few weeks after the storm proved to be exhausting but heady times for Alden J. McDonald, Jr., the chief executive of Liberty Bank and Trust, the largest black-owned bank in New Orleans. But McDonald's early optimism has given way to frustration. Five weeks after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, McDonald and his staff remain stuffed into a makeshift warren of offices here, struggling with the new reality of running a bank whose customer base has scattered and money seems only to flow out. McDonald has agreed to allow a reporter to chronicle his efforts over the coming months to rebuild in New Orleans. He sat behind a large wooden desk and for much of that time he used his fists and elbows to prop up his head. Maybe it only seemed as if his head would hit the desk with a thump if he removed his arms. When told he looked exhausted, he said, distractedly, I'm supposed to get a haircut at some time today. By Gary Rivlin.  The second in a series on Liberty Bank's fight for survival in New Orleans.  AUTO-SALES (Detroit) -- Auto makes report sales for September. By Danny Hakim.  XBOX-GAMES (Amsterdam) -- In the five months since Microsoft unveiled a prototype of its new video game machine, the Xbox 360, the company has staged innumerable demonstrations of the console's ability to play music and display digital photographs. The company has exhaustively cataloged the new machine's online community features. Yet as Microsoft has tried to build the 360 buzz, the most important ingredient has largely been missing: games. Microsoft means to change that in a big way, starting now. On Tuesday and Wednesday the company hopes to dazzle the more than 1,000 journalists, analysts and game executives who are converging here from around the world to see and, much more important, play the games that Microsoft hopes will propel the 360 into millions of homes in its first few months. By Seth Schiesel.  REAL-ESTATE-MERGER (Undated) -- Brandywine Realty Trust said it would buy Prentiss Properties Trust for $3.3 billion in cash and stock, making it one of the largest office real estate investment trusts in the country. By John Holusha.  EUROPE-PHONES (London) -- The talks between Telefonica and KPN on a $24 billion merger underscore a debate in the European telecommunications industry over whether cross-border deals are a wise strategy. By Heather Timmons.  INDONESIA-TOURISM (Singapore) -- Experts say that the good news from Saturday's bombings in Bali is that it is not as easy as it used to be to terrorize Southeast Asia and the tourists who visit the region. The attacks will undoubtedly have an immediate and pronounced impact on Bali's tourism, analysts predicted, but both the island and Indonesia are more likely to bounce back sooner than they did after the much more deadly attacks there in 2002. The latest attacks are also unlikely to have the same kind of ripple effect that that bombing, which killed 202 people, had across the region's tourism industry and economies, they said. By Wayne Arnold.  Editors, the News Service will file these briefs, except when all items are from other news agencies:  In addition, many clients receive condensed versions of 15-20 major news stories, summarized in the TIMES-EXPRESS-BUDGET.  ENTERTAINMENT/ARTS (e unless otherwise indicated)  GETTY-RESIGN (Undated) -- The antiquities curator of the J. Paul Getty Museum has resigned after museum officials confronted her about a $400,000 personal loan she secured with help from one of the institution's main suppliers.

For the latest photos and graphics from The New York Times, go to www.nytimages.com.  INTERNATIONAL (i code)  IRAQ (Baghdad, Iraq) -- Developments. The U.S. launched airstrikes Monday in a town on the Euphrates River in western Iraq, part of a three-day offensive against insurgents that has killed at least 36 militants since the fighting began, officials said. In Baghdad, Iraq's oil minister narrowly survived an assassination attempt Monday when a roadside bomb blasted his seven-car convoy, killing three of his escorts, officials said. Story will include reaction to counting votes in the Oct. 15 constitutional referendum, making it more difficult for the constitution to fail. (Summary from wires) By Robert F. Worth.  AFGHAN (Kabul, Afghanistan) -- Afghan government troops killed 28 militants in hours of fierce fighting on the border with Pakistan in the first serious attack by insurgents since the Sept. 18 elections, a spokesman for the defense ministry said Monday. Four soldiers were wounded in the battle when the insurgents attacked their base at Shkin, in southeastern Afghanistan, on Sunday night, said a spokesman, Gen. Zaher Azimi. By Carlotta Gall.  EU-TURKEY (Luxembourg) -- Turkey and the European Union formally begin talks on Turkey's historic bid to join the union, setting into motion a process that will likely take a decade or more but could end with the EU extending its borders eastward into Asia to embrace the predominantly Muslim country. By Craig S. Smith.  with:  EU-UZBEK (Moscow) -- European Union nations on Monday imposed sanctions on Uzbekistan, seeking to punish the Central Asian nation for its refusal to allow an international investigation into the bloody crackdown of an uprising in May in the northeastern city of Andijon. By C.J. Chivers.  MIDEAST (Jerusalem) -- More than 30 Palestinian policemen charged onto the grounds of the Palestinian parliament in Gaza City on Monday and fired weapons into the air, demanding more government support in a growing confrontation with the militant Islamic faction Hamas. Less than an hour later, lawmakers endorsed a plan calling on Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, to form a new Cabinet within two weeks. If he fails to do so, the government of the prime minister, Ahmed Qurei, could face a no-confidence vote. By Greg Myre.  INDONESIA-TERROR (Jimbaran, Indonesia) -- Forensic police continued the painstaking search for clues on Monday, sifting through the sand under the tables on the beach here where two suicide bombers killed more than a dozen diners Saturday evening, while on the larger canvas of the vast archipelago, police and counter terrorism units were searching for two highly-educated Malaysians, who have become the must hunted men in Southeast Asia. By Raymond Bonner.  SCIENCE (a code)  NOBEL-MEDICINE (Undated) -- Two Australians have won the Nobel prize for medicine for showing that a bacterium rather than stress causes stomach inflammation and ulcers, after one of them drank a potion of bacteria to prove the point. By Lawrence K. Altman.  WASHINGTON (w code)  SCOTUS-APPOINT (Washington) -- President Bush on Monday nominated Harriet E. Miers, the White House counsel, as his choice to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, his second nominee for the Supreme Court in the past two and half months. Miers, 60, a longtime confidante of the president's, has never been a judge, and therefore lacks a long history of judicial rulings that could reveal ideological tendencies. Her positions on such ideologically charged issues as abortion and affirmative action are unclear. Many of Bush's allies had lobbied the president to choose a conservative justice to replace O'Connor, a key swing vote on the court, in order to place a conservative stamp on the court for years to come. Democrats in the Senate however, have warned that a conservative pick to replace a moderate justice would lead to a drawn-out partisan battle. By Elisabeth Bumiller.  With photos, NYT1,5,8.  An early lede has moved.  With  SOCTUS-MIERS (Washington) -- A Woman in the News profile of Harriet Ellen Miers. By Neil A. Lewis.  With a photo, NYT5.  And  SCOTUS-APPOINT-ASSESS (Washington) -- President Bush ended up choosing a loyal member of his inner circle and someone who has no judicial paper record. We look at what the selection says about the president's political thinking, the direction of his presidency, as well the stamp he intends to put on the court with this choice. A news analysis by Richard W. Stevenson.  And  SCOTUS-REACT (Washington) -- Reaction to the nomination from The Hill, with a particular focus on the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Gang of 14. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg and David D. Kirkpatrick.  And  SCOTUS-CONSERVATIVES (Washington) -- The conservative groups representing President Bush's base had been demanding a justice akin to Justice Antonin Scalia or Justice Clarence Thomas. Did they get one? By David D. Kirkpatrick.  SCOTUS (Washington) -- A Supreme Court roundup: Going against the growing assumption that it was becoming more receptive to hearing death penalty cases, the Supreme Court on Monday turned down an appeal from a Virginia inmate for whom they had granted a last-minute stay over the summer. His appeal centered around the fact that the Virginia authorities had lost physical evidence that contained DNA, denying him a chance to try to prove his innocence. By Linda Greenhouse.  And  SCOTUS-ROBERTS (Washington) -- President Bush and the Supreme Court justices and others attended on Monday the investiture of John G. Roberts Jr. as the 17th chief justice of the United States. Shortly afterward, Roberts opened the first day of the court's term -- and by extension, the beginning of what is certain to be the Roberts Court. By Linda Greenhouse.  With photos, NYT9-10  DELAY-LOBBY (Washington) -- The Justice Department has asked that London police question Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, about the circumstances of a 2000 meeting with Tom DeLay during one of DeLay's overseas trips with Jack Abramoff. The request is the first public confirmation by U.S. prosecutors that DeLay, indicted last week in an unrelated investigation in Texas, is under close scrutiny in the Justice Department's corruption investigation that centers on Abramoff. Other developments. By Philip Shenon.  NATIONAL GENERAL (a code)  NY-BOAT-CAPSIZE (Lake George, N.Y.) -- Divers from a federal agency were poised to try to raise a tour boat Monday afternoon that capsized and sank in Lake George on Sunday, killing 20 elderly sightseers and injuring several more. At a news conference, an official of the federal agency, the National Transportation Safety Board, said it was too soon to know why the 40-foot, glass-enclosed tour boat, the Ethan Allen, had tipped over on a beautiful, calm day and went down a few hundred feet from the lake's western shore. The boat, which carried 47 elderly passengers and one crewman, was about two miles north of the village of Lake George, in the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York. By Michael Cooper.  PLANES-CELLPHONES (Undated) -- Security lines, weather delays and equipment failures make flying a burden for many. For Jason Green, it is a slice of heaven -- virtually the only place he is not bombarded by phone calls and e-mail. Being on a plane has become a mini-retreat for me, said Green, 32, executive vice president of Touchstone Pictures. Long international flights are like vacation. No phone, no e-mail and no guilt for being unreachable. But Green's no-obligation oasis may soon disappear. Federal regulators are reassessing the rules barring phones in the air.

BBA-YANKS (Anaheim, Calif.) -- The Yankees arrive in California to begin their five-game playoff series with the Los Angeles Angels, a team that has caused more trouble for Joe Torre in his 10 years as Yankee manager than any other American League club. By Tyler Kepner.  BBA-WHITESOX-REDSOX (Chicago) -- They are baseball's best-known pair of sox -- White and Red -- each with a long history of frustration, but with Boston now beginning the postseason in the unaccustomed position of being the defending world champion. The White Sox and Red Sox have never met before in the postseason, and in the middle of the series that begins Tuesday is Jose Contreras, the Cuban defector whom the Yankees originally acquired by outbidding the Red Sox before exiling him from the Bronx because he was incapable of pitching well in Fenway Park. Now, a year later, Contreras is the best pitcher on the White Sox and the man who will go up against Boston in Game 1. By Lee Jenkins.  BBN-CARDS (St. Louis) -- The Cardinals ran away with the NL Central this season, just as they did a year ago. But this year, they felt they had something they lacked in 2004 -- a bona fide ace on the starting staff. Indeed, Chris Carpenter was a 20-game winner for the Cards, but in recent weeks he has struggled, creating some doubts for the team as they begin a first-round series against a seemingly overmatched San Diego team.

Baseball was the sport in America then. Pro football had not yet caught on. Pro basketball was in its infancy. Hockey wasn't much. Golf and tennis were for country-clubbers. Auto racing was a one-day wonder. The Olympics were not on television. Boxing and college football were important, but nowhere near as important as baseball. Baseball was the sport, the World Series was its stage, and in Brooklyn the Dodgers were the team. By Dave Anderson.

, I think,	 We have more choices, and then more pressure. I think of the way my mom parented. It was very relaxed, the kids were playing by themselves, while the mothers could talk and have coffee. Mothers now, I think, don't give themselves that break. There is a pressure to be present for that child, every minute of the day. They had an education, in some cases, and left that career behind. So now they're home with the kids, and they don't just sit on their butts and watch Oprah. It's parenting with a capital P. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz

, he said,	 In 1999, Hill's stepdaughter, Erin, who was then 11, dissected a frog in school. About a week later, when I asked her questions, she had a hard time describing the organs in detail, said Hill, then a high school science teacher. That got him thinking about how he might simulate the dissection experience, in a format that allows users to repeat procedures and then review what they have done -- and, he said, without wasting another batch of frogs. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz

, he said,	 Hoggard of the Park Service said he would not consign even Fort Pickens to that fate. But, he said, it is time to consider replacing the road, possibly with a ferry service from the mainland. But, as is the case on all the developed shoreline, abandoning infrastructure means lost revenue, in this case fees from a year-round campground. So Hoggard said there would be pressure to maintain the road, flooded yet again by pounding surf churned up by Hurricane Rita. We can do that with our technology, he said. But only for so long, and at a great price. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20051003.0204 type=story > <HEADLINE> (FOR USE </HEADLINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz

, he argues,	 The controversy became more desperate this summer when astronomers discovered a new object larger than Pluto orbiting in the Kuiper Belt at a distance of 9 billion miles from the sun. Michael E. Brown of the California Institute of Technology, its discoverer, has said it will be fine with him if Pluto is demoted to a minor planet, but, he argues, if Pluto is a planet, so is the new object, which he nicknamed Xena, making it the 10th planet. Last Friday Brown announced that Xena has a tiny moon, making it seem even more planetlike. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz

, he said,	 Williams of the astronomical union said there was no deadline for his committee's decision on planetary nomenclature. The urgency, he said, comes from the need to find a way of giving Brown's Xena an official name.
