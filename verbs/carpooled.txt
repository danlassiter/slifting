Her concern now is that too many publishers have used her phenomenal sales as a yardstick to judge emerging writers, asking them to write stories like Exhale.

TOP  Lede story (4-col. head over 1-col. deck and story):  SCOTUS-COMMANDMENTS (Washington) -- The Supreme Court struggled in a pair of 5-4 rulings Monday to define how much blending of church and state is constitutionally permissible, allowing the Ten Commandments to be displayed outside the Texas state Capitol but not inside Kentucky courthouses. In its first rulings on the issue in a quarter-century, the high court said that displays of the Ten Commandments on government property are not inherently unconstitutional. But each exhibit demands scrutiny to determine whether it amounts to a governmental promotion of religion, the court said in a case involving Kentucky courthouse exhibits. By Linda Greenhouse.

WITH (at fold)  SCOTUS-INTERNET (Washington) -- The Supreme Court handed a major victory to the entertainment and recording industries on Monday by reinstating a copyright-infringement suit against two file-sharing services and strongly suggesting that the services should be found liable for the massive copyright infringement committed by those who use their software to download music and movies. Two lower federal courts in California had ruled in favor of the two services, Grokster and StreamCast Networks, dismissing the lawsuit without a trial on the basis of a legal analysis that the Supreme Court rejected in a unanimous opinion.

The cars signal the latest move by China to follow Japan and South Korea in building itself into a global competitor in one of the cornerstone industries of the global economy. But China's debut as a car exporter foretells a much broader challenge to a half-century of American economic and political ascendance, one that may go beyond Japan's nearly a generation ago.

Dennis Rader, 60, a former Boy Scout leader and church president who dubbed himself BTK -- for bind, torture, kill -- in poems and packages sent to local news outlets, referred to his victims as projects and said strangling them was part of a sexual fantasy.

MEXICO-KIDNAP (Mexico City) -- Federal agents and soldiers raided three safe houses in the sprawling Mexican border city of Nuevo Laredo, rescuing 43 people who had been kidnapped, and making at least three arrests, the president's spokesman said Monday. The victims were testifying before state and federal authorities in Nuevo Laredo, across the border from Laredo, Texas, Ruben Aguilar, a spokesman for President Vicente Fox, said in Mexico City. Since January, many foreigners -- most of them Americans -- have been kidnapped in Mexican border cities. The federal Attorney General's office said preliminary reports indicated that all those rescued Sunday were Mexican citizens, however. The Nuevo Laredo raids began Sunday afternoon and included three homes.

NY-WATERFRONT (New York) -- Few people reminisce longingly about the New York waterfront of the 1970s, with its decrepit piers, graffiti-covered warehouses and tetchy drag queens. But you can say this for it: it had a gritty integrity. The typical riverfront developments of today, with their traditional lampposts and quaint park benches, drip with nostalgia for a city that never was. They have all the charm of an open-air suburban mall. The master plan for an East River esplanade, which was unveiled last month by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, is a welcome reprieve from that New York cliche. By Nikolai Ouroussoff.  (With photo.)  (Story has moved in e news file.)

, he argues,	 In fact, it is one of Kirsch's central arguments that the discipline, seriousness and technical sophistication that these poets acquired during their Modernist apprenticeships enabled them to produce poems about newly intimate subjects that possessed the rigor and shapeliness of lasting art -- poems that stand in sharp contrast to the outpourings of earnest but flabby confessional verse produced from the 1960s on, in the wake of Robert Lowell's epochal book Life Studies. While that book's revelations of mental illness and familial strife opened the floodgates to poems about madness, marital grief and emotional dysfunction, he argues, Lowell's best work was not catalyzed by therapeutic or penitential motives, but by more purely aesthetic ends. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz

, I think,	 The courts' reluctance to grant reporters special rights may reflect a broader dissatisfaction by politicians and the public about the role the news media have come to play. The press has increasingly found itself a target of politically charged attacks, particularly from conservatives, who tend to view the mainstream media as liberal and out of touch with the concerns of many Americans. To at least some extent, the press has also wounded itself with a series of scandals that have undermined its credibility and with what many journalists acknowledge is an over-reliance on confidential sources. We're in an era of great judicial skepticism regarding the reliability and professionalism of the media generally, said Rodney A. Smolla, dean of the University of Richmond School of Law, and that atmosphere, I think, makes courts reluctant to recognize any special First Amendment protection. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz

But the court provided little guidance on just how one might determine whether a company was purposely inducing its users to violate the law, and in this many technology advocates saw reason for concern. The entertainment industry, they argue, can now use the ruling to sue without restraint, seeking to show bad intent or purpose behind every technology it does not like. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz

From Napster, which used central servers to index the files its users had stored on their computers, file-sharing enthusiasts turned to upstarts like Kazaa, Grokster and StreamCast, which had no central indexes.

, they argue,	 In overturning lower court decisions that had favored the two peer-to-peer software makers, the court ruled that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties. But the court provided little guidance on just how one might determine whether a company was purposely inducing its users to violate the law, and in this many technology advocates saw reason for concern. The entertainment industry, they argue, can now use the ruling to sue without restraint, seeking to show bad intent or purpose behind every technology it does not like. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz

, he argued,	 The Texas case involved a more subtle display -- the Ten Commandments were one of 17 monuments and 21 historical markers on 22 acres around the Capitol. Justice Stephen Breyer, who disapproved of the Kentucky displays, switched sides in this instance, saying the Texas installation was a borderline case. The Ten Commandments have a religious message, he argued, but it was offset in Texas by the other displays, all purporting to embody the ideals of Texas' settlers. Taken together, he said, it suggested an overall secular purpose. That is a stretch. Having the Ten Commandments on the Capitol grounds, but not the holy writings of other faiths, sends a clear message, as Justice John Paul Stevens notes in dissent, that this state endorses the divine code of the 'Judeo-Christian' God. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz

The aliens of Spielberg's War of the Worlds, by contrast, seem to have implemented their scorched-Earth policy for kicks and giggles.

But this isn't a flat cartoon image: It's full 3-D space, the combatants circle so convincingly that my hand twinges to grab them -- and I'm not wearing those clunky red-and-blue cardboard glasses, either. I'm seeing a 3-D image with the naked eye. Ordinary TV sets deliver 500 lines of resolution. Most high-definition screens reach 1,050. The HD3D hits 1,280 lines and counting -- which means better picture quality than that of any TV available today, all in a convincing impression of the third dimension. And here's the seriously trippy part about the new screen, which Deep Light plans to introduce at next winter's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas: multiple blades of video enable one screen to show different programs to different viewers, at the same time. Imagine what that could do to your living room. By Michael Krantz.  NATIONAL-LAMPOON (Undated) -- If you didn't happen to catch National Lampoon's Greek Games, held during spring break on South Padre Island, Texas, the comedy high jinks you missed went a little something like this: teams of college kids with names like I Felta Thi and Tappa Kegga Day competed in events like the Salisbury Steak Toss, in which they tried to catch meat in plastic helmets, and the Lube Luge, sliding down plastic sheeting coated with something resembling K-Y Jelly. There was, of course, a keg toss event, as well as something billed as Greco Roman Strip Wrestling. Along with pay-per-view strip poker and television shows featuring battles between bikini-clad women, the Greek Games are part of what the new owners of National Lampoon Inc. are calling a resuscitation of an American comedic treasure. But veterans of the original National Lampoon and others who were greatly influenced by it are horrified. The new efforts may, in some sense, revive National Lampoon, but in another sense, they show how one of the most ambitious and influential experiments in comedy is ending with beer-soaked soft-core porn. By Jake Tapper.  Theater  STAR-ACTORS-LONDON (London) -- As the leading man in the new revival of the musical Guys and Dolls, a big hit here, Ewan McGregor could be said to incorporate traits from both sets of title characters. Not that there is anything particularly feminine about McGregor, who can also currently be seen channeling the spirit of Alec Guinness in the latest (and last) of the Star Wars films. But there is something doll-like -- as in made by Mattel -- about McGregor as he struts, sidles and scissors-kicks his way through the role of the crapshooting heartthrob Sky Masterson. Being live and in person, it seems, offers no guarantee of personality. McGregor is one of a host of actors from screens large and small who have materialized in the West End theater district of London this summer. The roster embraces a two-time Oscar winner (Kevin Spacey), an international It boy (Gael Garcia Bernal), a Batman of the late 20th century (Val Kilmer) and an emigre from American television (the former Friend David Schwimmer). The willingness of these men to commit to the copious sweat and meager salaries of stage work in sparsely air-conditioned London is encouraging. But their performances refute the seemingly self-evident principle that human flesh generates more heat than celluloid. By Ben Brantley.  Film  BEAT-FILM-REMAKE (Undated) -- I always thought 'Fingers' felt like a French film, anyway, says James Toback, who wrote and directed it and who now, 27 years later, is enjoying the strange experience of seeing Fingers become French not just in feeling but in fact. Jacques Audiard's film The Beat That My Heart Skipped, which relocates Toback's violent, willfully unstable psychodrama from '70s New York to 21st-century Paris, has to be one of the unlikeliest remakes in the history of the movies, and not only because The Beat That My Heart Skipped is actually a strong picture in its own right. It's also unusual in that the original film is not the sort of proven, marketable commodity that generally inspires (if that's the word) the urge to remake: It's practically unheard of for a French filmmaker to redo an American movie. Even the auteurs of the French New Wave maintained a reverential, hands-off attitude toward the work of their Hollywood idols. By Terrence Rafferty.  Television  BEWITCHED-FEMINISM (Undated) -- At last the '60s sitcom Bewitched has made it to the big screen -- set by the screenwriter and director Nora Ephron into a loving show-within-a-show homage, a celebration of TV's sweeter, more innocent past. The appeal is obvious. Who in these days of Desperate Housewives and scandal-seeking halftime shows doesn't pine for television's golden age -- those halcyon days when whole families could gather around the set and laugh along with the madcap doings of, say, a Nazi prison camp? But in fact, even Hogan's Heroes, which for six years milked laughs from the Third Reich with a home-porn auteur as its star, seems relatively guileless after a closer look at the original Bewitched. Along with I Dream of Jeannie, Bewitched was the first of that peculiar strain of sitcom known as the supernatural-housewife show. Today these shows are, if not exactly Jane Austen, still major texts for feminist criticism. By Chris Norris.

TRAVEL-ENGLISH GARDENS (Undated) -- No part of Britain is as blessed with gardens as the Weald of Sussex, the belt of forest and open, rolling country that lies between the North and South Downs southeast of London. A hundred years ago, when taxes were minimal, wealthy Londoners of horticultural bent chose the area for their rural showplaces. It had (and has) a relatively mild climate, fertile, acid-rich soils and quick access by commuter train to city offices. Today, the gardens are easily visited on a weekend jaunt from the capital. By R.W. Apple Jr.  TRAVEL-ENGLAND-TRUSTS (Undated) -- A National Trust vacation is probably not for everyone, said Antoine Bourbon-Parme, a New Yorker who has stayed in nearly two dozen trust properties in Britain over the last decade. Don't expect to be able to find an open restaurant on Sunday evening in your local village or very wide roads. But do expect to have a wonderful time in a beautiful house and commune with nature.

, she said,	 Despite her pedigree and resume, Williams arrived as the 14th seed, in part because she is not one of the tour's grinders, chasing paydays from Prague to Philadelphia. Her abdominal woes, she said, don't allow her to work like that. She likes to pick her spots - something that sister Serena appeared to be doing when she arrived here out of shape - and that leads to lower seedings. It also can lead to the rest of the pack errantly not picking her up on the radar. When fit and rested, as she is these days, she is a powerful and dominant force. Perhaps she hasn't been to a Grand Slam final since '03 (a loss here in an all-Sledgehammer final), but she still packs plenty of punch. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, I believe,	 The United States passport, I believe, is among the most valuable documents on the planet, Maura Harty, assistant secretary for the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs, said in an interview on Tuesday. What we have is a tremendous challenge knowing how people who ought not have a passport would like to try to get one from us. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, she said,	 The real problem, Harty said, is the relative ease with which people can obtain fraudulent identification, which they then use to apply for a passport. For example, more than 8,000 governmental agencies in the nation issue birth certificates, she said, making it hard at times to confirm authenticity. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, I believe,	 I have a very interesting, very passionate profession, where I probably could have made, I believe, two, three times more money a month than being a deputy or a minister, he said of his decision to give up medicine. But I chose politics because I like politics. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, he replied,	 Clearly, Douste-Blazy, 52, who entered political life when he was elected mayor of Lourdes 16 years ago, is learning the new job along the way. He asked journalists for a bit of charity if his answers were not yet precise, and told them they had many things to teach him. Asked about the scandal in Italy in which 13 CIA-led agents have been indicted in connection with the abduction of a militant Muslim cleric, he replied, I don't know about that. I don't know about that. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, he replied,	 Yes, yes, yes, Galileo, he said, cutting off the reporter in midsentence. Told that the question was about the $12.18 billion experimental reactor in Cadarache, near Marseille, he replied, But we have also obtained Galileo, you know! Great day! </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, he said,	 He insisted he was not at all positioning Europe as anti-American. Rather, he said, I am positioning Europe as a force of stability, an economic, commercial power with a unique social model that the United States doesn't have -- this is true -- and as a political force with a foreign and common defense policy. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, he said,	 Is Iraq really a central front in the fight against terror? Terrorists, he said, know that the outcome will leave them emboldened, or defeated. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, he said,	 Of the $1 billion shortfall for this year, he said, $273 million could be attributed to veterans of the global war on terrorism. That is because the budget assumed the Veterans Administration would treat 23,553 such veterans in 2005; the actual number was more than four times that, 103,000. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, she said,	 They immediately bonded and have kept in touch ever since, she said, noting they have a lot in common. Sears grew up Savannah, about 12 miles away from Thomas' home in Pin Point. They share some of the same friends. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, he said,	 Hutchison's presence on the ticket, said the strategist, would help offset Clinton's efforts to attract suburban women. Moreover, he said, the Texas senator could play bad cop and openly criticize Clinton, something that might be awkward for a male candidate. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, he said,	 But, he said, if it were clear that Hillary is going to be the nominee, conservatives might accept her under those circumstances. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, he said,	 And, whatever the rationale, there are internal political reasons. Timor Goksul, who studied the Shiites in southern Lebanon for years as adviser to the U.N. peacekeeping troops, said that when Amal disbanded its own militia, young men flocked to Hezbollah. The Hezbollah leaders, he said, are not going to risk the same erosion of their organization. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, you say,	 He insisted that presidential politics is not a consideration. I think it is impossible if every time I do something that is good for Massachusetts, you say, 'Gosh that might help you if you want to be something more than governor,' he said. Then is the answer then that I should never do anything good for Massachusetts? </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, she said,	 At first, Cooke had no interest in joining the trust's board, she said, but then realized it might help the women who remain faithful to the sect's doctrines on polygamous marriages. The fundamentalist community here evolved after the Mormon Church in Salt Lake City officially renounced polygamy in 1890. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, he said,	 In the past, because of their remote location and their unusual beliefs, they have been left alone, said Terry Goddard, the Arizona attorney general. But in recent months, he said, largely as a result of news media attention, there's been a level of scrutiny that didn't exist before. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, I can,	 There's a lot of women saying, 'See? If she can do it, I can,' she said. What's awesome is that by getting these couple of cases, it's just snowballed. Before, no one would dare fight.

, he said,	 The giant brain is us, said Peter Hirshberg, a former Apple executive who recently joined Technorati, a service based on San Francisco that indexes more than 11 million Web logs. His reference is to the 1960s fear that computers would emerge as omniscient artificial intelligences that would control society. Instead, he said, the Internet is now making it possible to exploit collective intellectual power of Internet users efficiently and instantly. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz

, she said,	 Many of those complaints have been called in to the state Department of Social Services, said Denise Monteiro, the department's spokeswoman. The most recent case, filed on June 17, involved another teacher and student, she said, but the allegation could not be proven. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz

, he said,	 Calculations of profits per equity partner also are flawed, he said, because there is no universal definition of equity partners and no one system for compensating them. Generally, equity partners own a percentage share of their firm, are compensated largely based on performance and have full voting rights on firm matters. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, I feel,	 I am a big guard, a strong guard, the tallest of the three, Williams said. I have a good all-around game, I know how to control the tempo, I know how to lead people. It's something I was born with, I feel, and that's what I'll try to do. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, I guess,	 We're very excited about our pick here at 18, said Ainge. I'm sure a lot of teams say this kind of stuff. We had him ranked way up in this draft. We thought he was going sixth to Portland. We found out in the last couple days, because he didn't work out in Portland, that they might take [Martell] Webster instead. We'd been doing a little research and thinking, this guy may not have a home.' But we thought somebody will definitely take him. So, I guess, we're the lucky team that got to take him. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
