"28322"	"he"	"understands"	" The principal architect of the euphoric state presently loose in New England has been Parcells. For all the concerns about the effort to build a new stadium in Boston or the creation of a new logo that has spurred souvenir and clothing sales, it remains the team's on-field success that drives the engine and that is Parcells' sole responsibility. No coach in Patriots history has achieved what he has in so short a time, and he understands this because he has given New England more than football victories. He has returned its self-respect. All he has accomplished, he understands, is about the bottom line. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"34311"	"he"	"understands"	" So far, Powell has wisely avoided the Ross Perot trap of playing national scold by being above battles in which he is not engaged. It is fine for Perot to posture and fulminate, to ``warn'' America that he might run again next year if Congress doesn't pass his latest, Dallas-designed litmus tests. Presumtuous posturing is always off-putting in a politician, and Powell will avoid such bluster. Nonetheless, he understands, as some of the now-running GOP candidates do not, that what is most unusual about the 1995-96 election cycle is that the action is right here _ not in Iowa, New Hampshire, or any other early-voting primary or caucus state. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"

Times News Service for Thursday, Aug. 1:  SOHO-HOTEL (New York) _ Emanuel Stern understands exactly the sociological phenomenon that has made possible his dream of building the first hotel in SoHo in a century. ``Artists constantly stake out underutilized real estate on the fringes, and by doing so are a cultural vanguard,'' he said. ``They come in and make it attractive _ and then the blue suits come in.'' Stern, 33, is a blue suit. In the eyes of many locals, he understands, he is a despoiler of the community that attracted him in the first place.  SOHO-HOTEL-DESIGN (New York) _ When Bill Sofield and Thomas O'Brien, the team behind Soho's Aero Studios, broke up this past spring, everyone in the design industry wondered what would happen to downtown's hottest young firm. Several months later, the answer is beginning to emerge.  AIDS-ADDED-YEARS (Undated) _ They would not relinquish a moment of the extra time they've received for the journey. But a road map _ what they wouldn't give for a better road map. People with AIDS whose lives are being extended through new drug therapies are hearing terms like ``chronic manageable disease'' for the first time. Mostly, they are trying to come to terms with the fact that there may be a long term. After years of preparing to die, they are finding that a readjustment of such magnitude is wrenching, no matter how welcome. By David Lifespan.

Like playhouses, they present enticing possibilities to the curious who drift through them, offering the promise of a painless fresh start. After a few months, having inspired some and titillated many, they disappear forever. But one such temporary structure, the Japanese house with tea garden that drew record crowds to the Museum of Modern Art in 1954 and 1955, has gone on to have a real life of its own as a permanent cultural center in Philadelphia, in Fairmount Park, the enormous swath of green that rambles for miles through the western part of the city.

INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  BRITAIN-EMBRYOS (London) _ Under a new law, Britain is scheduled to begin to destroy more than 3,000 unclaimed human embryos from in-vitro fertilization clinics, an act that has stirred horror and religious outrage among some segments of society and ethical and practical questions as well. By Youssef Ibrahim.  BRITAIN-BOTANIC (London) _ Bulletin: Kew Gardens resident does not stink! (Foreign Journal). By John Darnton.  YUGO-WOUNDED (Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina) _ Through four years of war, the people of Sarajevo prided themselves on their solidarity. They picked up their dead from the streets, they embraced the wounded, they grieved in cathedrals, churches and mosques. But now, as the city adjusts to peace, that bond has worn thin, say some who were left gravely wounded or paralyzed by the war. For the most part they are treated like outcasts, left in institutions or at home without help. By Jane Perlez.  (ART ADV: Photo [NYT29) to illustrate story has been sent to NYT photo clients.)  NATIONAL _ GENERAL (Moved in ``a'' category)  OLY-BOMB-MEDIA (Undated) _ News media's naming of bomb suspect raises ethical issues. By Frank Bruni.  REPUBS-ABORTION (Los Angeles) _ Raising the specter of a sharply divided Republican National Convention next month, two of the party's leading moderates, Gov. Pete Wilson of California and Gov. William Weld of Massachusetts, said on Wednesday that they would press delegates to substitute an abortion rights plank for the party's current anti-abortion plank. Exclusive. By B. Drummond Ayres Jr.  TWA-CRASH-LASER (East Moriches, N.Y.) _ The crisp black and white photograph could have been snapped on a spotlit stage. Etched in rivet-by-rivet detail is a large flat piece of metal. More than 20 feet across, the section pictured is covered by two letters _ T R _ the first two letters in Trans World Airlines. But this was not shot by a camera. It's the work of the laser-line camera. By Andrew Revkin.  (ART ADV: Graphic to illustrate story has been sent to NYT graphics clients.

CAMPAIGN _ (Moved in ``p'' category)  CLINTON-CRIME (Washington) _ President Clinton's record on crime: After nearly three decades of Republican dominance of the issue, President Clinton has scrapped his party's traditional approach to crime and criminal justice, embracing a series of punitive measures that have given him conservative credentials and threatened the Republicans' lock on law and order. By David Johnston and Tim Weiner. (Part five in the Clinton series.)  (ART ADV: Chart to illustrate story has been sent to NYT graphics clients.)  CLINTON-CRIME-JUDGES (Washington) _ In selecting federal judges, President Clinton has not tried to be the Anti-Reagan. By Neil A. Lewis.  WASHINGTON _ (Moved in ``w'' category)  WELFARE-CLINTON _ This was not the welfare bill Clinton hoped to sign, just the one that came to him; in the end, aides insisted, it was not politics that was uppermost on the president's mind, but history. By Todd Purdum.  WELFARE-VOICES (San Francisco) _ The notion of a need for drastic change in the federal welfare system elicited no surprise Wednesday among the men and women slumped in the colored plastic chairs at San Francisco's main welfare office. They did not use words like ``dependency'' and ``underclass.'' But one after another, they told the same sort of story about having only one way to go in their lives now, and no clear way to get there. They said they had heard nothing in all the talk about overhauling welfare to make them think that there odds would now improve. By Tim Golden.  (ART ADV: Photos [NYT31,32) to illustrate story have been sent to NYT photo clients.)  WELFARE-ASSESS (Washington) _ For all of President Clinton's agonizing over the welfare bill's provisions, for all the risk that he would be condemned by the left for signing it, Republicans and Democrats agreed on Wednesday that Clinton's signature on the measure would win him many more votes than it would cost him. By Richard L. Berke.  BUSINESS DAY _ (Moved in ``f'' category)  BOOK-RETURNS _ It's the time of the year to nestle in a beach chair with the sun, a tan and the great American novel of the nanosecond. But the problem with that old-fashioned rite of summer is that books by the thousands are instead washing back to publishers in a mighty tide of rejected literature known wearily in the trade as returns. By Doreen Carvajal.  (ART ADV: Graphic on book returns has been sent to NYT graphics clients. Photo [NYT36) to illustrate story has been sent to NYT photo clients.)  AIRSAFETY-MARKETPLACE _ Companies that make bomb detection devices or sell security services have seen their stocks rise since the crash of TWA Flight 800. Share prices for companies like InVision Technologies, Barringer Technologies, and Magal Security Systems have doubled, and in some cases tripled, in the last two weeks. But airlines and airports, the main customers for these companies' products, have not been so eager to place orders as investors have been to buy their stock. By Claudia H. Deutsch.  SOCSEC-ECONSCENE _ Looking for a painless way to cover roughly one-third of Social Security's unfunded liability to the baby boom generation? Shift a big chunk of the system's trust fund to common stocks, which have enjoyed four times the return of Treasury bonds since the 1920s. By Peter Passell.

And so, a few years ago, he sat down his top employees to discuss how to ensure Sebco's endurance. In the time since, he has been tying up loose ends. Worried about the spread of decay, he agreed to take over the management of 25 troubled buildings from another community group.
