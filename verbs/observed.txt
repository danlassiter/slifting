"23586"	"we"	"observed"	" Wyoming's First Amended Counterclaim alleges that ``Nebraska has circumvented and violated the equitable apportionment by demanding natural flow water for diversion by irrigation canals at and above Tri-State Dam in excess of the beneficial use requirements of the Nebraska lands entitled to water from those canals under the Decree . . . .'' Third Interim Report App. E-4. Wyoming's First Amended Cross-Claim alleges that the United States ``has circumvented and violated the equitable apportionment, and continues to do so, by operating the federal reservoirs to deliver natural flow water for diversion by Nebraska irrigation canals at and above Tri-State Dam in excess of the beneficial use requirements of the lands entitled to water from those canals under the Decree . . . .'' Id., at E-8. The Master recommended that we deny leave to inject these claims into the litigation, concluding that Wyoming's object is to transform the 1945 apportionment from a proportionate sharing of the natural flows in the pivotal reach to a scheme based on the beneficial use requirements of the pivotal reach irrigators. Third Interim Report 55-64. Wyoming excepts to the recommendation, claiming that its amendments do no more than elaborate on the suggestion made in the counterclaim that we allowed it to file in 1987, that Nebraska irrigators are wasting water diverted in the pivotal reach. But there is more to the amendments than that, and we agree with the Master that Wyoming in reality is calling for a fundamental modification of the settled apportionment scheme established in 1945, without alleging a change in conditions that would arguably justify so bold a step. In Nebraska II we rejected any notion that our 1945 decision and decree ``impose absolute ceilings on diversions by canals taking in the pivotal reach.'' 507 U. S., at --- (slip op., at 17). We found that although the irrigation requirements of the lands served by the canals were calculated in the prior proceedings, those calculations were used to ``determin(e) the appropriate apportionment of the pivotal reach, not to impose a cap on the canals' total diversions, either individually or cumulatively.'' Ibid. This was clearly indicated, we observed, by the fact that ``Paragraph V of the decree, which sets forth the apportionment, makes no mention of diversion ceilings and expressly states that Nebraska is free to allocate its share among its canals as it sees fit.'' Ibid., citing Nebraska, I supra, at 667. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"

"85159"	"she"	"observed"	" The ban was hastily added without any debate to the 1997 defense budget reauthorization bill when it was approved by Congress last fall. Fortunately, the judge in the case, Shira Scheindlin, did not let its lofty title, the Military Honor and Decency Act of 1996, obscure the vaguely worded statute's affront to traditional constitutional values. All the parties in the case agreed that the material proposed for banning was not legally obscene. Outside the schools and the broadcast media, Judge Scheindlin correctly noted, the Supreme Court has never approved government restrictions on non-obscene speech merely because officials found it indecent, vulgar, or offensive. As a practical matter, she observed, the law would not rid military bases of sexually explicit magazines, since military personnel could purchase them off-base. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

The best thing is to prevent the spills in the first place.'' </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20021121.0048 type=story > <HEADLINE> Rockets see Mavs game as measuring stick </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 11-21-02 01:18:00EST (BC-BKN-ROCKETS-HNS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"

"132999"	"he"	"observed"	" Homan believes Americans are stressed. Many caring, worshiping individuals are afraid to expose cracks in their tough exoskeletons and are afraid to open up their hearts to others. People, he observed, interact from the safety of their self-imposed armor, unwilling to reveal their soft underbellies of vulnerability. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"

"134368"	"he"	"observed"	" Finally, Hale argued that the U.S. banking system was in a strong position since it has largely protected itself from bad loans through the use of credit insurance. Much of the financing for the telecom boom, he observed, came from capital markets and thus the collapse had not damaged the banks. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"

"137270"	"he"	"observed"	" In fact, he observed, nations were capable of far greater sins than individuals. The only choices are between the bad and the less bad. Nations that embrace principles such as freedom have the duty to oppose tyranny with force, but, warned Niebuhr, no nation should claim its motive is pure. All nations, including America, act out of self-interest. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200303.gz"
"139470"	"they"	"observed"	" Both Williams, who grew up in North Carolina and Brooklyn, and Echegoyan say they are disturbed by the knee-jerk reactions dictated by contemporary political correctness. When the Eddie Murphy comedy Trading Places is shown on television, they observed, a scene has been deleted in which the character played by the actor Don Ameche uses the slur in explaining that he would never let Murphy's character run his company. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"139816"	"he"	"observed"	" Ashton complained about her. Nonetheless it was in his Lords of Burleigh in 1937 that everyone knew that she was going to be the one, as the dance reviewer P.W. Manchester wrote. Eventually she won Ashton over and served as the inspiration for 25 years' worth of his ballets. She had a brief crush on him early on, and then the two settled into a blithe companionship that endured until Ashton's death in 1988. Fonteyn made light of everything that went wrong, he observed, on a disastrous Greek cruise that the two endured with friends in the 1930s. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"148373"	"he"	"observed"	" Counties as governing bodies were abolished in Connecticut years ago, and towns and cities have no ability, he observed, to annex surrounding suburbs to bolster their tax base. Therefore, New Haven and places like Groton with its submarine base and Mansfield with the University of Connecticut in its backyard have to provide services without handing out a property tax bill. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"150165"	"he"	"observed"	" He turned 14 the year Mark McGwire hit 70 home runs, and pretty soon he asked his parents if he could use creatine, an amino acid that helps build muscle mass. Creatine, he observed, was sold in health food stores. And a lot of teenagers used it. But his parents said no. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"152005"	"he"	"observed"	" Army Lt. Gen. David Barno, the commander of coalition forces in Afghanistan, had the task of covering that huge country with just 18,000 troops. It was possible to do so, he observed, because airpower from all the services ... have given ground forces ... the ability to operate in smaller units and respond quicker, with more accurate weaponry, than at any other point in history. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"

"159732"	"he"	"observed"	" Flemings said that private and public capital was not being adequately funneled to the kinds of projects and people that foster invention.

"161044"	"she"	"observed"	" What happened next was perfectly predicted by a Yale Law professor, Amy Chua, in her 2003 book, World on Fire. Chua noticed that many developing nations have market-dominant minorities that disproportionately benefit from globalization. They also have impoverished majorities that are empowered by democratization. Americans think democracy and capitalism go together, Chua noted, but increasingly developing-world majorities are using their voting power to lash out against rich minorities and against capitalism. These revolts, she observed, fuse legitimate class resentments with nasty ethnic hatreds. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"

"170657"	"he"	"observed"	" Asked what message Democratic demands for a vote of no confidence in Rumsfeld send to our troops in the middle of a war, Schumer was similarly evasive. The fundamental difference between World War II and the present day, he observed, is that The Republican leadership doesn't have a real plan in Iraq. (Actually, wasn't the plan to win, just as in WWII?) But then Schumer warmed up: The reason is not that we shouldn't fight a strong war on terror but that Rumsfeld's not doing a very good job of it. That was better. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171933"	"he"	"observed"	" The wild card, he observed, is if downloadable video sales and rentals catch on with consumers in a big way, bypassing DVDs as a distribution vehicle. Such an operation, with its relatively low overhead and greater efficiency, could make traditional video stores obsolete. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
