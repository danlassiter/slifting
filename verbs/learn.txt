"3937"	"we"	"learn"	" ``Chicago Hope,'' CBS. Typical, isn't it? We have two good medical dramas for the first time in years, and they're scheduled opposite each other. ``Chicago Hope'' is the more high-minded of the two: It's set in a hospital that, we learn, just might be ``the best in the country.'' Consequently, it's staffed by people with huge egos that, frankly, get a little tiresome. E.G. Marshall plays a veteran surgeon with failing hands; Mandy Patinkin is his heir apparent, and Adam Arkin (CBS' ``Northern Exposuref'') is Patinkin's pal. Hector Elizondo plays the doctor in charge, which means he mostly strides around barking platitudes. It's good, but not as good as I'd hoped, particularly because it's from David Kelley, the creator of ``Picket Fences.'' Previews Sept. 18; premieres Sept. 22. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199409.gz"

"109435"	"we"	"learn"	" There is Ray (Bob Hoskins), a horse race tout who tried to parlay a bet of Jack's into an annuity for Amy, and who, we learn, once had an affair with her. There is Lenny (David Hemmings), a still feisty, though pudgy, former boxer-turned-grocer, and Vic (Tom Courtenay), a sober-sided undertaker with a taste for whiskey. Also along for the journey is Jack's grown son Vince (Ray Winstone), who disappointed his father by refusing to follow him into the meat business, choosing instead to sell cars, a skill more attuned to his personality. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"110945"	"we"	"learn"	" Hopelessly klutzy, dressed in hideous thrift-shop throwaways, Annie Mary squirms under the disapproving eye of her tyrannical, womanizing father. A local singing legend nicknamed the Voice of the Valleys, Jack drives his van around wearing a plastic Luciano Pavarotti mask and belting Puccini arias through loudspeakers. When Annie Mary was a teen-ager, we learn, she won a singing contest with first prize being a scholarship to study opera in Milan, Italy. She turned it down to stay in the village and care for her dying mother. She hasn't sung a note since. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"116168"	"we"	"learn"	" The crowd oohs and aahs as a 10-month-old joey crawls head-first into his mother's pouch, somersaults and peers out. Another appears to be waving when it absent-mind-edly misses a couple of face-cleaning swipes with its paw. The mother kangaroo, we learn, can draw the pouch tight like a drawstring if she wants her young one to stay put. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"119805"	"we"	"learn"	" By the time we hit the second-hour mark, we're in a whole new movie. (Spoilers ahead, so walk away if you want to stay surprised.) In the original release, we never knew what the middle-aged Salvatore (Jacques Perrin) did for a living; now, we learn, he's a much-admired filmmaker. Previously, we got the sense that he kind of missed his lost love Elena; now we understand that he's obsessed with her. What's more, he tracks her down and forces a reunion. What's more, she's willing. What's more, she spills a long-held secret that completely changes our understanding of kindly old Alfredo the projectionist: Salvatore sees, as do we, that the old man was willing to be a monster to ensure his protege's future calling. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"119902"	"we"	"learn"	" Lincoln Beach is also targeted by developers who want to buy out the owners of this aging black beach enclave. It has been there since the '30s, created by blacks for blacks as a summer refuge during segregation. Here we see the return of Desiree (Angela Bassett), who left in disgrace as a pregnant 15-year-old 25 years earlier, with her trophy husband, a Boston anesthesiologist (James McDaniel). She locks horns with her judgmental mother (Mary Alice), who, we learn, sent her away rather than keep her at home and help her with her pregnancy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"

"120528"	"we"	"learn"	" Parker has found a mysterious buyer for his big score. The man turns out to be an FBI agent who builds a sting against Pooh-Bear and the undercover cops, who, we learn, are dirty. Danny's life as a snitch has never been what it seemed. The rest you'll have to see for yourself. It's a good ride. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"
"123757"	"we"	"learn"	" Not every brouhaha presented here is equal, though. In a small South Carolina town, we learn, a group of fun-loving, upper-crust matrons attempt to raise money for their favorite charity by posing for a calendar in discreetly positioned nudity _ but the good-humored effort raises the ire of local defenders of morality. Ironies abound, as the inner circle of the local power structure comes under attack from conservatives, and a nervous mayor, in the best American political tradition, walks a verbal tightrope between contrasting constituencies. Here, one suspects that Jennings, usually so straight-faced, might be winking at us just a little. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"129144"	"we"	"learn"	" When Roger was growing up, we learn, he earned the nickname Roger Dodger for his ability to talk himself out of any jam. That talent has served him well professionally. The values of advertising have so thoroughly infiltrated his view of the world that he sees the mating game as a preprogrammed Pavlovian response to the marketing of images. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"129747"	"we"	"learn"	" To no one's surprise, ``The Questions of Sexual Upbringing'' never actually gets around to the questions of sexual upbringing due to the fact that it is far too busy shoveling propaganda. Western women, we learn, are prohibited from working outside the home, depriving them of the Communist joys of digging out potatoes with their fingernails or scrounging around a damaged nuclear reactor for scraps of metal. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"136130"	"we"	"learn"	" And yet the careful construction of facades was not limited to Dvorak's music. Beckerman writes that studying the composer is a bit like ``observing a planetary body acting under the gravitational pull of an invisible force'' with that force being the fears and anxieties that dominated Dvorak's inner life. In New York, his nerves were apparently so fragile that he required constant accompaniment outside the home. He had terrible anxiety before performances of new works, and his modest upbringing made him frequently insecure in the company of members of the American and European elite. Other sources of turmoil, we learn, might have included a furtive love for his sister-in-law, and a deep conflict about whether to follow the more conservative example of Brahms or the more radical approach of Wagner. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"137846"	"we"	"learn"	" Everyone Moskowitz meets rhapsodizes about the torture of writing, but they all treasure the seemingly bottomless task of finishing a book. Mossman's situation, we learn, is a poignant symbol of that paradox, and a victim of it for sure. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200306.gz"
"139420"	"we"	"learn"	" The reason the script supplies to keep them in Britain is a real hoot: A bishop from Rome wants the knights to rescue a teen-age boy trapped behind the Saxon army invading from the north. The boy, we learn, has great spiritual potential, and could even become Pope one day. This means traveling north of Hadrian's Wall, which marked the border of the wild lands where the Pictish warriors, or Woads, hold sway. (Why the Woads continually attack the well-protected Roman settlements south of the Wall, while ignoring the wide-open estate of the boy's family, the movie does not bother to explain). </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"140537"	"they"	"learn"	" Transgression, in some cases, even seems to promise salvation. In Singer's first novel, Satan in Goray, written in 1933 just before he came to New York, the inhabitants of a 17th-century Polish village decimated by pogroms are seduced by the doctrines of the false messiah, Sabbatai Zevi. Salvation, they learn, will come not despite transgression but because of it. The sparks of the Divine will be freed from the depths of the underworld by those who submerge themselves in sin; those sparks, reunited with the Godhead, will usher in a Messianic world. Sin, in Sabbateanism, is made holy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"141107"	"we"	"learn"	" So while Yugi and his friends -- including the token girl, Tea -- are chasing around the Millennium Puzzle (don't ask) and dodging sinister mummies, Pharaoh and Kaiba are duking it out in a boring, explanation-saturated duel. The fate of the world, we learn, may somehow be at stake. The only significant time spent !ital!away!off! from this climactic duel is when Kaiba visits the the effete, white-wine-spritzer-drinking Pegasus, (please don't ask) to obtain better cards. And !ital!they!off! duel. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"142412"	"we"	"learn"	" Older brother Jack, we learn, was a handsome, goal-directed track star famously successful with women; Bobby, the younger, was always different, even peculiar, an asthmatic dreamer and geeky outsider. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"147151"	"we"	"learn"	" Hamill tries to conduct an orderly tour, starting at the Battery and working his way north, but his own biography keeps getting in the way. The book's subtitle is, after all, My Manhattan. The current Trinity Church, we learn, has a tower that rises 284 feet and cost $90,000 (about $1.9 million in today's money) when it was rebuilt in 1846. More to the point, Hamill saw that tower every morning and every lunch hour when he worked as a messenger at Doremus &amp; Co., an advertising agency in the Equitable Building. Both buildings engage his imagination because they're part of who he is. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"149782"	"we"	"learn"	" In the DVD extras, we're told that Asian and American horror films differ: Western characters come upon a haunting, discover what it is and figure out how to solve it. In the East, we learn, ghost stories are much deeper than that -- more artful and less formulaic. But Hollywood's Grudge fudges on these points: Sarah Michelle Gellar's character, like her Daphne in Scooby Doo, launches the most typical of film investigations and far too conveniently figures things out. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"
"149862"	"we"	"learn"	" Smith -- who understudied Cynthia Nixon in The Real Thing and eventually took over the role -- is ambitious, eager and, we learn, rather insecure. A hard-core bulimic from her early teens, she works a Martha Stewart-ish binge-and-purge demonstration into the performance that is more gimmicky than affecting. Indeed, there are times when the actress is working her way up and down the red staircase at the center of Keith E. Mitchell's playful set when you wish she'd just sit still and talk to us. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"
"149875"	"we"	"learn"	" Napoleon, we learn, craves to spend his last days in Britain. The Brits want no part of the idea. Then he focuses on America. There is a plan afoot for him to evade British blockades and sail from French soil to Boston or Philadelphia, but he is captured by a British ship before he makes open water and interned on it off the English coast. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"
"151980"	"we"	"learn"	" When Axel chooses a disco club to unwind in, we learn, as Eyal does, that the young German is gay. The macho Eyal reacts uncomfortably, but as he slowly softens his attitude, he begins to question his role in the Mossad effort as his firing-range skills deteriorate. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"154263"	"we"	"learn"	" What's the point? asks one of the signs along a mock trophy wall of elaborate skulls with baroque spikes and horns and frills of bone. You might think these animals were aggressive, fierce fighters. But the ceratopsians, we learn, were actually sluggish plant-eaters who moved in herds. Even the famous spikes of the Stegosaurus are now thought to have been far too weak to be useful as armor or weaponry. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"155325"	"we"	"learn"	" Sheriff Bell, we learn, is haunted by a Lord Jim-like episode from his past. Although he won a bronze star during World War II, he was guilty of an act of cowardice that contributed to the deaths of many men in his unit. Ever since then, he has been trying to make amends, looking upon his job as sheriff as a second chance to prove himself. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"157283"	"we"	"learn"	" In 2055, we learn, time travel (an invention that could change the world or destroy it) has been commodified by a greedy mogul named Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley). Hatton runs a business called Time Safari, which ferries tourists back into the Cretaceous period to hunt dinosaurs. Someone has also apparently gone back to the 20th century to retrieve a truckload of double-breasted chalk-stripe suits and, to judge from Kingsley's white pompadour, Jack Valenti's hair. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
"158911"	"we"	"learn"	" After all, horse racing, we learn, is the sport of kings. And monarchs need their minions, especially talented ones. Ben trains thoroughbreds for Palmer, who in turn races them for even wealthier men like Prince Tariq. The sport of sultans is more like it: The prince likes to pit his horses against those of his brother, Prince Sadir (Oded Fehr). </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
"159934"	"we"	"learn"	" Prof. Gloomy Hills, we learn, lives in his parents' house, proposing to die alone, in the same bed in which I was born and on a day that I hope will be distant and painless. In addition to having taught Spanish and Latin grammar, he served for 40 years as the cable editor at El Diario de La Paz, a job that involved reconstructing and completing in indigenous prose the news of the world that we caught as it flew through sidereal space on shortwaves or in Morse code. He now scrapes by on his pension from that extinct profession, combined with the even more meager sums he earns writing a weekly column. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"160747"	"we"	"learn"	" The diaries are very well organized on the discs. On the menu page, one can choose to watch them all the way through chronologically from Sept. 6, 2004 to April 8, 2005, or by a selected date, or even by location. These locations include the SS Venture, Skull Island and New York City -- all of which, we learn, were constructed in or around Wellington, New Zealand. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"165579"	"we"	"learn"	" They get in a couple. There are, we learn, alligators within the sewers of the city. And they have Brooklyn accents and know the best route to the Statue of Liberty. Would that The Wild had any kind of consistency of cleverness. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"166098"	"we"	"learn"	" Into this scene emerges the princess Salome, who is weary of the revelry inside the palace. Hearing the half-incoherent ramblings of the imprisoned prophet Jokanaan, Salome says -- fatefully -- I would speak with him. And this, we learn, is a girl unaccustomed to taking no for an answer. Now, this production of Salome was originally scheduled to tour the Southland with its New York cast -- including David Strathairn, Dianne Wiest and Marisa Tomei (as the veil-dropping princess) -- intact. Had that version arrived -- and with all due respect to Tomei -- local audiences would have missed out on seeing a very exciting actress named Jessica Chastain. Not only does this performer hold her own opposite some very formidable company, she delivers one of the hottest and most frightening performances of the year. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"166684"	"we"	"learn"	" The Takster, we learn, is holding a bunch of people hostage in a ratty jail, including a famous novelist (Tom Skerritt), a kid with a deep faith in God (Shane Haboucha) and a few other tissue-thin characters you'll care nothing about. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"170672"	"we"	"learn"	" Though touching lightly on some traditionalists' opposition to female cantors, A Cantor's Tale is more concerned with singing praises than with arguing over orthodoxies. The movie is most engaging when following Mendelson around his old neighborhood, which, we learn, is simply teeming with bakers whose singing is on a par with their knishes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"

Each subsequently vows to best the other in magic and in life: Borden has the skill, Angier has the showmanship, and their loved ones can only look on aghast. These include Rebecca Hall as Borden's increasingly confused wife, Scarlett Johansson as a stage assistant whose heart may or may not belong to both men, and Michael Caine, cackling from the sidelines as the creator of the stage tricks that dazzle the multitudes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
