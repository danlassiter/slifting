"28253"	"they"	"vow"	" Times Mirror Co. made an expensive bet that a new newspaper could be built in the core of urban America, instead of in the affluent suburbs where many metropolitan papers have focused their efforts. That it did not win that bet is a sad message not only for the newspaper business but for our cities as well. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950716.0178 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-BC-AZR-BUDGET-AZR) </DATELINE> <TEXT> (For use by N.Y.

"82406"	"I"	"vow"	" Each year, I vow, never again. Next year I'll be the popular aunt. I'll succumb to that Toys 'R' Us tidal wave and elbow out other shoppers for that Tickle-Me Elmo.

"171670"	"you"	"vow"	" Like most dieters, I cut deals with myself. If you are trying to lose real weight, you vow, say, to give up beer and ice cream but retain your pizza rights. Since I was trying to emit less CO2, I vowed to lower the thermostat at night by one degree -- not two, as often recommended by tree-huggers -- a tweak I expected none of us would notice. (That saved 79 pounds; each degree equals approximately 315 pounds of CO2; turning it down only at night, for the six colder months, or 1/4 times 315). </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
