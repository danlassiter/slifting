By EVERETT POTTER c.1995 Diversion magazine (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  It must have been the Tibetan beer and the 14,000-foot altitude that led my friend Dan and me to wander off the pitch-dark streets of Shigatse and straight onto a Chinese army base.  This was ultrasensitive Tibet in the 1980s, when rumors of secret Chinese nuclear sites were rife and relations between the Tibetans and Chinese were less than cordial. So having two Westerners stroll onto an army base like Beavis and Butt-head was not cool.  Marched under guard to a barracks room, we were regarded with confusion and not a little contempt by an officer still in his long johns and rubbing sleep from his eyes. He barked into a hand-crank telephone, and the room soon filled with chain-smoking officers, each one nastier than the next.  No one spoke English, and my thoughts turned to what a month or two in a Chinese jail cell would be like. A few tense hours passed before they figured out we were just a couple of idiots _ not spies _ and sent us packing.  Which just goes to prove that you can't always control what happens when you're on the road. Here are some of the more typical emergencies travelers face, what to do if they befall you and how to avoid them in the first place. -0- STOLEN CASH, CREDIT CARDS OR CAMERA  It can happen in Rio or in Peoria. Besides securing your property as carefully as possible, the only way to protect yourself is to be insured. Travel insurance covers theft, and most homeowners' policies cover off-premise thefts as well.  If you are robbed, immediately report the incident to the local police. Be sure to get a copy of the report _ it's essential for making insurance claims back home.  If you've lost cash, some policies will cover it if you can prove you had the money in the first place by showing a currency-exchange statement or a canceled traveler's check, which the issuing company can provide.  If your traveler's checks are lost or stolen, contact the issuer and supply the numbers of the missing checks. You will be reimbursed within a couple of days.  If you've lost an American Express card, the company can provide a replacement card, often within 24 hours. Visa and MasterCard will replace cards too, though these are likely to take longer. Be sure to note the telephone number of the issuing bank before you leave home _ and pack it in a safe place other than your wallet or purse, such as a money belt.  Other numbers to carry include those of the U.S. embassies or consulates anywhere you may be going. Call the State Department at (202) 647-4000 for these numbers. Embassies or consulates can help you deal with language problems and the local police. They will also assist in replacing passports or airline tickets, canceling credit cards and transferring money. LOST OR STOLEN PASSPORT  This may not be as disastrous as having your wallet stolen, but it's still a crisis. Begin by reporting the loss to the police and contacting the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.  You can speed the process of replacing a lost passport by having the foresight to pack, in a location separate from your passport, a notarized copy of your birth certificate, a copy of the information pages of your passport and two passport-sized photos.  In a pinch, the State Department can issue a passport waiver or a letter good for one-time re-entry into the United States. This is not done every day, and at $100 a pop it's not cheap. LOST AIRLINE TICKET  Report the loss to the carrier at once, supplying the ticket number _ yet another item to keep in a separate place. You'll have to file a lost-ticket application and pay a fee ranging from $39 to $70 which, if you have to buy a replacement ticket, will be deducted from your eventual refund. File as soon as possible, instead of waiting until you're about to return home.  Domestic carriers usually require you to buy a replacement ticket, to be refunded after verifying the original ticket purchase. Foreign carriers tend to be more lenient when it comes to replacing lost or stolen tickets, often simply handing you a new one. MISSED FLIGHT  This is every traveler's nightmare, and what you do about it depends on which airline you're flying.  American Airlines, which is typical of many carriers, will put you on its next flight to your destination, but not on a competitor's flight.  If your ticket is refundable, you may opt for a refund and then try to fly a competitor, but then you'll pay a full, no-advance-purchase fare. If your ticket is not refundable, you can travel on another day after paying a reticketing fee of about $35.  Travel insurance is the most important protection you can have. It covers missed air connections and is especially crucial when your flight is connecting to a cruise embarkation. RETURNING HOME IN AN EMERGENCY  Airlines handle the problem of emergency returns largely on a case-by-case basis. Officially, some airlines offer bereavement or compassion fares amounting to a stingy 10-percent discount on the highest excursion fare of the moment. To get even that discount, you must later provide a photocopy of the death certificate.  But airline personnel don't always follow the truly hardhearted policies, so your original return ticket may well be honored, particularly when a death in the family is involved. YOUR AIRLINE GOES OUT OF BUSINESS  Scams and sudden Chapter 11 filings by airlines and tour operators can leave travelers stranded like flightless birds.  If your airline goes under, you'll have to buy a new ticket on another carrier. But if you purchased your original ticket with a credit card, you may not have to pay for it. Because you didn't get what you paid for, the credit-card company will usually side with you.  Whenever you book a tour, make sure that the company is a member of the U.S. Tour Operators Association, the American Society of Travel Agents, or the National Tour Association. These groups have consumer-protection programs to provide reimbursement if a member fails. COUPS OR TERRORIST VIOLENCE  Political violence can erupt unexpectedly, and not just in the obvious places. In recent times, countries as disparate as Fiji, Turkey and Venezuela have seen political turmoil.  The State Department maintains a hot line at (202) 647-5225 with information on potential crises in every country. There's also a Travel Warnings list, which translates simply as ``Don't go,'' and limited advisories on countries such as Egypt, Israel, the Philippines and South Africa, where certain areas may be dangerous.  If you are going to a place where there is potential unrest, register with the U.S. embassy once you arrive. If you do get caught in a politcal disturbance, contact the nearest embassy or consulate immediately. Their advice may include telling you to stay inside and away from windows, to get to the airport and leave the country or in rare cases to come to the embassy for sanctuary. GETTING ARRESTED  Most things illegal at home _ such as theft, assault or drug possession _ are illegal abroad. Foreign countries may also prohibit other things that wouldn't occur to you, such as taking a picture of a bridge in Paraguay, failing to flush a toilet at a train station in Singapore or wandering onto that military base in Tibet. A car accident in Mexico or a black-market transaction in certain countries can also land you in the clink, at least temporarily.  American citizens are subject to the laws and procedures of the country they are visiting, says Nyda Budig, a State Department press officer. ``Your constitutional privileges remain stateside.''  If you are arrested, demand to speak to someone at the local U.S. consulate or embassy, who can help you contact attorneys and interpreters, and notify friends and relatives back home. Consulate officials may visit you in jail to determine if you are being treated humanely, but they can't get you out.  ``If the jails are awful, there isn't much we can do about it,'' Budig says. ``But let's face it. The majority of people who get arrested do break the law.'' The best advice, therefore, is to know the law and avoid taking chances in unfamiliar territory.

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) By PATRICIA KITCHEN c.1995 McCall's magazine (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Standing in front of a ninth-grade English class as a student teacher, I slowly looked up from behind my mass of long, straight hair and squeaked, ``Good morning, let's get started.''  When the buzz of before-class chatter continued, I tried again. Nothing. A third time. Again nothing.  As I broke into a sweat in front of that noisy class, my fear turned into a healthy anger that surprised even me. A new voice welled up inside.  ``Excuse me,'' I found myself saying in a firm, commanding tone. ``I am ready to begin. I suggest that you be ready too.'' That did the trick. Settling down in their seats, the students promptly turned to face me.  Many people learn as children to speak in pleasing, unassuming tones. Well-meaning parents and other adults encourage them to be overly considerate, so the words ``I'm sorry'' become a regular part of their vocabularies.  Women in particular are also conditioned to hint and cajole instead of simply asking for what they wanted.  ``Girls are taught not to boast, put themselves forward or try to claim credit in an obvious way,'' explains Deborah Tannen, author of ``Talking From 9 to 5: How Women's and Men's Conversational Styles Affect Who Gets Heard, Who Gets Credit, and What Gets Done at Work'' (William Morrow, 1994).  But socialization isn't destiny. You can develop a voice that says ``I know what I'm talking about, and it's important that you hear what I'm saying.'' So says Sam Chwat, a speech therapist who is director of New York Speech Improvement Services in New York City. START BY TURNING UP THE VOLUME  Betty Oliver, 45, remembers a time when she would answer the telephone with a teeny, tiny ``Hello?''  ``It was more of a whisper,'' Oliver says. ``I guess I was saying `Poor little old me. I'm not very interesting.'''  But when Oliver recently decided to return to work after a 20-year hiatus, she had to push herself to speak in a louder, more confident tone. She began testing her newfound voice at job interviews, with salespeople and even with her family.  Now, she reports, she answers the phone with an energetic ``Good morning, Olivers'.''  Besides having a low-volume, low-energy way of speaking, many women often use a higher pitch to emphasize their point. But this girlish, Betty Boop tone comes across as passive and unsure, Chwat says, as if you're afraid to actually let the message leave your head.  To crank up your volume and lower your tone, Chwat suggests imitating people known for speaking assertively, such as Oprah Winfrey. ``We just don't realize what good mimics we can be,'' he says.  Another way to pack some punch with your words is to avoid ``upspeak,'' the tendency to give the last syllable a higher inflection, which makes your statement sound more like a question. Though your intent may be to convey the thought ``Don't you agree?'' or ``Shall I go on?'' the message you send is ``I don't really believe what I'm saying,'' Chwat says.  If you catch yourself ending sentences on an upswing, just think, ``Would Diane Sawyer ever end a newscast by saying `This is Diane Sawyer for ABC News?''' KEEP IT SHORT, SIMPLE AND DIRECT  Dianna Booher, author of ``Communicate With Confidence: How to Say It Right the First Time and Every Time'' (McGraw-Hill, 1994), tells of a boss who decided to give a poorly performing administrative assistant another chance with a new assignment.  In an attempt to water down the criticism, the boss told the assistant that she was being reassigned so the department could take better advantage of her strengths. However, the boss ended up sugarcoating the message so much that the inept assistant tried to ask her for a raise.  In an effort to avoid hurting another person's feelings, you may wind up sounding so wishy-washy that your message is misinterpreted or not heard at all. It's the ``kinda, maybe, wouldn't-it-be-nice approach,'' says Laura Berman Fortgang, a former actress who now runs communication-skills workshops in New York City.  ``What's missing is certainty,'' Fortgang says. ``You have to start trusting yourself to have a wish or an opinion, and state it directly.''  For some people, the problem is taking too long to get to the point. Dana Young, 36, owner of a boutique in Colleyville, Texas, recalls one customer who phoned and said ``I can't believe I didn't check the package before I left the store. I got home and found that I have the large pants, instead of the medium ones. I'm not planning to be near the store again anytime soon, so ... ''  What the customer really wanted was for Young to come to her house and make the exchange. But it's effective in getting a point across to state your request definitively, Fortgang says.  For example, instead of saying to a colleague, ``Could you help me with a project on Friday if you have time?'' say, ``Will you definitely have time to help me on Friday, or should I make other arrangements?''  Make statements short and sweet, Booher says. You weaken your position by loading sentences with intensifiers such as ``so,'' ``very'' and ``much,'' or with too many adjectives and adverbs, when a bare-bones sentence of nouns and verbs would suffice. DO YOU HAVE THAT MUCH TO BE SORRY FOR?  After a recent speech, Booher accidentally bumped into a woman standing in front of her in the buffet line, making the woman spill her tea. Before Booher could apologize, the woman said how sorry she was, even though Booher was clearly at fault.  Many people automatically apologize for all kinds of things that aren't their fault or don't call for an expression of remorse.  Oliver remembers approaching busy salesclerks with ``I'm so sorry to bother you.'' ``But I really wasn't sorry, and I really wasn't bothering them _ that's their job,'' she says.  You may think you're merely being polite, but too many ``sorries'' make you sound wimpy. Next time you have the urge to ask for forgiveness, wait a minute and consider what your point would sound like without the apology. Then just say it. PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE  Chwat advises testing the ``new you'' in anonymous, non-threatening situations, such as over the telephone. Next, weave in examples of your improved language and style when you're speaking with someone in person, such as a salesclerk or a waiter. Finally, try a few techniques on family and friends.  ``You may think you sound outrageous, but in fact you'll elicit no unusual response at all,'' he says. If anything, your friends will respect and admire you all the more.

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Jonathan Pryce in a scene from ``Carrington.'' By IAN SPELLING (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  A biographical period-piece film about the loving, taboo-breaking relationship between a gay man and a younger woman who romances other men?  Such a scenario sounds mighty unlikely, especially these days, when films are painstakingly planned to attract as wide and lucrative an audience as possible.  Yet that's the essence of ``Carrington,'' which explores the intense relationship between two famous Brits, the respected author Lytton Strachey and the noted artist Dora Carrington, who fell in love in England in 1915 and spent the next 17 years involved in a bizarre, open relationship. The film debuts Nov. 10 in major cities, with additional screens to be added slowly over the next few weeks.  That ``Carrington'' _ which was written and directed by Christopher Hampton after a 19-year gestation period during which the script was widely regarded as too cerebral to be viable _ actually came to pass surprises no one more that its star, Jonathan Pryce. He plays the frail, thick-bearded Strachey to Emma Thompson's flush-faced, spirited Carrington.  ``Thank God it's finally done,'' Pryce says, running his fingers through his thinning, salt-and-pepper hair during a conversation over tea at a Manhattan hotel. ``I've been involved with the project since 1992, but I kept thinking it had gone away.  ``We lost our financing, we lost our director (Mike Newell), and then it looked as if I was not going to be able to fit it into my schedule. Finally, it all somehow came together, with very little money, with Christopher making his directing debut and with Emma and I able to squeeze it in.  ``Was it worth the wait? Absolutely. After `Brazil' (1985) it's the best film experience I've had, because I think that my strength as an actor is my theater work, and the role of Lytton is as close as I've had to a theatrical experience on film.''  Pryce, best known to American audiences for the film ``Glengarry Glen Ross'' (1992), his Tony Award-winning performance in ``Miss Saigon'' and his ubiquitous Infiniti television commercials, admits he was initially concerned that ``Carrington'' could turn into a costume drama centering on two boring, stiff people.  As much as he appreciated Hampton's script, Pryce felt both Strachey and his relationship with Carrington failed to come to life until the film's rehearsal period, which lasted two weeks.  ``I create characters in relation to other people,'' says the 48-year-old actor, who was born in North Wales. ``I'm informed by how another actor responds to my performance, to my character.  ``So having someone like Emma to play off of enabled it to jell. She helped me find his voice, and from there I found his humor and really began to enjoy being him.  ``If my performance works, I credit a lot of it to Emma.''  Though the caustically funny Strachey and the droll Carrington obviously shared a great deal of genuine affection, not to mention laughter, their tale would not be complete without its more tragic aspects. The two never consummated their relationship, and endured both jealous lovers and contemptuous contemporaries.  Further, the general consensus of the art world has always been that Carrington would have been a more accomplished, more productive painter had she not been so obsessed with and devoted to Strachey.  ``There was pain involved, but there's pain in all kinds of relationships,'' Pryce says. ``They felt great comfort with one another, and each found the kind of sympathetic relationship they needed _ which makes me believe theirs was not a tragic pairing at all.''  Pryce says he felt entirely at home playing a homosexual, though he is not gay. In fact, he says, it isn't the first time he's played a gay man _ only the first time that a character's sexual identity has been central enough to be overt.  In the past, he's played characters whom he as an actor perceived as gay, though the audience probably was never aware of it, he says. As far as he is concerned, it was only one aspect of his overall conceptions of those characters.  ``Homosexuality is so much a part of my life,'' he says, ``that (playing a gay character) doesn't seem like anything unusual or different from how I approach any other character or person that I've been involved with in the past.  ``I have homosexual friends, and I work in the theater both here and in England,'' he says. ``Homosexuality is a way of life that's embraced and celebrated in the theater world. You don't spend 20 years in the theater, as I've done, and not have it be a part of your life.  ``Strachey just happens to be an obviously homosexual character _ `obvious' because his preference is talked about and we see him with other men.''  Pryce seems pleased with ``Carrington,'' which received an extended standing ovation after a screening at the Cannes Film Festival. His work in the film earned him the Best Actor award at Cannes, and he is being talked of as a candidate for an Oscar nomination.  And, while he's happy that the film focuses in part on a gay man, he's happier that it delves into a complex relationship.  ``Any film that does that is worthwhile,'' he says. ``I don't see `Carrington' as a crusade piece or a campaign piece.  ``You can sense the prejudice behind a lot of questions concerning gays and projects that depict gays, and it's always an unwanted surprise. But you have to deal with it.  ``Still, you have to be careful because if you talk about it and you're not gay, it can begin to sound incredibly patronizing, like Oscar-speech time. I refuse to approach it like that.''  Pryce clearly takes a careful approach to his career, choosing quality over either quantity or box-office potential. Prior to ``Carrington,'' Pryce starred with Christopher Walken and Carole Bouquet in the independent film, ``A Business Affair.''  An offbeat love story currently in limited theatrical release, ``Business Affair'' casts Pryce as a reticent author whose frustrated wife (Bouquet) is lured away from him by his publisher (Walken).  After filming ``Carrington,'' the actor spent nine months in London, portraying Fagin in a stage revival of the musical ``Oliver!'' He will not, however, reprise the role if ``Oliver!'' jumps the pond for a run in America, because he says he feels he has exhausted the role's dramatic possibilities.  Pryce spent much of the past summer with his wife, actress Kate Fahy, and their three young children at the family's home in London. He also indulged himself anew in a once-great passion.  ``At one point in my life I thought I was going to be an artist _ a painter. But then acting came along, and that took care of my creative impulses,'' he says, laughing.  ``Now I'm drawing and painting again, and after not having done it all those years, I'm actually a little better at it because I'm more confident _ and because I don't have a teacher standing behind me anymore.''  Currently, Pryce the actor is preparing for another role, starring as Juan Peron opposite Madonna and Antonio Banderas in the long-awaited film version of ``Evita.''  ``I've got plenty of challenges ahead, I think, but they have less to do with my work and more to do with me,'' he says. ``I'd like to become a calmer, saner, more responsible human being.  ``The sound bite would be to say I want to continue to do good work, but there's more to it than just that. It's really a game you play with yourself.  ``I keep my ambitions to myself and, to paraphrase Strachey, the fact that I might be ambitious is a secret.''  Pryce pauses.  ``Actually, you know, ambition isn't a bad word.''  (Ian Spelling is a New York-based free-lance writer.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) By JAN BENZEL c.1995 The New York Times (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  The sign on his door reads ``Overstock and Maurice Sendak.''  Sendak emerges, a slight, squarish man, graying and somehow familiar, as if he were the relative of someone you know quite well.  As he talks, the glimmers get stronger. Behind the beard and glasses, there is Max, the defiant boy sent to his room in ``Where the Wild Things Are'' (HarperCollins, 1963). And Micky, who dreams of adventure in ``The Night Kitchen'' (HarperCollins, 1970). There is Rosie, who imagines herself into Alinda, the lovely lady singer.  There, too, are the Wild Things. And Little Bear, whom Sendak drew to illustrate Else Holmelund Minarik's stories, and who has tumbled out of the 1950s ``I Can Read'' books onto his own Nickelodeon series.  They are squat. They have obstinate hair that sticks straight down, or prickly-looking fur. They are bundles of restless energy and emotions and imagination, trying to make sense of their worlds.  But, Sendak says, they are not him.  ``Nothing in my books is autobiographical,'' he maintains over a roast-beef sandwich in the nondescript office he uses in the HarperCollins building in midtown Manhattan.  ``People always assume that if you write about children, you're writing about your own childhood. I was always writing childhoods I wished mine was like, giving children room to live in a way that I wasn't. Why re-create my childhood? I had to live tediously through it.  ``I never doubted that I was loved,'' he says. ``But I had parents who had no idea what children were all about. They just bumped along in the dark.''  When Minarik's first manuscript arrived unsolicited at Harper Brothers, where Sendak was working as a young illustrator and gofer in the 1950s, he seized the chance to illustrate it.  He had been a third child, the son of a father who worked so hard he was rarely home and a mother who took in sewing to help support her family.  Little Bear is the only cub of a mother who is always there when Little Bear needs or wants her. Little Bear roams the forest, tussling with independence, trust and friendship.  Sendak's passion at the time was for Victorian illustration, and the books _ and the series _ have an old-fashioned, carefully detailed style, drawn with lots of crosshatching.  ``It was a perfect opportunity to present the idealized child-and-parent relationship,'' he remembers. ``The unsentimental dream relationship, not the phony kiddie-book mommy-daddy-kiddie relationship. And Else had written that book, drained of sentiment. All heart, no sentiment _ big difference. Lean, clean, tough, dramatic, heartbreaking.''  Little Bear will be the star of ``Maurice Sendak's Little Bear,'' a half-hour program appearing on Nickelodeon on Mondays at noon, beginning Nov. 6. It joins a growing roster of gentle, well-produced programming for preschool children on the cable channel, with series including ``Gullah Gullah Island,'' ``Allegra's Window,'' ``The Busy World of Richard Scarry'' and ``Rupert Bear.''  Sendak, who is 67, is again working closely with Minarik, now 75 and living in New Hampshire, to adapt the ``Little Bear'' stories for television. With their guidance, a team of writers has expanded the spare universe of the books, coming up with new adventures and dialogue.  ``When you move from one form to another, if you don't accept that you're going to have to rework it, then you shouldn't do it,'' says Sendak, who has adapted ``Really Rosie'' (HarperCollins 1986) and other stories of his own for television and video.  Does it compromise the books to offer them up as television?  ``What do you do?'' he says, throwing up his hands. ``Just turn your back and just keep doing books for an elitist group of people that can afford books? Our job is to bring the elemental qualities that mean so much into these new forms. ```Little Bear' is worlds apart from what kids are seeing,'' he says. ``People move slowly. People talk slowly. Hardly anything happens.  ``How many things do you see on television where the parents are in love with each other, or they love their kids? Little Bear gets hugged and squeezed and kissed endlessly. Something as ordinary as that looks a little extraordinary.  ``Whether it's good television, I haven't a clue.''  (Jan Benzel is a staffer for The New York Times.)

Includes a 300-word sidebar. By SANDI KAHN SHELTON c.1996 Working Mother (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  There is no end to the ways children can turn homework into a major ordeal. In fact, on any given night a kid can transform into one of five possible characters to avoid getting schoolwork out of the way, or to at least turn it into a grueling, whiteknuckle event.  _ The Procrastinator: The Procrastinator hits his stride whenever he has a major project due. That's because he waits until the last possible minute to let you know he needs help with it.  He'll saunter in from soccer practice late one afternoon and inform you that he needs to create authentic medieval costumes for a family of clothespins for a special presentation the next day.  He doesn't even mind admitting that, yes, he's known about this assignment for the last six weeks. And while you may spend the next several hours at the sewing machine, furiously stitching up miniature dresses and capes till you're bleary-eyed, he doesn't break a sweat, knowing you won't fail him.  _ The Speed Freak: If you've dealt with the Procrastinator, you might think it a blessing to have a Speed Freak around. He's finished with his homework 10 seconds after he begins, or so it seems.  But don't be fooled. Most of his work is illegible, he didn't do questions nine through 27 because he has to ask the teacher about them and he claims he did his math and social studies homework on the school bus.  Whenever you want to check anything, he gets huffy and says you never trust him and, besides, you're always finding things wrong that the teacher couldn't care less about.  _ The Perfectionist: This kid feels she must do everything perfectly and can't handle it if anything goes wrong.  If she spells one word incorrectly and you gently point it out, she falls apart. Everything feels to her like criticism, and most of it comes from within herself.  This kid doesn't have a problem with settling down to work _ she wants to get it right! _ but all too often, the night grows long while she's still sitting there, erasing her science homework yet again because she thinks her cursive writing is too sloppy.  _ The Forgetter: Beware this character! When you say, ``What homework do you have tonight?'' he'll look blank, scratch his head as if he can't quite translate the meaning of your words, then mumble something about not remembering anything about homework.  _ The Codependent: This kid just loves to tackle her assignments, as long as she doesn't have to do them herself.  She needs constant encouragement along the lines of ``OK, pick up your pencil. Let's look at No. 4.''  Dont think you're going to get away with cooking supper while she cracks the books; she needs your full attention to stay on track.  While any of these characters can drive you crazy, the thing about kids is they may take on different roles at various times throughout their school careers _ so just when you think you've got a grip on a Procrastinator one year, he goes overboard and becomes a Perfectionist the next. WHAT WORKS?  If your child is in first or second grade, obviously you'll have to be more involved in the process than if you have a fifth-grader, but the hassles of homework can be much alleviated if you follow these simple rules:  1. Talk to the teacher.  As most parents know, the beginning of the school year is the time to find out what the teacher's homework policy is _ that is, how frequently homework is assigned, what kind to expect, how long it should take your child to complete assignments, what you should do if it takes longer or shorter than that and what your level of involvement should be.  Naturally, you'll be there to help your child with a tough math problem, to quiz her on spelling words or to help her look up the subject of her history report at the library. But experts agree that beyond this kind of help, students should be responsible for doing their own work and making sure it's done on time.  This doesn't mean that if there is a significant change _ for instance, your child suddenly tells you his teacher isn't giving any homework on weekends _ you shouldn't become involved. In that case, it's time to check in again with the teacher, suggests Ellen Klavan, author of ``Taming the Homework Monster: How to Make Homework a Positive Learning Experience for Your Cbild'' (Poseidon Press, 1992).  2. Create daily homework time.  If homework is done on a haphazard basis, with some nights consisting of an hour of work and other nights nearly nothing, it's hard to establish a predictable routine that will get kids in the habit of settling down to their studies. Therefore, most experts recommend setting aside a regular homework time.  And if the work doesn't get done during the allotted time period, or if it's done too sloppily, calmly announce that you'll have to extend homework time.  Once kids realize there is going to be a regular block of time during which work must be satisfactorily completed, they will most likely do it, says Linda Sonna, author of ``The Homework Plan: A Parent's Guide to helping Kids Excel'' (Berkley, 1994).  3. Make a homework box.  If your kid announces she's off to do her homework, then has to spend a half hour hunting for a pencil with a good eraser or a ruler with centimeter markings, you can bet she's going to get distracted somewhere along the way. Valuable energy, time and good moods can all be squandered in tracking down the little things.  To avoid this, Klavan suggests stocking a homework box _ which can be as simple as a see-through rectangular container _ with plenty of supplies.  ``It makes a child feel competent and powerful to have everything on hand,'' Klavan says.  And don't forget to let your child pick out a homework planner to take to school with him; this handy tool can help him get organized. Planners come in all varieties, but best are the ones that have enough lines for each subject's homework assignment to be written down each day and an adjacent space for the due date _ a big help when it comes to keeping track of long-term projects or assignments.  4. Develop a homework ritual.  Just as you once had to devise bedtime rituals that eased your child from wakefulness to sleep, so it is that you might have to come up with something that signals it's time to hit the books.  Sonna suggests you use straightforward ways to help kids make the transition to quiet study: Announce that homework time will begin shortly and let kids know how many minutes they have to wrap up current activities; stymie protests with a joke or cheery silence; finally, tote the homework box to the work area.  5. Do your own homework.  Some kids work well on their own, of course, but others do better when they have company. In fact, Sonna says, homework seems to go more smoothly for many children when they aren't sent to their rooms to do it in solitary confinement.  If they sit at the kitchen table with you as you write letters, read the paper or pay bills, homework doesn't seem like a punishment _ or a time to go off to their rooms and play.  Sonna notes that this strategy can work especially well with a Codependent _ even though you're not actually doing the work with your child, she will still have the benefit of your reassuring presence.  6. Minimize frustration.  Lyn Corno, professor of education and psychology at Teachers College, Columbia University in New York City, recently supervised a study in which families were videotaped helping their third-graders with homework.  The point? To determine what kind of interaction works best between parents and kids. The researchers discovered that mothers who act as cheerleaders on the sidelines, egging their children on, raise confident kids who are able to tackle even the most difficult homework assignments.  ``When kids were frustrated, the mothers whose kids functioned best didn't focus on the frustration,'' Corno explains. ``Instead of saying `Come on now, let's get this done! Stop whining!' these moms said things like `Sure this is hard, but I know you've done work this hard before. Now let's take a few minutes and look at the problem again.'''  ``After a while, kids start to internalize that message, increasing their confidence and ability to handle challenging homework assignments,'' Corno says. SIDEBAR: GETTING HELP  If you have difficulty working with your child on homework, or if you simply feel your child needs extra help, consider hiring a tutor. Here, tips for finding one:  _ Check with your child's teacher. Some schools have a peer tutoring program, which matches students with kids close to their own age.  _ In many towns, high-school honor students can register as tutors with the Youth Employment Service. Tutors are matched with elementary- and middle-school students who have difficulty in a particular subject.  Rates are about $10 an hour. And kids can get immediate after-school homework help every day if they need it.  _ Child care chains KinderCare and Children's World Learning Centers, both of which have after-school programs, offer informal tutoring help for children who want to do their homework.  Check to see if your child's after-school center has an allotted time for homework and offers help in completing assignments.  _ Contact your local library to see if afterschool programs are available.  ``Many libraries have homework helpers, special volunteers or staff members who are available and willing to help with homework,'' says Therese Bigelow, president of the Association for Library Services to Children, a division of the American Library Association.  ``But even if your library isn't staffed that way, all libraries welcome children and provide a place for study and plenty of reference materials.''  _ Sylvan Learning Systems, which has 580 centers nationwide, doesn't offer specific homework help, but can teach your child the study skills she needs to better complete work on her own.  Kids typically attend one-hour sessions twice a week for 4 to 6 months; costs range from $30 to $40 per hour.  _ Look in the Yellow Pages or the classified section of your local newspaper under ``Tutoring'' for additional leads.

Includes one 200-word sidebar and one 300-word sidebar. By NANCY LLOYD c.1996 Nancy Lloyd Originally appeared in February in Family Circle magazine. (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Your mailbox is probably brimming with unsolicited credit card offers boasting ``Low Interest Rates,'' ``No Annual Fees'' or ``Rebates With Purchase.''  But beware! With hidden fees and convoluted finance charges, you could end up paying hundreds of dollars more than you'd pay with competing cards _ money that would be better spent paying off (or paying down) your credit card balance.  Do you know how best to choose and use a credit card in 1996? Here's a quiz to see how savvy you are, plus tips that can cut your credit card fees.  Question: A typical consumer carries a credit card balance of $1,750 on a card that charges 18 percent interest. How long will it take to pay off the bill, and how much interest will she pay if she makes only the minimum monthly payment _ 2 percent of the outstanding balance?  (a) 3 years, 2 months; $627 interest.  (b) 7 years, 9 months; $1,129 interest.  (c) 16 years, 4 months; $2,189 interest.  (d) 21 years, 11 months; $3,647 interest.  Answer: (d) She'll spend almost 22 years (and $4,000 in interest) to pay it off.  Question: By paying an extra $25 per month, she'll cut the time to pay off her bill by how many years and save how much in interest?  (a) 18 years, 7 months; save $3,059 interest.  (b) 12 years, 2 months; save $2,091 interest.  (c) 5 years, 7 months; save $1,336 interest.  (d) 2 years, 9 months; save $850 interest.  Answer: (a) She'll cut payment time by nearly 19 years and pay off the balance in 3 years, 4 months. Instead of paying $3,647 interest, she'll pay $588.  Question: If you are only one day late with your payment, your credit card issuer may:  (a) assess a $15 late payment fee.  (b) increase the interest rate on your card.  (c) cancel your credit card.  (d) any of the above.  Answer: (d) Fees are rising, and credit card companies are boldly changing terms and canceling cards to punish consumers who don't use their cards the way the issuer would like. Switch to a different card if the terms on yours become unattractive.  Question: Your credit card could be canceled or your interest rate increased if you:  (a) are not using your card enough.  (b) are exceeding your credit limit.  (c) have accepted a credit card from another company.  (d) any of the above.  Answer: (d) Some credit card issuers want to control how much you charge and with whom you do business.  Question: True or false? If you accept a ``preapproved'' credit card offer with a $5,000 credit limit and a 13 percent interest rate, you may only get a card with a limit of $250 and an 18.6 percent interest rate.  Answer: True. Bait-and-switch is common with many unsolicited offers. Typically, you'll get a much lower credit limit and/or a higher interest rate. There are disclaimers in the fine print, but card issuers count on consumers taking whatever card they get.  Tip: Cut up the card before using it, and call the company to close the account.  Question: Credit card issuers can change terms (interest rates, fees, etc.) with:  (a) 15 days' notice.  (b) 20 days' notice.  (c) 1 month's notice.  (d) a year's notice.  Answer: (a) Read the insert that comes with your bill; be prepared to switch to a cheaper card.  Question: True or false? If the card issuer raises the interest rate, it will apply only to new purchases.  Answer: False. Most rate increases also apply to outstanding balances.  Tip: If you make no new purchases, a few states prohibit card issuers from raising rates on your existing balance. But you must notify the card issuer about your plans to discontinue using their card for new purchases.  Question: True or false? Cards that offer rebates (cash back, frequent-flyer miles) based on your card usage are great bargains for most consumers.  Answer: False. Unless you're a heavy credit-card user (charging more than $5,000 per year), fees may exceed benefits and are a good deal only if:  _ You pay off your balance each month. (Because these cards typically charge the highest interest rates allowed, if you don't pay your monthly balance, you'll pay more in finance charges than the rebates are worth.)  _ You use your credit cards frequently. (Most cards charge high annual fees _ often $50 or more _ and so for most consumers, the fees will exceed the value of the rebates.)  Count on long waits for big payoffs (seven years on the General Motors card to get the maximum rebate). And note that awards can change or be rescinded with no notice.  Question: True or false? Taking a cash advance on a credit card that charges 13 percent may cost the equivalent of 40 percent or more in interest and fees.  Answer: True. This is an expensive way to get cash. First, most cards charge a higher interest rate on cash advances than on purchases (and they don't have to disclose the rates in the bold or fine print).  Second, card issuers often assess fees (typically 2 percent of the cash advance), so look for a card that caps cash advance fees at no more than $10.  Third, there is no grace period. Interest typically begins from the date of the cash advance, even if your account is paid in full.  Question: True or false? Department store credit card offers promising ``no finance charges'' for 6 months will charge retroactive interest if you don't pay off the balance within 6 months.  Answer: True. Interest goes back to the date of purchase. The store will forgive the interest if you pay off your balance before the offer expires (6 months, in this example). If not, you'll owe interest from the date of purchase, and store cards often charge the highest interest allowed by law.  Question: True or false? If you carry a balance, you'll pay less in finance charges if you make payments earlier in the month.  Answer: True. Because most finance charges are based on the average daily balance, the sooner you make a payment, the lower your average balance will be and the lower your finance charges will be. (More of your payment will go to reduce your balance, not just to pay interest.)  Question: True or false? If you carry a balance some months, but pay it off other months, your card issuer may charge you interest even on the months when you pay off your bill in full.  Answer: True. Using a financing method called ``two cycle billing,'' card issuers can legally charge retroactive interest during the months you didn't carry a balance.  Be sure to read the terms in the disclosure box on the back of your credit card offer (or in your credit card agreement) and avoid cards that use ``two-cycle billing.''  Question: True or false? If your credit card company sends you a ``skip a payment'' offer, you won't be assessed finance charges for that month.  Answer: False. They send these offers to customers who usually pay their bills in full to get them in the habit of carrying a balance. Finance charges begin the day your payment is late.  Question: True or false? If your credit card is tied to your home's equity and you've missed payments, the bank can foreclose on your house.  Answer: True. For these cards, your credit limit is based not on your credit history, but on the value of your home's equity. If you fall behind on your payments, the bank can foreclose.  Save these cards for important purchases, not restaurant bills. SIDEBAR: FOUR RIP-OFFS TO AVOID  Credit card companies make a lot of money selling additional services. That's why most bills are filled with glossy brochures promoting extras they say cost ``just a few dollars a month.'' If you're offered these, save your money and just say no.  _ Credit Card ``Job Loss'' Protection and/or Disability Coverage: If you lose your job or become disabled, these two extras don't pay off your balance. They make only the minimum monthly payments and are money wasters. Each carries many restrictions before you can collect.  _ Credit Card Life Insurance: This pays off the balance if you die, but it is costly.  Tip: Buy a lower-priced term life insurance policy from an insurer. It costs less and gives your family flexibility.  _ Credit Card Registries: These notify all credit card issuers if your cards are lost or stolen.  Tip: Keep all card numbers in a safe place and report a loss yourself.  _ Gold Credit Cards: These give you frills such as extended warranties, but the snob appeal may cost you dearly. SIDEBAR: TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR DEBT  Carrying a balance on your credit card can be costly. Here are some ways to get on top.  _ Increase your monthly payment as much as possible: Be sure to put the most money toward the card with the highest interest rate. An increase of just $10 per month can make a huge difference.  For help in paying off debt, send for the Debt Zapper Kit from Bankcard Holders of America, a nonprofit credit education group. You'll receive a customized payment schedule, a strategies brochure on how to pay down credit card debt and a list of low-rate and no-fee credit card issuers.  Send a check for $10 (regularly $15) to: Bankcard Holders of America (BHA), 524 Branch Dr., Dept. FC, Salem, Va. 24153.  _ Get a low-rate credit card: For a listing, send $4 to Bankcard Holders of America (some address as above).  _ Check your credit report for errors: Mistakes can keep you from getting a job, a car loan, a credit card and even a mortgage. For a free copy of your report, write to: TRW National Consumer Relations Center, P.O. Box 2350 Chatsworth, Calif. 91313-2350.  Send only your name, complete address (along with a copy of a utility bill or driver's license), spouse's first name, addresses for the past five years, social security number and birth date.  _ Call your bank's ``retention department'' and ask for better terms: Many banks will lower your interest rate or waive fees in order to keep your business. Even if you're behind on your payments, they may offer better terms to keep you from defaulting on your debt.  You'll have the most clout if you ask your current card issuer to meet or beat an offer you have in hand from another company.

By CINDY PEARLMAN World rights except Chicago (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Every acting job brings its own challenges, and for Dennis Quaid ``Dragonheart'' posed some unique obstacles.  First and foremost was his co-star, whose acting technique can best be described as wooden. Literally.  It had come to this: Quaid, who has co-starred with legends such as Meryl Streep, Jessica Lange and Kevin Costner, was playing opposite a stick with a tennis ball on the end.  The problem was that the 43-foot-long dragon (voice by Sean Connery) would be dubbed into the film through special computer effects after Quaid had filmed his scenes. But Quaid still needed to know where to focus his performance.  ``For every scene that had a dragon, a stunt guy would run around with tennis balls on sticks so I would know where to look,'' he says with a smile. ``Believe me, I've worked with actors who have given me less!''  In ``Dragonheart,'' opening May 31, Quaid plays a disillusioned dragon-slayer in the service of an evil king (David Thewlis). Draco the dragon is his unlikely ally, a sophisticated monster with a voice as cultured as ... well, as cultured as James Bond.  Call them the ultimate odd couple.  But even with movie magic, this was a tricky film to make. Originally, Connery's voice was prerecorded for Quaid to interact with.  ``It didn't work,'' Quaid admits. ``It was so fake, like someone was pushing the play button. So we got rid of the speakers.''  Next, an actor was hired to read the dragon's lines on the set.  ``That didn't work either,'' Quaid says. ``It was sort of a thankless job for the poor fella.  ``So (director) Rob Cohen became the voice of Draco. He would stand in front of those tennis balls and do the lines. He actually did a fantastic job. He had such a passion for it to begin with and he even did it in sort of a Scottish lilt.''  The next hurdle was Quaid's own voice.  ``Actually, I was very concerned with my voice,'' Quaid says. ``Sean Connery is one of the great voices. And then we had all these English people on the film with cool accents. Where was my voice?  ``I wanted to do something that wasn't American _ sort of a combination of something. Just so you would say, `What the hell is he trying to do?'''  Finally, there was the shoot itself, on location in Slovakia.  ``This movie was like joining the army or the circus,'' Quaid says. ``It was mass confusion. Here you have an action movie with big stunts, no co-star and a ton of special effects. Even my horse was a pain. It was a Croatian horse who didn't know English. He did know what `action' meant _ then he would go berserk.''  One scene placed Quaid on horseback under a real waterfall.  ``The water is blinding and I'm in armor, which is weighing me down,'' he recalls. ``The next thing I know I'm underwater and the horse is under me, lifting me up and carrying me through the water.''  The capper was when the processing lab twice mishandled the film. The scene had to be reshot twice times.  ``I think they basically tried to murder me on this shoot,'' says Quaid, who also sustained a sword slash and a broken finger at various stages of filming.  Off the set, he reports, life in Slovakia was anything but stimulating.  ``The only thing worse than working in Slovakia is having a day off in Slovakia,'' Quaid says. ``There's no TV. I actually read the Bible from cover to cover. I read the Koran. And a lot of Joseph Campbell. I read a whole lot about the Holy Grail. I immersed myself in mythology.''  It's hard to picture Quaid poring over the Bible. Not long ago, he was one of Hollywood's most notorious wild men, devoted to drink, drugs and partying.  ``I think I've mellowed,'' the 42-year-old actor says. ``Now I'm a wild guy in a mellow life. In my head, I'm the same guy I've always been. It's just that a wilder life doesn't appeal to me anymore.  ``Now I go to bed at 10:30 and I think that's late. A wild night is staying up for Letterman.''  He credits his reformation to his wife, actress Meg Ryan, and especially to their 4-year-old son, Jack Henry.  ``I'm more tired from hanging out with him than after a night of partying,'' he says.  ``Sure, you still have people who say, `You were much more fun when you were out there,''' he says. ``(But) I had my full meal of that. You know, it was fun, but there are three stages of that type of fun: One, it's fun. Two, it's not so fun. Three, it's a problem.''  Quaid hopes that a more responsible lifestyle will help restart a career that has been bumpy of late. But after nearly 20 years in Hollywood _ the Houston native debuted in ``September 30, 1955'' (1977) _ Quaid has become philosophical.  ``I know I better look out _ this could all disappear tomorrow,'' he says. ``I get the same question from reporters all the time. They go, `Dennis, your last 18 movies didn't do so well _ now what?' And I say, `Look, my last 10 movies didn't do so well. Get it straight.'''  Recently, Quaid has tended to get better reviews than his movies. The bleak ``Flesh and Bone'' (1993) won plaudits for Quaid as an itinerant vending-machine manager and for his wife Ryan as a troubled woman whom he picks up on the road. But the film vanished at the box office.  Quaid's performance as Doc Holliday _ a role for which he lost 42 pounds _ was considered the best thing about ``Wyatt Earp'' (1994), Lawrence Kasdan's Western epic starring Costner, but again the movie didn't live up to its performances.  ``Flesh and Bone'' was a pet film of Quaid's, and its rapid disappearance from theaters dispirited him.  ``That failure hurt, because Meg and I did that project together and it was real acting. It was one of the most challenging parts of my life, and I wanted people to see it.''  After attending the University of Houston, Quaid began a career which has included commercial hits such as ``The Big Easy'' (1987), in which he played a sexy, good-natured crooked cop, and enduring favorites such as ``Breaking Away'' (1979) and ``The Right Stuff'' (1983). He also had a supporting role in the esteemed ``Postcards from the Edge'' (1990), in which he played Meryl Streep's shiftless lover.  There have been flops as well _ ``Jaws 3D'' (1983) comes to mind, as well as Quaid's energetic-but-bizarre performance as Jerry Lee Lewis in ``Great Balls of Fire'' (1989).  He's also made three movies with Ryan: ``Innerspace'' (1987), when they first met, ``DOA'' (1988) and ``Flesh and Bone.'' None was a big hit.  ``We talk about working together again, but not for the gimmick,'' Quaid says. ``It would have to be just right.''  There is no competitiveness between the two, he says, even though recently Ryan's stardom has eclipsed his own.  ``She's a girl and I'm a guy,'' Quaid says. ``I'm just really proud of her work.''  With his brother, Randy Quaid, it's a different story, he says.  ``Oh, we're completely jealous of each other.'' Then he laughs. ``I'm just kidding. Randy and I don't even talk about movies. We keep it to, `Whaddya doing now? I'm doing this ... oh, that's great. So how about you play in the outfield this time?'  ``Actually, he works so much that it hurts me to keep up with him.''  Not that Dennis Quaid isn't keeping busy. He recently finished filming ``Going West,'' in which he plays an FBI agent tracking a serial killer.  It's the lead role, but Quaid says that he now sees himself as a character actor.  ``I read stuff like, `He's a character actor trapped in a leading man's body,''' he says. ``I'm glad I've passed my sex-symbol days. The leading man is sort of boring to me. I started out in theater, and playing real characters always felt good to me. It was like real acting.  ``The work is just so much more interesting now. And I'm having more fun with the acting. This whole career even feels different for me now. I don't take it as seriously, even though I give it everything I've got.'' c.1996 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.) ------------------------------------------------- </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960520.0386 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-ROBIN-WRIGHT-IN-`MOLL-FLANDERS'-PAGEUP-ART-NYTSF) </DATELINE> <TEXT> ROBIN WRIGHT, FROM `FORREST GUMP' TO `MOLL FLANDERS' (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's PageUp Lifestyle and Entertainment Package.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Robin Wright in a scene from ``Moll Flanders.'' By IAN SPELLING (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  For an actress who professes indifference to fame or commercial success, Robin Wright has a strange way of going about her life.  In 1994, she co-starred in ``Forrest Gump,'' one of the highest-grossing films ever. This past April, she married the high-profile actor/director Sean Penn. And on June 14, she will open in the title role of a major-studio historical epic, MGM's ``Moll Flanders.''  ``Well, you can't always plan things in life,'' Wright says, laughing. ``Sometimes, life just happens.''  The actress smiles broadly as she scrunches deeper into a cozy, oversize chair at a Manhattan hotel. She's in town to promote ``Moll Flanders,'' and if she's feeling conflicted about being in the spotlight, it doesn't show.  ``Moll Flanders'' casts Wright as a put-upon, penniless 18th-century Englishwoman who turns to prostitution to survive. It is loosely based on Daniel Defoe's 1721 novel ``The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders.''  As Moll's story unfolds, she encounters Mrs. Allworthy (Stockard Channing), a powerful madam; Hibble (Morgan Freeman), Allworthy's servant and Moll's ally; and a mysterious artist (John Lynch), with whom she falls deeply in love and enjoys a fulfilling if ill-fated relationship that results in the birth of Moll's greatest joy _ a daughter named Flora.  ``I know it's a cliche, but the film is about an indomitable spirit,'' Wright says. ``She's a woman who won't be broken, who believes in herself (and in) what she wants, and she does what she does to obtain it.  ``That involves this man she loves, this child she bears and coming out of the drudgeries of life.  ``It's a wonderful journey she goes on.''  It was an emotional journey the likes of which Wright had never experienced in her own life. That fact made Moll a challenge to play.  ``It was so hard to see any of myself in her initially,'' she says, running her fingers through her short, brownish-blond hair. ``But I discovered that I could relate to her conviction about living life whether you're ready to or not.  ``I felt that way when I had kids. It tested me, but I just had to prevail.  ``Moll goes through that experience too.''  Wright doesn't consider herself a ``research person'' and didn't read Defoe's novel or view the earlier film version, ``The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders'' (1965), which starred Kim Novak. And while she adopted a British accent, Wright didn't think it worthwhile to obsess over other period details.  ``On the set I'd say, `Oh, by the way, did the women sit cross-legged?''' she says. ``I care more about the emotional aspects ... What we felt as human beings was the same then as now. We haven't changed that much.''  ``Moll Flanders'' faces a tough box-office challenge against summer blockbusters such as ``Twister'' and ``Mission Impossible.'' Chances are, this won't be another ``Forrest Gump.'' But then again, no one ever imagined ``Gump'' would be ``Gump.''  ``It never crossed our minds that it would be so big,'' Wright says of the Oscar-winning drama in which she co-starred as the flower-child love of Forrest's life. ``What we laughed about when we were shooting it was, `What are people going to think of this one?'  ``It was so nebulous, odd, quirky. We didn't know if people would even get it.  ``I guess they did, everybody in their own way.''  ``Gump'' was Wright's reward for delivering solid performances in such imperfect or little-seen films as ``The Princess Bride'' (1987), ``State of Grace'' (1990), ``Toys'' (1992) and ``The Playboys'' (1992). It was also light years beyond the Dallas-born actress's earliest credits, a role at age 14 in the TV series ``The Yellow Rose,'' and later the part of Kelly Capwell on the soap opera ``Santa Barbara.''  The ``Gump'' phenomenon resulted in Wright receiving ``more material, better material,'' including the Sean Penn-directed drama, ``The Crossing Guard'' (1995). It was also a pivotal factor in the 30-year-old Wright being deemed bankable enough to carry ``Moll Flanders.''  ``Obviously, I wouldn't have gotten to do `Moll Flanders' if it hadn't been for `Gump,''' she says. ``So I'll always be grateful for that film.''  These days, Wright is also grateful that personal matters seem to be on an upswing. After seven years together and one apart _ they were separated for most of 1995 and part of 1996 _ Wright and Penn finally tied the knot on April 27. (They have two children, 5-year-old Dylan and 2-year-old Hopper.)  Penn had won what is, for him, some rare positive press coverage for having skipped this year's Academy Awards ceremonies _ despite receiving a Best Actor nomination for ``Dead Man Walking'' (1995) _ to be by Wright's side at a hospital, where she was staying after being felled by gallstones. Shortly afterward, the two married.  ``I wasn't too surprised that it finally happened, because I sort of initiated it,'' Wright says _ admitting that it was she who actually popped the question. Any more details, however, are strictly private, she says.  ``We'd been together so long. We just sort of fit and it felt right,'' Wright says.  ``He's the most loyal person I've ever met, and his investment in a person is so complete that you feel very secure. We're great friends and he's an unbelievable father, a very special human being.  ``He's multifaceted and so talented. He's also very heavy to be around, but it's worth it.''  Now that she and Penn are back together, Wright knows that press curiosity is unavoidable.  ``That's a concern,'' she says. ``It's annoying and invasive, but it's part of the game.  ``It's a burden I'd prefer not to have, and every time some photographer chases after us or someone tries to get five minutes with me in the ladies room, I get frustrated.  ``But I'll find a way to deal with it.''  In her next film, ``Loved,'' Wright plays a character who has to deal with an even more tempestuous lover _ in this case, a former boyfriend who has been charged with murder in the death of a later girlfriend. William Hurt co-stars as the prosecuting attorney in the courtroom drama.  While Wright sounds pleased with ``Loved,'' which will be released later this year, she's particularly excited about her next film, ``She's De-Lovely.''  ``Sean and I are acting together in that,'' she says eagerly. ``It's a John Cassavetes script, and his son Nick is going to direct it.  ``It's about crazy love between two wackos who are made for each other.''  She cracks up again. Clearly, the irony is not lost on Wright. c.1996 Ian Spelling  (Ian Spelling is a New York-based free-lance writer.) ------------------------------------------------- </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960520.0387 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-CORRECTION-ENIGMA-OF-ENDOMETRIOSIS-PAGEUP-NYTSF) </DATELINE> <TEXT> THE ENIGMA OF ENDOMETRIOSIS: A PAINFUL DISORDER CAN BE TREATED By GREG BEAUBIEN c.1995 Chicago Sun Times (Correction note, the newspaper in which this piece originally appeared, The Chicago Sun Times, is reported accurately in this version.) Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  For 20 years, Kathleen Klages suffered from painful periods. By the time she was 30, they had become sheer torture.  ``On the first day of my period I couldn't go to work,'' she recalls. ``I'd turn white, break into a sweat and double over in pain.''  People told her not to worry, that menstrual pain was normal. But it turned out that her cramps were caused by endometriosis, a disease in which the tissue that lines the uterus grows outside the uterine cavity.  Endometriosis afflicts an estimated 5 million women in the United States, and probably many millions more worldwide. And though medical science has progressed in its understanding of the disorder, the cause of endometriosis is still a mystery.  ``It remains an enigmatic disease,'' says Dr. Edmond Confino, a reproductive endocrinologist at Chicago's Northwestern Memorial Hospital. ``We agree that it's treatable, but in many cases incurable.''  Several theories attempt to explain the cause of endometriosis. One theory is that tissue from the uterus escapes into the pelvic cavity during menstruation.  Another speculates that a defect in embryonic tissues causes some women to be born with endometriosis.  Still another theory suggests that environmental pollutants such as a dioxin may play a role in the disease.  Endometrial growths _ also called implants, lesions, nodules or tumors _ can form inside a woman's fallopian tubes, on the outside of her uterus or ovaries, and even on her pelvis, bladder or intestines. Growths sometimes appear on lungs, arms or thighs, but only rarely.  Like the endometrium (the tissue that lines the uterus), endometrial growths are fueled by estrogen, a female sex hormone. But unlike the endometrium _ which builds up, then sheds during the monthly menstrual cycle _ endometrial growths have no way to leave the body. Instead they become inflamed, causing pain, internal bleeding and the formation of scar tissue.  Sometimes the growths rupture, spreading endometriosis to other areas of the body. Depending on where it forms, scar tissue can accumulate and block the reproductive organs or intestines. Scar tissue can also interfere with the function of the bladder.  Endometriosis usually strikes women in their 30's and 40's but can occur much earlier. Symptoms of the disease include painful menstruation and sex, heavy menstrual bleeding and infertility. Painful bowel movements and other intestinal problems can also occur.  According to the Endometriosis Association, a research and education organization based in Milwaukee, such symptoms tend to worsen over time but sometimes follow a pattern of remission and recurrence.  About 40 percent of women with endometriosis experience some degree of infertility, according to RESOLVE, a national consumer organization for people trying to have children. But, like other aspects of the disease, the relationship between endometriosis and infertility isn't fully understood.  One theory is that scar tissue blocks the fallopian tubes and prevents eggs from coming into contact with sperm.  Women with endometriosis can have children, but they might need help from technology such as in vitro fertilization (IVF).  ``It really depends on the woman's age and the condition of her ovaries,'' Confino says. ``If she's 40 and has severe endometriosis, her chances of having a baby are dismal unless she has assistance.''  Klages, who's now 33 and works as a scrub nurse, managed to have a baby despite severe endometriosis. She and her husband, Gary, had been trying to conceive for several years before she was diagnosed with the disease.  She later endured three corrective surgeries and two miscarriages. The couple were on the verge of giving up when she became pregnant again.  ``It was real scary,'' Klages says. ``We were worried about another miscarriage. We asked ourselves, `How long can we keep doing this? Maybe we have to accept that having a baby is not meant to be.'''  But in early 1995, Klages gave birth to her son, Garrett. And in November she learned she was pregnant again.  Infertility is a major issue with endometriosis, but for some women, pain is the bigger problem.  ``I see just as many endometriosis patients with pain concerns as with reproductive concerns,'' says Dr. Charles Miller, a reproductive endocrinologist at the Center for Human Reproduction in Chicago.  ``It can totally incapacitate women (and keep them) from their jobs and families.''  Mary Lou Ballweg is the president of the Endometriosis Association. In 1979, after years of vibrant health, she became ridden with the disease.  ``I had to crawl to the bathroom,'' she said in a recent interview. ``The major accomplishment of my day was to take a shower.''  But fortunately for victims of endometriosis, medical and surgical treatments of the disorder have significantly improved.  ``We defined the disease much better in the '80s, and there have been a couple of treatment advances in the '90s which are very exciting for patients with endometriosis,'' Miller says.  Using an outpatient surgical technique called laparoscopy, doctors can remove endometrial growths without making a large incision or leaving an obvious scar.  The laparoscope is a long, slender device that enters a woman's abdomen through a small incision _ about half an inch long _ and allows the surgeon to see what's inside. The surgeon then uses a second slender instrument to remove endometrial growths.  But even laparoscopy doesn't always solve the problem of endometriosis. Recurrence of the disease forces some women to have multiple surgeries over a period of years.  Ballweg had a hysterectomy and her endometriosis still returned.  ``Even the most aggressive surgical approach won't cure everything,'' Confino says. ``It doesn't address the cause of the disease.''  He cautions that surgery should be used judiciously, because of the risks of scarring and damage to the internal organs.  In addition to surgical advances, drug treatments for endometriosis have also improved. Lupron, for example, can shrink endometrial growths by temporarily interrupting estrogen production.  But the drug is notorious for its side effects.  ``Lupron slams you into menopause,'' says Kathleen Fitzgerald, a 42-year-old nurse who's long suffered from endometriosis and today runs a support group at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.  Within three weeks of starting her Lupron prescription, she was having 25 hot flashes a day, plus night sweats, insomnia, headaches, mood swings and depression. Lupron can also cause vaginal and skin dryness, and shrinkage of the breasts.  According to Miller, a healthy diet can help reduce the spread of endometriosis. He recommends that women with the disease eat plenty of organically grown fruits and vegetables.  But before any kind of treatment can begin, women must first secure an accurate diagnosis. And that can be challenging, because some male doctors still don't take women's health complaints seriously.  Fitzgerald, for example, went to a succession of doctors before she found one who gave her a laparoscopy and diagnosed her endometriosis.  ``The other ones told me it was all in my head,'' she says.  According to Ballweg, it takes women with endometriosis an average of 10 to 15 years to be diagnosed. Doctors often tell them that the pain is normal, that having a baby will make it disappear or that the pain is imaginary and the woman should see a psychiatrist.  ``It's a very tough disease to treat,'' Ballweg says. ``Don't leave it up to your doctor. Get active. You need a specialist and you need to do your homework.''

Includes a 100-word sidebar. By DOROTHY FOLTZ GRAY c.1996 McCall's (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) (Editor's note: Names in case studies have been changed to protect privacy.)  Every six weeks or so, my husband's hair gets too long.  ``You need a haircut,'' I say charmlessly. This ensures that it will be at least two more weeks before he goes to the barber. Because, of course, I am nagging, and he hates it _ and so would I if he did it to me.  I'm not alone in my habit of constant complaining. Venture into the dark, dusty corners of even the best marriages and you're bound to find a subject that provokes one partner _ usually the wife _ to nag.  While some husbands complain just as much as some wives, when men do it, it isn't called nagging, explains Dr. Harriet Lerner, author of Dance of Anger (HarperCollins, 1989). In fact it usually isn't called anything at all.  Once it has begun, nagging takes on a life of its own: Typically the wife picks at a problem and the husband quietly sulks. Kathleen M. Galvin, a professor of communications studies at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., calls this pattern a nag-withdraw cycle.  It isn't pretty and, more importanty, it's ineffective. But like the Energizer bunny, the habit just keeps going. THE HIDDEN MESSAGE OF NAGGING  Why doesn't ceaseless complaining get you what you really want? According to Galvin, the reason is that serial whining masks a person's true feelings.  ``Nagging is a repetitive pattern of reminding, complaining and checking up on the other person,'' she explains. ``In most cases these indirect messages are an attempt to communicate something else.''  Let`s say your husband has failed to repair the garage door for the past two months. When you complain about it, you might really be asking ``Why can't you be the handyman and provider I want you to be?''  Kate Brandon, an Illinois lawyer who's been married for 10 years, frequently nags her husband James, to come to dinner.  ``I know he's going to be late,'' she says, ``so I always call him early.''  What Kate is after, she says, is a shared family meal with their three children. But as Galvin points out, the message Kate may truly want James to hear is ``Without me, we'd never spend time together with the kids.''  Yet as even Kate herself admits, this nagging rarely succeeds in getting James to dinner any faster. More commonly, her complaints receive a testy response: ``I'll be there when I get there!'' WHY IT'S SO TOUGH TO ASK FOR WHAT YOU WANT  The solution to nagging might seem to be obvious. If something's on your mind, just say it, instead of dancing around the point.  For many women, however, this isn't so easy. In fact, Lerner says, ``the unpleasant reality is that women often don't know how to be heard in their own marriage.''  ``Women have been trained that it's not appropriate to demand something,'' explains Joan Shapiro, a Denver psychiatrist who is the author of ``Men: A Translation for Women'' (Avon, 1993).  ``And if we've watched our mothers nag our fathers, many of us grow up thinking that's how to ask for what we want.''  Of course, some women have no problem asking for exactly what they want _ and asking again (and again) when they don't get it. This constant wave of demands may paralyze some men.  ``Being nagged by your wife is like being back home with Mom on your case, and it's not very sexy,'' says Ethan Hall, a teacher in Knoxville, Tenn., who's been married for 12 years.  And like the little boys they once were, many husbands either ignore the request completely or comply _ but they do a sloppy, haphazard job as a way of ``getting back at'' their wife. BREAKING THE COMPLAINT CYCLE  When a wife feels that she is always unheard and her husband feels defensive, a poor communication pattern may have developed that can become a problem itself, says Maggie Scarf, author of ``Intimate Worlds: Life Inside the Family'' (Random House, 1995).  ``Very often, people just do what they do and don't notice that it isn't working. They keep trying to solve the same problem in the same old way.''  Experts agree that the first step toward putting a stop to nagging is figuring out what you absolutely can and can't tolerate in terms of consistent mealtime hours or help with child care, housework and yard chores.  ``Decide what's most important,'' Lerner advises, ``and then drop the rest. If your husband is getting a constant onslaught, he probably won't listen to any of it.''  For Barbara Bobrick, 35, a finance officer in Colorado Springs, Colo., the medical journals and newsletters her husband Joseph, a pediatrician, constantly left strewn about their living room definitely qualified as a bottom-line battle.  ``I'm not a neat freak,'' she explains, ``but Joseph's housekeeping was just shy of chaotic. And I couldn't throw out any of the magazines because Joseph said he needed them for work.''  The solution: ``We talked through what my needs were'' _ to have things organized _ ``and what his were'' _ to avoid neat people's rules _ ``and tried to compromise,'' Barbara says. ``Now I put up with his papers all over the living room for a week; after that, he's got to store them at his office.''  But don't expect one conversation to work miracles. After all, your goal is to forge an entirely new style of communication.  Scarf suggests doing the following exercise weekly for a month and then repeating it as often as necessary: Pick an hour when you can spend uninterrupted time alone with your spouse. Decide in advance who will go first and, for the first half hour, have one person listen while the other one talks. When that half hour is up, switch roles.  Instead of discussing whatever problems the two of you may be having, however, focus on your personal hopes and concerns. You may also talk about your goals for your relationship.  Even though you aren't directly addressing the issues that make you nag, this exercise can help you understand and tolerate each other's behavior better. COOLING DOWN HOT PROBLEMS  Some couples may find that their negative patterns are so embedded _ and explosive _ that they need help turning off their anger.  ``We didn't nag and withdraw,'' says Mary Callahan, a homemaker and the mother of two, speaking ruefully of her four-year marriage to Rob, a bank supervisor. ``We nagged and screamed. Not just about big things, such as how I wanted him to help more with the kids, but about little things as well, such as fixing the storm windows.''  Mary and Rob eventually went to a marriage counselor who suggested that they each make a list of what they liked to do around the house and then compare it with a list of what needed to get done each week.  Though neither partner necessarily received all the tasks on his or her ``good'' list, this ``divide and conquer'' strategy (which the counselor refereed) helped Mary and Rob learn to assign household jobs more fairly.  ``Actually,'' Mary says, ``the lists were enlightening. I realized that I like doing the fix-it tasks that I was always yelling about. And Rob likes doing dishes, which I hate.''  Unfortunately, there's no quick trick to clear communication _ but a sense of humor and some perspective help. As Lisa Klein, a sales executive in Portland, Maine, explains, if anything ever happened to her husband, Peter, whose sloppy bureau drives her nuts, she'd actually miss his grungy mess.  ``I wouldn't clean it, not for a while,'' she says. ``But eventually I'd have to _ for health reasons.'' SIDEBAR: HOW MUCH DO WOMEN NAG?  A McCall's magazine survey asked 300 married readers whether or not they nagged their husband and, if so, about what. The results?  _ Just over half (52 percent) admitted nagging their husband at least once a week.  _ Nearly a quarter (22 percent) nagged at least once a day.  _ Eighty-nine percent of readers under 45 said they occasionally nagged their partner, compared with only 60 percent of those over 45.  _ Readers were most likely to nag their husband about doing housework (37 percent), home repairs (28 percent) and yard work (12 percent); and about remembering special events (almost 10 percent).

By MICHAEL CASTLEMAN Excerpted from ``Nature's Cures'' by Michael Castleman, Rodale Books. c.1996 Michael Castleman (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Unlike vision and hearing, the sense of smell is fully functional at birth. Olfaction, it seems from tests on infants, is at the root of parent and child bonding. Research also suggests that the subtle brain chemistry of olfaction plays a key role in sexual attraction.  But these are only a few of the findings.  ``There's a whole world out there at the tip of our noses,'' says Alan R. Hirsch, neurological director of the Smell and Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago.  ``We found that the sense of smell can evoke powerful memories and change people's perceptions and behavior. But until recently, olfaction has been largely ignored by the scientific community,'' he says.  A study at Duke University explored how fragrant aromas might sweeten the interpersonal atmosphere on New York City subways. They had a subtle scent piped into one car and then compared riders' behavior with that of riders in an adjacent, unscented car.  In the scented car, pushing, shoving and other aggressive acts dropped by as much as 40 percent. OILS WITH SPECIAL POWERS  What are these aromas with such powerful potential to affect people's mood and health?  Although they're called essential oils, the term oil is somewhat misleading. The oils used in aromatherapy do not feel as oily as, say, olive oil. But chemically they are oils. They do not mix with water but mix well with vegetable oils.  Essential oils are also known as volatile oils (from the Latin word for flying, volatilis). Open a vial of essential oil and some of the molecules fly off as a gas, which is how they get into your nose and smell aromatic.  Plant oils are incredibly concentrated. For a chamomile bath, for example, it might take several handfuls of fresh or dried flowers but only a few drops of chamomile oil.  One drop of an essential oil is the medical equivalent of 1 ounce of its parent plant material, according to Marcel Lavabre, co-founder of the American Aromatherapy Association, owner of Aroma Vera, an essential oil company in Culver City, Calif., and author of ``The Aromatherapy Workbook'' (Healing Arts Press, 1990).  Essential oils can be extracted from their parent plants in several ways, but the typical process used is distillation, which scientific historians believe was developed in ancient Egypt to produce aromatic embalming fluids.  Depending on the plant, oil comes from specialized oil or resin cells, glandular tissue, pockets within scales or intercellular spaces. There isn't much of it in each plant, and the harder it is to obtain, the more expensive it becomes.  No matter which part of the plant they come from, essential oils have the same purposes _ to keep the plant from becoming dehydrated and to protect it from predators, particularly microorganisms.  Because they have an antimicrobial mission, all essential oils are antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal _ attributes that make them quite useful to us humans as antiseptics.  Professional aromatherapists use up to 300 oils, but most people can meet their needs with less than two dozen.  Essential oils must be stored carefully in brown or dark vials away from heat, light and dampness. When not in use, keep containers tightly closed. Aromatherapists differ on the shelf life of essential oils, but most say they last for at least two years. HEALING WITH AROMATHERAPY  Research demonstrating aromatherapy's effectiveness is not as plentiful as studies of medicinal herb preparations given as teas or in capsules. But several studies _ and a great deal of clinical experience by aromatherapists _ suggest that essential oils can be effective for a variety of ailments, especially those that involve mind and body interactions, such as the following:  _ Compulsive eating. Weight management researchers have shown that many obese people often eat not because they're hungry but because they feel anxious.  Susan Schiffman, professor of psychology at Duke University, teaches relaxation techniques to participants in the Duke weight-loss program. At the same time, she has them inhale whiffs of apricot oil, so they associate the aroma with feeling calm.  Then they carry a vial of the oil with them and inhale it whenever they feel anxious, in effect substituting apricot's relaxing effect for their former stress reliever, eating.  Schiffman claims her aromatherapy technique has helped control compulsive eating in more than half of those who have adopted the technique.  _ Menopausal problems. Schiffman has also discovered that pleasant floral scents help women cope with the emotional symptoms of menopause: tension, anxiety, depression, fatigue and confusion.  Pleasant aromas appear to suppress negative emotions and allow more positive emotions to express themselves.  The following recommendations come from ``The Complete Book of Essential Oils'' (New World Library, 1991) by British aromatherapist Valerie Ann Worwood, ``The Aromatherapy Workbook'' by Marcel Lavabre and The Aromatherapy Book (North Atlantic Books, 1992) by San Francisco herbalist Jeanne Rose.  _ Abrasions, cuts, burns and scrapes: After washing with soap and water, apply 1 to 3 drops of lavender oil or tea tree oil to the wound or to a bandage. Reapply the oil twice a day until the area is substantially healed.  _ Athlete's foot: Mix 2 drops of lavender oil and 1 drop of tea tree oil. Using a cotton swab, apply it between the toes. Then dilute 5 drops of tea tree oil and 1 drop of lemon oil in 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil. Use this to massage the entire foot.  _ Bee stings: Apply 1 drop of chamomile oil three times a day for two days.  _ Blisters: Never open a blister. Apply 1 drop of lavender oil and 1 drop of chamomile oil.  _ Chapped lips: Add 2 drops of chamomile oil and 2 drops of geranium oil to 2 teaspoons of aloe vera gel. Apply to the lips.  _ The common cold: Add 3 drops of lemon oil, 2 drops of thyme oil, 2 drops of tea tree oil and 1 drop of eucalyptus oil to a hot bath. Lie back and inhale deeply.  _ Cough: Add 3 drops of eucalyptus oil and 2 drops of thyme oil to 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil. Massage this mixture into the neck and chest.  The old standby, Vicks Vaporub, is essentially an aromatherapy product. Its decongestant vapors come from eucalyptus oil.  _ Depression: Add to a bath 15 drops of geranium oil, 10 drops of bergamot and 5 drops of lavender.  _ Dry skin: Add 10 drops of geranium oil, 10 drops of chamomile oil, 5 drops of lemon oil and 5 drops of lavender oil to 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil. Massage into the affected area.  _ Fear of flying: Place 1 drop of lavender oil and one drop of geranium oil in a plastic sandwich bag. Keep the bag in your pocket or purse. Whenever you feet anxious, open it for a moment and inhale.  _ Hay fever: Begin by placing 1 drop of chamomile oil and 1 drop of lemon oil into a tissue, then inhale. If this does not provide sufficient relief, experiment with combinations of these two oils plus the oils of peppermint, clove, rosemary, lavender and geranium.  _ Headache: Massage around the temples, the base of the skull and along the hairline with 3 drops of lavender oil and 1 drop of peppermint oil blended with 1 drop of vegetable oil. Or substitute 1 drop of chamomile, rosemary or clove oil for the peppermint.  _ Hiccups: Place 1 drop of chamomile oil in a small brown paper bag. Hold it over your nose and mouth and breathe deeply through your nose. You can also try lemon oil.  _ Insomnia: Add to a bath a mixture of 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and 30 drops of any combination of the following oils: chamomile, clary-sage, lemon, marjoram, sandalwood and valerian.  _ Menstrual cramps: Mix 10 drops of peppermint oil, 10 drops of nutmeg, 5 drops of lavender and 5 drops of cypress with 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Massage the abdomen, lower back and shoulders.  _ Premenstrual irritability: Add to a bath 7 to 9 drops of the following oils in the combination that works best for you: bergamot, chamomile, clary-sage, geranium, jonquil and nutmeg.  _ Sinus infection: Place the following mixture on a tissue and inhale: 2 drops of rosemary oil, 1 drop of geranium and 1 drop of eucalyptus.  _ Stress: Mix 5 drops of grapefruit oil, 4 drops of cypress and 2 drops of geranium with 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil. Inhale the aroma or massage the face, neck, shoulders, chest and back. SIDEBAR: HOW GOOD IS YOUR SENSE OF SMELL?  A good deal of the healing potential of aromatherapy relies on your sense of smell. If your sense of smell is impaired, this might not be the best kind of therapy for you.  To find out how well you sense smells, take this simple test, created by Dr. Alan R. Hirsch, neurological director of the Smell and Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago. Part I  For every yes answer, give yourself 1 point. For every no, give yourself no points.  1. Have you ever been told (or gotten the feeling) that you're wearing too much perfume?  2. In general, do you think foods taste blander than they used to?  3. Lately, have you been adding more salt, spices and sugar to your food?  4. Has coffee been tasting especially bitter lately? (Coffee's bitter taste is offset by its sweet smell. But as olfactory acuity declines, coffee tastes increasingly bitter.)  5. Do other people notice scents that you don't?  6. When you're cooking, has the smoke alarm ever activated before you noticed that something was burning?  7. When you're at a service station, do you fail to notice the smell of gasoline?  8. When shining your shoes, do you fail to smell the polish?  9. At the movies, do you never notice the aroma of popcorn?  10. When you first turn on a gas stove, do you fail to smell the gas? Part II  You'll need a partner for these questions so you can take the smell-and-taste tests blind. For every yes, give yourself no points. For every no, give yourself 1 point.  11. Cut sliver-thin slices of apple and onion. Close your eyes and have your partner place one or the other on your tongue. Can you identify it? (Apples and onions taste the same to people with an impaired sense of smell.)  12. Place a scoop of vanilla ice cream in one bowl and a scoop of chocolate in another. Close your eyes and have your partner feed you a spoonful of one or the other. Can you identify it?  13. Close your eyes and have your partner spray one tissue with a scented deodorant and another with an unscented deodorant. Open your eyes and smell the tissues. Can you tell which is which?  14. Cut some bubble gum and a stick of fruit-flavored gum (not mint-flavored) into similar-size pieces. Close your eyes and have your partner give you one. Can you identify the flavor?  15. Place an eraser in one cup and a piece of Swiss cheese in another. Close your eyes and have your partner wave one or the other under your nose. Can you tell which is which? Scoring  0-1 point. Congratulations. Your sense of smell is fine. To keep it that way, don't smoke, and be sure to wear a seat belt in cars and a helmet whenever you ride a bike. Smoking impairs olfaction, and head injuries are a leading cause of olfactory impairment.  Also get enough smell-supporting zinc by eating whole grains, fruits, beans and leafy green vegetables.  2-15 points. Your sense of smell may not be up to snuff. Consult a physician to rule out illness and a zinc deficiency. If your doctor says you're healthy and you have no nutritional deficiencies, don't smoke, and prevent head injuries. SIDEBAR: WARNINGS FOR AROMATHERAPY  Medicines should only be taken in the prescribed manner at the recommended dosage, and essential oils are no exception. They should not be taken by mouth. When ingested, surprisingly modest amounts can be fatal.  Professional aromatherapists may occasionally recommend ingestion of dilute solutions of certain oils for specific ailments, but amateur aromatherapists should never ingest these oils. Whiff them or mix them with vegetable oil for use in massage.  In addition, British aromatherapist Valerie Ann Worwood, author of The Complete Book of Essential Oils and Aromatherapy (New World Library, 1991), cautions against using the following oils at all because of possible adverse effects: bitter almond, boldo leaf, calamus, yellow camphor, horseradish, jaborandi leaf, mugwort, mustard, pennyroyal, rue, sassafras, savin, southernwood, tansy, thuja, wintergreen, wormseed and wormwood. Leave these oils to the professionals.  A few oils _ among them clove and bergamot _ are phototoxic and can cause severe sunburn and rash.  Finally, any essential oil massaged into the skin may cause allergic irritation in some people. Be careful if you have sensitive skin. In fact, if you have allergies, you should also be cautious about inhaling essential oil aromas.  If you experience a rash or any kind of discomfort from using any essential oil, discontinue use.

The Square of Victims of Fascism has been renamed the Square of Croatia's Great Men, she reports, and a couple years ago the Commission for the Renaming of Streets even considered changing a square named after Tito to one named after the wartime pro-Nazi leader Ante Paveli.
