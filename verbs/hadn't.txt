In the eyes of the Very Rev. James Parks Morton, the dean of the cathedral, what Masur is to deliver is a sermon, the last of a series called ``Art and the Sacred'' that began on Oct. 9.   Whatever his words are called, Masur, the music director of the New York Philharmonic, will be at the cathedral for a musically auspicious occasion: the blessing of the majestic state trumpets of the organ. A cluster of 73 pipes known as a stop, they get their name from the sound of the instrument they replicate. They are 600 feet away from the organ itself and constitute the most powerful organ stop in the world, Morton said. They were removed for restoration last year, at a cost of $60,000, and Sunday will sound again for the first time, after Morton blesses them.   Deborah and Gerald S. Strober, on a tour to promote their new book about Richard M. Nixon, had no idea on Friday morning that they would go to the Washington office of Nixon's last chief of staff, Alexander M. Haig Jr., to give him a gift for his 70th birthday.   The couple, who have a public relations firm in Manhattan, appeared on the ``Morning Show'' on WWRC-AM in Washington to talk about the book, ``Nixon: An Oral History of His Presidency,'' published last month by Harper Collins. When they left the studio, they tuned their car radio to the program and heard Mike Cuthbert, the host, telephone Haig to ask if he had seen the book (he was interviewed for it in January).   ``He said no, he hadn't,'' Ms. Strober said. ``So we went right to his office, gave him a copy and wished him a happy birthday.''  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941202.0288 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-PHOTO-FULL-UPDATE-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> ATTENTION EDITORS: The following photos are part of tonight's New York Times Photo Full picture package moving: 12/2/94.
