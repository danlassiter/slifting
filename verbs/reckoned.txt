"103334"	"he"	"reckoned"	" Once the recession blows over, Goh, 60, said he will step down as prime minister. That could take a year, he reckoned, maybe two. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"108829"	"he"	"reckoned"	" He claimed a fleet of 20 U-planes lurking more than 6000 meters down on the ocean floor and equipped with torpedoes would make short work of an aircraft carrier and its protective screen of destroyers. At that depth a concrete sub would stand little chance of detection and could be positioned at strategic points to defend against attacks. Their concrete exterior would reduce their sonar signature, he reckoned, and they could be quickly repositioned if detected. Yet the Navy showed little interest. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"

"159821"	"he"	"reckoned"	" It was a weird, PlayStation season for Mroz, who was on something of an autumn sabbatical. He hadn't played the position as a junior in 2003 and unless something happened to starter Alvin Cowan, it didn't look as if Mroz would play as a senior, either.
