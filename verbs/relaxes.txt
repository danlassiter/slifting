MIAMI-BASEL (Miami Beach) -- Guy Trebay reports on the Miami Basel scene, where the money is burning a hole in people's pockets, and they're here to spend.  With photo.  MASTER-CLEANSE (Undated) -- There are lots of different drinks to be consumed during fasting for extreme weight loss or detoxification. But Master Cleanse, a home brew of maple syrup, lemon juice and cayenne meant to be drunk for 10 days or more, is the perennial favorite. Celebrities are doing it. Someone you know is doing it. How safe is it? By Lola Ogunnaike.  With photo.  NY-HOLIDAY-MONEY (New York) -- A look at the swirl that is New York around this holiday season: talking to event planners and people about town to see what's what and if more money is being spent in a year when the Dow hit 12,000 and Wall Street coffers are overflowing. By Melena Ryzik.  With photo.  BABBLE (Undated) -- Pamela Paul reports on the new parenting magazine for hipster moms and dads from the creators of Nerve.com .l  With photo.  MODERN-LOVE (Undated) -- From Dena Crosson: My husband of more than two decades bought a motorcycle, went on the Atkins diet, and began to lose his middle-age belly. He started taking martial arts classes and brought home books about Zen Buddhism, dharma and karma. He surfed the Web to find childhood classmates, looked up old girlfriends, and -- well, you know the story.  With photo.

COMMENTARY  BBN-RHODEN-COLUMN (Undated) -- Sports of The Times column on Barry Bonds, who will drive all of Major League Baseball crazy next season as he bears down on Hank Aaron's home run mark. By William C. Rhoden.  SOC-VECSEY-COLUMN (Undated) -- Sports of The Times column on the U.S. soccer team's coaching situation. By George Vecsey.  DAY'S EVENTS  BNN-BONDS (Undated) -- Barry Bonds will be coming back for at least one more season, with the San Francisco Giants, and setting sight on Hank Aaron's all-time home run record. By Jack Curry.  BBN-METS (Undated) -- The Mets sign Guillermo Mota for $5 million for two years not long after he violated baseball's performance-enhancing testing policy. By Ben Shpigl.  SOC-U.S.-COACH (New York) -- Juergen Klinsmann took himself out of consideration as coach of the U.S. soccer team, a surprising turn of events that led to Chivas USA's Bob Bradley getting the job on an interim basis. Bradley's appointment was announced Friday by U.S. Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati. Bradley also was given the job of coaching the U.S. Under-23 team as it tries to qualify for the 2008 Olympics. By Joshua Robinson.  FEATURES  BKC-LINCOLN (Lincoln University, Pa.) -- The men's basketball office here is on the second floor of a brick gymnasium across a two-lane road from grazing mules and rolling farmland. The office is not much bigger than coach Garfield Yuille's desk. On Sunday, a day after the most notable victory in Lincoln University's 88-year basketball history, Yuille sat at his desk and read his e-mail messages. Some were positive. Others were so vicious that Yuille, a 43-year-old ex-Marine with five children, began to cry. A day earlier, at a tournament in Salem, W.Va., Lincoln had set an NCAA Division III record by beating Ohio State-Marion, 201-78. Now the coach says everything he wanted to accomplished seems tarnished. By Dave Caldwell.  FBC-BLINN-COACH (Dateline TK) -- The son of Texas A&amp;M coach Dennis Franchione will lead Blinn College of Texas into the junior college national championship game against Pearl River Community College of Mississippi on Saturday. By Thayer Evans.  BKN-NETS-SUNS (East Rutherford, N.J.) -- Follow on the New Jersey Nets' double-overtime loss, 161-157, to the Phoenix Suns on Thursday night. By John Eligon.  OUTDOORS-SURF-KAYAK (Lompoc, Calif.) -- A wooden sign at this remote beach in Central California is carved with the words dangerous surf. That's why -- on the first weekend in December each year -- surf kayakers descend on Jalama Beach. They're hoping to ride big waves kicked up by winter storms in their tiny boats. Say surfing and California, and people in Omaha might picture a tanned dude in board shorts standing on a surfboard. Kayak surfers don helmets and neoprene tops, and stuff themselves into what look like short river kayaks, but with a flat, surf-board-like bottom and fins. Using a double-ended paddle for power, surf kayakers launch from the beach, and watch the breaking waves, timing their entry so they can punch through a smaller wave. By Bill Becher.

CULTURE AND ENTERTAINMENT (e code)  ART-BASEL-MIAMI (Miami) -- A bird's-eye view of Art Basel Miami, now an orgy of an art fair. By Roberta Smith  LONDON-MUSICALS (London) -- The West End is being overrun with musicals. It's beginning to look more and more like Broadway. By Sarah Lyall.  LA-SCALA-AIDA (Milan, Italy) -- La Scala opens for the season. By Alan Riding.  TV-MYSTERY-LOVE (Undated) -- The close-as-brothers relationship between Azim Khamisa and Ples Felix certainly exemplifies friendship as a kind of love. But it is an even more extraordinary example of forgiveness, compelling enough to be included in the PBS documentary The Mystery of Love, which is to be broadcast at 9 p.m. on Wednesday. Mystery serves up experts and real people to investigate love's varieties and includes the story of how Felix's grandson killed Khamisa's only son. Afterwards, the men met, began teaching non-violence as a way to redeem the tragedy, and their relationship deepened. By Felicia R. Lee.

, he added,	 I respected her intelligence, but she was not well suited to the job, Shultz wrote. Her strength was in her capacity for passionate advocacy, and the post, he added, demanded a dispassionate broker. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, he says,	 He is also reluctant to engage in conversation about the price of gasoline, which, after all, must be a constant anxiety to the man who runs the biggest package delivery system in the world: planes and trucks fueled by guess what. Finally, badgered by questions, he says the company is trying hybrid cars and we've done a lot with compressed natural gas. Oh, and, he says, those brown vehicles you see clogging up the city streets, they are emphatically not trucks. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, he said,	 Once traditional software is complemented by services delivered online, he said, it's a pretty logical thing that people would say, hey, I've got Windows and here's a set of Windows Live things that extend those services. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, he said,	 They had a lot of new initiatives, and people ran fast out of the gate, said Niall Kennedy, an expert on Internet publishing who joined Microsoft last spring and quit in disgust in August. After the stock fell, he said, I wasn't able to hire anybody for my group. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, he said,	 This differentiation, he said, is less about extraneous services like the 3-D maps and more about changes to the way basic search results are presented. This strategy helped him build a small but loyal audience at Ask Jeeves, where he introduced several features like the ability to see a preview of Web pages found by the search engine. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

, he said,	 Patrick acknowledged yesterday in a telephone interview that one goal of this initiative is political - to be able to call upon organized groups of citizens to support his legislative proposals, for instance. But the larger goal, he said, is to create a two-way street in which government listens to and responds to its citizens far better, while at the same time challenging the citizens to become more involved in solving their own problems: to get people to take greater responsibility. Patrick said he has in mind creating a central office of civic engagement within his office of public liaison at the State House. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, she writes,	 -- Nell Hill's Entertaining in Style: Inspiring Parties and Seasonal Celebrations (Andrews McMeel, $29.95) by Mary Carol Garrity. Known for her three home decor stores (Nell Hill's, Garrity's Encore, G. Diebolt's) in her hometown of Atchison, Kan., Garrity's latest book is organized around the changing seasons and the holidays and celebrations that go with them. Written in an engaging, personal fashion, the book offer creative party themes, yummy recipes, clever decor ideas and tips to make guests feel special. For dining room holiday decor, for example, she writes, Next to formal silver candelabra with towering tapers, I display an aged garden urn, roses in a weathered terra cotta pot, and pine cones from my yard. Read this book, and you'll never feel intimidated about hosting a party again. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, he said,	 They have sent messages through Cabinet officials and their assistants, and by way of government guards and clerical workers. One candidate, an Iraqi Shiite living in London whose brother was killed by Saddam, telephoned an aide to the prime minister to say he was prepared to drop everything and fly to Baghdad to execute the former ruler. It would be an honor, he said, according to the aide. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, they say,	 Officials have considered staging a public hanging in Baghdad's largest sports arena, Shaab Stadium, and filling the place with tens of thousands of spectators, according to government officials who agreed to discuss the subject on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record. But while such a spectacle might satisfy a communal need for closure, the authorities have rejected the idea for security reasons. A target that big, they say, would be highly vulnerable to attack by Sunni insurgents who might try to lob a few mortar shells into the crowd or ambush spectators on their way to and from the event. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, he said,	 The current spike, he said, has more to do with rising wholesale costs involved in producing gasoline than any year-end retail strategy or supply constraints. And consumers shouldn't read too much into it. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

, he stressed,	 For all the talk of accumulating wealth, though, greed was generally frowned upon at the expo. Despite the draw of Sunday headliner Donald Trump, the self-made riches movement has been forged by the likes of 19th century Pittsburgh steelmaker Andrew Carnegie, who stressed that increasing one's personal fortune has value only if it leads to a comparable increase in good works. Robbins spoke of his work as a peak performance coach with some of America's top athletes. But his reference to his foundation that feeds hungry people around the globe drew the stronger audience response. One especially caustic speaker, real estate investor James Smith, regaled the audience with outrageous-money making schemes and the characters he met along the way. But this is a game, he stressed, where winners are supposed to share the wealth. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

And (director) Steven (Soderbergh) would tell us, 'If it doesn't feel eggy, then you're not there, it's not right.' So we just had to throw ourselves into it. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

, he said,	 Berner argues that consumers are not as dependent as the pessimists contend on the wealth they extract from their homes to drive their spending. The more important factors today, he said, are the recent decline in energy prices and, above all, rising incomes. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, he said,	 Gault said that employers might be reluctant to cut their work force levels in a tight labor market, fearing they might have difficulty finding good workers if the economy rebounded.

, he said,	 In an interview, John Fleming, the chief marketing officer at Wal-Mart, said the company had indeed begun to backtrack from sleeker advertising that emphasized style over price. Customer research, he said, showed that, rich or poor, Wal-Mart customers care about unbeatable prices. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

, he said,	 There is something inherently easier to portraying the prowar, jingoistic picture, said Pressman. Kerry, he said, had to argue that he was against the war but not pro-Saddam Hussein. He had to argue that the war is wrong and is being fought incorrectly, but not be against the troops. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, he said,	 Before it's too late, he said, It is very important we work on this to leverage American security interests, protect our troops, and sustain our long-term interests. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, I think,	 The American people took the reins of government away from the Republican Party relative to the Republican Congress in this last election, Gregg said in a speech on the Senate floor. They did so, I think, in large part because they were tired of our hypocrisy as a party on the issue of fiscal responsibility. And it would appear that their concerns are justified. It is true, I guess. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

So when I received an e-mail message from my friend Georgette in Argentina, saying she was coming back to complete and defend her doctoral dissertation, I took it as propitious. I offered her a room and kitchen, bath and laundry. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, she said,	 I had never believed in such arcana. But Georgette's certainty in divine intervention was compelling. Her protector, she said, is the handsome and debonair god Mercury. Mine, she told me, is Saturn: dark, cold, harsh and mean. Well, fine. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

, he said,	 Contacted in Baghdad, Lt. Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, who commands U.S. forces in Iraq, described the Iraqi army as fragile. He said Sunni officers and soldiers have to believe the government is using force in a fair and evenhanded manner. As for the police, he said, it is clear there are some sectarian elements, but forceful action by the Interior Ministry was now addressing the problem. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, he says,	 He concedes that the same abuses took place in the Sunni areas, too. But, he says, the Sunnis are 20 percent only while the Shia are 70 percent and the police and army are Shia, so they are able to carry weapons officially. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, it is,	 As for the police, it is, in the view of Chiarelli, in far worse shape than the army. The year of the police, as 2006 was billed, has turned into the year of police abuse. The report suggests transferring a large part of the police from the Interior Ministry control to the Defense Ministry to improve discipline. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

The same laboratory, he said, worked on radioactive items. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, he said,	 Kalugin, facing increasing hostility at home, settled for good in the United States. In 2002, the onetime rising star of Russian democracy was convicted of treason by a Moscow court and sentenced in absentia to 15 years in prison. For decades, he said, any KGB officer who defected was automatically tried and sentenced to death, and officers overseas were expected to carry out the sentences. In the late 1960s, when Yuri Andropov became KGB chief, the practice faded. He never formally ended it, but he found reasons not to give the orders, said Kalugin, who knew Andropov well. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, it said,	 The day after the Baker-Hamilton report on Iraq was released, Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, rejected the part that urged the United States to refocus on the Israeli-Arab conflict because all Middle East issues were, it said, inextricably linked. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

, it seems,	 Without question, women and blacks have made significant progress in winning office. The new Congress will include 71 women -- one of whom will be the first female speaker of the House -- compared with 25 when Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, D-N.Y., became the first woman to run as a major-party vice presidential nominee in 1984. There will be 43 blacks in the new Congress, compared with 13 when the Congressional Black Caucus was formed in 1969. A Gallup Poll in September showed a steady rise in the number of people who expect the nation to elect a woman or an African-American as president one day: Americans, it seems, are much more open to these choices than, say, someone who is an atheist or who is gay. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, they say,	 Over the past of the past eight years, in the view of analysts from both parties, the country has shifted markedly on the issue of gender, to the point where they say voters could very well be open to electing a woman in 2008. That is reflected, they say, in polling data and in the continued success of women running for office, in red and blue states alike. The country is ready, said Sen. Elizabeth Dole, R-N.C., who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2000. I'm not saying it's going to happen in '08. But the country is ready. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, he said,	 All evidence is that a white female has an advantage over a black male -- for reasons of our cultural heritage, said the Rev. Jesse L.

, he said,	 Earley said Pratt's decision was sharply inconsistent with current law and his standard for separating secular from religious expenses was so extreme that it would disqualify almost any faith-based program. He acknowledged that inmates, whatever their own faith, are required to participate in all program activities, including worship, but he insisted that a religious conversion is not required for success. InnerChange uses biblical references only to illustrate a set of universal values, such as integrity and responsibility, and not to exclude those of other faiths, he said, adding that it was unfortunate if any inmates felt the program denigrated Catholicism or any other Christian faith. Corrections officials in Iowa declined to comment on the case. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

For example, while White House and Pentagon officials note that they are already embedding additional trainers and advisers in Iraqi units, they expressed deep skepticism that the force of 4,000 advisers could be rapidly increased to the 10,000 to 20,000 envisioned in the report. As a result, they said, they doubted it would be possible to pull back all 15 American combat brigades from Iraq's streets and towns by the first quarter of 2008, the goal in the panel's report. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

YOUNG-JEEZY (Undated) -- Though the Atlanta rapper Young Jeezy appears to be as cocky as they come, he never thought he would top the Billboard charts when he released his debut album, Let's Get it: Thug Motivation 101, last year. Chock-full of gritty rhymes about his life on the wrong side of the law, the album turned him into a critics' darling and a spokesman for Any Hood, U.S.A., and the antihero of suburban fans across the county. I knew I'd do well in the streets, but I didn't think I'd do so well in the mainstream, he said. A lot of people can't handle the truth. By Lola Ogunnaike.  CANDIDE-EUROPE (Paris) -- In the early 1950s, after Lillian Hellman was interrogated by the House Un-American Activities Committee, she sought revenge by persuading Leonard Bernstein to work with her on a musical adaptation of Voltaire's great satire, Candide. To both playwright and composer, it seems, the parallels between the Inquisition and the McCarthyist witch hunt were self-evident. But their comic operetta, which opened in New York 50 years ago this month, fared poorly at first. Robert Carsen, the Canadian opera director, has rewritten and rearranged this Candide so that audiences need not deduce any analogy between past and present: he spells it out. The score and lyrics remain largely unchanged, but the staging and new dialogue make it clear that the target is the United States, from the 1950s to this day. By Alan Riding.

HUNGARIAN-HANUKKAH (Kiryas Joel, N.Y.) -- As Mindel Appel showed me the contents of her freezer, my pulse began to race. Out came her homemade kokosh cake, similar to babka. Next were shlishkes, little potato dumplings that can be tossed in sugar, breadcrumbs and butter, or stuffed with lekvar, a kind of prune preserve. Finally, she brought out a Hanukkah delicacy, the cheese Danish called delkelekh. As a writer concentrating on Jewish food, I always get letters and e-mails asking for old recipes from Hungary. Most of what I know about these foods I have read in books. So I was thrilled to find these famous dishes in this village about 45 miles north of the George Washington Bridge. By Joan Nathan.  With recipes.  With photo.  GOURMET-TRUCK (Undated) -- For John Magazino, a baby-faced 37-year-old from Larchmont, N.Y., the unmarked white van in which he conducts his truffle business is a recent luxury. When he started peddling the aromatic fungi to high-end restaurants a decade ago, he took the subway, darting between Nobu and Le Cirque on the 1 and the R trains. Now he spends November and December at the mercy of holiday traffic as he hauls his wares, which have grown to include caviar, porcini and whatever costly, rarefied produce he can procure. By Melissa Clark.  With photo.  NY-CALORIE-LISTING (New York) -- When the New York City Board of Health passed a law last week that will force some restaurants to list calories on menus by this summer their goal was to help prevent obesity and the diseases that go along with it.

, I believe,	 I don't think he is saying Israel is an apartheid state, said Khalil Shikaki, who teaches political science at An-Najah National University, attended by 10,000 Palestinians, in the city of Nablus. He is saying Israel is using apartheid practices in the occupied areas, and this, I believe, is very appropriate. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, he argues,	 Thant eloquently and mournfully recites the dismal history of the last half century and, in analyzing the country's nascent democracy movement, holds out only the slimmest of hopes for a better future. It will not come through economic and diplomatic sanctions, of that he is convinced. Trade and more engagement, especially more tourism, might let in badly needed light and air. But trying to topple the regime by isolating it would, he argues, be disastrous. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, I think,	 The people who argue for more troops often, I think, are thinking World War II . . . a conflict between armies and navies and air forces, he said. More troops in Iraq can increase recruiting for extremism, it can increase financing for extremists, it can make more persuasive the lies of the extremists that we're there for their oil or for their water or to take over their countries. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

, it seems,	 To achieve this effect, she often appeals to the camera -- the audience? God? -- to find out what's going on. Slim, swan-necked, with the upright bearing of a dancer or cadet, she doesn't exactly lean in for intimacy with the viewer. She's not relatable. She seems a touch abstemious. The news, it seems, kind of grosses her out. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, she said,	 Finally in a room at Beth Israel, Angie looked every bit her age. Sunlight from a scorcher of a day beat in, bleaching her white hair and highlighting the weariness in her plump face. She was tethered to the bed by tubes that carried oxygen and fluids and by compression booties that kept blood moving in her legs to avoid clots. When the boots inflated, she said, it felt like her beloved dachshunds, Symantha and Sydney, pawing at her legs. The thought brought an ear-to-ear grin and a momentary sparkle to her eyes. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

, he continued,	 The lighter side of the book may be the moments that reveal a fledgling democracy in the early 1990s. Havel chose to include in the book documents like memos chiding staff members about bad food, improper utensils at state dinners and a whole array of things, which, of course, several years later seem entirely unimportant, Havel said. But, he continued, they really illustrate very well what the everyday life of the presidency was in a post-communist country, where we didn't have any tradition to latch onto and really had to invent everything all over again. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

, he said,	 Carsen said that he imagined an Americanized Candide well before he inquired whether a major reworking would be authorized. In practice, he said, he had no intention of altering the score and it proved too difficult to obtain permission to change songs written by no fewer than seven different lyricists. But Carsen did receive the go-ahead from Hugh Wheeler's estate to rewrite the libretto. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

, he said,	 With Inspiration Jeezy, who often compares himself to a motivational speaker, a kind of Tony Robbins of the 'hood, said he wants to encourage people to strive for something better. When you're stuck in the 'hood, you don't get a lot of hope, 'cause people all around you are so negative, he said. One has to wonder what he is trying to inspire people to do: Be better drug dealers? No, he said, before breaking into what sounded like a late-night infomercial: If you're down, this album will pick you up; if you're up, it will keep you up; and if your money is down, it will help get your money up. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, he said,	 One of his biggest inspirations growing up, he said, was his grandmother, a walking contradiction. She was both a devout Christian and a sassy numbers runner. She went to church every Sunday and was always the best dressed woman, but she got her money, he said laughing. She definitely got her money. She died before she could see his current success. I never got a chance to tell her how I felt about her, he said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, she said,	 KD: My wife is more capable of understanding what America means than I am because she was an immigrant. She wanted to pay back something for this country, and when she read that all the playgrounds at schools for children were decrepit and dangerous, she said, I'm going to fix them all. Of course, I thought she was crazy, but she wasn't crazy. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, he says,	 In many ways, Von Erck, who said he and his mother moved 13 times when he was in high school because they were often short of money, continues to live that messy life of deprivation. His meals often consist of ramen noodles, he said; his bed is perpetually unmade. For years, he has been trying unsuccessfully to find his father, who, he says, still owes his mother child support. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, he laughed,	 Kerry said he wanted to meet with the National Guard soldiers who mocked his blunder by holding a banner: Halp us Jon Carry - we R stuck hear N Irak. When he saw the banner in a widely circulated photograph, Kerry said, he laughed, adding that he'd have done the same thing if he were in their shoes. But he said he won't make that part of this trip because he is interested in business, not politics. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20061212.0182 type=story > <HEADLINE> BIZ-COVER-NYT </HEADLINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, he maintains,	 The agreement has angered local immigrant advocacy groups. Ali Noorani, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, said he hoped Patrick would rescind the accord, which, he maintains, is a waste of law enforcement's time and money. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, they said,	 In recent years the Internet has served as an important barometer of the public mood in China, and increasingly it functions as an outlet for criticism. In that light, some commentators said the online reactions reflected a real evolution in public opinion. Show trials and shaming thrived from a spirit of conformity, and even in the recent past, they said, few would have stepped forward to defend prostitutes. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, he said,	 Ten cement plants are under construction, O'Hare said, and 25 to 30 will be built or modernized over the next decade. Those kilns will produce about 40 million tons of cement, he said, or 30 percent of the material used in the United States. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, he said,	 At Tuesday's policy meeting, governors complained of having no money to manage immediate security concerns or for operational costs, said one diplomat. A new plan to deploy hundreds of auxiliary police officers in the districts nearly collapsed when there was no money to pay them, he said, adding, We want the president to reach out. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

, he added,	 Given the sadness many evangelicals say they feel for the former pastors, he added, what we're seeing here is a growing awareness among evangelicals that they have oversimplified, made false judgments and been very, very mean to the gay and lesbian community. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, he added,	 If the vision crowd gets its way, he added, it'll be more practical to go all the way up to Anacortes for fuel. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, he added,	 It's a hypothetical situation, and we'd work hard to avoid such a structure, one Arab diplomat in Washington said. But, he added, If things become so bad in Iraq, like an ethnic cleansing, we will feel we are pulled into the war. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, he said,	 Coast Guard Rear Adm. David W. Kunkel, director of the Homeland Security Task Force Southeast that led the two-day exercise, stressed that the U.S. government is not predicting that Castro's death will destabilize Cuba and spark a massive wave of migration. But, he said, We don't want to be caught flat-footed. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, he said,	 Robert Palestrant, acting director of the Office of Emergency Management in Miami-Dade County, said the county has the capacity to hold up to 78,000 people in the case of a hurricane, but that involves closing down schools and using them for shelter. Faced with large numbers, he said, the federal government would have to step in and send migrants to other parts of the country. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

, he says,	 Harri Tervola doesn't seem to have any fear. He told me he first drove a car when he was 6 on his family's property in Finland. A year later, he says, he had his own car, one he describes with a four-letter word, which he drove rally-style on the dirt roads around their farm. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, she said,	 Alison Simmons, a philosophy professor and cochairwoman of the general education task force, said her group did not make the switch because of objections to the topic. Rather, she said, they were convinced by colleagues that the subject would be adequately covered by other categories, including the moral reasoning requirement and requirements covering society in the United States and abroad. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, he adds,	 That means, he adds, revamping an education system designed in the 1900s for people to do routine work, and refocusing it on producing people who can imagine things that have never been available before, who can create ingenious marketing and sales campaigns, write books, build furniture, make movies and design software that will capture people's imaginations and become indispensable for millions. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

, he said,	 It is a very efficient way of governing, said Antonio Elorza, a political science professor at the Complutense University of Madrid. But on serious matters of state, he said, such as the quest for more self-government from Spain's regions, concessions must be constrained by clearly stated principles. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

These other approaches, he said, would include pump-priming investments in Iraqi factories and other businesses that would create jobs, as well as in agriculture; renewed pressure on the Iraqi government to promote reconciliation between warring Shiite and Sunni groups; and fresh efforts to build trust between the U.S. forces and Iraqis. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

Very often, we get people on our trips who don't think of themselves as environmentalists, they just want to have a fun vacation, said Tanya Tschesnok, a spokeswoman for Sierra Club Outings, the Sierra Club's travel arm.
