"2536"	"he"	"adds"	" Richard Eyre, the head of the Royal National Theater (where Miss Warner is an associate director), says her major virtue is ``to strip away baggage from major works,'' to treat them as a tabula rasa. It is, he adds, ``a dangerous route.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199408.gz"

Just look at Fontana's colored-glass and stone-encrusted canvases or his ceramic ``Crucifixion,'' not to mention Salvatore Ferragamo's shoes and Arnaldo Pomodoro's jewelry, to see what Celant is referring to.

"6718"	"he"	"adds"	" Still, being a partner at Goldman is about as close to a sure thing as there is anywhere in the business world -- a ticket to wealth and prestige. A Goldman partnership, says Samuel Hayes III, a finance professor at the Harvard Business School, is ``the epitome of professional recognition on Wall Street.'' And financially, he adds, it is ``the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199410.gz"

"7985"	"he"	"adds"	" Michael Harrison, editor of Talkers Magazine, a trade publication for talk radio, agrees that ``talk radio hosts really reflect and amplify more than they influence.''

"8044"	"he"	"adds"	" Naturally, Panetta says, we will take up where we left off on health reform. But this time around, he adds, the stress will be on cost control. And, what is more, the Republicans will be asked to take a big stake in any deal from the start. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"

"8373"	"she"	"adds"	" Other man-made alterations to the environment, she adds, have also had unforeseen consequences. The building of huge dams in Egypt, the Sudan and Ghana seems to have led to rising numbers of the schistosome parasite and a concurrent rise in related diseases, just as deforestation in North and South America has led to changes in the region's flora and fauna, which in turn have led to significant shifts in the microbe population. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"
"8687"	"it"	"adds"	" AOL recently updated its opening screens, giving them a more colorful, more intuitive command structure. Once connected, the user is greeted by a voice that says, ``Welcome.'' If there is electronic mail waiting, it adds, ``You've got mail.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"
"8805"	"he"	"adds"	" Beecham, in a fascinating 1958 interview, berates young conductors for starting and stopping during rehearsals.

"9910"	"he"	"adds"	" - The personal savings rate has dropped to a near-record low of 3.5 percent, says Georgia Tech marketing expert Dr. Fred Allvine. What's more, he adds, Americans are buying more on plastic than ever before in a dangerous ``buy now pay never'' attitude he describes as a ``credit card mania.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"
"9911"	"he"	"adds"	" - Total consumer debt as a proportion of total income averaged 72 percent between 1965 to 1984 but has ballooned ``to the low 90 percent area now,'' Allvine says. Real family income, he adds, has been declining for 15 years, disappointing boomers who'd expected their buying clout to rise. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"
"9914"	"he"	"adds"	" But millions of people, he adds, also are turning to traditional beliefs, such as orthodox religions, to fill what Truzzi describes as a ``deep, innate, basic human need'' that calms rising fears of an uncertain, frightening future. He blames such fears on everything from financial disappointment to the coming of the Third Millennium in six years to what the collapse of communism may mean. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"
"9917"	"he"	"adds"	" It's wishful thinking -- a fallacious belief system -- for technical analysts to believe they can predict the future, he says. Still, he adds, customers of stockbrokers want to know what to buy, when to buy and when to sell, and technical analysts offer them a rationale. And because the predictions thus help brokers sell, brokerages employ technical analysts. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"

"10157"	"he"	"adds"	" Just as important, he adds, the new disks could curtail the widespread public practice of dubbing audio-cassette copies of CDs, because bootleg tapes would lack the multimedia embellishments. ``Once listeners get accustomed to this,'' Beil said, ``they will never again accept an audio-only product.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"
"10367"	"she"	"adds"	" At first, Ms. Drescher said, the writers who tried to flesh out the character didn't quite get the idea. ``Most of the scripts that came to us,'' she said, ``were written with a kind of meanspirited, hard edge to them,'' says Ms. Drescher.

Now the fact that Hunter is half Stewart's age and just might be considered more attractive to the opposite sex than he is does not enter into the discussion. Instead, we learn that before they tied the knot Stewart made a point of telling his betrothed ``all about all my past relationships.'' Alas, he adds, ``it's impossible for me to remember everybody I've made love to.'' To make up for that lapse he does ``try and point them out if Rachel and I are out together.'' The image this conjures up is sublime. Imagine the Stewarts bearing binoculars as they cruise Sunset or prowl Mayfair in the wee small hours. ``Bung ho, Rachel! That bird, the one over there, she was the one at the, uh, party after the Faces concert at the Fillmore in '71.

Hoffman, who has taken as long as five years before deciding to commit to a film, had to dispense with his usual agonizing this time.

Wolfgang and I had met the day before about another project that never happened. He told me about this one and asked me if I was interested.

"19400"	"she"	"adds"	" Whereas such heroes are routinely embraced today as role models, she adds, the mythic heroes of the Greek story cycles, like Oedipus, Jason and Orestes, used to elicit a more complicated response: ``Their pride, their knowing and unknowing crimes, the matricides and infanticides, self-blindings and suicides, all the strife and horror they undergo and perpetrate didn't make them exemplary, but cautionary: they provoked terror and pity, not emulation.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"

"20602"	"he"	"adds"	" What's particularly troublesome, he adds, is that spanking is often done by otherwise loving parents. ``The message becomes, `When you are angry with people you love, hitting is OK to do,''' says Luce. ``When you spank, you're modeling violence as an acceptable way to solve problems.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"20603"	"he"	"adds"	" --It escalates. According to Luce, one-third of parents who spank on the rear end with an open hand move on to hit with belts and paddles; to hit on the face and head; to punch, kick and beat; to throw children down stairs, against walls. In other words, they end up as child abusers. ``The No.1 cause of accidental death of infants is parents who beat them under the guise of discipline,'' Luce says. Unfortunately, he adds, laws in every state allow parental corporal punishment. A 1977 Supreme Court decision says physical punishment by parents is ``permissible as long as it isational Child Abuse Prevention Month. All month, the GoodStart program by the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children has been giving ``Operating Instructions,'' a package of educational information, to all parents of newborns in the hopes of heading off abuse before it starts. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"20615"	"he"	"adds"	" What's particularly troublesome, he adds, is that spanking is often done by otherwise loving parents. ``The message becomes, `When you are angry with people you love, hitting is OK to do,''' says Luce. ``When you spank, you're modeling violence as an acceptable way to solve problems.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"20616"	"he"	"adds"	" --It escalates. According to Luce, one-third of parents who spank on the rear end with an open hand move on to hit with belts and paddles; to hit on the face and head; to punch, kick and beat; to throw children down stairs, against walls. In other words, they end up as child abusers. ``The No.1 cause of accidental death of infants is parents who beat them under the guise of discipline,'' Luce says. Unfortunately, he adds, laws in every state allow parental corporal punishment. A 1977 Supreme Court decision says physical punishment by parents is ``permissible as long as it is short of deadly force.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"

"21179"	"she"	"adds"	" It's bad enough to be raped. Does a body have to risk a fatal disease, too? Apparently so, if she wants justice, at least in some courtrooms. Rape charges in various states have been thrown out on condom grounds alone. And in California, a rape conviction recently was overturned because it didn't appear that the victim believed she faced ``immediate bodily injury.'' She was faulted for her lack of resistance. Yet, many self-defense experts caud, prosecuted and end up with jail time for the defendant. ``Few victims come forward because it is a thankless process,'' says Wendy Murphy, a victims'-rights lawyer. In Massachusetts, she adds, rape sentences generally are low. ``The message sent is that this is a crime that's OK to commit.'' For women, that is a chilling message indeed. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950503.0195 type=story > <HEADLINE> EXODUS ENIGMA: ARGUING THE END OF JEWISH BOSTON </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-BEAM-COLUMN-BOS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"

"29338"	"he"	"adds"	" ``TV exposure is a crucial element,'' Sondheim says. Eventually, he adds, there will be 65 Scarry episodes on tape. The cassettes are $9.95 each. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"29339"	"he"	"adds"	" Some children will still be focused on the original crime, although Jellinek says most children are not threatened by it but perplexed and disconcerted. ``It's not so much, `Could my parents do this to me?' as, `I wonder why this could happen?''' says Jellinek, who is chief of child psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital. Most children, he adds, ``will look for concrete answers and probably place the blame on the children: `They must have been really bad for their mother to do this.''' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"29357"	"he"	"adds"	" ``This is a street fight ... that will never be resolved,'' says Fisher. ``Presidents like to think that they not only announce foreign policy but make it.'' However, he adds, ``Congress is a co-equal. It's very legitimate for Congress not to let a president decide it all.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"29560"	"he"	"adds"	" But rather than distribute money to shareholders in the form of dividends or stock repurchases, Buffett says many macho managers ``possess an abundance of animal spirits and ego'' and are driven to make deals. When CEOs ask planning staff, consultants or investment bankers whether an acquisition or two makes sense, he adds, ``That's like asking your interior decorator whether you need a $50,000 rug.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"29655"	"he"	"adds"	" ``When you switch to another dialect, you're really becoming bilingual,'' Boone says. You often switch back, he adds, if you're scared, angry, tired, excited, stressed out, inebriated or on drugs. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"

"29876"	"he"	"adds"	" Bill Ivey, the foundation director, agrees that ``we come from distinctly different segments of Nashville society.'' But, he adds, ``we've been easing toward each other for the last 40 years.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"29964"	"he"	"adds"	" Bill Ivey, the foundation director, agrees that ``we come from distinctly different segments of Nashville society.'' But, he adds, ``we've been easing toward each other for the last 40 years.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"

"30195"	"he"	"adds"	" On the other side, he adds, ``Catholic Croatia has unquestionably benefited from the support of co-religionists in Germany and Austria, as well as from the sympathy and diplomatic influence of the Vatican.'' </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950804.0345 type=story > <HEADLINE> POST-WAR GENERATION BETS ON BRIGHT FUTURE IN VIETNAM </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> HANOI (BC-VIETNAM-YOUNG-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"30580"	"he"	"adds"	" Then, looking at the screen filled with a close-up of his anguished character, he adds, ``Move over, Martin Scorsese.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"30666"	"he"	"adds"	" Roger Clemens says that, despite press portrayals of him as a reluctant autographer, he signs ``everywhere'' _ from Fenway Park to the players' parking lot to restaurants. The only time he won't, he adds, is when he's out with his family, and even then, it's not he who declines. ``My wife takes care of that.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"30832"	"she"	"adds"	" ``There is a way to look fashionable but professional without looking like a man,'' she says. There is also a difference, she adds, between the uniformed pinstripes a junior executive needs to wear and the freer, more fashionable style open to an officer whose career has topped 10 years. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"30944"	"he"	"adds"	" ``We need a more sophisticated question: What is the biology of the psychology of addiction?'' he asks. A simple answer, he adds, is that cravings _ as well as human nature _ stem from a complex interaction of biology and psychology, not simply one or the other. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"31091"	"he"	"adds"	" Making Hiroshima more important than V-J Day, he adds, results from ``the American trait of sentimentality, the same way Americans feel about baby whales, baby seals and saving trees. That retroactive sentimentality has colored their memory of the war. Many of these academics aren't good enough thinkers to know they live because I killed people on their behalf. They're implicated in the behavior of soldiers fighting for them. They cannot imagine themselves as wicked and culpable, so they play this game of guessing about the past. The great thing about self-righteousness is that it requires no thinking.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"31212"	"he"	"adds"	" His movie role, he adds, was ``totally inconsistent'' with that philosophy. ``The idea amused me. I cannot in any way justify it. I just went ahead and did it because at age 79, I said `what the hell.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"31214"	"she"	"adds"	" News organizations today, she adds, with an eye on things like the Disney deal and the Time-Warner empire, ``have all become part of huge infotainment machines.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"31259"	"he"	"adds"	" ``We need a more sophisticated question: What is the biology of the psychology of addiction?'' he asks. A simple answer, he adds, is that cravings _ as well as human nature _ stem from a complex interaction of biology and psychology, not simply one or the other. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"31288"	"he"	"adds"	" ``Nobody disputes that the Irish have a facility with the language in a very entertaining way that comes across in `Glenroe,' '' O'Leary says. Referring to Dinny, he adds, ``I'd be hard-pressed to find a character as engaging as him.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"31296"	"he"	"adds"	" In Dallas, for example, movies that are ``severe and twisted'' perform well while softer, art-house films do poorly, Barker says. In Houston, he adds, the reverse is true. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"31347"	"he"	"adds"	" In Dallas, for example, movies that are ``severe and twisted'' perform well while softer, art-house films do poorly, Barker says. In Houston, he adds, the reverse is true. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"31350"	"he"	"adds"	" ``Nobody disputes that the Irish have a facility with the language in a very entertaining way that comes across in `Glenroe,' '' O'Leary says. Referring to Dinny, he adds, ``I'd be hard-pressed to find a character as engaging as him.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"31563"	"she"	"adds"	" A student in the University of Phoenix's master's program in business administration/technology management, Higa finds the course work ``extremely, incredibly demanding.'' But, she adds, ``It's the best academic experience I've had in my career, and I've gone to a lot of different schools.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"31789"	"he"	"adds"	" People do get emotionally attached to words _ even scientific ones. What middle-aged dinosaur aficionado can view the new Apatosaurus on display at the American Museum of Natural History and not think wistfully of the Brontosaurus that used to be? Brontosaurus (Greek for ``thunder lizard'') lost its name because findings in paleontology identified it as a dinosaur that had been discovered earlier, Apatosaurus (``deceptive lizard''). Betraying not a whit of sentiment, Mark A. Norell, a paleontologist at the museum, says: ``That's the way science works.'' (As for Stegosaurus and Triceratops, he adds, they're ``safe for now.'') </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"31870"	"she"	"adds"	" ``I think teens are the segment of the population that still tend to spend their money,'' says Jordan Marsh's Dressler. ``Our back-to-school business has been healthy.'' But, she adds, ``there's probably a little more longevity in what they're buying.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"31895"	"he"	"adds"	" Sarah Bonner, 53, is from Opelika, Ala., and her only professional experience was at her brother's soul-food restaurant, Fred's Kitchen, in Brooklyn, from 1988 to 1990. Eric Eisenberg, 32, who trained at the Cordon Bleu Cooking School, is a Southern-style cook by night and the executive chef at the Luxembourg Mission to the United Nations by day. Mrs. Bonner cooks what her mother and grandmother made, while Eisenberg invents dishes like sweet potato butter that he says taste ``like someone's grandma did it.'' But, he adds, ``Sarah has the final taste.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"31980"	"she"	"adds"	" A student in the University of Phoenix's master's program in business administration/technology management, Higa finds the course work ``extremely, incredibly demanding.'' But, she adds, ``It's the best academic experience I've had in my career, and I've gone to a lot of different schools.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"32009"	"he"	"adds"	" As a royal couple, Kaufman declares, Queen Elizabeth II's second son and Sarah Ferguson are ``more trouble than they are worth.'' Everyone, he adds, is ``fed up'' with their antics. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"32020"	"she"	"adds"	" ``I got a beautiful life out of it, the kind not many people get to have,'' she says. But only slowly, she adds, has she come to realize that that life was not just the result of being married to a famous artist; it was also the result of what she contributed to their relationship. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"32078"	"he"	"adds"	" For that reason, he adds, Lee's appointment is good news for the local stock market, which often has been hurt by the central bank's strong anti-inflation measures and the ensuing interest rate rise. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"32080"	"he"	"adds"	" For that reason, he adds, Lee's appointment is good news for the local stock market, which often has been hurt by the central bank's strong anti-inflation measures and the ensuing interest rate rise. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"32103"	"she"	"adds"	" ``Just because your 12-year-old is ready to be home alone, doesn't mean he's ready to be home alone and responsible for one or two other children,'' she says. ``The younger child is often left feeling unprotected and unsafe.'' On the other hand, she adds, ``It depends on the relationship. If they generally get along and are respectful of each other, it could be OK.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"32118"	"he"	"adds"	" ``Poor people's memory,'' Jacques thinks, ``is less nourished than that of the rich; it has fewer landmarks in space because they seldom leave the place where they live, and fewer reference points in time.'' Of course, he adds, ``there is the memory of the heart that they say is the surest kind, but the heart wears out with sorrow and labor, it forgets sooner under the weight of fatigue.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"32153"	"she"	"adds"	" Also, she adds, within the first eight episodes, a series regular will die during a story about rabies. The death is not the result of an actor's contract up for renewal, but is a dramatic turn the show needs, she says, without identifying who dies. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"32216"	"he"	"adds"	" The two scams, notes Larry Norton, an assistant director in the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, cost investors ``tens of millions of dollars.'' In the second instance, he adds, some 3,000 victims might as a group recoup $600,000. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"32501"	"he"	"adds"	" ``My overall feeling is that the managing editors are a very strong group,'' he says. But without much prodding, he adds, ``I don't think an editorship ought to be a tenured position. ... I've certainly asked all my editors to give me their thoughts on succession.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"32859"	"he"	"adds"	" The Fuhrman tapes, he adds, indicate only that there are some bad police officers, just as there are some bad members of any profession. To turn Fuhrman's nastiness into a debate about whether white Americans are reluctant to own up to their own racism is, he says ``frankly ludicrous.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"32997"	"she"	"adds"	" In limiting categories to heterosexual and homosexual, Garber says, society has ``occluded a tremendous amount of human experience. We have also abnormalized other aspects of experience that are in fact pretty normal.'' That is, she adds, ``if `normal' means `happens a lot.''' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"33116"	"he"	"adds"	" In the end, he adds, the price of the competing disk players might make more of a difference than the cost of the disks. The cost of optical lenses could be a deciding factor. Each competitor says its player will cost around $500. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"33274"	"he"	"adds"	" Besides, he adds, ``an architect is an artist, and she works for a bank. She knows what interest rates are and how that affects their credit card debt.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"33277"	"she"	"adds"	" As a little girl, Ms. Subach says, she imagined marrying an engineer or a lawyer _ ``someone who is totally financially responsible.'' But, she adds, ``This is the man I love.'' </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950908.0291 type=story > <HEADLINE> FINANCIAL TIP FOR NEWLYWEDS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-SPEND-COUPLES-DEBT-TIPS-ART-2TAKES-$ADV10-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"33340"	"he"	"adds"	" The bill for asbestos removal topped a half-million dollars, he adds, and nearly as much was spent on improvements to bring the theater into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"33640"	"he"	"adds"	" ``The zone'' is a reference to what Sears calls ``that mysterious but very real state in which your body and mind work together at their ultimate best.'' Baseball players, gymnasts and other athletes know about this, he adds, but so can the person trying to get in shape after a day at the office. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"34046"	"he"	"adds"	" But Holman is not celebrating. For one thing, his bottom line still looks pretty weak. He says his income this year _ after expenses but before taxes _ from the truck he operates and a second trailer that he rents out will total $18,000 at most. And if ranchers keep cutting back their herds, he adds, he might have to go out hustling for business again. ``I read where the economy is getting better every day,'' he said. ``But I live in a farming and ranch area. It doesn't look like it's getting better here.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"34169"	"he"	"adds"	" But Holman is not celebrating. For one thing, his bottom line still looks pretty weak.

It doesn't look like it's getting better here.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"34208"	"she"	"adds"	" Still, she adds, ``It's not good for me to be demeaned and diminished by that 'cause I've got a lot to do and I need my confidence and I need my hope high. That sort of chipping away isn't good. No, we don't let that happen.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"34274"	"he"	"adds"	" J. Davitt McAteer, Labor Department Assistant Secretary for mine safety, acknowledges a major criticism of the agency: miners receive an extraordinary amount of special attention compared with all other workers. But, he adds, no other workers are subject to such peril. Once a hazard is removed from a factory, he said, it is likely to remain removed. But nothing stands still in a coal miner's factory. ``It's an extractive process,'' McAteer said. ``You renew the dangers every 24 hours.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"34441"	"he"	"adds"	" Even so, he adds, he felt compelled to write a musical just to see if he could do it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"34488"	"he"	"adds"	" In fiscal 1995, the PTO had revenues of over $600 million, and Congress diverted $20 million, a sum Lehman characterizes as ``survivable.'' But, he adds, the total of funds diverted since 1990 is close to $60 million. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"34574"	"she"	"adds"	" In this initial conversation, less is often more, says Shure. ``Some parents can't bear to see their child upset an STORY IN d they try to distract them, move them on too quickly.'' But that doesn't give a child a chance to digest her feelings. ``Avoid saying such things as, `You tried your hardest,' because right now, that isn't comforting.'' Besides, she adds, an upset child can't even hear what you are saying, let alone take it in. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"34760"	"he"	"adds"	" Brodigan is speaking, of course, about completed homes. Log construction itself, like any other building project, he adds, can be anything but calming. ``Log building has ruined many marriages,'' he said, probably due to the time factor. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"34890"	"he"	"adds"	" At the company's insurance unit, profit increased 31 percent to 25.9 million pounds. Shipping profit declined 19 percent to 6.1 million because of currency losses. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950925.0202 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-WAY-TO-GO!-TRAVEL-ADVISORY-NYTSF) </DATELINE> <TEXT> The following six articles are in The New York Times Syndicate's ``WAY TO GO!'' travel package for release the week of Oct. 1, 1995.

By LINDA MARSA c.1995 Omni magazine (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  A major bank was about to approve a huge loan when the institution's officials called the Detective Information Network to do one last check on the applicant before they forked over nearly a million dollars.  They were glad they did. A little probing revealed their prospective client was a real miscreant who'd done prison time for convictions on 11 counts of fraud _ including lying on a loan application.  It was a close call for the greatly relieved bankers _ but all in a day's work for the network's investigators, who've been dubbed the ``Sam Spades of Cyberspace.''  Instead of a 38-caliber pistol and a nose for trouble, these cybersleuths are armed with PCs and modems which dial into nationwide databases.  These high-tech snoops can sniff out clues about the whereabouts of missing heirs, deadbeat dads and long-lost relatives.  They can unearth hidden property for those in the midst of a divorce or for creditors looking for assets in a bankruptcy, or find out if job applicants have inflated their resumes.  Best of all, they can ferret out this information without ever leaving their Washington, D.C.-area office.  ``We couldn't have done this 10 years ago _ the impact of technology is just incredible,'' says Charles Pinck, the network's research director, who believes the computerization of public information has completely changed the detective business.  An electronic wizard who loves to prowl through public records, Pinck's penchant for cloak-and-daggering seems to be genetic.  His father served under the legendary Wild Bill Donovan in World War II's OSS, forerunner of the CIA. Pinck himself honed his craft digging up dirt on political candidates.  ``No one is going to mistake me for a choirboy,'' he cheerfully admits.  Pinck started the network in 1994 with Francis Dillon, a retired general and former director of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.  It seemed like a good combination of talent _ the military cop from the old school and the young turk who can deftly surf the Net.  ``We knew lots of people needed investigative advice from experienced pros but couldn't afford the services of a regular private eye,'' says Dillon, the network's managing director. ``So this fills that niche.''  They also tapped into the vast pool of retired investigators _ ex-informants, FBI and Secret Service agents _ in the nation's capital to do consultations with callers to their hot line.  ``We work with clients to narrow their search and figure out exactly what they're looking for,'' Dillon says.  Then for $30 to $40 an hour, the detectives scour cyberspace for any red flags such as bankruptcies, liens, judgments or problems with the IRS.  They scan databases to retrieve news items, voter registration and driving records. They can also look up information on prior court appearances, both criminal and civil.  The network, which claims an 80 percent success rate in locating missing people, has solved some intriguing cases by sifting through information on the infobahn.  A Texas man, for instance, was considering investing in a new airline. But before shelling out $10,000, he asked the network detectives to do a background check. They hit paydirt.  The airline's chairman had headed other dubious ventures and had been sanctioned by the Securities and Exchange Commission for selling $300,000 of unregistered stocks.  In another case _ these guys handle both commercial and domestic requests _ a woman had given her baby son to an American soldier in post-World War II Germany. She later married, had a family and emigrated to the United States. Now in failing health, she longed to be reunited with her son.  ``We got lucky because the Army officer had an unusual name,'' Dillon recalls. A national surname database that combines telephone directories and census records uncovered four possibilities. ``We let the family make the final calls,'' Dillon says.  ``People could execute many of these searches themselves,'' Pinck says. But they don't have the time or the patience. They don't know what to look for or where to look. Some are intimidated by the technology.  So for about $25, network staffers can tell you how to do it yourself. Sometimes a nudge in the right direction is all that is needed to jump-start a search.  While it may be true that new technologies and the accessibility of public databases increases opportunities for fraud and flimflam, if the Detective Information Network has its way, these same technologies will prove to be invaluable resources for professional and amateur detective alike.

By DEVERA PINE c.1995 Omni magazine (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Take one helium balloon the size of the Empire State Building, attach a cabin 8 feet in diameter, throw in three crew members and lots of scientific equipment and send the whole thing 24 miles up and on a journey around the world.  The result? Odyssey, the first manned balloon expedition to circle the world while floating through the stratosphere.  If all goes well, the privately organized, all-volunteer expedition will launch in July 1996.  Although unmanned balloons have flown around the world in the stratosphere, Odyssey will be the first manned flight to do so _ and it will be the longest manned flight ever, lasting 18 days to 22 days.  In total, Odyssey will set three all-time records for manned balloon flights: altitude, distance and duration.  Moreover, Odyssey will be the first balloon _ manned or unmanned _ to fly around the Northern Hemisphere.  Until recently, politics prevented such flights. ``In the old days, getting shot at was certainly a consideration,'' says Robert Golden, director of the Particle Astrophysics Lab at New Mexico State University and Odyssey's volunteer chief engineer. (Golden died shortly before this article was published). ``You wouldn't have wanted to violate Soviet airspace with one of these things.''  With the end of the Cold War, Odyssey can now sail worry-free through the Northern Hemisphere _ though the crew still plans to avoid North Korea.  Flying at about 129,000 feet, Odyssey will qualify as a ``near-space'' balloon. The view from the windows of the gondola will look a lot like the view from a space-shuttle porthole _ the sky will be black, the stars may be out during the day and the blue band of the earth's atmosphere will be visible.  If the crew members have to make an emergency exit, they'll don pressure suits and portable oxygen tanks and free-fall to an altitude where they can open their parachutes _ and breathe. Needless to say, crew members Troy Bradley, Bob Martin and Mark Sullivan all have considerable experience parachuting.  More importantly from a scientific standpoint, Odyssey will fly above 99.9 percent of the earth's atmosphere, in the middle of the ozone layer. As a result, the expedition's organizers have consulted with scientists who want the balloon to carry experiments focusing on the ozone layer.  ``No one has flown (ozone experiments) that high for that long,'' says Kevin Roark, volunteer public-affairs director for the mission and a public-information specialist at Los Alamos National Lab.  Odyssey has yet another leg up on unmanned balloon flights when it comes to carrying out ozone research. Having a crew on board means the experiments don't have to be autonomous.  In between monitoring experiments, the crew will deal with living in the confines of the pressurized aluminum cabin.  In terms of people per cubic foot of space, the balloon has about as much room as the space shuttle, Golden says. But, he adds, ``the balloon won't have the advantage of zero gravity, which allows you to pack more people in.''  In addition to three crew members, Odyssey's gondola will house about 300 pounds of science instruments, batteries to power them as well as food and other supplies. The crew members will sleep in shifts in a bunk above the instrument rack. Odyssey's designers squeezed in a private toilet but no shower.  The similarities between Odyssey and the space shuttle haven't been lost on NASA, which plans to test the balloon's crew before, during and after the trip.  Like the crews of both long-duration shuttle flights and the not-yet-built space station, Odyssey's team must face cramped quarters, high altitudes and a demanding workload.  The information on crew interaction could prove invaluable to the agency as it examines the challenges involved in keeping astronauts in space for extended missions.  For instance, NASA will study how the crew works together in a potentially stressful and dangerous situation.  ``The gondola is 8 feet in diameter, you've got three people in it and you're flying an extremely complex aircraft. One mistake and you could have serious problems,'' says crew member Martin, a science reporter for KRQE-TV in New Mexico and a commercial pilot.  Another NASA experiment will monitor the crew's exposure to radiation. ``We know that people who fly on airliners get more radiation than people on the ground,'' Golden says. ``What's it going to be like for future hypersonic aircraft flying at the altitudes where our balloon is going to be?''  Other studies will track meteorological data, particularly information on thunder and lightning because the balloon is likely to fly over the top of thunderstorms.  Golden, who has sent experiments up in unmanned balloons, hopes that the mission will also improve the efficiency of balloon-piloting methods, opening the way for longer unmanned flights.  ``I have a 6,000-pound instrument that we fly about once a year for about a day, looking for antimatter,'' he says. ``We can't afford to fly it on a satellite. But a week on a balloon _ it's a poor man's satellite.''  Scientific concerns aside, however, the real force behind the mission lies in the quest for adventure. ``I always wanted to get on the shuttle,'' Martin says. ``This may be about as close as I'll ever get.''

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Jason Priestley in a scene from ``Coldblooded.'' By MICHAEL SZYMANSKI Distributed by New York Times Special Features  Slapping his hockey stick to the ground, Jason Priestley smashes into comedian Mike Myers, steals the puck from Jason Hervey (``The Wonder Years'') and passes it to actor Peter Berg, who scores against goalie Andrew Shue (``Melrose Place'').  As the crowd in the stands roars, hockey great Wayne Gretsky high-fives Priestley, who then jeers at the stars on the opposing team.  The action is part of a charity game being played by members of the Hollywood All-Star Hockey League on a back lot at Universal Pictures' studios.  The star of the day is Priestley _ best known as Brandon Walsh on ``Beverly Hills 90210'' _ who is playing every bit as hard as the hockey pros on both teams.  ``In reality, I'm more competitive than I think Brandon would be,'' Priestley explains from the sidelines during a break in the action, ``but I'm certainly not as brutal as Cosmo. That guy's coldblooded.''  Cosmo is the character Priestley plays in the new movie ``Coldblooded,'' a black comedy that has opened in selected cities and will be released in others throughout September and October.  A few days later, when Priestley is out of his hockey togs and into his actor mode, he elaborates on the role that he _ and many critics _ think is his best to date: Cosmo, a mob hit man-in-training.  ``Cosmo is a blank canvas. He doesn't have hobbies like hockey,'' Priestley says during an interview in his agent's Hollywood office. ``He allows other people to paint colors on him, and even the people who Cosmo kills all color him one way or another and give the guy some sort of personality.''  The 26-year-old actor kicks his feet up on a desk and leans back on his chair, puffing on a Marlboro and rolling back the sleeves of his checked shirt. Dressed in pressed gray slacks and black shoes, with his hair in a high, flat-topped style, Priestly looks very much like his ``90210'' character. But unlike Brandon Walsh, the actor sports a slight mustache and beard.  ``I'm very proud of my work in this film, and it should help my movie career,'' says Priestley, whose feature credits include ``The Boy Who Could Fly'' (1986), ``Tombstone'' (1993), ``Nowhere to Run'' (1993) and ``Calendar Girl''(1993).  ``This is my best. People will be shocked.''  Priestley's ``Coldblooded'' character is a nerdy bookie for the mob who lives in the basement of a retirement center and leads a relatively boring life. His only distractions are his television set and occasional visits from his prostitute girlfriend Honey (Janeane Garofalo).  Things change dramatically when the mob boss (Robert Loggia) decides to turn Cosmo into a hit man and instructs veteran mobster Steve (Peter Riegert) to show Cosmo the ropes.  Riegert, who had never seen an episode of ``90210,'' says he was not sure what to expect from one of America's hottest teen idols.  ``Jason surprised me. He was terrific to work with,'' Riegert says during a separate interview. ``He knew how to underplay the role using great subtlety.''  As the film progresses, Cosmo realizes his new talent in gun marksmanship and becomes an accomplished, unflinching hit man. He also falls in love with a beautiful yoga instructor, played by Kimberly Williams, which complicates his life.  The movie was produced by Snowback Productions, the company headed by former ``Family Ties'' star Michael J. Fox.  In a cameo role, Fox plays one of Cosmo's victims. This allowed Priestley and Fox, who are off-screen friends, to work together for the first time.  ``I got a lot of satisfaction out of killing Michael J. Fox,'' Priestley says with a smile. ``We were doing the scene and I said, `Mike, how did we end up here like this, two kids from Vancouver where there are no guns?'  ``Here we are doing this movie and Michael is covered in blood. I think it was the first time he ever died on film and I was honored to do it.''  ``Coldblooded'' was written and directed by first-timer M. Wallace Wolodarsky. Shooting was completed in a little more than three weeks, with Priestley helping to make some changes in the script.  ``There's a line at the very beginning of the film that I added where a caller asks if I can make a suggestion (to the mob) that we take booking action on hockey games,'' says Priestley, who has played ice and street hockey since he was a child.  Hockey is one of the few hobbies Priestley still has time for as he juggles movie roles with his acting, directing and producing work on ``90210.''  The Canadian-born star says he is happy hockey is finally being taken seriously by Americans.  ``It got a bad rap because of all the fights going on during the games,'' Priestley says. ``But it's a different game now.''  Priestley enjoys both watching and playing hockey _ especially when he gets a chance to participate in games that help raise money for charities. Through the charity work, he has become friendly with hockey stars such as Gretsky, Brett Hull and Mark Messier.  ``It's fun because I get to hang out with my hockey idols and have a beer with them after the games,'' Priestley says. ``That's cool!''  In addition to his affinity for hockey, Priestley says he has an interest in guns _ which came in handy during his work on ``Coldblooded.'' Though the actor taped a gun-safety video for the National Rifle Association several years ago, his ``Coldblooded'' character routinely mishandles his weapon, even scratching his head with the barrel at one point.  ``This is not a gun-safety movie,'' says Priestley, who has several guns of his own. ``It's a gun comedy.''  Guns played a big part in the final all-night shoot for ``Coldblooded,'' which took place at a firing range. Director Wolodarsky, Riegert and Priestley watched the sun go down, filmed their scenes and watched the sun come up.  ``It was a surreal night, real spooky _ and it comes across on film. We were shooting real rounds and I'm pretty good with a gun,'' Priestley says. ``I'm absolutely comfortable with a gun. But could I actually take a human life? I don't know.''  Lack of a killer instinct is one way Priestley differs from his film character. The two also have distinct temperaments.  ``I'm not as calm as Cosmo. I'm a more of a kinetic kind of person,'' Priestley says. ``There was this guy in high school I knew who would walk around alone and talk to rocks and stuff, and he reminds me of Cosmo.  ``I'm a bit offbeat myself in real life, but not that bad. Yet I'm not really as straight-laced as Brandon either.''  Fans may be surprised to learn that Priestley sometimes participates in chat groups on the Internet, using the sign-on of a friend.  ``I'm amazed at how much people gossip about meeting me in places I've never been and all kinds of other stuff,'' he says. ``I'm really just a regular guy.''  Though he hates the ``icon'' label that his hit TV show has brought him, Priestley says he expects to stay with ``90210'' for several more years.  ``Will our show be like the `Brady Bunch' in the year 2010? I wonder about things like that,'' Priestley says. ``It's kind of weird to be a part of that.  ``Will they put the Walsh kitchen in the Smithsonian museum? Will there be a reunion show? Will they do a movie with a whole new cast? Will some of us never work again?''  He's doing everything he can to prevent that and says he wouldn't mind making another quirky picture like ``Coldblooded.''  ``This is the first time a film turned out as I imagined it would,'' Priestley says. ``I laughed out loud when I read it, it was so twisted.''  While he has certainly been successful thus far, Priestley concedes he may never achieve his goal of becoming the modern-day Cary Grant.  ``I've been a huge Cary Grant fan all my life,'' the actor says. ``When I was growing up I aspired to be like him.  ``Unfortunately, it looks like Hugh Grant filled those shoes. God, he's a charming guy, isn't he? I hate him.'' c.1995 Michael Szymanski  (Michael Szymanski is a Hollywood-based free-lance writer.) ------------------------------------------------- (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448; fax: 816-822-1444.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Linda Fiorentino in a scene from ``Jade.'' By CINDY PEARLMAN Distributed by New York Times Special Features  A reporter walks up to Linda Fiorentino in the lobby of New York City's Regency Hotel and proceeds to give her a line.  ``So, Linda,'' he says in a Texas drawl. ``I hear that your new movie is a lot like `Basic Instinct.'''  Apparently, this comparison doesn't sit too well with the actress.  ``Let's get this straight,'' she says bitingly. ``I am no Sharon Stone.''  Undaunted, the man presses on.  ``I know 10 guys who would leapfrog over Sharon Stone to get to you,'' he says.  Fiorentino doesn't crack a smile. Cool, calm and collected, she reaches into her purse and takes out a notebook.  ``Here's a piece of paper,'' she says with an icy stare. ``List these men. Don't forget the phone numbers.''  One thing is clear from this encounter: Fiorentino is one tough cookie.  And that's just the kind of woman she plays in the new movie ``Jade,'' which will open nationwide Oct. 13.  Fiorentino stars as Trina Gavin, a psychologist by day who is a sexy adulteress by night. Upset over her hubby's infidelities, she decides to show him that two can play that game.  Like Stone's character in ``Basic Instinct'' (1992), Gavin may also have the nasty habit of killing the men she takes to bed.  David Caruso co-stars as an assistant district attorney who investigates a murder in which Trina may be a suspect. He also happens to be Trina's college boyfriend.  Fiorentino has come to the Regency today to promote ``Jade,'' which was written by Joe Eszterhas and directed by William Friedkin.  Dressed in a black stretch catsuit, she stalks her way into one of the hotel's suite and begins sizing up the journalists who have come to interview her.  The men in the room seem to be easy targets for the 35-year-old actress's rapier wit.  A male reporter starts out by telling Fiorentino that her ``Jade'' co-star Michael Biehn (who plays a homicide detective) recently received some sexy nighties from a fan through the mail.  ``What's the weirdest gift a fan ever sent you?'' he asks.  ``Michael got the lingerie! I was hoping it got to him,'' Fiorentino says with a husky laugh.  Actually, lingerie is something with which Fiorentino became quite familiar during the many explicit sex scenes in ``Jade.''  During an earlier interview, Chazz Palminteri (who plays Gavin's cheating husband) said that the love scenes he shared with Fiorentino made him a bit uncomfortable.  ``Linda had a certain confidence,'' the actor said. ``We'd get on the set and _ whoosh! _ her clothes were off. I was nervous. I haven't done many love scenes.''  When Fiorentino hears this her eyes light up.  ``Had I known that Chazz had never done a sex scene before I would have been more gentle with him,'' she says. ``I always am with any virgin I encounter.''  Then, on a more serious note, the actress admits that those erotic scenes weren't really easy for her, either.  ``Look, I come from a family of eight kids,'' she says. ``We were a good Catholic family, which means I think my mother had sex eight times.''  Another male journalist decides to pounce on this statement.  ``If your family was so uptight,'' he says, ``how did you become such an exhibitionist in this movie?''  Fiorentino tosses him a long, penetrating stare that could stop a clock. He squirms.  ``I don't understand,'' she says finally. ``Are you asking me if I run around naked all the time?''  The reporter blushes and begins to stammers. ``No, no. I didn't _ uh, I'm sorry.''  Satisfied with this reaction, Fiorentino decides to answer her own question.  ``Yes, I did run around naked all the time,'' she says. ``When I was 6 years old. I guess that's how I got the guts for `Jade.'''  A few moments later, she reveals how her own attitudes toward sex differ from those of her character.  ``I'm not really sure if I am free about sex,'' she says. ``I look at the things I do in `Jade' and have to justify it by saying it's not me. It's just me playing a role. It's a movie.  ``It's part of the job to pretend that you're not inhibited when you're doing a sex scene. After the fact, I freaked out. At the end of the day on `Jade' I was like, `Oh, my God! I did that?'  ``But it's just part of the job.''  And it's a job that Fiorentino almost passed on.  ``I was skeptical going in,'' she says. ``I didn't know if I could do this part because it was representing a man's idea of what a woman is. The fantasy seemed more male than female.  ``I decided her extracurricular activities were an extreme reaction to finding out her husband was unfaithful. Wealth and power replaced sex in that relationship. And she wanted the power.''  Trina is not the first powerful woman Fiorentino has portrayed. She garnered a great deal of publicity for her role as femme fatale Bridget Gregory in last year's ``The Last Seduction.''  ``When I read the script I just thought, `This is my part. No one else will get it.' I walked into director John Dahl's office and made that very clear. I said, `John, no one else plays this part but me.'''  Gregory is a woman who steals her husband's hot cash, then moves to a small town where she becomes a ruthless, murderous vixen.  ``It was a therapeutic role,'' Fiorentino says. ``Sure, this woman was not exactly a role model for little girls, but she was smart. She was a professional. She was unique.''  It was also a role Fiorentino knew could have a big impact on her career.  ``I thought if anybody ever saw the film, it would either change my life or ruin it,'' she says. ``If it didn't touch a nerve in people, then I don't know what would have happened. It was a real gamble.''  The gamble paid off with a Best Actress award from the New York Film Critics Circle and a near nomination for an Academy Award. The latter was canceled after ``Seduction'' was declared ineligible for Academy Award consideration because it had premiered on cable television.  Even without an Oscar, Fiorentino is on her way to becoming a true Hollywood star.  But it's the work that interests her, she says, not the fame. She doesn't read Hollywood power lists and she doesn't really care who's hot and who's not.  ``Does anyone really care?'' she asks with a sigh.  ``Some people do,'' a male journalist suggests.  Fiorentino flicks him off like a fly. ``They do? I don't know anybody who cares if they're hot. But maybe that's because I keep good company.''  That said, she won't reveal much about the company she keeps. This is one actress who wants to keep her private life private.  The one thing she will say is that she grew up in a family of eight children in South Philadelphia.  After graduating from Rosemont College with a degree in political science, she was thinking about law school. Instead, on the advice of a teacher, she moved to New York to study at the Circle in the Square Theater.  Her first film work came a few years later when she landed a role in the high school wrestling melodrama ``Vision Quest'' (1985).  ``The whole movie made me miserable, but I was just out of school,'' she says. ``What could I do? I didn't have a million choices.''  Afterward, she showed up in Martin Scorsese's ``After Hours'' (1985), playing a kinky sculptress, and Alan Rudolph's ``The Moderns'' (1988). A small role as Joe Mantegna's very upset wife in ``Queens Logic'' followed in 1991.  Fiorentino met Dahl when she tested for the role that went to Lara Flynn Boyle in the director's 1993 film ``Red Rock West.'' He remembered her later on, when he was casting the role of Bridget in ``The Last Seduction.''  Fiorentino has teamed with Dahl again for ``Unforgettable'' in which she portrays a scientist who discovers a memory drug. That film will be released later this year or early in 1996.  Though the actress hasn't chosen a follow-up role as yet, she's been told that Quentin Tarantino is dying to work with her.  ``That would be a riot,'' she says, laughing.  Since she seems to be in a good mood at the moment, another male journalist decides to step up to bat.  ``Could you have handled this success 10 years ago?'' he asks.  ``I can't predict what would have happened,'' Fiorentino replies. ``I suspect because I have 10 years of abuse behind me that I handle success a little differently. I think I'm more aloof than I otherwise would be.''  Another male journalist pipes up and asks: ``What constitutes abuse?''  Fiorentino shoots him daggers. ``What constitutes abuse for women in Hollywood?'' she snaps. ``Use your imagination, pal.''  Sharon Stone would have been proud. c.1995 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.) ------------------------------------------------- (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448; fax: 816-822-1444.)

Polar bears, caribou and Eskimos are found north in the Arctic.  3. Tourism to Antarctica is still in its infant stage and may well remain so because of climatic and environmental considerations. Only about 80,000 people have set foot in Antarctica.  4. Visitors coming ashore on Antarctica's coastline will be greeted by an overpowering aroma _ penguin poop, or guano, as it is known in intimate circles.  5. Antarctica has no hotels or anything remotely resembling tourist lodging. Your cruise ship is your home for the duration of a visit, unless you are invited to stay at a research station.  6. The coldest temperature on Earth was reported at the Vostok Base, located 1,200 kilometers inland (746 miles): a frosty -128.6 degrees Fahrenheit (-89.2 Celsius).  7. Travel to Antarctica is limited to the austral summer, roughly the period of December to February. Otherwise, the weather is too treacherous and unpredictable to safely make the journey, to say nothing of the extremely short winter days and the possibility of your ship becoming ice-locked when the waters surrounding the continent freeze.  8. There are bubbling, hot, volcanic springs at Deception Island. If you are brave enough to remove your parka and strip to a bathing suit, you can enjoy nature's natural Jacuzzi.  9. Antarctica is the highest place on Earth, with more than half of the continent measuring 2,000 meters above sea level (6,562 feet). The highest point is Mount Vinson Massif, measuring 5,140 meters high (16,864 feet). Adventure-travel companies offer climbing treks up Mount Vinson.  10. The only human civilizations are the scientific research stations. Some, such as Chilean Marsh Station and American McMurdo, are quite large and resemble towns.  11. Likewise, there are no shopping malls, freeways, traffic jams, inner cities or coffeehouses. It is the only place on Earth that is truly quiet, more silent than even the desert.  12. Antarctica wasn't successfully traversed by land until 1957-1958 when an English team including Sir Edmund Hillary (of Mount Everest fame) crossed the continent. The previous attempt had been in 1914, when Sir Ernest Shackleton's ship froze in the ice and was crushed.  13. The first explorer to reach the South Pole, Roald Amundsen, hadn't planned on going south. His lifelong dream was to be the first to reach the North Pole, but when news came that it had been conquered by Robert Peary, he decided to try for the South Pole.  14. The ice cap covering Antarctica is about two miles thick in some areas, developing over millions of years as scant layers of snowfall accumulated and never melted.  15. Antarctica is frozen today, but evidence shows that it was once covered with trees and sustained many forms of plant and mammal life.  16. Gondwana is the name of the ancient supercontinent that is believed to have consisted of Africa, Antarctica, Australia, India, New Zealand and South America. Fossilized leaves and bird skeletons found in Antarctica and its surrounding islands match species found in both Australia and South America.  17. The hole in the ozone layer was first discovered in Antarctica by British scientists at their base in Halley Bay.  18. Antarctica is rich in sea life. Six species of seals, nine species of whales and seven species of penguins call Antarctica home for at least part of the year.  Among numerous other sea birds is the extraordinary Arctic tern, which migrates between the Arctic and the Antarctic _ a total of 25,000 miles per year. The surrounding seas harbor many species of fish and other sea life.  19. Tiny lichen and other minute forms of plant life grow in parts of Antarctica, dispelling the myth that the continent is lifeless.  20. The dry valleys, ice-free zones, more closely resemble alien worlds than anywhere else on Earth. NASA carried out much of its work there before sending the Viking probe to Mars.  21. The Antarctic environment is extremely fragile, its ecosystem unable to tolerate any disruptions. A footprint in a rain forest might disappear after half an hour, but in the Antarctic, it might take 10 years.  Tourists must strictly adhere to the guidelines and rules given them before going ashore. It can sometimes be literally a matter of life or death. Storms can blow up without warning, and evacuation must take place with utmost speed.  22. Traces of pesticides have been found in the ice, which gives scientists a good idea how widespread the pollution of our planet is.  23. Antarctica belongs to no single nation, although several nations have laid claim to the continent based on discoveries by early explorers. The Antarctic Treaty of 1961 did not actually settle the disputes, but merely shelved them. Its purpose was to ensure international cooperation.  24. Greenpeace and other conservation groups would like to make Antarctica a ``world park'' to be used for peaceful purposes only, ensuring that all wildlife will be protected and the continent will never be exploited. So far the first step in that goal has been the attainment of a 50-year moratorium on mineral and oil exploration.  25. Antarctica is simply, without question, the most beautiful place on Earth and one that still remains unconquered.

Medvedow writes in the catalog that in the Gardner project, Munoz follows in the time-honored tradition of an artist paying homage to a predecessor _ a tradition epitomized at the Gardner by the Titian ``Rape of Europa'' hanging over Van Dyck's copy of the work. But, she adds, Munoz also follows the much newer traditions of appropriation and ``readymades.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"

Listen, for example, to Herbert von Karajan's recordings from that period on Deutsche Grammophon, a label once renowned for its finely detailed sense of acoustic place and spectrum. Timbres mix into a featureless wash, and the morass of orchestral sound actually diminishes the effect of the performances.

But sometimes useful, he concedes.

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) By ANN E. LaFORGE c.1995 Child magazine (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Most parents want to raise kids who will contribute to the good of the world. But these days, it's hard to know what values to teach and how to convey them most effectively. Everybody from politicians to preachers seem to have a different idea of right and wrong.  ``Many parents are insecure or uncertain about how to teach values to their children,'' says Richard Eyre, co-author of ``Teaching Your Children Values'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1993). But, he adds, ``Who would you rather have influencing your child _ you or MTV?''  Even if you don't have all the answers, you can still raise a moral child. In fact, children usually begin to learn values from the little things you do, like hugging them when they do well and teaching them to say ``Thank you'' even when they don't want to.  ``Kids learn right from wrong mainly by observing the actions of their parents,'' says Michael Schulman, co-author of ``Bringing Up a Moral Child'' (Addison-Wesley, 1985)  Accordingly, here are 40 ways to raise a caring kid. -0-  1. The magic word. Teach your children ``magic'' words like ``thank you,'' ``please'' and ``excuse me.'' Whenever they use one, act like you're under their spell and quickly grant all polite requests, as long as they're reasonable.  2. Tea for two. Have a dress-up tea party with your children. Ask them to invite their favorite stuffed animals. Then, try to outdo each other's politeness.  3. Lend a hug. Give a special hug or a pat on the head or shoulder when your children are being nice to someone or simply behaving.  4. Rock the vote. Take your children along with you when you vote, and explain why it's important to cast your ballot at election time.  5. Honesty policy. Always answer your child's questions truthfully.  6. Praise others. When you and your children encounter helpful or polite people, make note of their kindness.  7. Pillow talk. Every night, when you tuck your children in, ask them, ``What was the best part of the day?'' and ``What was the hardest part of the day?'' Then zip your lips and listen to what's on their minds without judging, lecturing or interrupting.  8. The if ... then game. If someone you don't often see is about to visit your home, play an if ... then game to help your children make guests feel welcome. You present the if part _ ``If Susan likes crayons ... '' _ and have your children supply the ``then'' _ `` ... then we can color.''  9. Sort and save. Have your children put cans, bottles and newspapers in recycling bins. Be environmentally creative, and encourage them to find new uses for old things.  10. Be kind, rewind. Make sure your children see you rewinding videotapes, and explain why it's considerate.  11. Set goals. Help your children work toward realistic objectives such as saving money for a special toy or reading a certain number of books.  12. Give a hint. When someone says ``Hello'' to your children or compliments them and they don't respond, help them find the polite words _ ``Come say `Hello' to Ms. Jones, Ann.''  13. It's cool to be kind. Acknowledge any acts of kindness your children initiate _ ``It was nice of you to help your sister.'' Be sure to praise your children, as well as the action.  14. Fight fair. When you and your spouse disagree, avoid making hostile, accusatory remarks, casting blame or and calling each other names. Find a way to compromise and make up.  15. Vent creatively. When you're angry, do something you'd like your children to do. For example, draw a picture of how you feel or rip up some old newspapers instead of lashing out.  16. Hands off. Establish a no-hurting policy at home. Send any overly aggressive child to a designated ``cool-down'' spot.  17. A friend in deed. Take your children with you to visit and help care for people who are less fortunate. Explain how good it makes you feel to you help others.  18. Ask first. Always ask permission before taking, using or throwing away something that belongs to your children.  19. Movie mania. Plan to watch an inspiring videotape such as ``It's a Wonderful Life'' or ``Beauty and the Beast.'' Make popcorn.  20. Adjective action. Have a contest to see how many adjectives the family can think up to describe how people feel. Set a goal of 50 words such as ``joyful,'' ``cranky'' and ``hopeful,'' and try to meet it. Then post the list and keep adding to it.  21. Talk it out. If another child starts crying on the playground, talk about it. Ask your children, ``How do you think that little boy is feeling right now? What do you think made him unhappy?''  22. Local heroes. Talk about people in your community who are doing good deeds. Read aloud heartwarming newspaper stories.  23. If it doesn't belong to you ...  If your child steals a toy from school, explain why it's wrong to keep it and have him/her give it back.  24. Role reversal. Give your children a chance to see how it feels to be in someone else's shoes: For 10 or 15 minutes, let them pretend to be the parent, while you pretend to be a child.  25. New kid in town. When someone new moves into your neighborhood, pay a ``welcome'' visit with your children and bring along a card or some cookies.  26. Be a clean team. If you and your children notice litter while taking a walk, pick up the garbage and put it in the trash.  27. Second chances. If your children lie about some household episode, contain your anger and remind them how important it is to tell the truth. Then give them a second chance. When they come clean, let your praise outweigh the punishment.  28. Cause and effect. When practical, let your children feel the consequences of their mistakes _ ``If you leave your bike out in the rain, it gets rusty.''  29. Dollars and sense. Help your children learn to manage money by giving them a weekly allowance and letting them decide how to spend it.  30. Do the right thing. Admit to your children that it's sometimes hard to be honest. Praise them when they resist a strong temptation to cheat or lie.  31. Don't send mixed messages. Never ask your child to lie for you _ ``Tell her I'm not here'' or ``Don't tell your dad I bought this.''  32. Thanks, I guess. Teach your children to say ``Thank you'' even for gifts they don't love them. Pretend to give them some funny presents, then ask them to practice saying ``Thank you.''  33. Never break a promise. Don't promise your child a punishment or reward that you cannot, will not or do not deliver _ ``If you don't clean up your room right now, you'll never have another friend over again.''  34. Baby love. Ask older children to help you care for your baby. Have them suggest ways to soothe a crying baby.  35. Bench warmers. Designate a chair as a ``fighting bench'' in your home. When two kids fight, send them to the ``bench,'' where they must stay seated until each child can tell you what he/she did wrong.  36. Mix It Up. join a play group, or find an extracurricular activity for your child that includes people from different racial, religious or economic backgrounds.  37. A ``Hands-off'' box. To reduce battles over toys, have each child decorate a personal toy box. Inside it, keep all the toys that they'd rather not share with siblings or friends who come over to play. Make sure you leave some toys out for all the children to share.  38. Your lips are sealed. When your children face difficult moral dilemmas, such as peer pressure to cheat or steal, resist the urge to supply all the answers. Instead, use role play to help them think through their feelings and find their own solutions.  39. Television talk. When you watch TV or videos, talk about the characters' actions and their effect on others _ ``If that character hadn't lied, he wouldn't be in so much trouble now'' or ``It took a lot of courage for her to tell the truth, but it was worth it in the end.''  40. Fan mail. When your child gives you a special present, send him/her a thank-you note through the mail.  (Ann E. LaForge is a Durham, N.C.-based free-lance writer.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a 350-word sidebar By JOANN GRECO c.1995 A&AMP;E Monthly (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Sit back and imagine your dream house. Everybody has one. Maybe a lush, tropical paradise, sporting a kidney-shaped, mosaic-rimmed pool.  Or an ultramodern mansion, with a media center to house a 50-inch projection television and Bang and Olufsen silver-sleek stereo components?  How about ye olde country estate, where a canopied bed beckons, piled with a glossy magazine's worth of lace-edged pillows and the most sumptuous of downy white comforters?  If given the choice, I'd settle for more closets.  But others _ the truly rich _ dream a little bigger, and for them dreams very often come true.  A century ago families such as the Astors, Hearsts and Vanderbilts tossed their pennies into the air and, voila, the magnificent, European-inspired, turn-of-the-century mansions emerged.  Today, when you peek inside the multimillion-dollar, custom-built homes of the monied, you may notice some differences.  ``Compared to when the rich were trying to emulate the classic villas of Italy or the palazzos of Renaissance Europe, today's wealthy tend to incorporate the latest technology and to look for intelligent buildings,'' says Raj Barr-Kumar, past vice president of the American Institute of Architects.  ``This kind of home is always going to be a statement that you've arrived,'' he says, ``but the way you create comfort and express yourself today is through technological innovations. There aren't so many attempts to recreate Windsor Castle.''  Well, actually, there is the guy in San Jose, Calif., who's trying to unload his 23-room replica of that fortress for $3.5 million. And spiral staircases and marble foyers do still abound. But traditional touches of luxury aside, many megamansions excel in over-the-top indulgences.  Before we get to the extreme, let's begin with the sublime. Let's take a walk in the remote woods of Mill Run, Penn.  Here the modern era of America's castles begins, with Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater, arguably the most famous residence in America other than the White House. Eye-catching, sure, but you'll find no exterior marble facings here, no gilt-edged furnishings, no crystal chandeliers.  Instead, Fallingwater represents the epitome of Wright's philosophy of organic architecture, his ideal of lessening the barriers between nature and structure. The house straddles a stream and is rooted to a rock on top of the property's natural waterfall.  Owner Edgar Kaufmann expected his vacation home to take advantage of the views. He was unprepared for the master builder's response: ``I want you to live with the waterfall, not just to look at it.''  Despite the appearance of its massive exterior and soaring interiors, the 1936 building occupies hardly more than 5,000 square feet, nothing compared to some other modern dream homes.  Yet, the building is awe-inspiring. ``Fallingwater just bowls you over,'' says Joan Wilson, a curator who has worked there for 25 years. ``It's got everything going for it _ gorgeous site, original Wright furniture, original art collection. It's so unusual in every way.'' It cost only $155,000 to build _ and even that was way over budget.  Western Pennsylvania is an unlikely setting for a dream house. In general, the most gorgeous homes are in Colorado, California, Florida or Hawaii.  The Hawaiian estate created by hotelier Christopher Hernmeter may be the pinnacle of uberresidences. This 30,000-square-foot edifice opens onto the corals, deep purples and emerald greens of its setting via a one-ton bronze door that alone cost a cool $1 million.  Through the baronial entrance await Parisian and Florentine antiques, a ``his'' bathroom styled to resemble the burled-walnut richness of an English haberdashery, a 10,000-square-foot master suite, travertine-marble fireplaces, muraled and coffered ceilings, etched glass screens and a roomful of gadgetry for controlling the climate and manipulating the switchless lights and invisible telephones.  ``Hernmeter wanted to create something people would speak of and remember,'' says designer Randy Patton, who helped complete the interiors. Patton says the ultraformal elegance of the home is atypical for Hawaii. ``He wasn't interested in something that evoked bikinis and luaus.''  Waterfront footage means a lot on the West Coast, and architect Robert Earl is particularly proud of his Newport Beach, Calif., masterpiece _ an 18,000-square-foot edifice with a limestone facade and Versailles-style furnishings.  Earl believes that, technology aside, today's castles still ``seek to re-create the flavor of European country homes.'' From the outside, the home looks like a row of Italianate town houses to be found lining a London park.  Inside, the $13 million mansion is a marvel of creamy gentility, with ivory-colored marble flooring, butter-yellow-and-taupe upholstery, gilt-edged furniture, a skylit rotunda in one of the 13 bathrooms and seemingly acres of eggshell-toned draperies.  Louis XIV chairs and French fripperies just wouldn't work at North Star Lodge, a custom-built log home near Aspen, Colo. Still, Honest Abe would hardly recognize this gleaming, gloriously grand ``cabin,'' which serves as a second home for an international lawyer.  Some 550 logs of standing dead spruce and pine add up to a 16,000-square-foot home where everything _ from the imposing dining-room chairs to the rough-hewn staircase _ is made of logs, twigs and branches.  This tour ends in a forest outside Seattle, where software developer Bill Gates _ America's richest man _ is building a 42,000-square-foot estate for $35 million. In a nod to eco-conscious northwesterners, much of the lumber is from old buildings and, upon completion, an extensive reforestation effort will be undertaken.  As befits Gates' hermitlike reputation, the main house will be burrowed into the sloping site, camouflaged with wood, glass and rock, and hidden behind trees.  It's what is inside that is really making architects, technology-freaks and celebrity-watchers take note.  Walls will be hung with flat-panel, high-definition screens, the better to showcase the 100,000 electronic images of works of art Gates owns. As the mogul strolls from room to room, the image he's selected will follow him, or merge effortlessly into the background.  Throughout the house, state-of-the-art and beyond-the-art devices will control electrical and mechanical systems.  Art that moves with you, switchless lamps, invisible telephones. Marble, crystal and gold. Sweeping staircases and sweeping vistas. It's all at your fingertips _ if you've got the money to pay. -0- SIDEBAR: WHAT DO SIMPLE FOLK DO?  Now, let's be realistic. What comforts can the average homeowner expect?  First of all, experts caution, there's no such thing as ``average,'' thanks to variations in location, size and budget.  But according to the National Association of Home Builders and the U.S. Census Bureau in 1993, Mr. and Mrs. Joe Median built a typical new home that was 1,945 square feet at a cost of about $126,000.  Only 13 percent of homes hover near the more-than-3,000-square-foot mark _ and only 9 percent of homes top $250,000. A million or so new homes are built each year _ a minuscule addition to the huge pool of 110 million existing homes.  Of those new homes, more than a third are custom-built, meaning owners turn to stock plans or general contractors rather than selecting an already-built house in a new, speculative development. A 1,600-square-foot home can be bought for $80,000, exclusive of land.  But if you want to approach the range of the supercastles, you need to hire an architect. Fewer than 5 percent of homeowners do that, estimates Raj Barr-Kumar, an architect in Washington, D.C.  ``I'd say the upper bracket begins at a 6,000-square-foot or 7,000-square-foot home,'' he says, before reeling off the standard accoutrements for such a home: ``four-car garage, double-height living room, a grand staircase, preferably in two big swoops, `his' and `her' bathrooms.'' That would place a home in the $1 million range.  Throw in a spa, heated indoor pool, bowling alley and 25-seat theater and we're talking about 10,000 square feet and $3 million. ``An elevator always gives extra cachet,'' he adds, ``and it doesn't even cost a lot, about $25,000.''  ``But,'' Barr-Kumar chuckles, ``designing for the rich isn't necessarily easy. There's always never enough money. Most people want more than their budget can cover _ I'm sure even Bill Gates' budget won't be enough.''

"41077"	"she"	"adds"	" For the most part, though, ``The Price of Love'' takes the high road, thanks largely to a remarkably affectation-free performance by Peter Facinelli as 16-year-old Bret, a runaway who reluctantly drifts into hustling male clients. According to Dr. Lee, incidentally, most of the hustlers' customers, at least in Hollywood, are attorneys and, she adds, ``I think 95 percent are white and 75 percent are married.''

It's got everything, including how to select a kitten or cat, what to do in the first few days, how to train (no, really), and cat psychology, safety and health. Most important, there is plenty in here about the litter box (a topic people are endlessly curious about). Here's a bit of advice for those whose cats occasionally use the bathtub instead of the litter box: leave an inch of water in the bottom of the tub. ``That is a 100 percent effective method,'' the book says. Of course, it adds, the cat may then find an even less convenient place. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"

A positive test, for example, doesn't mean that a woman is doomed to develop the disease, because 15 percent of gene carriers remain cancer-free even by their 80s.

Consenting because he can't figure out how to turn her down, he botches it. But he does meet up with Paltrow's character at the funeral and falls for her again. The trouble is that he also allows himself to be drawn into an affair with the needy older woman, who, among other things, wants to cling to her dead son through the guy she keeps referring to as his ``best friend.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"

"58140"	"she"	"adds"	" For Blake, this is only fair. ``A lot of guys told me that if I could get on the job like anyone else, they'd give me a chance,'' she says. These days, she adds, the only grief she gets from men is in bars. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"

"61905"	"he"	"adds"	" ``Public television was interested in a how-to series, a `This Old House approach,' '' he says. If anything, he adds, interest in genealogy has risen since the Haley project was first proposed. Van Wagenen knew that for the series to work, he would need to find compelling stories to illustrate the how-to material. Beyond that, he reasoned, the right host was necessary to interview professional genealogists. With those concerns in mind, Van Wagenen wandered into a New England genealogical society computer seminar being taught by Jim Willard last summer. Willard, says Van Wagenen, had all the qualities he was looking for, except name recognition. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199606.gz"

Adler, whose company produces the Kathy Lee line, said that it has had occasional problems with the Labor Department over the years but had always settled them ``and gone on without a word in the press _ no television, no nothing.''

Times News Service  ALL 29 DIE IN PLANE CRASH OUTSIDE DETROIT  DETROIT (NYT) _ A twin-engine turboprop plane operated by Comair, a commuter air carrier affiliated with Delta Air Lines, crashed on Thursday afternoon in a snowstorm while approaching the Detroit Metropolitan Airport. All 26 passengers and 3 crew members are believed to have died.  The flight from Cincinnati went down in a field 18 miles southwest of the airport. The Federal Aviation Administration said that the pilot had been approaching the airport's Runway 3 Right and that he had not mentioned anything unusual to the air traffic controller before the crash.  The airport reported that at the time of the crash visibility at the airport was 1.5 miles with snow showers and several layers of clouds. But Doug Dandron, the communications supervisor at the dispatcher's office of the Monroe County Sheriff's Office, which responded to the crash, said there was ``very, very heavy snow.''  VOLKSWAGEN TO PAY GM $100 MILLION IN ESPIONAGE SUIT  DETROIT (NYT) _ Bringing to an end a four-year feud between two of the world's largest companies, Volkswagen AG agreed on Thursday to pay $100 million to General Motors Corp. to settle a lawsuit contending that VW stole trade secrets from GM.  In the settlement, one of the largest in a corporate espionage case, Volkswagen also agreed to buy at least $1 billion worth of auto parts from the American company over the next seven years. While not admitting any wrongdoing, VW said that it ``acknowledges the possibility that illegal activities'' by a team of executives who defected from GM to VW may have occurred.  While the agreement means that both companies can go back to building cars rather than legal cases, the central figure in the case, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, still faces criminal charges in Germany. And the Justice Department is still looking into the matter.  DEMOCRATS CRITICIZE DELAY OF GINGRICH REPORT BY ETHICS PANEL  WASHINGTON (NYT) _ Democrats reacted angrily on Thursday to a decision to delay the release of a full ethics report against Speaker Newt Gingrich until after the House votes on his punishment and suggested that the Republican leader was orchestrating the investigation.  The Democrats demanded that the scheduled vote be postponed.  ``The Republican leadership is trying to bury the Gingrich ethics case by holding the House vote the day after the president is inaugurated, and by releasing the bipartisan ethics report on the day of the president's State of the Union Address,'' said Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the Democratic whip and Gingrich's major political tormentor in the House.  A spokesman for the Republican National Campaign Committee called the Democrats' complaints a political smoke screen to drag out the ethics charges against Gingrich.  STUDY: RED WINE AND GRAPES MAY INHIBIT CANCER  (NYT) _ Grapes and red wine, already heralded for their potential to prevent heart disease, may also harbor a potent cancer inhibitor, according to a study being published Friday in the journal Science.  Researchers at the University of Illinois showed in preliminary laboratory and animal studies that the substance, resveratrol, which is prominent in the skin of grapes, may interfere with the development of cancer on several levels: by blocking the action of carcinogens, inhibiting the initiation and promotion of tumors and causing precancerous cells to revert to normal.  But it is not yet known whether eating grapes or drinking red wine results in biologically useful levels of resveratrol in a person's blood. Researchers have not demonstrated that resveratrol, which is soluble in alcohol but not water, is absorbed by humans who consume it through foods or wine.  HELMSLEY'S WILL LEAVES $1.7 BILLION TO HIS WIDOW  NEW YORK (NYT) _ Except for the $25,000 he left to his longtime secretary, Harry Helmsley bequeathed his entire $1.7 billion empire to his wife, Leona, automatically anointing her as one of the dominant forces in New York City real estate.  Considering the vastness of Helmsley's holdings, his will was a fairly straightforward 18-page document that was filed Thursday morning in Surrogate's Court in Manhattan. By just after noon, the will had been approved by Surrogate Eve Preminger.  The will transfers to Mrs. Helmsley ownership and management over Helmsley's stable of properties, from the Empire State Building and One Penn Plaza to a chain of hotels that includes the Helmsley Park Lane and the St. Moritz. It also gives her the freedom to transfer or sell any properties.  ``Now she's in an extraordinarily important position,'' said Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for the family. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19970109.0724 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-PHOTO-FULL-UPDATE-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> ATTENTION EDITORS: The following photos are part of tonight's N.Y.

Though still the setting for Shakespeare, jazz concerts and chess players, the grim landscape with depressing gray concrete mounds and grassless dog runs seems better suited to the drug dealers and other assorted sleazes who are the main occupants.

Irwin is a prince of clowns with a distinctly nonearthly relationship to the basic laws of motion and anatomy: His very walk, a ballet of graceful awkwardness, suggests someone used to moving in another element.

The show, Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein's follow-up to ``Show Boat,'' opened in 1929 and closed quickly, a casualty of the stock-market crash. It has been performed rarely, and usually with revisions. ``There's a lot of music, a lot of big numbers and a lot of choral work to be done, with only a week of rehearsal,'' he says.

The lab is an attempt, says Ms. Cattaneo, ``to use the resources of this institution to give young directors access to the best directors we know.'' At the same time, she adds, ``we want to get as diverse a group as possible.'' (Frances Roberts/New York Times Photo)  (NYT5) BONN, Germany -- Jan. 9, 1996 -- ADV.

I'm very proud of the variety we offer. Before I came here, it was very gray and very heavy. No one was having fun. I want people to relax and enjoy themselves.''

FOR SUN., JAN. 12 -- EUROPE-THEATER-2-CLR, 1-9 -- Katie Mitchell in Camden Passage, a street in Islington, London, where she won the prestigious Evening Standard Award for directing last year. Last summer, reviewing her production of Euripides' ``Phoenician Women,'' Alastair Macauley wrote in The Financial Times that it was ``one of the finest productions of a Greek tragedy that I have ever seen, and one of the finest of all productions in recent RSC repertory.''

Nordey is trying to revive theater's political idealism in a society that seems no longer interested in ideological debate. While he is praised for his stagecraft, Nordey said he picks his texts for their substance. ``They have to be powerfully poetic, but also have a clear political message,'' he explains.

Ms. Lopez is from the Castle Hill section of the Bronx, not South Texas, and is of Puerto Rican descent, not Mexican. ``But Selena was dark, like me, and had a Latin body, like mine, and didn't try to hide that,'' she says. Gregory Nava, the movie's Mexican-American director and screenwriter, describes Selena as ``the torchbearer for a new generation of Latinos.'' (Craig Stafford/New York Times Photo) *LITE  N.Y.

"86000"	"she"	"adds"	" Canadian acceptance behind her, Bonham Carter expands on the idea of labels and appearances as imprisoning. Although she's well-born (her great-grandfather Herbert Asquith was England's last Liberal prime minister; her great-uncle, Anthony Asquith, directed such notable British films as the 1938 ``Pygmalion'' and the early-'50s ``The Browning Version'' and ``The Importance of Being Earnest''), she insists she's middle-class, not all that posh. For that matter, she adds, she's not all that Anglo-Saxon, either. Her mother, Elena, a psychiatrist, from whom she says she got her looks, is half French, half Spanish. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"86001"	"she"	"adds"	" ``At 30, I think I actually will make a break and accept the responsibility of living like an adult. Living at home has been wonderful. I'm totally spoiled. But the guilt has been awful. I've lately been feeling rather retarded, feeling it's time to engage with life. I don't want to live indefinitely on my own. Presumably, I'll marry and have children.'' Which is as much as Bonham Carter cares to reveal on that subject, limiting her remarks about her relationship with Kenneth Branagh to ``We are going out.'' They talk, she adds, of doing another project together, having appeared in ``Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"86005"	"he"	"adds"	" ``If I had known what I was about to do to my peace of mind, my sanity, my treasury,'' he says now, ``I would have turned my back on it.'' But he continues to do it, he adds, because ``it is my passion and my duty to the American people.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"86175"	"he"	"adds"	" There is no overestimating the role that gospel music has played in the lives of American blacks. Commenting on the early days, writer Amiri Baraka observes that the songs were ``really meant to communicate a whole social life of the slaves that is more or less obscure to the masters.'' Although the African drum was taken away, he adds, ``all music slaves made is like percussive without the drum.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"86311"	"he"	"adds"	" Dr. Richard Marlink, director of the Harvard AIDS Institute, says it may be that doctors are more candid about their role in suicides in San Francisco. But the practice, he adds, ``is more common everywhere than most people talk about. That figure of more than 50 percent doesn't surprise me.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"86354"	"he"	"adds"	" Despite these problems, trial mania is here to stay as a TV staple _ at least for the foreseeable future. ``I definitely think the real-life drama of courtroom on TV has legs,'' says TV Guide's Robins. Adds Abrams: ``I think there are enough cases in the courts which are both terribly interesting ... and signficant that these broadcasts are likely to do pretty well.'' Next up, he adds, ``it'll be Bill Cosby's kid.'' (One can only imagine what kind of a spectacle the JonBenet Ramsey case will be.) </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"

"86474"	"he"	"adds"	" On the phone from his Pacific Palisades home in Los Angeles, Thornton, an Arkansas native, sounds more like Bill Clinton than his gravel-voiced hero. He says his $1 million movie is the culmination of 12 years of fleshing out Karl, both in a series of onstage monologues and in a short film called ``Some Folks Call It a Sling Blade.'' ``It's really the only character I've ever played where I was sad and a little devastated when it was over,'' he says. ``Karl became a real person to everybody.'' The daily toll of contorting his posture and his vocal cords was formidable, he adds, and there was always Chloraseptic on the set. ``It was kind of my tip of the hat to Lon Chaney Sr., because he used to do everything in pain!'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"86738"	"she"	"adds"	" ``It's like a food-starter _ you need some to make some,'' she says in a town of 87 where, she adds, the little library symbolizes that ``learning is alive and well in the Northeast Kingdom.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"86740"	"she"	"adds"	" Most men need only 17 treatments over three weeks, says Dr. Carolyn Lamb, a radiation oncologist at Boston's Joint Center for Radiation Therapy. Typically, she adds, there are few side effects such as nausea. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"86754"	"he"	"adds"	" But, he adds, an upside is, perhaps, that some of that luggage ``makes travel easier. Plus, I just have this _ I don't know _ unquench-able enthusiasm. I probably drive people around me mad with my enthusiasm.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"86857"	"she"	"adds"	" In her reading program, Goldenberg sometimes includes instruction in what she calls hygiene. ``Many kids are wearing what they had on when they left,'' she says. ``Some have arrived barefoot.'' She'll talk about deodorant and shampoos and showering. But before too long, she adds, the talk is less about hygiene and more about fashion. The girls especially, she says, suddenly want to know ``the brand of my lipstick, the name of the shade they've seen on someone, a nail polish color.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"

"87000"	"he"	"adds"	" ``Success overseas usually doesn't mean much,'' concedes Phil Quartararo, president of Virgin Records America, the Spice Girls' American label. ``America is very insular. They may be a big story internationally, but the consumer in Amarillo or Peoria doesn't know what a Spice Girl is yet.'' Virgin, he adds, plans to change all that with a promotional campaign he describes as ``absolutely massive.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"87035"	"he"	"adds"	" Right now, he adds, most experts believe that ``a highly inbred population, or one based on a few parents, should be written off _ that it's doomed to extinction'' because of a lack of genetic diversity. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"

"87266"	"he"	"adds"	" He can do that in part because a dealer is more likely to make money trading with an amateur than with a pro. ``It's like if you run a used-car lot, where you buy cars from some people and sell them to others,'' said Michael Goldstein, a visiting professor of finance at Boston College.

"87774"	"she"	"adds"	" For years, she adds, the residents of Eastern Europe dreamed about the West, dreamed about becoming a part of the Europe that enjoyed freedom and democracy and consumer goods.

"87852"	"he"	"adds"	" Proof of this, he adds, is a recent purchase by Peru of a squadron of MIG-29 advanced fighter jets from Russia. However, Cardamone insists that the lobbyists for the American arms manufacturers are overstating the case, that they already control the largest percentage of the arms export market to Latin America and that they merely want to get a bigger and more advanced product line to generate bigger profits. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"87981"	"he"	"adds"	" ``Tell the people I don't plan to preach,'' says Peck. ``I hope they find the stories amusing.

I hope people don't expect me to be as smart and articulate as the characters I played. After all, I had some great writers and directors.''

"88030"	"he"	"adds"	" Jas Plaa, who has worked for Kritzinger for 19 years, says many at first disparaged the project, using the word Boer, a pejorative term for Afrikaners. And many, he adds, would sell their shares in the farm now if they could. (They cannot for five years.) ``They won't care how much they get as long as it's money,'' he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"88031"	"he"	"adds"	" Kritzinger says he understands. For too long, he adds, the Afrikaners who voted in apartheid said, ``You will get, you will get,'' but they gave nothing. He has his doubts about the scheme, too. He worries that the workers will be so anxious to get cash that they will not want to reinvest any profits in their farm. Without reinvestment, it will fail. A freak hailstorm this year did not make things any better. The profit is not likely to be more than $400 a person. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"

"88355"	"he"	"adds"	" The Wadsworth is stable _ sort of _ although Hartford ranks among the nation's 10 poorest cities. ``We struggle, but at least we have no debt,'' Sutton says, not failing to mention the $31 million the MFA owes. But, he adds, ``I inherited a lot of unfunded projects,'' from former Wadsworth director Patrick McCaughey, who now heads the Yale Center for British Art. Among them is a stellar-sounding show of the Serge Lifar Colnekuion, slated for fall. In 1933, Austin bought the fabled collection of designs for the Ballets Russes that impresario Sergei Diaghilev had given to Lifar, a favorite dancer. The Lifar Collection is key to the understanding of the heady Parisian period when Diaghilev was commissioning collaborations from Stravinsky, Balanchine, Picasso, Prokofiev, Nijinsky, Matisse, and other luminaries. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"

"91421"	"he"	"adds"	" Joseph Olchefske, the superintendent, says added money is less important than principals' flexibility to design enticing programs. And, he adds, it is no solution to increase voucher differentials to make low-income students more attractive. Middle-class schools would recruit struggling pupils only if it was profitable. Such children would have to bring more dollars than their added services cost. Then, money for poor children would be used to benefit the middle class and this, Olchefske believes, would be unfair. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"

I did not feel guilty. When I left, I put on the Mom switch. I did not feel guilty.'' A lot of being a single mother, she adds, ``is controlling guilt. I mean, it's just wasted emotional energy.'' But the fact is that Tilghman rarely hired a baby sitter and walked out of her lab every day at 5:30 p.m. And when her children went to sleep, she opened her work books. In retrospect, Tilghman, whose daughter is a Princeton senior and whose son recently graduated from high school, says she would never do it with so little help again. ``I feel like I was a fool,'' sighed Tilghman, who is a staunch advocate of making the sciences more friendly to women. ``I did it in the most stupid, ignorant way possible.

"106248"	"he"	"adds"	" Shawn is at his best discussing the motivations for Schoenberg's exploration of atonality at the beginning of the 20th century. The works that he and his composer colleagues were then writing, Schoenberg observed, though supposedly tonal (that is, moored to the system of major and minor keys), had become so wayward, so unhinged that it was time to admit that music was in crises and figure out what to do. In Schoenberg's gargantuan oratorio ``Gurrelieder'' (1901), ambiguous and wildly anomalous harmonic episodes ``are still being made to fit, sometimes just barely, into conventional tonal logic,'' Shawn writes. But, he adds, ``just because these harmonies are `prepared' and eventually `resolve,' doesn't mean that something crucial hasn't changed in the language.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"

Two separate presentations made at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science demonstrated the range of global warming's possible consequences, from a boom in the shark population in Alaskan waters to a sharper rise in sea level than previously estimated.  According to Vince Gallucci of the University of Washington, the combined effects of a periodic swing in weather (called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and global warming may be making Alaska's Prince William Sound more hospitable to local sharks.  Meanwhile, Galucci notes, the number of pinnipeds, such as seals and sea lions, has decreased. In fact, Pacific sleeper sharks, which are capable of growing to 24 feet, and the much smaller salmon sharks have replaced the pinnipeds as the second-most efficient predators in the area, behind orcas.  Perhaps even more significant, the very waters these creatures swim in could rise much higher than recently predicted.  After analyzing the melting rate of glaciers on the West Coast of Alaska and northern Canada, Mark Meier and Mark Dyurgerov of the University of Colorado at Boulder have concluded that forecasts made last year by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) failed to take into account an acceleration in glacial and ice cap melting that began in 1988. Since then, Meier says, the rate of ice loss has doubled.  He notes that the Alaskan and Canadian glaciers are important because they currently account for about half of the rate of global ice loss, yet they make up only about one-sixth of total glacial ice area.  In contrast to the IPCC's prediction that glacial melting will elevate sea levels by 0.16 to 0.36 feet, the new calculations indicate that the figure should be 0.65 feet or more.  Although this might not seem large, Meier notes that a 1-foot rise in sea level normally corresponds to a loss of 100 feet of beach. A rise of 1 meter, he adds, would flood half of Bangladesh, displacing 100 million people. A TASTE FOR PROTEIN By SARAH GRAHAM  Protein is an important part of a healthy diet. Now scientists have identified a taste receptor that may play a part in making sure we consume enough of it.  According to a report published online by the journal Nature, the receptor responds to the taste of amino acids, the building blocks of protein.  Charles Zuker of the University of California, San Diego and colleagues discovered and tested the receptor, dubbed T1R1plus3, in both mice and humans. In both species, the team found that the receptor responded to most of the 20 standard amino acids but did not react to similar natural and artificial compounds.  ``Our results,'' the authors write, ``demonstrate that T1R1 and T1R3 combine to function as a broadly tuned amino acid receptor.''  In humans, the receptor is more sensitive to the chemical glutamate than to any other amino acid. A related molecule, monosodium glutamate (MSG), is responsible for evoking the ``umami'' taste.  The researchers further determined that the genes for T1R1 and T1R3, which make up the new receptor, display individual variation. Such differences, they note, could account for subjective differences in the sense of taste. SAY GOODBYE TO FAST-FADING CELL-PHONE BATTERIES By GREG MONE  The days of fast-fading cellular phone batteries may soon be over.  Researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) recently developed a working prototype for a portable fuel cell energy source that could power a cellular phone 300 percent longer than existing rechargeable batteries do. Indeed, the new technology would be less expensive, smaller and more powerful than any battery currently in use, according to Jeff Morse of LLNL's Center for Microtechnology Engineering.  He predicts that it could replace standard lithium-ion and lithium-ion polymer batteries in a number of consumer electronics products, such as laptops and handheld computers.  The new power source, which runs on liquid fuels, has at its core a thin layer of electrolyte materials sandwiched between electrode materials.  As control elements distribute the fuel over one electrode surface, the other receives air. Heating of the electrolyte-electrode layers stimulates the flow of protons from the fuel, sending them across the electrolyte layer to the air-breathing electrode. The protons then react with oxygen to generate electrical current.  Conveniently, recharging the power source requires only a simple switch of fuel cartridges.  The higher energy capacity of this miniature thin-film fuel cell battery ``will lead to further new classes of personal electronics, such as autonomous sensors and communication devices that are not currently possible with existing battery technologies,'' Morse says. ``This will facilitate the integration of voice, data and computing technologies that cannot be achieved with today's technologies.'' -0-  For more information on the topics covered in the Scientific American News Service, visit www.sciam.com.

Charles Zuker of the University of California, San Diego and colleagues discovered and tested the receptor, dubbed T1R1plus3, in both mice and humans. In both species, the team found that the receptor responded to most of the 20 standard amino acids but did not react to similar natural and artificial compounds.  ``Our results,'' the authors write, ``demonstrate that T1R1 and T1R3 combine to function as a broadly tuned amino acid receptor.''  In humans, the receptor is more sensitive to the chemical glutamate than to any other amino acid. A related molecule, monosodium glutamate (MSG), is responsible for evoking the ``umami'' taste.  The researchers further determined that the genes for T1R1 and T1R3, which make up the new receptor, display individual variation. Such differences, they note, could account for subjective differences in the sense of taste. SAY GOODBYE TO FAST-FADING CELL-PHONE BATTERIES By GREG MONE  The days of fast-fading cellular phone batteries may soon be over.  Researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) recently developed a working prototype for a portable fuel cell energy source that could power a cellular phone 300 percent longer than existing rechargeable batteries do. Indeed, the new technology would be less expensive, smaller and more powerful than any battery currently in use, according to Jeff Morse of LLNL's Center for Microtechnology Engineering.  He predicts that it could replace standard lithium-ion and lithium-ion polymer batteries in a number of consumer electronics products, such as laptops and handheld computers.  The new power source, which runs on liquid fuels, has at its core a thin layer of electrolyte materials sandwiched between electrode materials.  As control elements distribute the fuel over one electrode surface, the other receives air. Heating of the electrolyte-electrode layers stimulates the flow of protons from the fuel, sending them across the electrolyte layer to the air-breathing electrode. The protons then react with oxygen to generate electrical current.  Conveniently, recharging the power source requires only a simple switch of fuel cartridges.  The higher energy capacity of this miniature thin-film fuel cell battery ``will lead to further new classes of personal electronics, such as autonomous sensors and communication devices that are not currently possible with existing battery technologies,'' Morse says. ``This will facilitate the integration of voice, data and computing technologies that cannot be achieved with today's technologies.'' -0-  For more information on the topics covered in the Scientific American News Service, visit www.sciam.com.

Two separate presentations made at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science demonstrated the range of global warming's possible consequences, from a boom in the shark population in Alaskan waters to a sharper rise in sea level than previously estimated.  According to Vince Gallucci of the University of Washington, the combined effects of a periodic swing in weather (called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and global warming may be making Alaska's Prince William Sound more hospitable to local sharks.  Meanwhile, Galucci notes, the number of pinnipeds, such as seals and sea lions, has decreased. In fact, Pacific sleeper sharks, which are capable of growing to 24 feet, and the much smaller salmon sharks have replaced the pinnipeds as the second-most efficient predators in the area, behind orcas.  Perhaps even more significant, the very waters these creatures swim in could rise much higher than recently predicted.  After analyzing the melting rate of glaciers on the West Coast of Alaska and northern Canada, Mark Meier and Mark Dyurgerov of the University of Colorado at Boulder have concluded that forecasts made last year by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) failed to take into account an acceleration in glacial and ice cap melting that began in 1988. Since then, Meier says, the rate of ice loss has doubled.  He notes that the Alaskan and Canadian glaciers are important because they currently account for about half of the rate of global ice loss, yet they make up only about one-sixth of total glacial ice area.  In contrast to the IPCC's prediction that glacial melting will elevate sea levels by 0.16 to 0.36 feet, the new calculations indicate that the figure should be 0.65 feet or more.  Although this might not seem large, Meier notes that a 1-foot rise in sea level normally corresponds to a loss of 100 feet of beach. A rise of 1 meter, he adds, would flood half of Bangladesh, displacing 100 million people. A TASTE FOR PROTEIN By SARAH GRAHAM  Protein is an important part of a healthy diet.

"108837"	"he"	"adds"	" Equally striking for many readers will be the essay ``Biblical Archaeology,'' by Lee Levine, a professor at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. ``There is no reference in Egyptian sources to Israel's sojourn in that country,'' he writes, ``and the evidence that does exist is negligible and indirect.'' The few indirect pieces of evidence, like the use of Egyptian names, he adds, ``are far from adequate to corroborate the historicity of the biblical account.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"

"111216"	"she"	"adds"	" Sanderson, co-owner of Jonathan Sprouts in Massachusetts, says that sprout outbreaks have gone down dramatically in the past few years. The January CDC report was based on an isolated incident involving a California company, she adds, noting that sprout sales declined as a result of the January warning. That's primarily because institutions and universities pulled sprouts from their salad bars. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"

"111387"	"he"	"adds"	" In ``Panic Room,'' Foster's character, Meg Altman, and her daughter use their safe room the very night they move into their townhouse/brownstone. Others who invest $12,000 to $500,000 for a safe room may never use it. Corbi suggests thinking of these safe rooms like a spare tire. ``It's something you may never need but you go through life more comfortable having,'' he says. ``God forbid you need it one time, I don't care what it costs, it was worth it.'' It doesn't hurt, he adds, that safe rooms raise the resale value of your home. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"

"112309"	"he"	"adds"	" Finally, he adds, parents who seek to promote closer ties between their children and adult parents should think of themselves as party hosts. ``A good host brings people together, lays out some activity ideas and discussion topics, but leaves it up to the participants to figure out how to have a good time.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"

"113965"	"he"	"adds"	" It was a tournament win that didn't receive the publicity it deserved, so here's a belated round of applause for Michael Welch of Quincy. The sophomore at Central Connecticut State shot 71-71_142 at Triggs Memorial GC in Providence to win the New England Division 1 Championship. Quiet but confident, Welch started the second day with a four-shot lead, then double-bogeyed the first hole. That would have sent many players reeling, so Blue Devils coach Ed Batogowski thought he'd help out. ``I went out to see him and he said, `Coach, that's exactly what I needed,' '' said the longtime coach. ``I had to laugh to myself, but he went and played the next 17 holes in 3 under.'' A former NBA official, Batogowski has been nurturing young golfers at the University of Hartford and Central Connecticut for years.

Yale classmate Martha Minow, a professor at Harvard Law School, shared an office with Carter when both were clerks for Justice Marshall. ``I would be struggling to finish my work,'' Minow says, ``and he would be finished with his and working on fiction.''

Michigan states in a summary of its legal position that its admissions program ``consider(s) race and ethnicity as one of many factors in order to select a diverse student body.''

So they called in Magnus Sandstrm, professor of structural chemistry at Stockholm University. He discovered that an unexpected reaction in the timbers was generating sulphuric acid. From samples of the ship's timber, Sandstrm estimated that the timbers already contained 2 tons of acid. And if the reaction continues unchecked, he adds, it will eventually generate a further 6 tons of sulphuric acid, which would eat away at the wood. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"

A few sentences later, she adds, ``Just as it is with my own dreams, I alone have the opportunity to bring into focus this fragile and volatile kaleidoscope, made of insect's wings; only for me does the keyhole exist, inviting me to spy, while on the other side of the door the disappearance continues little by little, and the only things that will endure are those that I am able to capture and to pierce with a pin to affix them to these pages.''

You'll find pieces on the origins of chess, the ``65th square'' defense, a profile of USCF director Frank Niro, playing solitaire chess, managing time in chess, and Grandmaster Susan Polgar's explanation of the Panov-Botvinnik Attack (If you're intimidated by that, you might want to stick to tiddlywinks.) The cover story looks at ``The Match of the New Century,'' held in Moscow in September 2002. The Russian team, starring the mighty ``three Ks'' -- Gary Kasparov, Vladimir Kramnik and Anatoly Karpov -- went down to surprising defeat at the hands of a ``world team.'' The Russians, who won ``Matches of the Century'' in 1970 and 1980, have asked for a ``revenge match'' in the fall. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20030107.0231 type=multi > <HEADLINE> EDUCATION NOTES AND NEWS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 01-07-03 18:16:00EST (BC-EDLIFE-BRIEFS-$ADV12-) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Here's One Way to Turn Off a Date  There's a home test for pregnancy and a drug test kit for parents. Now there's a do-it-yourself test to see if your drink has been spiked with the date-rape drugs GHB or ketamine _ odorless, colorless sedatives that impair judgment and induce sleep.  The test, made by Drink Safe Technologies in Plantation, Fla., consists of a four-inch cardboard coaster that fits into a purse or pocket. Students can slip it under their beverage and dribble liquid with a swizzle stick or finger on one of two test areas. If the spot turns blue, the drink has been dosed. The company also makes a personal test kit with 20 strips.  The products will be in supermarkets and drug stores early this year, but more than 40 colleges and universities have already ordered them, including the University of Miami and Loyola University in New Orleans. St. Lawrence University in Canton, N.Y., has bought 600 coasters to distribute in the spring.  ``We're working toward developing a proactive and educational approach to distributing the cards,'' said Bettina Straight, assistant director of residential learning communities at St. Lawrence. ``We want them to be used appropriately as an added safety precaution and want to arm our students with information about what to do if they find their drink is contaminated, before or after they have actually ingested some of it.''  Stephen M. Thompson, sexual assault services coordinator at Central Michigan University in Mount Pleasant, is skeptical. For one, the coaster announces its intent: there's a big Drink Safe logo in the center that is designed, its makers say, to scare off potential assailants. But most people who use drugs to subdue a victim are known to their target, Thompson says, ``and the target feels fairly comfortable drinking with them.''  And, he adds, ``most people are not dosed in bars but at private parties. Realistically, at a party, are you going to have these things with you and test your drink with them? The likelihood is you are not.''  Dillydallying: Bad For Your Health  Here's some bad news for students who put off studying: procrastinators get more cold and flu symptoms and have more digestive problems than their punctual classmates.  They also tend toward an unhealthy lifestyle, according to a recent study of 374 undergraduates by the Procrastination Research Group at Carleton University in Ottawa. Student procrastinators are more likely to eat poorly and smoke, and they sleep less and drink more than students who do their homework promptly.  At the root of the problem is an inability to regulate behavior and control impulses _ say, drinking more than you had intended when you sat down at the bar. ``If you're quite impulsive then you're unable to protect one intention from another,'' says Timothy A. Pychyl, a psychologist and co-author of the study. Things can get worse when tasks are impersonal or out of one's control. ``Most assignments are not things that students initiated themselves,'' he says. ``They can lack meaning for that reason.''  Giving a procrastinator a hand-held organizer probably won't change habits in the long term. ``It's not about time management,'' Pychyl says. ``Some people will buy a day planner, fill it in and say that's it for today. It becomes part of the procrastination itself.''  Such dawdling is not unusual. In one survey, 70 percent of the students confessed to academic tardiness. Some favorite excuses: computer failure, leaving a paper at home and the death of a grandmother.  Is That Andromeda or a Truck Stop on the Turnpike? Finally, Focus  When the astronomer Ptolemy stared into the night sky to ``search out the massed wheeling circles of the stars,'' he felt as if he were ``side by side with Zeus himself'' taking in his ``fill of ambrosia, the food of the gods.''  Here's how Prof. Fred Chromey of Vassar College describes gazing at the stars from the typical campus observatory: ``You'd go into this really cold, dark room, clamp your eye to the eyepiece and after a long time of shifting focus, you'd see a _ fuzzy patch!''  Astronomy students long toiled in crumbling, moldy observatories, most built in the early 19th century in the darkest (i.e., most isolated) parts of campus to avoid light pollution. But in the mid-'90s, the cost of video and digital electronics plummeted, while the quality of results improved. With the technology that enabled the camcorder, it became possible to get brighter, crisper images and automatically pinpoint a position. Today's astronomers can view images and data on a computer screen from the comfort of the ``warm room,'' where they used to go to escape the chill of the open-domed observatory.  ``Now a small college can afford $20K and do research that gets you scientific results,'' Chromey said. ``It's a big difference for the students.'' Vassar overhauled its observatory in 1998.  Other campuses have been updating as well. A new observatory at the University of North Texas was completed in April. Eventually, students will be able to operate telescopes 45 miles away from campus via remote control. A Civil War-era observatory at Drake University in Des Moines is considered haunted (a university president and his wife are entombed behind a wall in the lobby). With water damage, a dented bronze dome and warped shutters, it looked the part. A rejuvenated observatory reopened in March.  Alfred University in upstate New York has spiffed up, too. ``We are now able to see objects you used to have the biggest telescopes on Earth to see,'' said G. David Toot, director of the Stull Observatory at Alfred. ``The whole experience is much friendlier. Now telescopes point themselves'' _ after being told, via computer, what to look at. ``Before we put in an automation system, finding some of these more distant targets could take easily 45 minutes to an hour. Now we have it in five minutes.''  Astronomy may be one of the more popular ways to fulfill a science requirement _ in 1999-2000, 163,000 students took an introductory course _ but some things haven't changed. Stargazing is a lonely field: only 202 bachelor's degrees and 199 doctorates in astronomy and astrophysics were conferred in 2000, according to the American Institute of Physics.  ``There always has been a relatively small number of people who are willing to study objects that are very remote and don't have direct application to everyday life,'' said Kevin B. Marvel, deputy executive officer of the 6,000-member American Astronomical Society. ``The pay is generally low and the hours are long and at night, and it requires 10 or 15 years of education in math and science and physics.''  ``Everybody loves the sky,'' he conceded, ``but you have to be devoted to study it for a living.''  Battle of the Campus TV Networks  The rocker Lisa Loeb bakes a banana cream pie; cameras trail the world's shortest porn star as she starts a new life; college kids are voted off a deserted island. This is college network television, where students get their own versions of ``Emeril Live,'' ``The Osbournes'' and ``Survivor,'' and advertisers get access to a desirable, often sequestered demographic.  In a bid to reach coveted 18- to 21-year-olds _ and to fill empty time slots on college stations _ major enterprises like MTV and National Lampoon have entered the college-only marketplace, wherein programming is piped solely into dorm rooms and dining halls via satellite or university cable systems.  ``We're going to really have our laser focus on this audience,'' says Donald Silvey, a programming executive at MTV. ``Everything we do is going to be programmed specifically for them.''  NATIONAL LAMPOON NETWORK: The idea of a national network aimed at college students was hatched in 1995 by five recent graduates sharing a ski vacation. They named it Burly Bear, and Lorne Michaels of ``Saturday Night Live'' became a major backer. National Lampoon bought the struggling network last fall.  Niche: National Lampoon, whose Ivy League pedigree includes producing ``Animal House,'' plans to add its own stamp to Burly Bear's irreverent reality programs and twisted interpretations of mainstream television shows.  Where: 420 campuses, including Duke, MIT and Brown.  What's on: ``Bridget the Midget'' follows the life of a three-foot-tall former porn star who is now an aspiring rock singer. Burly Bear holdovers include ``Half Baked,'' an anti-Martha Stewart cooking show that features celebrities like Shaquille O'Neal and Lisa Loeb sharing favorite, if unappetizing, recipes, and ``Gamers,'' in which two video- game wonks review new releases and crack jokes a la ``Beavis and Butthead.''  COLLEGE TELEVISION NETWORK: Ten years ago, an Atlanta company, Laser Video Network, began installing music video kiosks on campuses. In 1997, it changed its name to CTN and started beaming videos, news, sports and original shows to college television sets via satellite. Now the largest of the campus networks, CTN skips the dorm rooms favored by its competitors and offers 24/7 programming in common areas like dining halls and fitness centers. MTV bought the network this fall.  Niche: MTV for the all-nighter crowd. Executives say they will weave their music programming muscle into the current mix.  Where: 720 campuses, including Fordham, Michigan State and UCLA.  What's on: ``Pay Dirt,'' a job-search series, goes on location to the cubicles and laboratories of entry-level workers (one episode walked viewers through the making of a Twix Bars commercial). ``Backstage Pass'' features behind-the-microphone chats with college music favorites like John Mayer and Savage Garden.  ZILO NETWORKS: Begun in 2000 by two pay-per-view executives, Zilo cross-pollinates original programs with Web activity and live campus events.  Niche: X-Games edginess meets prime time. Extreme sports, emerging music and college-centric versions of reality shows.  Where: 256 campuses, including New York University, University of Southern California and Rutgers.  What's on: In ``Exiled,'' a ``Survivor'' takeoff, nine students swat bugs and compete for scholarship money. In ``Get Stupid,'' students agree to eat cat food, dance naked on dorm roofs and accept other dares for cash.   </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20030107.0232 type=story > <HEADLINE> AFTER ATTACK, CHIRAC EMPHASIZES IMPORTANCE OF FRENCH PEACEKEEPING </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> PARIS  (BC-IVORY-COAST-FRANCE-NY) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"

Stalking is generally characterized by persistent, uninvited attention, with some harm or risk of harm attached, says James Liebman, a professor of criminal law at Columbia University.

That image of mobility, however, has some limitations, he adds, for among young adults 18 to 24, 57 percent of men and 47 percent of women are still living with their parents. One large segment of the population is not free to move. At the end of 2002, Roberts writes, 2,166,260 people were incarcerated as criminals. Statistics from that year, he says, showed that there were 701 prisoners for every 100,000 United States residents, a notable increase from the rate of 601 just seven years earlier, in 1995.

I knew, especially as a woman of color, I really, really wanted to go to Yale, to learn from two of the nation's elite African-American theater artists, she said. But my audition was a dog. And I was just crushed because all I ever wanted was to be in the ring. The ring she is referring to is the cycle of plays that Wilson has written -- from Ma Rainey's Black Bottom in 1984 to his current offering, Gem of the Ocean -- depicting the African-American experience through each decade of the 20th century. While creating the lives of black families onstage, though, Wilson has succeeded in creating another family -- made up of the remarkable corps of actors, largely African-American, who have repeatedly filled roles small and large in his plays. It is a list that includes such mainstream stars as Angela Bassett, Whoopi Goldberg, Phylicia Rashad and Laurence Fishburne, as well as theater veterans like Anthony Chisholm. Hamilton, who ended up going to some school called Juilliard after Yale rejected her, eventually landed a small role in Wilson's 1989 play, Piano Lesson, and is now back on Broadway in Gem.

The building has been photographed only a jillion times.  She thought the photos would help with her final paper in a State University of New York at Albany history class -- Albany, the City and its Architecture. But as Miner sat in her car taking pictures last week, parked between the Capitol and Empire State Plaza, somebody walked by and got the idea she was a threat. The person dialed 911 and gave the Albany Police Department her license plate number.  At 7 a.m. the next day, Miner got a call from her upset mother, Carol, in Rhode Island. The police had called Carol Miner to find out what her daughter, a senior planning on going to law school, was doing with a camera alongside New York's Capitol.  The police officer was really nice, said Ashley Miner, who said the cop was just doing his job.  Carol Miner was worried because she figured a call from the authorities so early in the morning could only mean bad news.  They said, 'This is the Albany police,' and my heart just automatically stopped, she said.  The officer questioned Carol Miner for about five minutes before being satisfied that Ashley was, indeed, just a student. She's never been in trouble, Carol Miner said proudly.  Detective James Miller, a spokesman for the city's Public Safety Department, said the officer's response to the 911 tip was typical. Any slight inconvenience, he said, is outweighed by the ultimate safety of the community.  Ashley Miner wound up calling the officer to explain herself. She said the officer told her the 911 caller believed Ashley was staring at him and looked suspicious.  She said she knew right away who the officer was talking about.  He stopped in front of my car and was staring at me -- that's why I left, she said.  Miner couldn't muster up anger at the conspiracy theorist, either. Because if something had happened, people would be praising him, she said.  What's sad, she said, is that we've created a society where we're that paranoid.  Miner squeezed just three frames before she drove off.  None of them came out.  But her professor, Warren Roberts, still gave her an A on the paper.  --  (Kenneth Aaron can be reached at aaronktimesunion.com) </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20041222.0078 type=story > <HEADLINE> MANY EASTERN UKRAINIANS FEEL FRUSTRATION AS REVOTE NEARS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> DONETSK, Ukraine </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz

IRAQ (Baghdad, Iraq) -- American troops and armored vehicles clamped down on Mosul on Wednesday, a day after an attack on a nearby base in which 22 people were killed -- almost all of them Americans. The military said a suicide bomber probably had carried out the blast, the deadliest single attack on American troops since the war began.the war began.  IRAQ-SECURITY (Washington) -- The U.S. ground commander in Iraq on Wednesday acknowledged that insurgents had a good idea where and when large numbers of American troops in Mosul were assembled for meals, but defended the military's measures to protect the troops. Investigators were still sifting through clues to explain Tuesday's attack on a mess hall in Mosul that killed at least 22 people and appeared to have been the work of a suicide bomber. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Richard B. Myers, and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, at a news conference, repeatedly said that it would continue to be difficult to protect against a determined insurgency, and that it would ultimately be necessary for Iraqi forces to achieve security for their own country. The enemy's got a brain, the enemy alters its tactics, Rumsfeld said. The intimidation brought on by violent attacks, he said, can prevent ordinary Iraqis from providing intelligence, running for office or voting. But they and other military leaders said there are no easy answers when it comes to protecting American troops, especially if they are perceived as an occupying force. By Eric Schmitt.  SAUDI-LIBYA (Cairo, Egypt) -- Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, announced on Wednesday that the kingdom is expelling the Libyan ambassador and withdrawing its own envoy from Tripoli because of a Libyan plot to assassinate the crown prince. Speaking at a news conference in Riyadh, Prince Saud said his country was not breaking off relations, but was taking what he called limited measures despite the ugliness of what happened. Prince Saud said that the Libyan embassy in Riyadh and the Saudi embassy in Tripoli would remain open. He stressed that he did not want the Libyan people to suffer, particularly with the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca and other holy sites starting in January. By Neil MacFarquhar.  MIDEAST (Jerusalem) -- The visiting British prime minister, Tony Blair, said on Wednesday that it was an opportune moment to relaunch Mideast peace efforts, but warned that the Palestinians needed to act against terrorism. Amid the improved regional climate, Blair plans to hold an international conference in Britain early next year that will encourage Palestinian political, economic and security reforms, though Israel will not be participating.

"150607"	"he"	"adds"	" Waltz spells out his theory most thoroughly in the 1995 book The Spread of Nuclear Weapons, co-written with the Stanford political scientist Scott D. Sagan in the form of an extended debate. Updated and republished two years ago to take into account the nuclearization of India and Pakistan, it contains the same arguments Waltz makes today in interviews. Put simply, a war between nuclear powers cannot be decisively won without the risk of total destruction. Since the risk of escalation in any conflict is so high, nuclear states grow cautious. If states can score only small gains because large ones risk retaliation, Waltz writes, they have little incentive to fight. When fighting does break out, it is likely to be a localized proxy conflict like the Korean War instead of, say, a Soviet invasion of Western Europe. Nuclear weapons, he adds, even blunt the urge for territorial expansion, since they contribute far more to a country's security than any geographical buffer could. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"

That's particularly unfortunate, since the camerawork is so good. The camera tends to move only if Demme wants us to notice something, like the worn-away varnish on Young's guitar; both the camera movements and the editing take it nice and easy, like the songs. A shot of the full moon over the Ryman before the concert is especially lovely, not only because it alludes to one of Young's favorite images (blue moon sinking, full moon risin', yellow moon, silver moon, unfulfilled moon) but also because, I swear, it looks like a beacon. </P> 	nyt_eng_200602.gz

It used to be that stock funds would be put in tax-deferred accounts and income-based investment would go in taxable accounts, said Warren McIntyre, the owner of VisionQuest Financial Planning in Troy, Mich.

"163653"	"he"	"adds"	" In My Own Words. Def Jam. 13 tracks. Grade: B Put away that box of tissues, gentle record buyer. The music industry is apparently sensing your pain. The incredible songs. Those dance moves. And then, of course, there's the abs. Missing Usher, aren't you? Well, your good friends at the record labels have rolled out two in-no-way limited editions of the R&amp;B megastar of 2004. In late November came Chris Brown, who rocketed to the top of the charts with a very Yeah!-like smash called Run It! He's a teen Usher. Now comes the young-adult version: 23-year-old Ne-Yo. The already accomplished songwriter behind Mario's No. 1 hit Let Me Love You is beyond the excitement of discovering girls, in general. His voice and music bristle with the borderline delirium of having figured out exactly what about them affects him. It's the little wrinkle over her nose, Ne-Yo sings on When You're Mad. It's the way she makes the hairs on his neck stand up, he adds, sounding very sweet and Michael Jackson-like on Sexy Love. And it's watching her enjoying him, he sighs, in Mirror. But those aren't even the best songs here. He manages to conjure some down-home, Sam Cooke-like soul on Get Down Like That. Then way up in the higher registers, he hits a dead-on El DeBarge in It Just Ain't Right. And of course there's his current chart-climbing hit, So Sick, a post-breakup song with a melody that breezily insinuates itself ? as much of this debut CD does. -- Sonia Murray </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"

She continues: In an obit about a figure in the '60s music scene, you might come across: 'I took Cream on their first trip to America.

"171879"	"she"	"adds"	" But there's nothing special about what goes into an energy bar, Liebman says: It's just sugar, some oil and casein, and a handful of vitamins.
