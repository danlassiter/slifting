(EDs: Adds ADVERTISING-EXEC; DISNEY-LAWSUIT; INFANT-VIDEO; TAX-DEDUCTION; DRIVING-DANGERS; NUNS-ORDINATION and FBN-COACHES)  (Slugline includes the ``HNS'' tag.)  For Thursday:  WASHINGTON NEWS (``w'' category)  BUDGET-TAX-CUTS (Washington) _ In their fight over a balanced budget, both the White House and the Republican Congress are proposing tax cuts. GOP lawmakers want $245 billion in tax breaks _ one third of it for businesses _ and President Clinton is seeking $105 billion for middle class and low income families. The compromise may be no tax cut at all. By STEWART M. POWELL.  TRAFFIC-CONGESTION (Washington) _ As Americans take to the road for the holidays, a new study shows traffic congestion is getting worse in most major U.S. cities. Los Angeles remains the most gridlocked, followed by Washington D.C. Fastest growing congestion rates are in Salt Lake City, Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio. By WENDY KOCH.  BUSINESS &AMP; FINANCIAL NEWS (``f'' category)  ADVERTISING-EXEC (San Antonio) _ Advertising guru Lionel Sosa plans to retire Dec. 31 as chairman of DMB&AMP;B Americas, sources said this week. By LESLI HICKS.  DISNEY-LAWSUIT (San Francisco) _ Just before Thanksgiving, 3-year-old Olivia Hayashi Groves and her father went to the Disney Store to do a little shopping. But Todd Groves couldn't steer his power wheelchair to a toy display, because his path was blocked by narrow aisles crammed with merchandise. It was the final straw for Groves, who filed a class action lawsuit charging Disney with violating the Americans With Disabilities Act. By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN.  INFANT-VIDEO (Belmont, Calif.) _ Bret Frost and Erica Dalton are not yet 2 years old, but they know what they like. And what they like looks a lot like them. It drools, it smiles, it sucks a pacifier. Now, thanks to their mothers, they can spend a blissful half-hour viewing what's believed to be the world's first video for infants. By KATHERINE SELIGMAN.  TAX-DEDUCTION (San Francisco) _ Get yourself a nice tax deduction. That fenderless clunker sitting in your yard is a sought-after item these days. Nonprofit organizations are snatching up automotive albatrosses, a fund-raising trend that has generated hundreds of thousands of dollars for charities. By KATHERINE SELIGMAN.  COMMENTARY (``k'' category)  DRIVING-DANGERS (San Francisco) _ My kid wants driving school for a gift this year. I'm trying my best to dissuade him. I'm thinking about the fact that President Clinton weak-mindedly bowed to Republican pressures and agreed to a hike in the national 55-mph speed limit, to 65 and 70. Make no mistake: The president and the GOP looked carnage in the eye and said there's a place for it. By SCOTT WINOKUR.  NUNS-ORDINATION (San Francisco) _ Tens of thousands of U.S. Catholic nuns recently joined together in ``grief'' and spent the day fasting and praying. The nation's nuns were responding to the Vatican's recent ``infallible'' ban on the ordination of women priests. For all the lip service paid to women by the male hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church, nuns are treated as second-class citizens. By STEPHANIE SALTER.  SPORTS (``s'' category)  FBN-COACHES (San Francisco) In this season of good will to men, women and special teams coaches, it's time to consider which poor souls will be left out in the cold at the end of the year with nothing more than huge salary settlements to keep them warm. In other words, which head coaches will be out of work after the season is over? By JOHN CRUMPACKER.  For Sunday:  COMMENTARY (``k'' category)  THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ When the curtain rings down on the 104th Congress a year from now, we the people will say farewell to a remarkable treasure of talent.

For Thursday:  WASHINGTON NEWS (``w'' category)  BUDGET-TAX-CUTS (Washington) _ The White House-Congress dispute over where to cut federal taxes is a large part of the budget impasse that kept the federal government partially closed Wednesday for a fifth day. A compromise might seem possible. However, planned face-to-face negotiations between the sides broke down Wednesday. By STEWART M. POWELL.

"98199"	"he"	"smiles"	" We know the score, the season and the shortstop. We see the stadium, standing room only. We feel the pressure and we are sure he must feel it, too. Derek Jeter stands in the middle of all we see and he spends a good portion of his day making faces. He grins, he smiles, he smirks. He catches the eye of third baseman Scott Brosius and laughs, he jokes with a base runner. If a ball is hit his way, well, he will catch it. He knows that. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
