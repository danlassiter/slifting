The company's shares rose 27 percent in the fourth quarter, based on a gradual realization by the market of the strength of its business model, Oelschlager said.

, they say,	 At many urban schools, superintendents, principals and teachers talk about how the Advanced Placement program exposes students to new subjects like economics and psychology. They say AP courses help identify opportunities for those who might otherwise not think of themselves as college material, and help solve discipline problems when bored students acting up in lower-level classes are put with higher achievers. Even students who score only a 2 on an exam, or never even take the exam, they say, benefit from having challenged themselves. </P> 	nyt_eng_200601.gz

They have set high standards for what it takes to sue, Schulhofer said. And as these cases unfold, there is always an effort to discredit the credibility of the person who complained.

, they said,	 Palestinians and Sharon's left-wing critics said his approach was calculatedly self-fulfilling. In their eyes, his refusal to talk undermined Palestinian pragmatists, who needed negotiated achievements to build domestic support. To them, Israeli incursions and blockades crippled the very security forces that were supposed to act against terrorists. Sharon's unilateralism, they said, empowered militants, who pointed to it in arguing that the violence of the second intifada had achieved something that 10 years of negotiations never did -- the evacuation of Israeli settlements. </P> 	nyt_eng_200601.gz
, he said,	 Sharon was fairly clear about whether he saw this unilateralism leading to a peace agreement. He wanted an agreement, he said, provided the Palestinians could meet his demands for his security. His senior aides used to joke that, to do so, the Palestinians would have to become Swedes. For years, Sharon said he wanted a long-term interim agreement, a sort of standstill arrangement that would end the fighting, reduce the friction between the two peoples and help them, somehow, become comfortable with each other. Only after many years, he argued, would there be enough trust for real peace. In any final deal, he wanted to hold all of Jerusalem and Israel's biggest West Bank settlements. </P> 	nyt_eng_200601.gz

, they said,	 It's not the first time churches have reached for popular music in their services - or created division by doing so. In 1954, Ray Charles turned the gospel song My Jesus Is All the World to Me into I Got a Woman, scandalizing many in the black church. In the 1960s, guitars and folk music filtered into U.S. churches, driving away many traditionalists. Today, Christian rock also is a growing cultural force. Nationally, one of hip-hop's most vocal critics is the Rev. G. Craige Lewis, a preacher from Fort Worth, Texas, whose speeches at churches around the country call hip-hop a tool of the devil. His website, www.exministries.com, boasts: 750,000 CDs destroyed and counting: To God be the glory! Lewis did not return phone or e-mail messages, and the CD-stomping zeal of his ministry is not reflected in the tone of the worried worshipers in Minnesota. Still, many churches are struggling to balance the preferences of urban youths steeped in hip-hop and other congregants, many of them older and uneasy about it. The Rev. Belinda Green, an African Methodist Episcopal minister who is assistant principal of Evergreen Park Elementary in Brooklyn Center, is typical of the Minnesotans who have strong reservations about bringing hip-hop into church. Yes, I'm old school, but I see us trying to appeal only to one small group among young people and leaving everyone else behind, she said. What will really sustain young people is giving them the pure, unadulterated words of Jesus and involving them in service and activities. Green said she worries that hip-hop music, even with Christian lyrics, has usurped Jesus' words and lovely gospel music, spirituals and anthems. She described a recent conference where a hip-hop performer had people walking around scratching their heads asking, 'What'd he say?' Some people said they liked his 'bounce,' but they couldn't make out the words, she said. A CAUTIOUS WELCOME TO CHURCH Like many of the Minneapolis area's 250-plus black churches, the Church of New Life Christian Ministries uses praise music and dance in its services, but shies away from overt hip-hop rhythms. Secular hip-hop's focus on sexuality and violence does worry me; it's a powerful influence on young people, said the Rev. Carmen Means. But you have to look at the motive behind it. If it's to win souls to Jesus, I'm totally with that. We can't compromise on our message. But God gives us different avenues as time goes on. The Rev. Marchelle Hallman of St. James African Methodist Episcopal Church in Minneapolis said her church is slowly bridging a generational difference about ministry styles. We have embraced that hip-hop is not the Antichrist, she said. We want to create an atmosphere where all feel welcome. If there's tension, we discuss it. Said the Rev. Loyace Foreman of New Vision Faith Center in St. Paul: We are the crunkiest church in the Twin Cities. We use hip-hop quite extensively, but we take out the bad lyrics or get the artists to redo them in a positive light. We always conclude with a gospel message. Sixty percent of our church is under 21; many come without their parents. This is a way to get them plugged into something positive. ONE OF THE MANY PATHS Hip-hop is just one way in which black churches are striving to gain and retain young members. Smith and the Rev. Richard Coleman, a Baptist minister who is chief operating officer of Kingdom Oil, a Christian community foundation in Minneapolis, say the single greatest tool that black churches can use to attract young people is a paid youth minister. For reasons both historic and economic, they said, youth ministers are not common in the black church. Another tool is the arts -- music, dance, drama and the visual arts. Hip-hop is just one aspect of that. Said Tylonda Maxwell, 14, daughter of Shiloh's Rev. Maxwell, We dance not about things of the world, but about things of the spirit. Coleman said he can see both sides of the hip-hop debate. The kids are so invested that it's foolish not to use it, but it'll take more than an infectious beat to sustain the black church's role as the heart of the community, Coleman said. Elders and the church must be stronger role models, and must partner with businesses, schools and other institutions in this post-civil rights era. ...The fight now is about strengthening the community and coalescing around common values and needs. Advocates of hip-hop culture often show disrespect for the gatekeepers, Coleman said. Gatekeepers must not abdicate their roles as leaders. ... I will respect [hip-hop adherents], but they must respect what I stand for, too. TAKING HIP-HOP BACK FOR GOOD Early Christians often seized on pagan practices to serve their faith, and modern Christians should not hesitate to use hip-hop as a means to righteous ends, Smith said. They must take hip-hop back, he said, from the gang-bangers and degraders of women who have hijacked hip-hop's original good intentions. In the book of Acts, Paul went into Athens and looked at its pagan, idolatrous culture, and his spirit was provoked, but instead of screaming judgment, he learned it, observed it, reasoned with its scholars and poets, Smith said. Rappers, break dancers and spoken-word artists are the philosophers of urban culture. We must learn their principles and history and use them to proclaim a positive message that can uplift the community. Shiloh Temple, on West Broadway in the heart of north Minneapolis' black community, has sought to do just that, said Bishop Richard Howell. There has been a tremendous controversy about hip-hop, but not in our church, Howell said. Shiloh aggressively courts and serves urban youths via Maxwell, its rapping youth minister (it also has a minister for seniors), and other programs, including Bible studies, urban outreach, college and job fairs, dance, music and drama groups, and youth-oriented worship. We are competing with emotions, hormones, the culture, said Broderick Austin, 26, who oversees Shiloh's Streets program, which reaches out to urban youths. So we want to use every means we can to win souls to Christ. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060107.0155 type=story > <HEADLINE> PLUGGED IN </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> SACRAMENTO, Calif. </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
