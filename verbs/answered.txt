"13375"	"he"	"answered"	" Chris Webber is still pushing for a return in early February, although doctors are a little more conservative in their timetable. According to friends of the power forward, he is feeling pressure (self-induced) to get the Bullets into the playoffs, and he also wants to come back even if he's not 100 percent to set an example for a group of teammates he thinks won't play hurt (are you listening, Kevin Duckworth?). Remember, owner Abe Pollin said people should be patient while Washington learns to play together, but when asked if that meant it was OK for the team not to qualify for postseason, he answered, ``No, it's not OK.'' Don't laugh. In the horrid Atlantic Division, the Bullets are still very much alive. It should be interesting to watch them, Miami, Milwaukee, Boston and New Jersey battle it out in the final weeks for the right to get slaughtered by Orlando in the first round ... George Andrews, who represents Roy Tarpley, was against his client returning to the Mavericks from the start. ``It's like marrying the same person again,'' said Andrews. ``There may be two nice people involved, but they still have the same old baggage.'' Dallas is having a hard time finding takers for that ``baggage'' ... Did you notice Latrell Sprewell still had the numbers of Webber and Billy Owens on the back of his sneakers? No wonder coach Don Nelson continues to look so weary. Nelson has spoken before about moving up to the front office as just GM, leaving the coaching to someone else, but new owner Chris Cohan said that would require some discussion before he'd go along. Meanwhile, Tom Gugliotta continues to struggle in the Warriors' system. ``I keep telling him he's just scratched the surface of what he can be,'' said Nelson. ``I do the best job I can coaching him. He's a good player, but I think he can be an All-Star if he grooms the game skills he's never thought about, like handling the ball, running the team, knowing how to get other people shots. At the same time, I don't want to confuse him too much. There's been enough of that.'' ... Barkley and Dan Majerle are in as Phoenix All-Stars, but the truth is Danny Manning deserves to go more than both of them. He has agreed to come off the bench without so much as a whimper, has played every position on the floor except point guard, and has managed to make a contribution while remaining conscious of the fact that Sir Charles needs the most shots and the most publicity. Manning was never cut out to be The Man; Barkley was never cut out to be anything but The Man ... Too bad the Celtics don't have a Man. They sure could use one. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950128.0180 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-PHOTO-WEEKEND-UPDATE-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> ATTENTION EDITORS: The following photos are part of tonight's New York Times Photo package moving: 1/28/95.
