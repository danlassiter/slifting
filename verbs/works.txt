FILM-DEVIL (Undated) The movie version of Walter Mosley's mystery-thriller, ``Devil in a Blue Dress,'' is not ``Chinatown'' _ but it's one of the better of the scores of movies that have set out to evoke the hard-boiled private-eye, film noir world of late-'40s Los Angeles. It's by-the-numbers, imitation Raymond Chandler, but done extremely well, with loads of atmosphere, consistently top-notch direction by Carl Franklin (``One False Move'') and one of Denzel Washington's most appealing star performances.  By William Arnold. (story will move in the ``e'' category)  FILM-LAKE (Undated) It has become something of a sure-fire, art-house formula: the one about the stuffy English vacationers who find social release _ and true love _ under the magical spell of sunny Italy. In ``A Month By the Lake,'' it happens one more time in one more period romance. Once again, it works, if not nearly as well _ or as magically _ as in its predecessors. Based on a novel by H.E. Bates.  By William Arnold. (story will move in the ``e'' category)  FILM-MOON (Undated) With the surprise box-office success of films like ``The Joy Luck Club,'' ``Little Women'' and ``Boys on the Side,'' the woman-ensemble film is having a authentic renaissance in Hollywood. ``Moonlight and Valentino'' is an ensemble piece that looks at some distinctly female situations in a humorous and touching way. This particular example of the phenomenon is a mixed blessing. It has a handful of effective moments and a compelling lead performance by the under-used Elizabeth Perkins, but it's otherwise a bit too calculated, and unevenly written and acted.  By William Arnold. (story will move in the ``e'' category)  ROCK-PHISH (Undated) In describing the eclectic sound of Phish, bassist Mike Gordon uses a gardening analogy. ``Over the years we've studied a lot of different styles of music,'' Gordon said in an interview. ``We tried to learn something about jazz and bluegrass and Latin and other styles. It was like a composting thing, where it all went back into the soil of our music.'' The group is on a tour that started Wednesday in Sacramento, Calif., and ends New Year's Eve at Madison Square Garden in New York City.  By Gene Stout. (story will move in the ``e'' category)  BOOKS-POLITICS (Undated) Reviews of three political books, including one on Bob Dole's money machine, one on Frank Church and another on ``The Almanac of American Politics.''

In this case, Walter can watch the children on a daily basis and be tempted. It also allows him to spy out what he believes is another pedophile stalking the schoolkids.
