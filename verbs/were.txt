The research reinforces the theories of an African origin for modern humans, and the earlier date gives the species more time to have evolved the cultural attributes that probably supported its spread out of Africa to Asia and Europe. The new date appears to be near the early boundary for modern human emergence, as suggested in recent genetic studies. By John Noble Wilford. </P> 	nyt_eng_200502.gz

EXP-LEBANON (Beirut, Lebanon) -- More than 100,000 Lebanese descended on downtown Beirut's Amin mosque on Wednesday to bury the former prime minister, Rafik Hariri, in an emotional and politically charged tribute. Hariri, assassinated in a car bombing on Monday, was buried with six of his bodyguards. By Hassan M. Fattah.  EXP-IRAQ (Baghdad, Iraq) -- An Italian journalist kidnapped in Baghdad appeared on video on Wednesday, pleading for her life and urging U.S.-led forces to leave Iraq. Occasionally sobbing, the journalist, Giuliana Sgrena, begged her family to put pressure on the Italian government to secure her release and warned foreigners to steer clear of the country. Sgrena, a reporter for the Rome-based communist newspaper Il Manifesto, was seized in Baghdad on Feb. 4 as she conducted interviews on the street near Baghdad University. By Dexter Filkins.

By Julie Macur.  SIMMONS-ESPN (Undated) -- Bill Simmons, a former blogger and now The Sports Guy on ESPN.com, has become a cultural force. By Warren St. John.  With photo.

Skilling go on trial for their role in the collapse of Enron, the story of Daniel H. Bayly shows that, in today's supercharged regulatory environment, the line that keeps a legitimate investment banking deal from becoming a federal crime has become thinner than ever.  FANNING-NAPSTER (San Francisco) -- Shawn Fanning turns 25 on Tuesday, and it's been a very long seven years since he wrote a little computer program that let him trade electronic music files with his dorm mates at Northeastern University, where he was a freshman. He called it Napster, after his nickname, and it quickly grew to be by far the most popular use of the burgeoning Internet, making Fanning a symbol of how technology gives users much more for much less. Now the public spotlight is turning back to Fanning, this time as a symbol of how big business and the disruptive force of the Net just might find a way to get along. By Saul Hansell.  MARKET-WATCH (Undated) -- Weekly Wall Street commentary. By Gretchen Morgenson.  EVERYMANS-BUSINESS (Undated) -- Don't beat up on big oil. It's just doing its job. By Ben Stein.  ECON-COLUMN (Undated) -- Realtors aren't the only ones who fear a bursting bubble. By Matt Gross.  With graphic.  STRATEGIES-COLUMN (Undated) --Few mutual fund managers beat the stock market over the long term. That sad truth is widely understood, and it helps to account for the vast popularity of index funds, which aspire only to match the returns of a particular market. But a new study suggests that it may be too soon to give up on actively managed mutual funds. By Mark Hulbert.  INVESTING  INVEST-NUCLEAR (Londonderry, Pa.) -- The nuclear-power sector has been enjoying something of a revival, because of its operating-cost advantages over other forms of electricity production. That may prompt investors to bet on its resurgence by buying shares in nuclear power plant operators, equipment makers or fuel producers. By Tim Gray.  VOLUNTEER-VACATIONS (Undated) -- Making the world better, one vacation at a time. Although there is no hard data about the number of volunteer vacations, many specialists say such trips have become more popular in recent years, particularly since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the tsunami. Sherry Schwarz, editor and publisher of Transitions Abroad, a magazine that helps readers study, work and live overseas, found after the tsunami that there was a large outpouring of people interested in going to Southeast Asia to help, to do more than just give money. Both the tsunami and 9/11, she said, made people realize there was a real need to help one another, rebuild, reach out. By Jane Levere.

, he said,	 Castelli, too, has said he did nothing illegal. He pleaded guilty, he said, to avoid the cost of the trial. He told the Times he wore a wire in conversations with Velasco as part of the FBI investigation. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 Losing track of a few dollars here and there might not be so bad, but the price of not paying attention can be much higher. Credit card companies can raise interest rates for almost any reason, including no reason, said Edmund Mierzwinski, consumer program director at U.S. Public Interest Research Group. Mierzwinski added that even a supposedly fixed-rate card could be changed with 15 days' notice. And rather than bounce a check, he said, now many banks make money on the back end by not bouncing your check -- but charging you a fee. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 On top of that, he said, Alaska is getting hit because of the uproar over Alaska's bridges. Congress, facing ridicule from all quarters for funding the alleged bridges to nowhere, has removed the controversial Knik and Gravina bridges from the national highway bill it passed four months ago, although Alaska gets to keep the $452 million allocated for that purpose. Stevens said the bridge episode, and several other events, have created a hostility for Alaska that hurts the state in the wallet. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 Stevens opposed an amendment banning the mistreatment of detainees because, he said, it didn't make exceptions for the CIA. Now, he said, people are calling him the senator for torture. Democrats challenged him on his decision last week not to swear in a panel of oil company executives when they testified at a hearing he chaired. Daily News stories about him, he said, have hurt his credibility. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, I think,	 Sony BMG responded by offering a piece of software it said would remove the rootkit, but at the same time said the rootkit was not malicious and does not compromise security. Thomas Hesse, president of Sony BMG's Global Digital Business, went on National Public Radio to say that most people, I think, don't even know what a rootkit is, so why should they care about it? </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he added,	 Allegations that Bush intentionally manipulated intelligence to build his case for war are one of the most dishonest and reprehensible charges ever levied in Washington, said Cheney. Some Democratic war critics, he added, have lost their memory - and their backbone - and are now trying to rewrite the history of the war. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, she says,	 But Fisk seems to have decided that even striving for objectivity is silly. He approvingly quotes the left-wing Israeli journalist Amira Hass as saying that it is a misconception to imagine journalists can be objective. Journalism's job, she says, is to monitor power and the centers of power. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he added,	 Adler of the publishers association also noted that while Google is currently making only one specified use of the material it copies, publishers and authors cannot be assured of the company's future plans. If Google is allowed to go down this path unfettered, he added, copyright holders will have no way to stop others who want to do the same thing, perhaps with greater financial harm to authors and publishers. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz

, you see,	 Medallion, you see, is a quantitative fund. In quant funds, trading activity is generated by complex computer models rather than human judgment. Most quants are secretive about the algorithms that drive their models; after all, that's their investing edge. But of the handful of big-time black box investors, as they're often called, Simons' box may well be the blackest. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 One advantage, he said, is that models can lower your risk. Another, though, is that it reduces the daily aggravation. With old-fashioned stock picking, he said: One day you feel like a hero. The next day you feel like a goat. Either way, most of the time it's just luck. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he added,	 But for those coming after him, it's just sad that it's ending, that it looks like this, he said. In his hometown, he added, all these places that used to be factories are now just parking lots. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 The work forces were young, the pension costs were low, the exposure for health care wasn't really there and they didn't promise a lot to begin with, said Gerald Meyers, a professor at the University of Michigan and the former chief executive of American Motors. Each contract, he said, added a little more and a little more and a little more. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 The insurance business has been a tough strategic fit for GE, said Jeffrey R. Immelt, the company's chief executive, who wants to focus on faster-growing sectors. During the last five years, he said, GE's main insurance unit has lost $700 million and required the infusion of $3.2 billion. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 Brian Meredith of Bank of American Equity Research said in a note to investors that the absorption of half a dozen GE reinsurance units into Swiss Re would reduce the choices for insurance companies in need of insurance and could result in higher prices. Some customers that had purchased coverage from both companies, he said, may now think they need to work with another carrier in order to spread their risk. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 Ney did not return calls for comment. When federal prosecutors subpoenaed documents from him earlier this month, he said, As I have said repeatedly, we will cooperate fully with any inquiry. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz

, he hasn't,	 The answer is no, he hasn't, which doesn't necessarily mean he won't. It's that possibility that has handed Patterson some extra leverage and sharpened the edge of contract extension talks that had already begun at TCU before the Snyder announcement even came down. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz

, they say,	 To be sure, it is not just a lack of electrical power that is hindering the city's revival. Almost half of New Orleans lacks natural gas for cooking or heating, according to Entergy, even as temperatures here have fallen sharply in recent days, dipping below 40 degrees at night. Toilets in roughly half the homes are still not connected to the city's sewer system, municipal officials say. About a quarter of the city is still without drinkable water, they say, and some isolated patches have no running water at all, a circumstance that could prove disastrous in the event of a fire. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 Packer also warned that if relief did not come soon, the city might have no choice but to take over the company. That might seem good news for consumers, he said, but the utility would no longer have the buying power it enjoys in the energy market as part of a large conglomerate . </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, she said,	 Several weeks ago, Entergy announced that large parts of the city would not have electrical service until mid-2006. The resulting roar of complaints spurred the company to shift strategy. On Thursday, the City Council approved an Entergy plan to use $11.2 million that had been earmarked for other purposes, including $6.8 million in a fund devoted to improving customers' energy efficiency. The extra money will allow the company to more than double the size of its repair crews. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20051118.0189 type=advis > <HEADLINE> PHOTO-UPDATE-NYT </HEADLINE> <TEXT> ATTN: PHOTO EDITORS:  The following photos have been sent as part of the New York Times News Service photo package for Friday, Nov. 18, 2005.

WHITE-COLLAR-CRIME (Undated) -- With less than two months before Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling go on trial for their role in the collapse of Enron, the story of Daniel H. Bayly shows that, in today's supercharged regulatory environment, the line that keeps a legitimate investment banking deal from becoming a federal crime has become thinner than ever.  FANNING-NAPSTER (San Francisco) -- Shawn Fanning turns 25 on Tuesday, and it's been a very long seven years since he wrote a little computer program that let him trade electronic music files with his dorm mates at Northeastern University, where he was a freshman. He called it Napster, after his nickname, and it quickly grew to be by far the most popular use of the burgeoning Internet, making Fanning a symbol of how technology gives users much more for much less. Now the public spotlight is turning back to Fanning, this time as a symbol of how big business and the disruptive force of the Net just might find a way to get along. By Saul Hansell.

STRATEGIES-COLUMN (Undated) --Few mutual fund managers beat the stock market over the long term. That sad truth is widely understood, and it helps to account for the vast popularity of index funds, which aspire only to match the returns of a particular market. But a new study suggests that it may be too soon to give up on actively managed mutual funds. By Mark Hulbert.  INVESTING  INVEST-NUCLEAR (Londonderry, Pa.) -- The nuclear-power sector has been enjoying something of a revival, because of its operating-cost advantages over other forms of electricity production. That may prompt investors to bet on its resurgence by buying shares in nuclear power plant operators, equipment makers or fuel producers. By Tim Gray.  VOLUNTEER-VACATIONS (Undated) -- Making the world better, one vacation at a time. Although there is no hard data about the number of volunteer vacations, many specialists say such trips have become more popular in recent years, particularly since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the tsunami. Sherry Schwarz, editor and publisher of Transitions Abroad, a magazine that helps readers study, work and live overseas, found after the tsunami that there was a large outpouring of people interested in going to Southeast Asia to help, to do more than just give money. Both the tsunami and 9/11, she said, made people realize there was a real need to help one another, rebuild, reach out. By Jane Levere.

AUTO-TECH (Undated) -- New techniques and processes are letting automakers twist and bend body panels in previously unimagined ways. This gives designers more freedom and has begun to result in striking new shapes on cars like the Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky. By Don Sherman.  CELEBRITY-SOIREES (Undated) -- Pop music celebrities like Beyonce and Justin Timberlake are the party favor of choice these days at private soirees. Beyonce, for instance, was paid $2 million to perform a song or two at a recent Bar Mitzvah. By Alex Williams.  IRAQ-WOMEN (Camp Normandy, Iraq) -- The role of women in the military has evolved, from serving as nurses in the Civil War to serving in support units in conflicts like the Persian Gulf War, but never before have they operated on the front lines they way they are in Iraq.

, he said,	 U.S. forces, he said, had heard the stories of secret prisons and torture, many of them telephoned to hotlines set up last year for tips in the hunt for insurgents. The center, in Jadriya, he said, was notorious before the raid was triggered by a mother's appeal for help in finding her 15-year-old son. So why wasn't it raided sooner? Because, the general said in so many words, Iraq is so washed by rumor, and fact is so elusive, that the 153,000 U.S. troops here have simply been overwhelmed. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 As an example of the obscurities that have enveloped the American enterprise here, the general cited the difficulty the Americans have in distinguishing between the 320,000 members of the Iraqi army and the police, and the thousands of other armed irregulars now stalking the land. Some of these irregulars, he said, were members of Kurdish and Shiite militias; some, private security forces recruited by ministers; still others, bodyguards to other prominent Iraqis. Along with these, he said there are Sunni insurgents and other killers and kidnappers who steal uniforms and unit badges and masquerade as army and police commandos. In Baghdad alone, he said, three truckloads of uniforms have been hijacked in recent weeks. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz

In the United States, he said, breeder chickens are vaccinated in this way (for other diseases, not for avian flu); a crew of about six people with vaccine guns can inject about 10,000 birds in three hours. At that level of efficiency, at least 10,000 workers would be needed to vaccinate China's birds. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz

, he said,	 It is the governing principles that are more important than the personalities themselves, said Fossella, citing improvements in the city's quality of life and crime control.

, he said,	 For most people, there is probably no reason to make a revocable living trust, said Ralph Engel, a Manhattan trusts and estates lawyer. Engel said a living trust is a legal device -- created by a document known as a trust agreement -- that acts as a holding bin for property and other assets. Typically, he said, the trust takes title to a grantor's property and gives control to a trustee. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 By law, however, certain property, like life insurance with a named beneficiary, is not subject to probate. An asset in a trust, he said, is that kind of property. So, he said, if all of a person's assets are in a living trust, they pass to beneficiaries without being subject to probate. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 While that might sound good at first, Engel said, two issues should be considered. First, the individual creating the trust must be diligent in transferring title to all assets to the trust, including those currently owned in his or her name as well as those obtained in the future. Any assets not specifically owned by the trust, he said, could be subject to probate, undermining the reason for creating it in the first place. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 Second, he said, in the vast majority of cases, probate isn't nearly as expensive, complicated or time-consuming as most people think. Unless there are problems with the estate, the probate process typically takes only a few weeks, he said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 Jonathan Forster, an estate-planning lawyer in Washington, said that while revocable living trusts are not necessary for most people, they might make sense sometimes. For example, he said, people with property in two or more states might want to put it into a living trust to avoid going through probate in multiple jurisdictions. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 Also, he said, probate is governed by state law, and some states, like California and Maryland, have fairly complicated probate laws, making property in such states good candidates for a living trust. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz

, he said,	 The stricter testing and penalties for amphetamines in baseball are being applauded by Dr. P.S. Kishore of Brookline, an addiction specialist and founder of the National Library of Addictions. But testing may not be easy. According to Kishore, amphetamines can be flushed out of the body within three days or even sooner. Random testing may not detect them, he said, because they are water-soluble. In his practice, Kishore sees amphetamine use by college students who want to optimize their alertness for a big exam. He sees a lot of it among medical students and law school students. But there can be bad consequences. Kishore said psychotic behavior can manifest itself after extended use to the point you don't see reality from unreality. Kishore said abusers often become disheveled in appearance, have trouble thinking straight, and eventually their performance declines. Kishore is in complete agreement with the penalties for positive tests: additional mandatory testing after one failed test, 25 games for a second positive, and 80 games for a third positive ...

(The code was aimed at players. Coaches generally have been well-attired over the years.) It's free? I'm in, said Popovich. That was always Bird's mantra. As a player, Bird wore some of the ugliest shirts imaginable. When asked why, he said, It's free. If it's free, I'll wear it. Which makes you wonder: How would those free-wheeling Celtics of the 1980s have handled a dress code? Larry would have gotten a jacket, Cedric Maxwell said. It wouldn't have been a good-looking jacket, but he would have gotten one. Danny Ainge said the Celtics would have had no trouble complying, but it probably would not have gone over very well.

The government argued successfully during the trial last year that four Merrill Lynch executives were guilty of conspiracy to defraud investors and that their motivation was simple: to secure future banking business from Enron.

, he said,	 He said he wouldn't mind if the law was changed to allow a higher markup for ticket resellers, but he said state officials should also address other consumer issues. For example, he said, some ticket brokers resell tickets well above face value but refund only the face value if the event is canceled. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he suggests,	 Jameson, a professor of comparative literature at Duke, isn't talking about Star Trek novelizations. Because of the Cold War emphasis on dystopias, Cold War writers like Philip K. Dick, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Samuel R. Delany had to find radical new ways to express their inexpressible hopes about the future, claims Jameson. At this moment of neoliberal triumphalism, he suggests, we should take these writers seriously-even if their ideas are packaged inside lurid paperbacks. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he claims,	 The ability of utopian narratives in particular, and science fiction in general, to break the paralyzing spell of the quotidian has less to do with its content than with its form, he argues persuasively. (Buck Rogers-type science fiction in the mode of extrapolation and mere anticipation of all kinds of technological marvels, as Jameson puts it, is far less effective at doing so.) It requires a tremendous effort to imagine a daily life that is politically, economically, socially, and psychologically truly different from our own. And this effort, Jameson writes, warps the structure of science fiction. As a result, he claims, even Dick's amphetamine-fuelled potboilers are as productively alienating as the plays of Brecht and Beckett. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, I asked,	 Can reading science fiction, I asked, help us decide between various utopian alternatives-urban vs. pastoral, statist vs. anarchistic? No, replied Jameson, insisting there are utopian elements in each of these. What science fiction does afford us, he said, is not a synthesis of these elements but a process where the imagination begins to question itself, to move back and forth among the possibilities. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he says,	 On Beacon Hill, Rowell has a few smaller units in renovated buildings at more moderate prices. A 455-square-foot studio is listed for $329,000 and a 525-square-foot, one-bedroom condo is priced at $349,000. Either would make an ideal pied-à-terre. The well-established neighborhood has a lot of appeal, he says, offering easy access to downtown and Back Bay as well as the many shops and restaurants right on the Hill. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"160033"	"they"	"were"	" Sara Solfanelli will own up to the MC Hammer-inspired baggy pants and the Thriller-era Michael Jackson vest. As embarrassing as they seem to her now, they were, back when she wore them to her 1990 bat mitzvah dance party, the height of middle school couture. But the dress she wore to the ceremony - a silky floral print with puffy sleeves and mock turtleneck collar that made her look like a 5-foot-tall bouquet with hairspray - Solfanelli insists, was her mother's doing. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"

"163504"	"they"	"were"	" Getting disqualified for various reasons, they were, but primarily for causing somebody else to crash headlong into the padded boards. Leaning so close to the ice on the constant cornering that motorcycle racers must cringe when watching. Getting all duded up, too, for fear of fading into the crowd of body-suited brawlers in yellow, turtleshell helmets. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"169120"	"you"	"were"	" His cheerleading in the face of economic problems contributed to the decline of Treasury's prestige during the Bush years. A weakened Treasury Department is something the nation can ill afford in this era of daunting economic challenges. In distancing yourself rhetorically from the recent past, you were, for a moment, both off message and on point, a refreshing combination. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
