"4644"	"he"	"thought"	" Meyer regarded Coan's exit as a dastardly version of horse theft. Kansas, he thought, stole the fastest horse in the Frogs' stable. He couldn't hang Coan, or Adams, or Kansas coach Jack Mitchell, but he could cancel the series forever, and did. Well, forever after the teams played out the last two years of the contract.

"4788"	"I"	"thought"	" But it was the no-makeup aspect that really got us. It reminded me of the time, in the 80s, when Max Factor first came out with colorless or invisible mascara. I had to try some right away, and as I left the store, I thought, ``Great, I've just bought the emperor's new mascara.''

Back-to-back Super Bowl victories good. If he also was fashioning a Bunyonesque legend about himself, then we bought that, too.

For Steinberg, this was nothing short of Shakespearean. It was also, he thought, an example of ``so much that goes on in organized mass education.''

As she now recalls the moment, the judge, a man, looked at her and said, ``I don't have any use for either lady law professors or legal aid clinics.''   Well, she thought, ``I'm certainly getting off on the right foot here.''   The lawyer recounted the incident on Thursday night as she accepted a Servant of Justice award at the annual dinner of the Legal Aid Society of New York at the Waldorf-Astoria.   The ``lady lawyer,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton, then added: ``I always have a little trouble getting my footing in new settings, in case you haven't noticed.

It was still asking if another transaction was wanted, and when she pushed ``No,'' a card popped out. No other customers were in sight, but a man acting as an unofficial doorman told her that he had seen a man jump into a cab.   She looked at the card, which was from Lloyds Bank; the name on it was Rufus Sewell   By a coincidence hard to believe, Ms. Shore, a one-time casting assistant, not only recognized the name, still somewhat obscure in this country, but knew where to find the man.   She had seen Sewell, an Irish actor, in the movie ``A Man of No Importance'' and was about to see him in ``Translations,'' the Brian Friel play now on Broadway.   She called the company manager at the theater and told him the story, and he sent a messenger for the card. Ms. Shore enclosed a note prefaced, ``Only in New York.''   The next day the actor responded: a bouquet was delivered to her apartment in Chelsea with a thank-you note that ended, ``Only in New York indeed.''   By the way, Sewell, who calls himself a klutz, has also lost two wallets and a small shoulder bag in his seven weeks in New York.   ``By the end of the day, I'm always one thing short,'' he said.   The day may come when Prince Charles will open his mouth and say something nonflammable, but it hasn't yet arrived. The prince spoke on Thursday at the opening of a British Council campaign to preserve the worldwide dominance of the English language and, by The Times of London report, said that American English was ``very corrupting.''   Elaborating on his view of American influence, he continued: ``People tend to invent all sorts of nouns and verbs and make words that shouldn't be. I think we have to be a bit careful; otherwise the whole thing can get rather a mess.   ``We must act now to insure that English -- and that, to my way of thinking, means English English -- maintains its position as the world language well into the next century.''  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950324.0257 type=story > <HEADLINE> CONNER CATCHES MIGHTY MARY </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> SAN DIEGO  (BC-AMERICAS-CUP-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"

(NYT)  (BC-NATIONAL-BRIEFS-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> It is hard to imagine a public figure whose death would inspire such universal grief as that of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt's death at 3:35 p.m. on April 12, 1945, will be commemorated on Wednesday in ceremonies both in Hyde Park, N.Y., where he is buried in a hemlock-enclosed rose garden on the grounds of his boyhood home, and in Warm Springs, Ga., where he died of a cerebral hemorrhage while having his portrait painted in watercolors. ``I have a terrific headache,'' Roosevelt said with his final words, before collapsing.   Eighty-three-year-old Millie Ashley of Wabbaseka, Ark., remembers weeping. ``I was working in the cotton patch,'' she said. ``After President Roosevelt got to be president it got to be pretty good because he did a minimum wage so people could live. When he started, we got 35 cents for a hundred pounds, working sun to sun when you were chopping. We was getting $2.35 when he died. When I heard the news, I thought, 'Well everything's gone now.' ``   Albert Gore Sr., the vice president's 87-year-old father, was a congressman in Washington at the time. ``I was up the street from where we lived and I think I was en route to a laundry to get some shirts,'' he said. ``I met a man who was weeping deeply and loudly and with tears flowing plentifully. He had just heard about the death of President Roosevelt. This, of course, was a shock to me. I did proceed to recover my shirts and then I returned and my dear wife and I together privately wept ourselves.''   NEW YORK (NYT) -- The Plaza Hotel, long a symbol of fashion and grandeur and more recently a trophy in the high-stakes arenas of real estate and global deal-making, is being sold to a Saudi Arabian prince and a Singapore-based company.   The sale price for the landmark 800-room hotel at 59th Street and Fifth Avenue near Central Park is said to be about $325 million -- at least $55 million less than the price paid in 1988 by Donald J. Trump, whose sagging fortunes were a crucial factor in the transfer.   The sale, which has been rumored for weeks, was announced Tuesday in Singapore by CDL Hotels International Ltd., the hotel arm of the Hong Leong Group.   CDL said it has formed a joint venture with an entity controlled by Saudi Arabian Prince Alwaleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz Saud that will join Trump and a group of banks as partners in Plaza Operating Partners Ltd., which owns the Plaza Hotel.   INFLATION VANISHED IN MARCH   WASHINGTON (NYT) -- In an unexpectedly benign report, inflation vanished at the producer level in March as both energy and food prices turned down, government figures showed Tuesday.   Not only was the price of finished products unchanged for the month, the best performance since October, goods at earlier stages of production settled back to a pace that calmed jitters that had developed from sharp price increases since late last year. March marked the end of the fourth year of economic recovery and expansion following the 1990-1991 recession.   ``The United States still does not have any serious inflationary problem,'' commented Lacy Hunt, chief economist at HSBC Holdings in New York, parent of Marine Midland. ``There's an ample supply of goods and services and companies keep finding ways to make productivity gains.''   When the erratic energy and food components removed, the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods edged up just one-tenth of 1 percent in March, also the skimpiest in five months.   Tuesday's figures, if followed Wednesday by similar restrained consumer prices, where services are a sizable component, would seem to further reduce the possibility that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates anytime soon, analysts said.   YPSILANTI, Mich. (NYT) -- From dozens of conversations around the country -- in small North Carolina towns, in the wealthy desert outskirts of Phoenix, in union strongholds outside Detroit and on a college campus in Boston, what emerged this week was a sense that those who had framed the Republican Contract With America were far more enthusiastic about it than the people with whom they had supposedly made it.   ``It's just a political strategy,'' said Lonnie Parcell, a 50-year-old customer at Stacy's Diner in Pittsboro, Mass.   Michael Marshner, 43, a disabled truck driver who voted Libertarian in the last election, said he did not trust the new Republican leaders. ``They ought to call it the contract out on America,'' he said. ``How can you believe them? Everything they say falls through or doesn't come through. What happened to the Brady bill? What happened to the Gramm-Rudman Act? That was supposed to fix everything. The biggest thing that's out of control is the politicians.''   But others were less cynical. Asked about the contract by a reporter, plenty of people praised the Republicans' legislative agenda and the House's passage of it under the promised 100-day deadline. ``For the first time in 40 years there's been a change in direction,'' said Jim Bruner, a tax attorney, and a Republican, from Scottsdale, Ariz.   But while the Republicans have set the national agenda, with their Contract the talk of Washington, out in the country, beyond the Beltway, it seemed almost incidental to people's lives.   ``Yeah, I heard about that contract,'' said Donna Allen, owner of the Sweet Licks ice cream parlor. ``What the heck is that?  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950411.0216 type=story > <HEADLINE> `STUART SAVES HIS FAMILY': TWO-STEP COMEDY </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-STUART-FILM-REVIEW-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"

Max turned on the tank's radio to see if it still worked _ pointlessly, I thought, since neither of us could speak German (although Max could speak Yiddish, which is fairly close).

"26605"	"she"	"thought"	" Whenever she drove, she was constantly glancing in the rear-view mirror. She'd call her parents to tell them where she was headed, then call again for safe arrival. She began to look at her co-workers with suspicion. The caller knew her name; surely, she thought, she must know him, too. She changed her routine, which the man apparently realized, matching his calls to her arrivals. She felt certain she was being stalked. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"26733"	"we"	"thought"	" Petitioners argue that absence of perceived endorsement was material in Lamb's Chapel and Widmar. We did state in Lamb's Chapel that there was ``no realistic danger that the community would think that the District was endorsing religion or any particular creed,'' 508 U. S., at --- (slip op., at 10). But that conclusion was not the result of empirical investigation; it followed directly, we thought, from the fact that the forum was open and the religious activity privately sponsored. See ibid. It is significant that we referred only to what would be thought by ``the community'' not by outsiders or individual members of the community uninformed about the school's practice. Surely some of the latter, hearing of religious ceremonies on school premises, and not knowing of the premises' availability and use for all sorts of other private activities, might leap to the erroneous conclusion of state endorsement. But, we in effect said, given an open forum and private sponsorship, erroneous conclusions do not count. So also in Widmar. Once we determined that the benefit to religious groups from the public forum was incidental and shared by other groups, we categorically rejected the State's Establishment Clause defense. 454 U. S., at 274. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"26851"	"I"	"thought"	" I took my ball glove with me. I wanted to find a pick-up game, talk my way into the lineup and play some ball. Maybe, I thought, they'd let me play centerfield. So Thursday afternoon, off I went in search of a game. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"27095"	"I"	"thought"	" When Wayne Newton announced that he's directly descended from Pocahontas, I thought, well, of course he is. It's obvious. The resemblance is uncanny.

"27180"	"he"	"thought"	" An impatient cook, he quickly discovered fast food: bread made from a Latin recipe, ``which Marcus Porcius Cato gave about two centuries before Christ.'' The Walden flatbread was made with flour or meal and water, kneaded, molded and baked on a shingle over a outdoor fire. Although baking bread could be unpleasant in winter, at least, Thoreau noted, he had dispensed with the rising step. Yeast, he thought, was totally unnecessary and not, as local housewives had it, a health food: ``after going without it for a year am still in the land of the living.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"27280"	"I"	"thought"	" ``I finally couldn't do it anymore, because they weren't very good,'' Mancuso said of the ``Friday'' films. ``But I've always thought horror was a valid genre. And when I read this story, I liked it. I thought its central idea was a big one, and worth exploring: making contact with alien intelligence, then using our capacity, as it relates to DNA research, to create a communicator between them and us. That, and the inevitability of what would happen from that, I thought, was fun.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"27422"	"I"	"thought"	" Duval Street had sunk to a thudding low, I thought, as I read the T-shirts in the windows screaming such eloquent messages as ``Help, I've fallen and I can't reach my beer!'' And ``So many bars, so little time.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"27537"	"she"	"thought"	" At the bus pick-up point behind Bloomingdale's in White Plains at the end of June, parents compared camping experiences. Debbie James, 42, did not go to camp as a child because her parents could not afford it, but all her friends in Syracuse went to Raquette Lake. So when her daughter, Lindsay, who is 12, decided she was ready to go to camp, Ms. James said, she thought, ``Raquette Lake.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"

"27854"	"I"	"thought"	" Stephen Petronio, the first man to dance with the Brown troupe and now a choreographer in his own right, said: ``When I heard that Trisha was dancing to Bach, I thought, `Do we really want to see another dance to this music?'

CABLE-CARS (San Francisco) _ With his silver and turquoise Native American jewelry dangling from his chest as he guides a cable car in San Francisco, Gordon Engler is the picture of civic nonconformity. City officials want him and his funkily dressed colleagues back in their brown uniforms. By the San Francisco Examiner.  ALAMO-SOLDIERS (San Antonio) _ Davy Crockett wore a fur cap and defiantly swung a rifle nicknamed ``Old Betsy.'' James Bowie created a deadly knife and fought from his sickbed.

OUTDOORS-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Memories have a way of eating at your mind, but it is the here and now that can bring every cell in your body back to life. So it is at Pacifica on the Bay Area coast, where fishing went from heaven to hell over the past 20 years, but in the past week has suddenly become something like Valhalla, an angler's paradise.

"29079"	"he"	"thought"	" Asked about the infrequency of fishing poems (and more often written by women than men in this century), Engels acknowleged that it was uncommon but, he thought, an unwarranted paucity. ``Fishing has always seemed to me a perfect metaphor for writing poetry, the fruitless casting over a promising surface, and then, as when you find the words, the surprise of seeing the surface broken, the fish rising.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"

"30050"	"I"	"thought"	" We drove past a little girl in a flowered dress, teens playing ragtag football, shirts against skins. No, I thought, that's just the urban legend. It's bad, but not that bad. This is still a neighborhood, still these families' homes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"30347"	"we"	"thought"	" ``The opportunity to trade for Bret Saberhagen, we thought, brought our club to another level,'' Gebhard said. ``The philosophy here since Day 1 has been to improve the team each year.

"30806"	"we"	"thought"	" But by the time we got back to our seats, the waiter had bad news: the kitchen had run out of all entrees but Nantucket scallops and capon. We had what was left, with peas and corn pudding. The scallops were delicious, the chicken so-so. ``Maybe that's why they call it Randall's Ordinary,'' said my wife, Debbie, her churlish mood only partly mitigated by a dessert of pear and apple crisp.

"33445"	"she"	"thought"	" Point by point she dismantles the structure of illusion that Arendt built around her former teacher and lover. A central ingredient of that structure, for example, was Arendt's belief that Heidegger's problems stemmed from his wife, Elfride, whose biases and resentments, she thought, undermined her husband's prestige ``and created an atmosphere of hostility around him.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"

They did a remarkably good job, I thought, and also got the audience involved, so that one gentleman wound up with Madonna on his lap and one woman ended up dancing with Elvis. On the other nights, the star act was ``4 Past Midnight,'' a four-person song-and-dance show covering a wide variety of music and, again, occasionally involving an unsuspecting audience member. For instance, during the song ``Ride, Sally, Ride'' I suddenly found a microphone in my face, a spotlight on me and one of the entertainers urging me to sing the chorus.

Stories are moving in category shown at end of each budget item.  Lifestyle, Entertainment  GRETA _ WASHINGTON _ Of all the characters that have emerged from the O.J. Simpson trial, none is perhaps as unlikely a media celebrity as Greta Van Susteren. With her long, straight schoolgirlish hair and solid-as-a-gavel insights, the 5-foot-3-inch litigator has become a familiar sight to OJTV addicts. She is CNN's on-air legal analyst, providing play-by-play for the Simpson trial. (e)  ONBOOKS _ undated _ BOOK NOTES: Writer and professional storyteller J.J. Reneaux of Athens, Ga., is one of the authors contributing to ``Little Folk,'' a new line of children's folklore being launched this week by August House of Little Rock. Reneaux's book, ``Why Alligator Hates Dog,'' is based on a Cajun folk tale about a crafty canine who consistently outwits a pompous gator. (e)  BUSTER-KEATON-$ADV01 _ undated _ It's Buster Keaton's year, and it's about time. (e)  National  RAILROAD _ ABOARD THE PIEDMONT _ Four months into the Piedmont's daily round-trip service from Raleigh to Charlotte, business travelers whom state rail officials hoped would buoy ridership are sticking to cars and planes. On many days, the refurbished, comfortable train is virtually empty except for retirees seeking to relive rail's golden era and parents with kids looking for some fun. (a)  OLY-TRYOUTS _ undated _ The auditions will be intense, and if you're selected, the rehearsals will be demanding, lengthy and frequent. The pay is zilch, and the cast will get to see only the part of the show in which it's performing. Heck, who'd want anything to do with it? Since what we're talking about is the chance to perform in the Olympic Opening and Closing Ceremonies, plenty do. (a)  OLY-Q&AMP;A _ ATLANTA _ Olympics tickets questions and answers. (a)  OLY-SOCCER _ undated _ The firing of Timo Liekoski as Olympic men's soccer coach this week resulted from fears that the team won't make it out of the first round next summer. (a)  OLY-ELEVATED _ undated _ A Florida company's plan to build the world's only public magnetic levitation people mover to the Olympic stadium zipped through several City Council committees this week. But the most important stop will be Monday, when the full council is expected to vote on whether to grant air rights to the company to build the privately funded, high-speed train over city streets. (a)  OLY-TIXORDERS _ ATLANTA _ Atlanta ticket experiences ranged from good to disappointing. (a)  OLY-ROOFTOPS _ ATLANTA _ Those in search of a roof to rent during next summer's Olympics will find there's no shortage of space for the right price, which is in keeping with the neighborhood: sky high. (a)  OLY-HUMMER _ undated _ There is another way into the oversold halls of the Olympics, you know. Octavius Terry this week got just as many tickets as he requested. None. Yet he obsesses over the thought of being there. As long shots go, his method may be no more of a reach than trusting a computer to pull your name out of its cybernetic hat. (a)  OLY-ROUGHTON _ undated _ At Opening Ceremonies, 15,000 of the 75,000 people will be connected to the Olympic Games only by virtue of the grand luck that won them tickets in the FairTix lottery. The other 60,000 people in the stands will be Olympic officials, politicians, VIPs, the media and corporate sponsors _ those connected to the Olympic Games by virtue of their wealth and/or status. (a)  OLY-SPORTS-(2Takes) _ undated _ Atlanta Olympics update, sport by sport. (a)  OLY-MOCEANU _ HOUSTON _ Dominique Moceanu has been armed with a passport since the advanced age of three months, having already traveled to Brazil and Belgium, along with pilgrimages to visit relatives in Romania. Those were for practice. The big trip is now. The one to the future. (a)  OLY-KAROLYI _ HOUSTON _ When Bela Karolyi slammed his last table and stormed away from Barcelona vowing he was through with world-class coaching, no voice piped up to contest the divorce. If the most flamboyant gymnastics coach of the era had had enough of the sport, the converse ran equally true and he knew it. (a)  PTA-2takes _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Cookies and magic shows used to be all some parents expected from their local parent-teacher association. The PTA of the 1990s, however, fights handgun laws and lobbies for legislation to curb juvenile crime. That activism has been cited as contributing to a decline over the past few years in PTA membership in Texas. TEXAS POINTS. (a)  Sports  OSU-NDAME _ COLUMBUS, Ohio _ They will take the field with monograms on their sleeves, gold helmets on their heads and an attitude in their hearts. Except for the monograms and helmets, Ohio State will not be much different than Notre Dame's Fighting Irish at Ohio Stadium. Same type of offense; same type of defense. OSU 3-0 and ranked No. 7. ND 3-1 and No. 15. (s)  AUTORACING _ undated _ Two-time Automobile Racing Club of America champion Bobby Bowsher has learned to appreciate the good times. ``It's been one of those years _ we've had mechanical problems,'' he said this week as preparations for Saturday's 150-lap event at Winchester (Ind.) Speedway continued at the team's shop in Harmony, just east of Springfield, Ohio. (s)  BOHLS-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ This story is about minor-league baseball. Perhaps you've heard of it. Yeah, yeah, I'm sure you're absolutely, unequivocably fed up with the issue, so I promise this will be my final column on the Phoenix Firebirds/ Austin Swing before the election unless, of course, I write another one. (s)  MOFFETT-COLUMN _ undated _ Centuries from now, a future generation will look back with an archaeologist's eye to seek to understand the decline of sports. The Saturday match for a million between two really tall guys, promoted by Donald T rump, could give them a clue. (s)  BISHER-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ If somebody would call in today and accuse George O'Leary of running up the score on Maryland, he'd be much obliged and quite flattered. In his short time as head coach at Georgia Tech, the blarney Irishman has been on the short end of some long numbers on the board. Thursday night at Bobby Dodd-Grant Field, Georgia Tech beat Maryland, 31-3, when it seemed at one precarious moment in the third quarter the Yellow Jackets might have to fight for their lives. (s)  SCHUERHOLZ _ ATLANTA _ No matter what happens this postseason, John Schuerholz promises not to use the word. ``A failure,'' the Braves general manager said, then paused. (s)  Business  Commentary  ASHLEY-COLUMN _ undated _ It's easy to forget that a few years ago, Atlanta, Washington and New York could have become irradiated ruins because of some little flare-up between peoples who conceive of God in different ways and covet the same little patch of land. So it is quite remarkable today that a tortured people like the Jews _ who since the Holocaust have preached to themselves that they must never again rely on anyone but themselves _ can give a share of that land to peop le who relentlessly have tried to take it by force. (k)  NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ CARLSBAD, Calif. _ I hope no one is looking, I thought, as I struggled to unload my car into my motel room in this trendy Pacific Coast community just north of San Diego. It's my genetic disorder. Since childhood I have suffered from a severe overpacking abnormality. I once read where some shrink said people who overpack are insecure.

Lifestyle, Entertainment  HORSE-WHISPERER _ undated _ BOOKS: And now for something completely different: a massively promoted novel that begins rather well, undergoes a literary nervous breakdown and becomes floridly bad. (e)  EYMAN-ON-BOOKS _ undated _ BOOKS COMMENTARY: Some successful people surprise with book picks. (e)  CYNDI-LAUPER _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The pop singer steps out of a black stretch limo in front of the West Palm Beach radio station early one morning. Her entourage includes a makeup artist, manager, record company representative and chauffeur. A few fans greet her outside the station with photos and copies of albums to sign. The scene may look like star-stoking excess, but Cyndi Lauper acts far from regal, arrogant or distant. (e)  TEDDY-ROOSEVELT _ undated _ BOOKS: When Teddy Roosevelt made the NYPD blue.

(l)  OLY-FOODMAIN _ ATLANTA _ It's not that the milk was bad. It was cold. And to see it come spitting out of the mouths of foreign athletes who had never tasted cold milk before was just one of those lessons in culinary diversity that's shaping the menu planning for next summer's Olympic Village dining hall. ``It was surprising the first time I saw it,'' remembers Lew Sprague, of his first taste of feeding Olympians. Since that first exposure at the 1980 Winter Games in Lake Placid, N.Y., to people who knew only shelf-stable, nonrefrigerated milk, Sprague, who's in charge of feeding the athletes at the Atlanta Games, has learned a lot about the world's feeding habits. (d)  OLY-FOODSIDE _ ATLANTA _ You'd think it would take the Jolly Green Giant to feed so many people. But this jolly-enough, sandy- haired man is of average height and comes bearing no gargantuan cans of vegetables. (d)  VIDEO-REVIEWS _ undated _ VIDEOVIEW: `Cinderella' steps back on video.

As Hurricane Opal's fury dissipated after ravaging Georgia, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle, Tropical Storm Pablo was born in the area of the Atlantic Ocean that has bred some of this season's most dangerous storms. Pablo is the 16th named storm of the busy Atlantic storm season. (a)  LOCKHEED-SCANDAL _ ATLANTA _ The man whom federal prosecutors called the ``major motivator and perpetrator'' in a Lockheed Corp. scheme to bribe a member of the Egyptian Parliament was sentenced Thursday to 18 months in prison. Suleiman Nassar, 58, who resides in Switzerland and was once Lockheed's vice president of international marketing for the Middle East and North Africa, also must pay a $125,000 fine. (a)  OLY-FLAME _ ATLANTA _ The Olympic flame may be a symbol of Atlanta's Olympic dream, but for local TV stations and networks that haven't shelled out millions to be official broadcasters, it's turning into the symbol of the city's Olympic nightmare. Officials at the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games have been telling non-rights-holding broadcasters they cannot show the flame during the Summer Games. (a)  OLY-PARKING _ ATLANTA _ Don't even think about driving downtown during the Games _ unless you're willing to pay astronomical rates to park. (a)  OLY-TICKETS _ ATLANTA _ Atlanta Olympic officials have set aside a contingency cache of tickets to award to customers whose orders were botched or who end up with obstructed seats at venues. ACOG officials, acknowledging errors in the processing of some orders, staged a ``mini-FairTix'' last week to award an undisclosed number of tickets. (a)  OLY-CONGRESS _ ATLANTA _ For the first time in 17 years, Congress will examine the U.S. Olympic Committee to see if its operations and policies fulfill the federal mandate passed in 1978. (a)  OLY-MUHAMMAD _ ATLANTA _ Atlanta swimmer could be first black on U.S. team. (a)  ROUGHTON-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ COMMENTARY: Two classes of people come to the Games: The Olympic Family and everybody else. Consequently, there are two Olympics: One for the Family and one for everyone else. Grasp this very important certitud e; find your place in the pecking order, and all else will be made clear. The Family numbers about 160,000. It consists of athletes, the International Olympic Committee, the national Olympic committees, sports administrators, corporate sponsors and their guests, elite politicians, ACOG staffers, volunteers and _ sorry _ the press. (a)  KINDRED-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ COMMENTARY: After a night like a bad horror flick, everybody is a neighbor, and everybody has a story to tell. (a)  OLY-EXPO _ ATLANTA _ Sponsors, licensees and cities hoping to host Olympic-type events tried to outdo each other in the U.S. Olympic Congress Expo at the Hilton Hotel and Towers. Products ranged from water bottles selling for a couple of dollars to Balfour jewel-encrusted pins that will sell for $10,000 apiece when they become available to the public. (a)  OILERS-NASHVILLE _ NASHVILLE _ Nashville wants the Oilers; team demands high price to move from Houston. (a)  Sports  OLY-SPORTS-4takes _ undated _ A roundup of short takes on every Olympic sport. (s)  HUMMER-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ There is one Olympic tradition that hardly ever gets its due. Yet it's as old as the will to win. Consider the ancient Greek Olympians who were reported to use herbs and mushrooms as performance-enhancing stimula nts. An athlete was only as good as his garden. It's still going on. (s)  BOHLS-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ With The Trial of the Century ending, thankfully, before the end of the century, it seems appropriate to discuss a high-profile sports figure who, according to much of the public, has been found guilty until proven innocent. We refer to Peter Edward Rose. (s)  BOHLS-COLUMN _ undated _ The trade of Dennis Rodman for a living, breathing human being from planet Earth was a win-win situation. Trading him for Will Perdue was an added bonus. Trading him for Will Rogers _ that would have worked, too. (s)  Commentary  NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ I'm white so I think O.J. got away with murder. Forget free will. That's my genetically predetermined position. Until the verdict was read, I would not have believed it. But it must be so. For months polls showed blacks and whites were 180 degrees apart. Whites thought Simpson was guilty. Blacks thought he was innocent. The polls, I thought, were flawed attempts to extract permanent meaning from fleeting sentiments. Snapshots do not reflect the big picture. But after watching the televised reactions of blacks and whites to the announcement of the verdict, I've begun to think that the polls actually gave a clear view of the big picture. (k)  YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Across the country the experience was nearly uniform. If the audience was white, it sat in silence _ a ``sickening silence'' as one reporter described things at the Los Angeles PD. If the audience was black, the cheers deafened. Judging by the noise meter, Simpson verdict reactions could have been the most jarring and pronounced evidence of racial polarization in the country's history. (k)  REAL-LIFE _ undated _ I am angry with Wal-Mart, but Ann Moliver Ruben is not. Which tells you something: Ruben has lived longer than I have. She's better educated, wiser, more kind.

It's not like this team is winning, 10-2. I know he has trade value. He's a highly skilled offensive guy. He's not getting detailed explanations as to why he isn't playing. With Europeans, if you put them on the shelf, they go away (mentally). You lose them. He thought he'd be given a chance to play. You're not going to win, 2-1, in this league anymore. The league likes high-scoring games. Guys like Mariusz carry the puck and try to make things happen. What's happening with him now goes beyond, `We're resting him tonight.'

Lorenz, who was art editor of the New Yorker from 1973 to 1993 and is cartoon editor nowadays, talked last week about his new book, ``The Art of the New Yorker, 1925 to 1995'' (Knopf; $40).  Q: How have New Yorker covers changed under the Tina Brown regime?  A: ``The biggest change is that they are being commissioned. On the editorial side, covers were always meant to be a graceful introduction to the magazine, and not a selling tool. Now, they are seen as a way of grabbing your attention, particularly on the newsstand. And they are more tied to the editorial content of the magazine, which they never used to be.''  Q: How has the subject matter in cartoons changed?  A: ``Cartoons depend on cliches. Some things have become too far out of date: Images of the businessman with his secretary, the `get ready' man (carrying the `end of the world is nigh' sign). ... We phased out the bum on the street with a little sign, because nowadays the person on the street is really a homeless person. It's not a neutral figure. ... The wife waiting behind the door with a rolling pin is out the window. ...  ``We have more on politics than we used to have. If there were serious issues, like Vietnam, we didn't want to echo that in cartoons. But there was a deliberate editorial decision to change, and now we're edging up to something that comes close to a political cartoon.''  THE MYSTERY OF JANE AUSTEN  After nearly 200 years of resting in peace, Jane Austen, this year's Frida Kahlo, is popping up everywhere.  ``Sense and Sensibility,'' ``Persuasion'' and ``Pride and Prejudice'' are new movies, notes Entertainment Weekly, and the author is such a hot commodity that she's about to star in her own mystery series.  In April, Bantam Books will publish ``Jane and the Unpleasantness at Seagrave Manor,'' which the publisher says will be the first in a series in which Austen serves as a crimefighter. The author is Stephanie Barron, described by the publisher as ``a lifelong admirer of Jane Austen's work.''  THE BEATLES ON THE HAIGHT  Bruce Bellingham of San Francisco watched a videotape of the ``Beatles Anthology'' over the weekend and pricked up his ears at the mention of his town.  ``I was all for going there,'' said John Lennon, recalling the summer of 1967, ``and living in the Haight, you know.

"54886"	"I"	"thought"	" Seven mothers in their 30s recently gatheredin a 10-mat room in an apartment building in a residential area near Jiyugaoka Station in Tokyo.    They discussed business, including advertising and how to recruit more people for their network, while their children played nearby.    The room is the head office of M-Net Japan, a company of women that does market research for companies and sells goods through a network of 1,300 homemakers. Its president is Mayumi Tomizawa, 35.    For a year after it was established, it leaned heavily on the mail to recruit more people for its marketing network. But in March it opened a home page on the Internet.    The name of the home page is Pop'n Planet. It offers mothers a place for business exchanges. In the ''planet'' in the frame, information about railway lines along which many members live is available.     Companies can place ads in the ''office building'' corner of the page. In the ''department store'' corner, children's goods and clothing are sold by mail order.    Several members conversant with computers and the Internet created the home page.    When they were first thinking of using a computer network to generate business, the women ''met'' via their personal computers late at night.    In the beginning, they didn't know whether they could generate business by using multimedia. But when they sent questionnaires to those involved in their network-marketing efforts, they found that more than 30 percent had personal computers at home.     A computer can help many mothers with small children, who have little free time and cannot go out when they want, get information they need.    ''In the daytime, when our husbands are at work, the personal computers are idle, so we can use them whenever we like,'' Tomizawa said. ''If mothers show an interest in working at home, companies will come around, too.''    Office Will, a company established by women in Ota Ward, will start a talent bank, JMB, to look for work that women can do at home. It will use a home page to recruit talent.    Its workers will translate, edit and do accounting consultation via personal computers. It has already received an order from a Tokyo company to create a home page.    Company representative Mutsumi Okuyama, 37, has formed a group to help working women. ''Hearing that women the same age as myself are being targeted in company restructuring, I thought, `Let us women create a means by which women who are fired can find work,''' she said.    The Internet is allowing small companies to tap the skills of women in their 30s _ an age range that has been under-represented in the work force because of the women's family commitments.    In Japan, most working women are in their 20s, having just graduated from high school or college, and their 40s, when many return to work after raising children.    ''We can include women in their 30s who have the will and energy to work but who need time to rear their children,'' Okuyama said. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960410.0368 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-ASAHI-BUDGET (EDITORIAL)) </DATELINE> <TEXT> FOR RELEASE: WED., APR. 10, 1996 LOWER HOUSE BUDGET DEBATE MUST NOT BE SIDETRACKED C.1996 Asahi News Service  Asahi Shimbun said in an editorial:     Lower House deliberation on the fiscal 1996 budget draft,  which includes a 685 billion yen ($6.5 billion) allocation for liquidating seven  jusen housing loan companies, is in its final phase. The ruling  coalition is prepared to vote the bill out of the Lower House Budget Committee soon.    It is, of course, unreasonable to needlessly prolong the debate. One rule of parliamentary democracy is to vote on a bill after thorough discussion. A budget bill deserves to be expedited especially because the national budget has a direct bearing on the daily lives of the citizenry.    Having said all that, however, we cannot endorse a vote on the budget bill now.    That is because neither the administration nor the ruling coalition parties have answered the key question of why taxpayers should have to pay for dealing with the jusen companies. If for no other reason than to thwart their apparent hope that the people, who oppose the expenditure, would be resigned to it eventually, we must continue to raise the question.    A promotional brochure from the Finance Ministry claims that ''The government's measures to deal with the jusen companies, including the expenditure of public money, are indispensable for protecting your savings.''    Honestly, we are stunned. Has the Finance Ministry said clearly, if just this once, that the expenditure of public funds is intended to protect depositors in general?    If the Finance Ministry goes so far as to suggest that banks and other financial institutions will be imperiled unless the jusen companies are liquidated with tax money quickly, it should specify which institutions are at risk. Without doing that, the ministry cannot avoid criticism for having issued a document that arouses public concern.    Nor has it been made clear how much more public money will need to be spent in future years. The only solution is to strike the allocation of taxpayers' money for jusen and set a time limit for establishing a rule that could be applied to all the bad loans that trouble the nation's financial institutions.    In the Diet, the movement has been neither discussion about the heart of the jusen problem nor constructive discussion toward finding a breakthrough.    Instead, the wrangling between the ruling parties and the opposition Shinshinto (New Frontier Party) is shifting away from the question of deleting the jusen line from the budget draft to the question of whether to call Koichi Kato, secretary-general of the Liberal Democratic Party, to testify.    Kato is accused of having received and concealed a donation of 10 million yen from a former vice president of Kyowa, a now-bankrupt manufacturer of structural steel framing. The suspicions have been fortified by claims of a former chairman of Kato's support group to the effect that he saw the money change hands.    Kato is the man who must bear the blame for his unwillingness to clear the suspicion. Although he has said he would follow the Budget Committee's decision, he is primarily responsible for determining the policies of the ruling coalition. Kato thus cannot shun criticism that he is being evasive. He should accept the summons to testify with good grace.    At the same time, we cannot condone the Shinshinto attitude of predicating a vote on the budget bill upon a requirement to have Kato testify. Even if Kato is called, the budget jusen allocation is unreasonable.    There is rampant speculation that Shinshinto hopes to cut a deal with the LDP that would trade demands for Diet testimony, since Shinshinto knows that the LDP would never accept having Kato testify, in exchange for not bringing Daisaku Ikeda, honorary president of the influential lay Buddhist organization Soka Gakkai, to the stand to testify on an unrelated matter. If Shinshinto's demand is thus questionable, so is the demand of the LDP, which, knowing the Shinshinto vulnerability on this point, insists on having Ikeda summoned.    The ruling and opposition parties should agree upon summoning Kato promptly after passing the budget bill in the Lower House and, furthermore, hold serious talks on how to deal with the main issue of handling the jusen companies. The Japanese Communist Party has urged that the parent banks of the troubled jusen companies pay more. That suggestion is worth study by the ruling coalition and Shinshinto.    When the Diet proceedings got back on track some time ago, the coalition and Shinshinto agreed to abide by the united opinion in the course of budget bill deliberations, and agreed that a vote on the bill would not be rammed through. That agreement should be upheld now.

"55478"	"he"	"thought"	" The letters also tell a great story about important and politically committed lives in the midst of some of the defining events of our century. After they came to America, Weill (who was Jewish) and Lenya (who was not) spoke and wrote to each other in English; they reserve some of their choicest scorn for emigres who remained in their own cliques in this country, refusing to find American friends and become Americans, the way Weill and Lenya did. Although there are still people who feel that Weill ``sold out'' to Broadway and Hollywood, the composer knew exactly what he was doing. In Hollywood, Weill wrote, ``There is only one way to get on here; you have to take everything with a great sense of humor and make fun of it (to yourself, because you mustn't show it!) and just enjoy the beautiful scenery and make money.'' The money, he thought, would enable him to do the important work he was meant to do, ``something significant again, by my former standards.''

By CINDY PEARLMAN World rights except Chicago (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  What is it about Will Smith and aliens?  He battles extraterrestrial invaders in his role as a cocky, gifted Marine fighter pilot in ``Independence Day,'' opening July 3.  But while awaiting release of that film, which might be the summer's biggest hit, Smith is in a muggy New York City, on the set of ``Men in Black'' _ and he's chasing aliens again.  ``Men in Black,'' co-starring Tommy Lee Jones, is based on a popular comic book. It casts Smith as a New York City police officer recruited by the Men in Black, an elite force who combat aliens living among us.  ``I must have been crowned the alien man,'' Smith says with a laugh. ``The next thing you'll hear is that I've signed up for `Alien 4' with Sigourney Weaver. The poster will read, `Will Smith IS the Alien.'''  Alien-fighting is a strange business.  ``Tommy Lee Jones is my partner,'' explains Smith over the phone from his trailer on the set. ``This morning, Tommy Lee blew this guy's head off in front of me. I was about to arrest Tommy Lee for murder. All of a sudden his victim's head grew back.  ``It's pretty creepy stuff.''  Filming the $70-million ``Independence Day'' was less bizarre, he says. In fact, it was downright boring.  ``When I would look in the sky, I didn't see the aliens. They were put in later with a computer,'' Smith says. ``So I'd be standing there looking at nothing but clouds and then I would have to freak out.''  Even the air combat scenes were exercises in imagination.  ``There were no other jets or little green guys flying them,'' he says. ``I was just sitting there in this easy chair throwing my body around and yelling, `Explosion!' or `There must be 12,000 aliens in that spaceship!'  ``Anyone could do it at home.''  Given his apparent specialization in alien movies, what does Smith think about real-life ETs?  ``I just think it is arrogant for us to believe we are the only life force (in the universe),'' he answers. ``How can we think we're it?  ``I have to say that my dreams are getting a little weird. I'm getting beamed to a lot of places. Weird little people show up. I think, `Will, you have to get a hobby or something.' I just can't stop thinking about aliens.  ``Everywhere I go, it's the same thing. I'm in a restaurant and the waitress will say, `Will, do you want fries with that and do you believe in aliens?' People seem very excited about it.''  After six years as television's ``Fresh Prince of Bel Air,'' Smith is excited about a movie career that has taken off. Offers are pouring in, including a sequel to ``Bad Boys'' (1995), his hit action film that cracked the $100 million mark.  ``It's funny. This June marks my 10th anniversary in show business,'' the 28-year-old says. ``In many ways it seems like I just started. Then I have days where everything just seems to be happening too quickly.''  Smith was born in Philadelphia, where he grew up with two sisters and a brother. His mother worked with the school board, his father at an ice company.  Despite his raffish charm and quick wit, Smith was not the class clown as a boy, he says.  ``I was a little shy, especially with women. I was interested in computer engineering. Math was my best subject, and I thought I'd have a nice little 9-to-5 job someday.''  It was his hobby that derailed those plans: In his spare time, Smith liked to rap.  ``It was just something to do,'' he recalls. ``I started rapping at age 12, but I never had big plans to cut a record or anything.''  In 1986, Smith and Jeff Townes formed a group, D.J. Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince. During his senior year of high school, a talent scout from Jive records heard their music. One month before high-school graduation, Jive released the duo's first record, ``Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble.''  The group earned a 1988 Grammy Award for best rap performance for ``Parents Just Don't Understand,'' the hit single from their second album, ``He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper.'' They also won a Grammy for the single ``Summertime,'' from their fourth album, ``Homebase,'' which was released in 1991 and went platinum.  When producing legend Quincy Jones heard their music and called Smith to offer him the lead role in ``Fresh Prince of Belair,'' the rapper didn't have to think twice.  ``At the time, I thought, `Why not? I'm just so very good. I'm talented, I should have a TV series.' I'm so cocky!'' he says.  ``After six years on `Fresh Prince,' I'm gonna miss it a little bit,'' Smith admits. ``I do keep in touch with everyone. Our job was to have fun on that set and there are wonderful memories. You just can't spend your life looking back.''  Throughout the run of the series, Smith had used his hiatuses for film roles in such features as ``Where the Day Takes You'' (1992), ``Six Degrees of Separation'' (1993) and ``Made in America'' (1993). Now, with the series having ended, he can be a movie machine if he likes.  ``All these offers roll in,'' he says. ``It's hard to know what to do or who to trust to steer me in the right direction.  ``I trust me. That's the only person you can really trust in this business. People in this business just want to make money off you, and usually it's not in your best interests. I'm excited about a movie career, but cautious too.''  In an effort to revive his musical career, he plans to spend more time in New York, which wasn't possible during the run of ``Fresh Prince.''  ``There is just no creative inspiration in Los Angeles. It pulls my creativity down,'' Smith says. ``There's a huge difference between New York and Los Angeles in the way rap music is performed. In New York, I feel there is more hope in the music and more comedy. That's what I like.''  The end of the series will also give him more time to spend with his son, Willard C. Smith III, nicknamed ``Trey.'' Smith is divorced from his son's mother and is currently dating actress Jada Pinkett, who stars this summer in ``The Nutty Professor.''  Feeling a little played out, Smith says he will take the rest of the summer off after ``Men in Black'' wraps.  ``Jada and I talk about doing something together. We've got to strengthen the relationship first. You must get yourselves together first, before you put a movie in the mix. Otherwise you just get too stressed out.''  Not that Smith isn't enjoying his success.  ``I'm not shy with girls anymore,'' he says. ``Seriously, for the first time in my life, I feel that women like me. There was always the other guy. I was always told, `Will is fun and he makes me laugh.' I was always the best friend and it stunk. Now women like me better.''  And why not? You never know when you may need to chase away some aliens, and Will Smith is a good man to have around for that sort of thing.  But not to hear him tell it. This Independence Day, his plans don't involve any world-saving.  ``I'll be at the barbecue,'' he says. ``I'm the grill man. The only thing I'll be saving is the hamburgers from falling into the flames.'' c.1996 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.) ------------------------------------------------- </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960624.0413 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-HOOTIE-AND-THE-BLOWFISH-PAGEUP-ART-NYTSF) </DATELINE> <TEXT> ATTN MIDWEST: IL./MICH./MO./OHIO/TENN./WIS. HOOTING AND HOLLERING: ON THE ROAD WITH HOOTIE AND THE BLOWFISH Includes a color slide of the band Hootie and the Blowfish and a sidebar listing the band's July tour dates in the Midwest. By JEANNE WOLF (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  No tuxedos for Hootie and the Blowfish, not even when they appeared on the Grammys or sang for royalty in Monaco.  ``We're just not a tux band,'' lead singer Darius Rucker explains. ``We've borrowed tuxes for some shows because it was a respect thing, but that's not us.''  No problem for this astoundingly successful band. They can wear and sing whatever they want in the wake of their record-setting first album. More than 13 million copies of ``Cracked Rear View'' (1994) were sold, and the record was still on the charts when they went back to the studio to record their much-awaited follow-up album, ``Fairweather Johnson.''  It's no coincidence that this very American group headed off on a European tour shortly after the new album came out in May.  ``We wanted to get away from all the hype and everything,'' Rucker says bluntly, ``'cause, you know, hype sucks.''  The band has encountered plenty of hype _ unsurprisingly so, given that theirs was the second-best-selling debut album in recording history, trailing only Boston's 1976 first effort.  But with the hype came intimidatingly high expectations for their second album, along with fears of the dreaded ``sophomore jinx'' which has made many artists' second albums into disappointments. Many predicted that these South Carolina college buddies, more used to playing minor clubs and small gigs all over the South, would crumble under the pressure.  But Rucker says that when they hit the studio they were fearless.  ``We had a lot of ideas and we weren't worried about it. We were just ready to do another album and we weren't scared at all.''  The group also was ready for flak from critics, who have never really been kind to them.  ``We worried about the critics at first, but not any more,'' Rucker says. ``We figured out that the media didn't sell our record. First it was the music and then it was the radio and then people just seemed to like it.''  ``We had pressure on ourselves, but from a different angle,'' agrees bassist Dean Felber. ``We're a live band and we wanted to tour, and in order to do that we needed new songs. And we were kind of worn out on the old stuff.  ``All of the pressure we put on ourselves is easier pressure to handle than when it's outside sources pushing you in a certain direction. We got to pick our own course.''  Felber says the group was braced for inevitable, probably unfavorable comparisons to its first album.  ``You can't expect something like that twice,'' he says. ``We didn't expect it the first time, you know _ it was kind of a gift. It was timing or whatever.''  He shrugs.  ``To create that twice in a row ... I don't know if that could be done.''  Guitarist Mark Bryan says that they were eager to try some new ideas.  ``I'm proud that we're still growing. I'm proud of our songwriting abilities, which are maturing,'' he says. ``I enjoy the songs from `Fairweather Johnson' the way I enjoyed the songs from `Cracked Rear View' when we first wrote them.  ``Most of all, I enjoy everyone getting together and playing. We can still have fun together and also make our music better.''  ``Fairweather Johnson'' has been in the top five since its debut. Now, as the group hits the road, Bryan looks forward to the chance to bring the new songs to live audiences.  ``We are trying as hard as we can to be anti-hype,'' he says. ``It's much more fun to just worry about your music and just play and not read about yourself every day.''  All the band members stress the group's commitment to live performances and present themselves as anti-stars _ working-guy musicians devoid of star glitter.  ``A six-week European tour, and two nights before I'm like, `OK, I gotta pack,''' Felber says. He claims that his secret to traveling comfort is to bring only two weeks' worth of clothing and do laundry every two weeks.  Bryan tries to see as much as he can in each new city they visit. He also calls home every day.  ``I try to talk to my wife every night,'' he says. ``It's important to keep yourself involved in your life back home.''  Drummer Jim ``Soni'' Sonefeld sums up his slant on the European experience:  ``It's pretty here but I can't afford a hamburger _ $38 for a burger! That's wild!''  ``We are not used to these four-star hotels,'' Felber says with a smile. ``You gotta understand, the nicest place in town in a lot of the cities we play is just an ordinary motel. I keep kidding that we don't really belong in this kind of luxury.''  And how do these hot young rockers spent their time on the road? Do they trash hotel rooms, party into the night or cruise the night scene?  No, because it might interfere with their real passion: This may be the world's only rock band which also makes up a foursome for golf.  ``Everyone asks us if success spoiled us,'' Sonefeld says. ``About golf, I can say yes! We get to play some of the nicest courses in the country and sometimes in the world.  ``We know there are people that are much more deserving who would die to play on these courses and they can't. We've been playing them for free, and we stink. We've been spoiled in that world.''  Another unusual aspect of this band is that, at least from an outsider's perspective, they reveal few signs of artistic or personal conflicts. To all appearances, all four Blowfish get along amazingly well, exchanging good-natured barbs and clearly enjoying what they do. Their only real conflicts arise from business discussions:  ``The biggest chafe these days is just trying to separate business from our music, 'cause business has become a big part of it,'' Sonefeld says. ``There's a lot of responsibility that comes with success and you've got to sit there and sort it out.  ``Though counting money isn't the biggest problem in the world to have, it can chafe people the wrong way when you're tired and you've just finished a big concert and the last thing you want to discuss is payroll taxes and investments.  ``We are all truly grateful, but we're in this for the music,'' he continues. ``And when you have to get into all these business details it can be a bit of a pain in the (butt), and tempers run a little short.''  He grins.  ``It's not a joking matter, (but) we're such lighthearted people and we still want to joke sometimes. I admit I'm the worst at it.''  Onstage, though, any lingering annoyance disappears, Sonefeld says.  ``It's not about money. It's not about anything in the world other than playing the music. That's the reason we all got together in the first place. It's what brings you back to the first time you ever had a gig together, you know. You've got your instrument, you've got your microphone and the crowd gets going. It's great!''  So great, in fact, that the musicians occasionally can't believe it, Rucker says. They are a long way from taking it for granted.  ``We were sitting around last night just having a beer,'' Rucker says, ``and thinking, `This is all part of the fantasy.'  ``And it's like I never want to wake up. Because I swear this is a dream, and one day my alarm's gonna go off and I'm going to be waking up in Charleston, S.C. and heading to the Music Forum to play a show.'' c.1996 Pentacom Productions  (Jeanne Wolf, who is based in Hollywood, reports on the entertainment industry for television, radio and print outlets.)  -0- SIDEBAR: HOOTIE AND THE BLOWFISH ON TOUR  This summer's tour will bring Hootie and the Blowfish to sites throughout the United States, including the following July dates: July 7, Mears, Mich.; July 8, Nobelsville, Mich.; July 9, St. Louis, Mo.; July 10, Kansas City, Kan.; July 12, Tinley Park, Ill.; July 13, East Troy, Wis.; July 14, Columbus, Ohio; July 16-17, Clarkston, Mich.; July 18, Cleveland, Ohio; July 21, Nashville, Tenn.; July 23, Cincinnati, Ohio; July 26, Burgettstown, Penn.; July 27-28, Bristow, Va.; July 30-31, New York City.

By IAN SPELLING (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Lou Diamond Phillips is on a roll, again.  The actor made an early splash in 1987 as rock legend Ritchie Valens in ``La Bamba'' and the next year scored in ``Stand and Deliver'' and ``Young Guns.''  He then endured a long commercial drought, including a couple of failed films _ ``Ambition'' (1991), which he co-wrote, and ``Shadow of the Wolf'' (1992). He also directed a film, ``Sioux City,'' which has yet to be released.  But the down cycle seems to be ending, thanks to his acclaimed performance in the Broadway revival of ``The King and I'' and his powerful supporting role in the upcoming film ``Courage Under Fire.''  So what happened? It's a puzzlement, as the play's King Mongkut might say. Others, though, might point to poor timing, wrong choices and old-fashioned bad luck.  ``It got frustrating sometimes because I'd say to myself, `My abilities are not any less than they were and I'm no less of an actor now than I was in 1987,''' the gregarious Phillips says, relaxing in jeans and a black-and-white polo shirt as he sits in his dressing room at Manhattan's Neil Simon Theater, where ``King and I'' has been running since its April opening. ``It's really all about who's on the cover of a magazine right now.  ``I did three films in the last few years that didn't have a chance to breathe, which opened one weekend and were gone the next. I also directed a couple of independent films.  ``So I've always been working, but I've never been in the studio stable and never been a guy with a three-picture deal. There's a perception that my career was on a higher level, but it was perceived as higher than it really was, because most of my hits were negative pickups (independent films bought and released by a studio).  ``I'm grateful for that and for the good press I've always gotten, because it makes me a known quantity to people. Anyway, the point is I stuck in there, and it's paying off now.''  Indeed it is. At 34, Phillips has been basking in the praise heaped on his energetic portrayal of the King in ``The King and I,'' not only for his talent but also for his moxie in tackling a role so associated with the late Yul Brynner.  Phillips, who acted on stage during his formative years growing up in Arlington, Texas, admits it was naive of him, but he went into ``King and I'' believing audiences and critics would not judge him by Brynner's standard.  ``I felt the show would be wonderful and that people would be swept away by it,'' says Phillips. ``I had a certain amount of confidence that what I'd do with the role would be different and, therefore, accepted as a reinterpretation.  ``I also realized that one and, possibly, two generations never saw Mr. Brynner on Broadway or in the film, and they might be open to seeing a new version of the play.  ``I knew I might take a few hits, but I could see what (director) Christopher Renshaw was doing and I could see what Donna Murphy, who has legendary status on Broadway, was doing with Anna.  ``So I thought all that would help shield me, and I was right. People essentially said, `This is an American classic, it's wonderful, and why should it be buried with Mr. Brynner?'''  Phillips, who last month lost the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical to Broadway fixture Nathan Lane, is signed to remain with ``King and I'' until next April. He does, however, have a contract stipulation that allows him time off should a desirable film role come along.  Still, audiences can see Phillips back on the big screen in ``Courage Under Fire,'' opening nationwide on July 12. The film stars Denzel Washington as Lt. Col. Serling, assigned to investigate the death in battle of Capt. Walden (Meg Ryan), a Medevac pilot nominated for a posthumous Medal of Honor.  Serling's investigation leads him to interview the men in Walden's unit, each of whom offers a different version of what unfolded during the rescue mission in which Walden perished. Among those Serling encounters is the bitter Monfriez, played by Phillips.  ``Monfriez is a good soldier who marches and shoots well and is brave,'' Phillips says. ``He's a lot of the things that make up what everybody expects of a great American GI.  ``When he's thrown into a situation beyond his control, one where what he was taught doesn't apply, things become very difficult for him. The pinnacle of that is his inability to take orders from a woman, to deal with the fact that he's outranked by someone who doesn't have his experience or battle savvy, but does have more compassion.  ``You essentially have a soldier dealing with input _ input from a woman _ that no other soldier in any other war has dealt with.''  Phillips realized when he read the script that Monfriez could be an intriguing character, but that if he didn't play him carefully he could become a cliche.  ``As much as people will learn to loathe Monfriez, they will also understand him,'' Phillips says. ``They will, at times, feel for him, and that's one of the brilliances, not only of the screenplay but also of what (director) Ed Zwick has done.  ``Monfriez, like the film, is not black-and-white. Even the people who are perceived to be bad guys have lost and been wounded, and behave the way they do because of what happened to them.  ``A lot of people are used to seeing me play good guys, and that may be part of the reason Ed cast me. People will have expectations because of my past work, and we really put a twist on that, which is great.''  Though the characters played by Washington and Ryan never meet, Phillips shared scenes with both actors. He says that they are stars for a reason.  Specifically, he notes, they were professional, prepared and there was ``magic when they turned it on'' before the camera.  ``It was a real pleasure to watch them,'' he says. ``I think I've done some of my best work in the piece, and they had something to do with that.  ``Ed's direction was important, the level of the material was superior, but perhaps it also had to do with the fact that I felt so incredibly challenged to come up against such terrific talents as Meg and Denzel.''  In a perfect world, Phillips notes, ``Courage'' would lead to other big-screen opportunities for him. Until the film fates have their say, however, he's content to star in ``The King and I,'' returning after each performance to the rented townhouse he shares with his wife Kelly, along with a rottweiler and three Dobermans.  Phillips and his wife, a makeup artist, have been married for two years. Previously he was married to ``La Bamba'' assistant director Julie Cypher, who is now in a relationship with singer Melissa Etheridge.  Phillips politely declines to talk about Cypher or their marriage, preferring instead to discuss life with Kelly.  ``Kids are definitely in the future,'' he says. ``They're something we want very badly.  ``Things are just slowing down now, that whole whirlwind of award ceremonies, luncheons and the play's opening. Kelly and I finally got back into a pool hall to play a few games.  ``That's how we met, at a pool hall in L.A., over a shot of tequila. We're just getting to the point where we're carving out a semblance of a life outside the show and my responsibilities to it.''  All in all, Phillips admits with a sheepish smile, life is good right now.  ``Life has always treated me nicely,'' he says. ``I always felt like I'm the luckiest person I could ever meet.  ``I've got to say 1996 has been a milestone. I felt that way when it started and I'll feel that way when it ends. This is a year to remember and I'm just enjoying the ride.'' c.1996 Ian Spelling  (Ian Spelling is a New York-based free-lance writer.) ------------------------------------------------- </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960624.0415 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-ANOTHER-`POINT-OF-VIEW''-PAGEUP-ART-NYTSF) </DATELINE> <TEXT> ``P.O.V.'' _ IDIOSYNCRATIC AND PROUD OF IT Includes a color slide of Sokly ``Don Bonus'' Ny in a scene from the documentary film ``AKA Don Bonus'' on ``P.O.V.'' By LAWRIE MIFFLIN c.1996 The New York Times (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  At the start of ``AKA Don Bonus,'' his first-person documentary about his refugee family's life in San Francisco's bleakest neighborhoods, the 18-year-old filmmaker Sokly ``Don Bonus'' Ny says it was hard to live his life and videotape it at the same time.  ``Especially with my family,'' he says, speaking to his own camcorder. ``We're from Cambodia, and we're pretty traditional. Talking about family secrets to the public _ we don't do that.''  American television doesn't do much of that, either. But ``P.O.V.,'' the public-television series that will broadcast Ny's film on June 25, does. ``P.O.V.'' consistently presents films that talk about some of America's most closely guarded family secrets.  They are secrets mined from the most sensitive of subjects, ranging from race to homosexuality to class conflict to physical afflictions such as Tourette's syndrome or Alzheimer's disease, both of which were topics of ``P.O.V.'' films last year. The Alzheimer's film, Deborah Hoffmann's ``Complaints of a Dutiful Daughter,'' was nominated for an Academy Award.  Named after the cinematic shorthand for ``point of view,'' ``P.O.V.'' screens several hundred independent, nonfiction films each year and chooses about a dozen for its PBS season, which is in the summer. Usually, the subject or the perspective is one that would not be found elsewhere on television.  One of the most controversial presentations on ``P.O.V.'' was Marlon Riggs' 1991 film ``Tongues Untied,'' a frank and unapologetically erotic portrayal of black male homosexuals. In a film aired this June, the subject was Audre Lorde, a black lesbian and an outspoken and influential poet who died of cancer in 1992 at the age of 58.  Unlike ``Tongues Untied,'' which was nonfiction but with dramatic enactments, music and poetry woven in, ``A Litany for Survival: The Audre Lorde Story,'' by Ada Gay Griffin and Michelle Parkerson, is a conventional documentary. But it tells the story of a passionately unconventional woman.  Born in New York of West Indian parents, Lorde first conceived of her poetry as purely private expression. Later, as she came to terms with her homosexuality _ but not before she married and had two children _ she realized she could ``take poetry and use it'' publicly, she says, ``not as propaganda, but as a way of altering feelings and lives.''  She became a teacher, a leader known in feminist circles around the world and a poetry coach to many other women. In the film, Adrienne Rich, a more eminent poet, says, ``Many poems of mine are much better because of Audre's criticisms.''  This season, many ``P.O.V.'' offerings concern conflicts about ethnicity, race or cultural identity. The series, in its ninth season, will present 11 films this summer, as well as two fall specials. They are ``Palante Siempre Palante! The Young Lords,'' a history of the militant Puerto Rican civil-rights group, and ``Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision,'' about the architect who designed the Vietnam War Memorial. The latter won the 1995 Academy Award for best documentary feature, but has never been on television until now.  Six of these 13 films are co-presentations with groups that help underwrite minority filmmakers' work. Ny's film, ``AKA Don Bonus,'' is also a presentation of the National Asian-American Telecommunications Association, for example. The Audre Lorde film is a co-presentation of the National Black Programming Consortium and the Independent Television Service.  ``(A) multicultural or minority independent film that is challenging, either in the way it's filmed or in its content, is very difficult to get televised, on public television or any other kind of television,'' says Mable Haddock, executive director of the National Black Programming Consortium, which also raises money to help producers make their films.  ``For that reason, `P.O.V.' is very, very important to independent minority producers.''  This sort of co-presentation arrangement also involves a publicity campaign for a film. Cautioning that ``the African-American community is not a monolith,'' Haddock says her group helped to direct promotional materials to segments of that community that might be interested in a certain film, and alerted them to screenings and discussion groups. It also tells ``P.O.V.'' about films that merit consideration for the series.  Similar consortiums help Hispanic, Asian-American and American Indian filmmakers.  ``Many people don't know who Audre Lord was, for example,'' Haddock says. ``We may know the importance of these artists, because we're inside this community, and often we know the filmmakers and whether they can pull it off.''  Suzanne Singer, the executive director of ``P.O.V.,'' gives two reasons why most of this season's films concern minorities.  ``Partly it's our mission to present voices not often heard on commercial television,'' she says. ``And this year there happened to be lots of really strong films coming from those communities. The Asian-American community in particular had a real flowering of very strong films this year, and we have four in the series.''  Ny's film is unusual in format, being essentially a video diary. It feels raw, like a home movie, and intensely candid.  For example, Ny didn't edit out a scene of himself crying in the car of Chandara, his older brother. When Sokly was 3, Chandara carried him out of the Cambodian jungle as the family escaped the Khmer Rouge. Here in America, Chandara is so preoccupied with his job and his wife and children that he cannot help Sokly and their younger brother with the problems overwhelming them in the ghetto.  ``Even though it's a Cambodian family in San Francisco's Tenderloin district, it's about immigrant experience too, and in some ways everyone in America can relate to that,'' Singer says. ``A lot of our films are about what it means to be an American or about identity.''  ``P.O.V.'' films have won many awards _ Emmys, Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awards, Peabodys and three Oscars _ but some of the more provocative subjects have prompted letters and phone calls complaining to PBS. Some PBS executives have even expressed discomfort about certain ``P.O.V.'' topics.  ``As society changes, risky programming becomes even riskier to make and even more difficult to get on the air,'' Haddock says.  ``For me, `P.O.V.' is a beacon. Along with ITVS and the minority consortia, it's giving us some new voices that wouldn't otherwise have an opportunity to be heard.''  And, she adds, ``Isn't that what the PBS commercial says, `If we don't do it, who will?'''

KRUGHOFF c.1996 The Washingtonian (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  There's only one thing worse than a lawn that seems to need mowing every time you look _ one that doesn't.  Most homeowners want their lawns to be green and lush. But not many people look forward to weekends of spreading fertilizer, eradicating weeds or replacing patches of brown.  Fortunately, lawn-care firms can spare you this labor and produce a lawn that will make your neighbors green with envy.  Washington Consumers' Checkbook, a nonprofit magazine, found that costs for lawn care can vary dramatically. Just in the Washington, D.C., area, prices for the same work on one lawn ranged from $417 to $1,292.  The best way to improve your chances of getting a good price and good service is to invite several firms to inspect your lawn and propose prices.  Although most firms don't require you to be there during an inspection, try to meet with a firm's representative so you can size up the company and get answers to questions. You can help the firm satisfy you by explaining to its representative:  _ how tolerant you are of weeds, thin spots and other lawn problems.  _ what you envision the result of the firm's work to be. _ how long you are willing to wait for the lawn to reach an acceptable condition.  _ how much responsibility you are willing to take on yourself.  _ how strong your concerns are regarding the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides and what precautions you expect. THE DIRT ON LAWN-CARE COMPANIES  The experiences of homeowners surveyed by Checkbook suggest that some sales representatives know little or nothing about lawns.  For one lawn, for example, Checkbook got written ``lawn analyses'' and price quotes from six firms.  _ Two firms saw evidence of leaf-spot disease, three firms found red-thread disease, one firm saw dollar-spot disease and two firms did not find any disease.  _ Two firms saw grubs, while four firms did not see any insect problems.  _ Three firms spotted crabgrass, while three did not.  _ Three firms spotted ground ivy, while three did not.  _ Three firms recommended aeration, while the other three did not.  If a firm's representative is not savvy enough to make informed judgments, the firm may be forced to follow fixed routines _ providing roughly the same treatment for every lawn. That means broadly applying pesticides and other controls rather than treating specific problems.  If you want a more tailored program, you'll want a firm with a knowledgeable staff. Identifying such a firm is not easy, but you might get insight several ways:  _ by walking your property with each firm's sales representative, listening to his or her observations and asking questions.  _ by calling your area's Cooperative Extension Service office and discussing the firms' recommendations.  _ by asking _ after having hired a firm _ that a brief explanation be left for you after each treatment, explaining what was done to which parts of your lawn and why. THE FINE PRINT  As you gather bids, you'll want to make sure each firm is quoting at least a year's worth of service, because it often takes at least that long to get good results.  Ask each company what guarantees it offers. Usually a firm promises to refund money for a treatment, or to reapply a treatment, if a customer is not satisfied.  A few firms will agree, in writing, to refund a customer's money for the entire year if the customer is not satisfied with the result.  A number of others will agree, in writing, to continue service at no cost until the customer is satisfied.  If all the firms propose prices above what you are willing to pay, ask bidders how they can cut back service to trim costs _ and what effects those cuts might have on your lawn.  Autumn fertilization and seeding, if needed, are generally regarded as the most necessary treatments. NATURAL VERSUS ORGANIC  In the past few years, lawn-care firms have offered ``natural'' or ``organic'' programs to limit environmental risks.  Although the labels are used rather loosely, most natural or organic programs simply call for fertilizing several times a year with a non-synthetic fertilizer and aerating and seeding once or twice a year.  Coupled with proper mowing and watering, such a simple program often can create a lawn as attractive as one that receives conventional chemical treatments.  Some firms offer more extensive organic treatments to kill weeds and pests, including insecticidal oils and soaps and other chemicals that are less toxic than traditional herbicides and pesticides. SECRETS OF GOOD MOWING  While a lawn-care company can provide a variety of services to improve your lawn, most leave important tasks to you, including mowing and watering. But a good firm will advise you on how to do your part.  The key to mowing is not to mow too short. Most grasses should not be cut below a height of 3 inches, although zoysia grass should be cut to about an inch.  A lawn should be mowed frequently enough that no more than one-third of the leaf is cut off at once. Mower blades should be sharp to avoid tearing the cut ends of grass, which can make them brown and vulnerable to pest attack.  Grass should be mowed when it is dry. Clippings should be left on the lawn so they can decompose and return nutrients to the soil.  Watering is also important. Grass should be watered just when the leaves are approaching the point of wilting. You'll know that your grass has reached this point if you leave footprints when you walk on it.  To keep grass green during the summer, try to make sure it gets about 1 inch of water a week: a rain gauge or a tin can can help you figure out how much you'll have to supplement rainfall.  Watering should be thorough, so that moisture penetrates at least 3 inches into the soil. Until you get a sense of how much watering your lawn needs, you can check how deep the water penetrates by digging out (and then returning) a plug of sod with a spade.  The best time to water is early in the morning. In hot weather, it's best not to water at night because that may contribute to disease. But the risk of disease is low in a well-tended lawn, and it's better to water at night than not at all.  If you see problems, call your lawn-care company to describe what you've seen. Remember that in long dry periods, brown areas may just mean that the grass has gone into a dormant stage to save its moisture and energy. (Robert M.

Luck comes our way when good or bad things happen unpredictably, in ways that we cannot foresee, let alone control.  Luck has nothing to do with success that comes the old fashioned way _ through hard work or carefully developed skill. But if you clinch a deal just because you happened along in time to help the firm's biggest client fix his flat tire, that's sheer luck.  Luck pivots on the element of chance. That sets it apart from good fortune, which is a matter of how one is situated in the world. The person who is born heir to an enormous enterprise or who possesses a vast reservoir of natural talent is fortunate but not lucky; the element of chance is absent.  Sometimes, of course, the two factors cooperate: The movie starlet is fortunate to be a talented actress and lucky to be ``discovered.''  Is there anything that lucky people have in common? The one way in which those who have luck seem to differ from those who don't is in their tendency to expose themselves to potentially lucky circumstances.  Only someone who holds a lottery ticket can be a lucky winner; only the person who runs the risk of possible failure can achieve success through luck's gift.  Luck, be it good or bad, will accordingly play a larger role _ statistically speaking _ in the lives of risk takers than in those of the world's Casper Milquetoasts.  Might someone become successful through luck alone? The odds of that are unlikely. Usually, the most that luck brings is an opportunity, or a favorable conjuncture of events. The individual must be in a position to capitalize on that opportunity.  A stroke of luck might make someone enormously wealthy, but the concept of success suggests engaging in an enterprise that yields a chain of positive consequences _ good results achieved systematically in some ongoing line of endeavor.  That such results could be realized through chance alone is improbable. Think of your favorite candidate for the role of ``incredibly lucky person,'' someone whose career and course of life has been punctuated by great strokes of luck. Almost inevitably you will find that those gifts of luck are coupled with an extraordinary talent for exploiting them.  Luck seems to be particularly evident when matters go especially well or ill despite the probabilities. Consider what the world would be like if this were not so _ if the talented always succeeded and the inept invariably came to ruin.  Luck is a great equalizer. Exempt from reason, it helps make the playing field of life more level. It creates a situation in which everyone has a chance. Even those who are handsome, rich, naturally well-endowed and well-equipped with the world's goods may suffer the ravages of hard luck.  And the world's victims, handicapped by the lack of life's good things, may have their bleak condition alleviated by spurts of good luck.  How can one comfort someone who has sustained major misfortune through bad luck? Some people find it helpful to believe that all mischance is only apparently so _ that it's part of a great plan in which everything happens for the best.  But for those who believe in a more random universe, comfort may be found in the very idea that chance is blind. One simply accepts that ill luck is undeserved, and that its victims have not brought it on themselves.  The prospect of occasional bad luck is there for us all. The range of what we cannot foresee is so extensive that luck is bound to be an important reality for everyone.  And even if we could eliminate luck altogether, would we want to? Doing so would impoverish our lives. In a predictable world, where all actions could be read off from the register of the Recording Angel before the fact, there would remain no room for human freedom.  But if luck can't be eliminated, can it at least be controlled or manipulated? In one sense the answer is clearly no. By the time luck enters the scene it is usually too late for intervention.  What can be controlled or manipulated, however, is the extent to which matters are left to chance. Planning, preparation, safety measures and insurance are all classic examples of safeguards we take to protect ourselves against the potential impact of bad luck.  It must also be acknowledged that sometimes even superstition _ the feeling that luck is on one's side _ can make a difference.  In circumstances where one's mental attitude counts, a feeling of confidence can affect performance. When, for example, a salesman is dealing with a difficult customer, or a tennis player with a tough opponent, the heartening feeling that today is one's lucky day _ that on this occasion success will come one's way, even against the odds _ can affect one's prospects.  But in genuine games of chance, such as roulette or the lottery, that notion can be an invitation to frustration. Luck doesn't take sides.  The attribute that Napoleon is said to have prized in his marshals was their apparent good luck. But chance alone did not throw success in battle into their waiting arms. Preparedness and diligence do not bring luck into being, but they help us position ourselves to take advantage of favorable moments.  It was, if memory serves, the golfer Lee Trevino who said, ``The harder I work, the luckier I get.'' As such precepts suggest, luck management is mostly a matter of common sense.  How could it be otherwise? Just exactly because luck is so prominent and pervasive a factor in human affairs, we have an enormous amount of accumulated experience on the issue. But whether or not we actually profit from that wisdom is something else altogether.  Luck may not play favorites, but it certainly does not discriminate against those who use their heads. -0- SIDEBAR: FIVE WAYS TO INCREASE YOUR LUCK  Luck management draws on principles of proverbial wisdom; in other words, on common sense.  1. Invite good luck. To maximize your exposure to good luck, capitalize on opportunities that put you in situations where favorable developments can occur.  2. Play the odds. Wherever possible, keep the odds on your side by managing risks in terms of determinable probabilities, thereby reducing the extent to which you rely on luck alone.  3. Avoid undue risks. Another cardinal rule of prudence is to minimize your exposure to bad luck. Don't take undue or unnecessary chances.  4. Plan for contingencies. Insurance _ literally, an insurance policy, or figuratively, a disaster or contingency plan _ is another tried-and-true resource for managing unpredictability. It provides protection and buffering against the inevitable occurrence of unlucky outcomes.  5. Extend your knowledge. Gather needed information and act on that knowledge, instead of simply trusting luck. By testing the market before introducing a product line you will not leave its success or failure to chance.

Includes a 200-word sidebar By SHERRY SUIB COHEN c.1996 Family Circle North American rights only. (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  There's something captivating about an opposite. Passion is aroused by a jolt of differences: It's exciting.  The opposite natures of couples can lend a marriage its most exciting challenges _ and balance. The very best marriages thrive on growth and change. But what if your differences become annoyances? Or worse, obstacles to your marriage?  What follows are four combinations of disparate individuals (all names have been changed) who are married to each other. If you find yourself in one or more categories, read on for tips on transforming your differences into strengths. THE INTROVERT &AMP; EXTROVERT: OPPOSITE TYPES  ``Steve was intensely private,'' says Ann from Florida. ``At first, it seemed intriguing and romantic.''  But after six months of marriage, ``the silence got dull. We're so different socially. I love people; his inspiration comes from empty rooms. Are we in trouble?''  ``We're talking about issues of safety here,'' says Rebecca Cutter, a Portland, Ore., psychotherapist and author of ``When Opposites Attract (Plume/Penguin, 1995).  Understanding is the key. The extrovert must recognize why her spouse won't choose to be social (he feels unsafe), and minimize the perceived danger for him. She should never put him in the spotlight without his prior knowledge (surprise parties are a definite no).  When the introvert trusts his mate, Cutter says, he'll risk a little more social activity knowing she won't do anything to hurt him (like desert him in a crowded room).  By the same token, the introvert must maximize the variety in the partners' lives or risk deadening the liveliness of the marriage.  ``Invigorating changes _ more travel, for example _ keep the relationship vital,'' Cutter says.  Another approach comes from Sybil Evans, president of Sybil Evans Associates, a New York organization specializing in conflict resolution.  ``We look for an `integrated solution' that satisfies both,'' Evans says, ``instead of the traditional `compromise' where neither ends up happy.''  For example, a traditional compromise might consist of Steve's reluctantly agreeing to a large party one week if Ann says yes to staying home the next. But rest assured, Evans says, that even though it's a compromise, he'll hate the party, and she'll feel like a prisoner at home. Both may become bitter and blame each other.  But here's the integrated approach: hosting a quiet, two-couple dinner instead of attending a large affair. The intimate party will satisfy Ann's need to interact with others, and it will meet her husband's need to limit socializing to a few people rather than having to painfully cruise a crowd. THE FISHERMAN &AMP; THE READER: OPPOSITE INTERESTS  ``Nancy was a client of mine,'' Evans says. ``At first, the city-lover in her was drawn to the outdoorsy him. But just because the ocean interested him didn't mean she wanted to do battle with 6-foot waves.''  The relationship worked all right initially _ when he went off to do things with worms and sharks, she explored the flea markets or simply stayed home with a novel.  Then Nancy noticed that there was something wrong with her husband's fish stories.  ``He'd come home with these wonderful tales about seeing whales and catching giant tuna,'' she told Evans, ``but I realized, I was just hearing the stories. I wasn't in them.''  At Evans's suggestion, Nancy came up with a plan. She goes on the boat a lot now but never without a book. Nancy enjoys reading during the more mundane parts, but she's also there to marvel when they see a giant turtle.  And when it's her turn to curl up with a book, he practices his fishing knots next to her on the same couch.  Two caveats: Blending interests only works when both partners share in the blending. And although it's great when it happens, partners with opposite interests can't always blend them, Evans warns. THE OPTIMIST &AMP; THE PESSIMIST: OPPOSITE OUTLOOKS  Jane, a Boston lawyer, was enticed, she says, by Randy's ``happy face and sunny outlook.'' And Jane, says Randy, was ``the most interesting, grounded woman'' he ever met.  When they married six years ago, they began to live the way they'd been brought up: Randy, a reporter, focuses not on problems but on finding solutions, and he believes that he and Jane can always turn roadblocks into opportunities. When he lost his job recently, he wasn't crushed _ he was confident that he'd find another.  Jane is steady and intelligent, but worry and distrust are her middle names. She often thinks Randy's being childish. In a shrinking economy she's sure he won't find another job. The two are wearing each other down. Is there any hope?  Cutter offers two coping tricks to help achieve a balance between negativity and positivity: ``When Randy Optimist is having a really difficult time with Janie Pessimist, he might try picturing her when she was 5,'' Cutter suggests.  Seeing your partner as a vulnerable child, Cutter says, helps you understand and respect her way of looking at life. It makes her an endearing _ instead of a cranky _ character.  If two opposite personalities can learn to talk peacefully and try to understand, then sometimes draw from each other's reverse outlook, a remarkable balance certainly can be achieved, Evans says.  Randy and Jane might try working out a ``best-case'' and a ``worst-case'' scenario for any given threat. The idea is to temper his enthusiasm while uplifting her gloominess. Working together, they will see that growth and strength lie in emotional moderation. THE SPENDER &AMP; THE SAVER: OPPOSITE IMPULSES  After 13 years of a difficult marriage, Sara from Colorado is doubtful that either she or Michael have many strengths the other needs _ or wants.  When they met, she was drawn to his financial stability and his quiet reticence. Like a moth to flame, he flew to the way she made him laugh.  Today she wouldn't give 5 cents for his quiet, and he doesn't find her so funny anymore.  Sara is a generous spirit. Her strongest impulse is to spend her money and to share her dreams and thoughts with all her friends, not just Michael.  She has a full-time job, and her checking and savings accounts are in both their names.  Conversely, Michael's deepest impulse is to hoard. His bank account is in his name alone: ``What's mine is mine, what's hers is ours because I earn more'' is the way he looks at finances. He also shares very little emotionally.  It's not too late for this couple to see that they have reconcilable differences, says Dr. Harville Hendrix, co-author of ``The Couples Companion'' (Pocket, 1994). And with work, they can weave gold from chaff.  ``They should recognize that both too much giving and too much hoarding are defenses,'' Hendrix says. ``The generous spirit and the miserly mate must understand each other's motivations.''  Giving, Hendrix says, is, among other things, a subtle attempt to get others to love you. Most ultragenerous spirits are trying very hard to build a wall against loneliness, which would make them too vulnerable. They think if they give things of value away _ and that includes emotions _ people will be devoted to them and that will be a defense against being alone.  The miserly mate is also trying to make something happen: He wants to feel secure, and he fears he hasn't enough resources or emotions to share. If he lets down his guard, tells his secrets or spends his money, he'll be exposed and vulnerable.  What to do? The answer, like most good solutions, is disarmingly simple. Hendrix says that ``each must understand that the other's difference is precisely what's missing in themselves and then try to develop in themselves some of what they most object to in their partners.''  The miser must try to share more and protect less. He might start, Evans says, with joint banking accounts to promote trust in the marriage (both might still keep small separate accounts so each still has autonomy, and neither has to ask ``permission'' to spend money).  The emotional hoarder must also attempt to give his partner more access to his inner world _ even if it doesn't immediately feel safe. When it becomes a habit, it will start to feel safe.  The partner who gives everything away needs to put limits on her largesse, needs to incorporate a bit of her mate's hoarding behavior. She has to understand that keeping some things to herself doesn't diminish but enhances her desirability to others, Hendrix says. -0- SIDEBAR: TURNING YOUR DIFFERENCES INTO STRENGTHS  These conflict-resolution methods will help keep you and your spouse close.  _ Check assumptions before leaping to conclusions. Agree to stop for a moment at an ``outlook impasse'' and entertain the possibility that this time the other's outlook may be right.  For example, she notices her wallet is gone and assumes it's stolen. He says she probably left it at home. Each must listen to each other's reasons for their conclusions _ then figure out together the most logical one.  No sarcasm is allowed.  _ Role play. Every few weeks, agree to creep into each other's skin for a day. He will try not to be Pollyanna, and she will not dwell on wort-case scenarios.  At any given crisis during the day, each must promise to think, ``What would my spouse do?'' Then each will do it in the other's way.  This approach gives spouses permission to step back and take another route other than the programmed one. It works.  _ Get funny. Try to look at your spouse's outlooks in a humorous way and don't take things too seriously. Laughing at yourself is a lovable act, and lovable acts cement relationships.

Within the reaches of the information superhighway lies the World Wide Web, a vast subsystem that's even faster and easier to access than the Internet.  Since its creation in 1989, the Web has exploded into hundreds of thousands of home pages, or Web sites. The possibilities for researching a particular health topic boggle the mind.  No matter which home page you start with, by following hypertext clues (text that's colored to lead you to other sites at the click of a mouse), you can end up browsing everything from the National Institutes of Health to research abstracts at a European university.  You'll find a wealth of information covering the conventional and unconventional in medicine and health: hospitals, dentistry, women's health, heart health, cancer, diabetes, plastic surgery, mental health, foot care, even ``Rogaine Online'' _ and that's just a sampling.  Understanding of the topic is often enhanced by superior graphics. If you want to check into herbal medicine, for instance, it's a great help to ``see'' the herbs you're reading about. Try the herbal photo gallery at Herbal Hall (http://www.crl.com/(T)robbee/herbal.html), as well as a menu of other selections from ``Longevity Herbs-Adaptogens-Nutritives'' to ``Herbal-Medical Dictionary.''  Or you could start at the Alternative Medicine Homepage (http://www.pitt.edu/(T)cbw/altm.html), which describes itself as ``a jumpstation for sources of information on unconventional, unorthodox, unproven or alternative, innovative, integrative therapies.''  From there, you're a mouse-click away from a pool of newsletters, access to mailing lists and commercial databases, bulletin boards and files for such selections as Kombucha (the medicinal mushroom), music therapy, massage, chiropractic and acupuncture.

If there's a nip or tuck in your future, set your Web-searching tool for ``plastic surgery'' and browse through plastic surgery-focused home pages, such as the University of California Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery page, a list of plastic surgery medical journals called Plink or hundreds of other publications, each outfitted with hypertext links of its own.  You'll find a dazzling array, including information-jammed text files, charts, graphs, drawings, diagrams, photos and, in some cases, even sound-bytes and movies on nearly every subject you can imagine.  The World Wide web is a home for ``hundreds of resources from schools, hospitals, health-care professionals, informed amateurs, former patients and charlatans,'' says Abbot Chambers, editor of the Whole Internet Catalog (http://gnn.com/wic/index.html), which is online.  ``In short, it's a mirror of everything going on in society at large.''

Agree to stop for a moment at an ``outlook impasse'' and entertain the possibility that this time the other's outlook may be right.  For example, she notices her wallet is gone and assumes it's stolen. He says she probably left it at home. Each must listen to each other's reasons for their conclusions _ then figure out together the most logical one.  No sarcasm is allowed.  _ Role play. Every few weeks, agree to creep into each other's skin for a day. He will try not to be Pollyanna, and she will not dwell on wort-case scenarios.  At any given crisis during the day, each must promise to think, ``What would my spouse do?'' Then each will do it in the other's way.  This approach gives spouses permission to step back and take another route other than the programmed one. It works.  _ Get funny. Try to look at your spouse's outlooks in a humorous way and don't take things too seriously. Laughing at yourself is a lovable act, and lovable acts cement relationships.

By CINDY PEARLMAN World rights except Chicago (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  What is it about Will Smith and aliens?  He battles extraterrestrial invaders in his role as a cocky, gifted Marine fighter pilot in ``Independence Day,'' opening July 3.  But while awaiting release of that film, which might be the summer's biggest hit, Smith is in a muggy New York City, on the set of ``Men in Black'' _ and he's chasing aliens again.  ``Men in Black,'' co-starring Tommy Lee Jones, is based on a popular comic book. It casts Smith as a New York City police officer recruited by the Men in Black, an elite force who combat aliens living among us.  ``I must have been crowned the alien man,'' Smith says with a laugh. ``The next thing you'll hear is that I've signed up for `Alien 4' with Sigourney Weaver. The poster will read, `Will Smith IS the Alien.'''  Alien-fighting is a strange business.  ``Tommy Lee Jones is my partner,'' explains Smith over the phone from his trailer on the set. ``This morning, Tommy Lee blew this guy's head off in front of me. I was about to arrest Tommy Lee for murder. All of a sudden his victim's head grew back.  ``It's pretty creepy stuff.''  Filming the $70-million ``Independence Day'' was less bizarre, he says. In fact, it was downright boring.  ``When I would look in the sky, I didn't see the aliens. They were put in later with a computer,'' Smith says. ``So I'd be standing there looking at nothing but clouds and then I would have to freak out.''  Even the air combat scenes were exercises in imagination.  ``There were no other jets or little green guys flying them,'' he says. ``I was just sitting there in this easy chair throwing my body around and yelling, `Explosion!' or `There must be 12,000 aliens in that spaceship!'  ``Anyone could do it at home.''  Given his apparent specialization in alien movies, what does Smith think about real-life ETs?  ``I just think it is arrogant for us to believe we are the only life force (in the universe),'' he answers. ``How can we think we're it?  ``I have to say that my dreams are getting a little weird. I'm getting beamed to a lot of places. Weird little people show up. I think, `Will, you have to get a hobby or something.' I just can't stop thinking about aliens.  ``Everywhere I go, it's the same thing. I'm in a restaurant and the waitress will say, `Will, do you want fries with that and do you believe in aliens?' People seem very excited about it.''  After six years as television's ``Fresh Prince of Bel Air,'' Smith is excited about a movie career that has taken off. Offers are pouring in, including a sequel to ``Bad Boys'' (1995), his hit action film that cracked the $100 million mark.  ``It's funny. This June marks my 10th anniversary in show business,'' the 28-year-old says. ``In many ways it seems like I just started. Then I have days where everything just seems to be happening too quickly.''  Smith was born in Philadelphia, where he grew up with two sisters and a brother. His mother worked with the school board, his father at an ice company.  Despite his raffish charm and quick wit, Smith was not the class clown as a boy, he says.  ``I was a little shy, especially with women. I was interested in computer engineering. Math was my best subject, and I thought I'd have a nice little 9-to-5 job someday.''  It was his hobby that derailed those plans: In his spare time, Smith liked to rap.  ``It was just something to do,'' he recalls. ``I started rapping at age 12, but I never had big plans to cut a record or anything.''  In 1986, Smith and Jeff Townes formed a group, D.J. Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince. During his senior year of high school, a talent scout from Jive records heard their music. One month before high-school graduation, Jive released the duo's first record, ``Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble.''  The group earned a 1988 Grammy Award for best rap performance for ``Parents Just Don't Understand,'' the hit single from their second album, ``He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper.'' They also won a Grammy for the single ``Summertime,'' from their fourth album, ``Homebase,'' which was released in 1991 and went platinum.  When producing legend Quincy Jones heard their music and called Smith to offer him the lead role in ``Fresh Prince of Belair,'' the rapper didn't have to think twice.  ``At the time, I thought, `Why not? I'm just so very good. I'm talented, I should have a TV series.' I'm so cocky!'' he says.  ``After six years on `Fresh Prince,' I'm gonna miss it a little bit,'' Smith admits. ``I do keep in touch with everyone. Our job was to have fun on that set and there are wonderful memories. You just can't spend your life looking back.''  Throughout the run of the series, Smith had used his hiatuses for film roles in such features as ``Where the Day Takes You'' (1992), ``Six Degrees of Separation'' (1993) and ``Made in America'' (1993). Now, with the series having ended, he can be a movie machine if he likes.  ``All these offers roll in,'' he says. ``It's hard to know what to do or who to trust to steer me in the right direction.  ``I trust me. That's the only person you can really trust in this business. People in this business just want to make money off you, and usually it's not in your best interests. I'm excited about a movie career, but cautious too.''  In an effort to revive his musical career, he plans to spend more time in New York, which wasn't possible during the run of ``Fresh Prince.''  ``There is just no creative inspiration in Los Angeles. It pulls my creativity down,'' Smith says. ``There's a huge difference between New York and Los Angeles in the way rap music is performed. In New York, I feel there is more hope in the music and more comedy. That's what I like.''  The end of the series will also give him more time to spend with his son, Willard C. Smith III, nicknamed ``Trey.'' Smith is divorced from his son's mother and is currently dating actress Jada Pinkett, who stars this summer in ``The Nutty Professor.''  Feeling a little played out, Smith says he will take the rest of the summer off after ``Men in Black'' wraps.  ``Jada and I talk about doing something together. We've got to strengthen the relationship first. You must get yourselves together first, before you put a movie in the mix. Otherwise you just get too stressed out.''  Not that Smith isn't enjoying his success.  ``I'm not shy with girls anymore,'' he says. ``Seriously, for the first time in my life, I feel that women like me. There was always the other guy. I was always told, `Will is fun and he makes me laugh.' I was always the best friend and it stunk. Now women like me better.''  And why not? You never know when you may need to chase away some aliens, and Will Smith is a good man to have around for that sort of thing.  But not to hear him tell it. This Independence Day, his plans don't involve any world-saving.  ``I'll be at the barbecue,'' he says. ``I'm the grill man. The only thing I'll be saving is the hamburgers from falling into the flames.'' c.1996 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of the band Hootie and the Blowfish and a sidebar listing the band's July tour dates in the Midwest. By JEANNE WOLF (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  No tuxedos for Hootie and the Blowfish, not even when they appeared on the Grammys or sang for royalty in Monaco.  ``We're just not a tux band,'' lead singer Darius Rucker explains. ``We've borrowed tuxes for some shows because it was a respect thing, but that's not us.''  No problem for this astoundingly successful band. They can wear and sing whatever they want in the wake of their record-setting first album. More than 13 million copies of ``Cracked Rear View'' (1994) were sold, and the record was still on the charts when they went back to the studio to record their much-awaited follow-up album, ``Fairweather Johnson.''  It's no coincidence that this very American group headed off on a European tour shortly after the new album came out in May.  ``We wanted to get away from all the hype and everything,'' Rucker says bluntly, ``'cause, you know, hype sucks.''  The band has encountered plenty of hype _ unsurprisingly so, given that theirs was the second-best-selling debut album in recording history, trailing only Boston's 1976 first effort.  But with the hype came intimidatingly high expectations for their second album, along with fears of the dreaded ``sophomore jinx'' which has made many artists' second albums into disappointments. Many predicted that these South Carolina college buddies, more used to playing minor clubs and small gigs all over the South, would crumble under the pressure.  But Rucker says that when they hit the studio they were fearless.  ``We had a lot of ideas and we weren't worried about it. We were just ready to do another album and we weren't scared at all.''  The group also was ready for flak from critics, who have never really been kind to them.  ``We worried about the critics at first, but not any more,'' Rucker says. ``We figured out that the media didn't sell our record. First it was the music and then it was the radio and then people just seemed to like it.''  ``We had pressure on ourselves, but from a different angle,'' agrees bassist Dean Felber. ``We're a live band and we wanted to tour, and in order to do that we needed new songs. And we were kind of worn out on the old stuff.  ``All of the pressure we put on ourselves is easier pressure to handle than when it's outside sources pushing you in a certain direction. We got to pick our own course.''  Felber says the group was braced for inevitable, probably unfavorable comparisons to its first album.  ``You can't expect something like that twice,'' he says. ``We didn't expect it the first time, you know _ it was kind of a gift. It was timing or whatever.''  He shrugs.  ``To create that twice in a row ... I don't know if that could be done.''  Guitarist Mark Bryan says that they were eager to try some new ideas.  ``I'm proud that we're still growing. I'm proud of our songwriting abilities, which are maturing,'' he says. ``I enjoy the songs from `Fairweather Johnson' the way I enjoyed the songs from `Cracked Rear View' when we first wrote them.  ``Most of all, I enjoy everyone getting together and playing. We can still have fun together and also make our music better.''  ``Fairweather Johnson'' has been in the top five since its debut. Now, as the group hits the road, Bryan looks forward to the chance to bring the new songs to live audiences.  ``We are trying as hard as we can to be anti-hype,'' he says. ``It's much more fun to just worry about your music and just play and not read about yourself every day.''  All the band members stress the group's commitment to live performances and present themselves as anti-stars _ working-guy musicians devoid of star glitter.  ``A six-week European tour, and two nights before I'm like, `OK, I gotta pack,''' Felber says. He claims that his secret to traveling comfort is to bring only two weeks' worth of clothing and do laundry every two weeks.  Bryan tries to see as much as he can in each new city they visit. He also calls home every day.  ``I try to talk to my wife every night,'' he says. ``It's important to keep yourself involved in your life back home.''  Drummer Jim ``Soni'' Sonefeld sums up his slant on the European experience:  ``It's pretty here but I can't afford a hamburger _ $38 for a burger! That's wild!''  ``We are not used to these four-star hotels,'' Felber says with a smile. ``You gotta understand, the nicest place in town in a lot of the cities we play is just an ordinary motel. I keep kidding that we don't really belong in this kind of luxury.''  And how do these hot young rockers spent their time on the road? Do they trash hotel rooms, party into the night or cruise the night scene?  No, because it might interfere with their real passion: This may be the world's only rock band which also makes up a foursome for golf.  ``Everyone asks us if success spoiled us,'' Sonefeld says. ``About golf, I can say yes! We get to play some of the nicest courses in the country and sometimes in the world.  ``We know there are people that are much more deserving who would die to play on these courses and they can't. We've been playing them for free, and we stink. We've been spoiled in that world.''  Another unusual aspect of this band is that, at least from an outsider's perspective, they reveal few signs of artistic or personal conflicts. To all appearances, all four Blowfish get along amazingly well, exchanging good-natured barbs and clearly enjoying what they do. Their only real conflicts arise from business discussions:  ``The biggest chafe these days is just trying to separate business from our music, 'cause business has become a big part of it,'' Sonefeld says. ``There's a lot of responsibility that comes with success and you've got to sit there and sort it out.  ``Though counting money isn't the biggest problem in the world to have, it can chafe people the wrong way when you're tired and you've just finished a big concert and the last thing you want to discuss is payroll taxes and investments.  ``We are all truly grateful, but we're in this for the music,'' he continues. ``And when you have to get into all these business details it can be a bit of a pain in the (butt), and tempers run a little short.''  He grins.  ``It's not a joking matter, (but) we're such lighthearted people and we still want to joke sometimes. I admit I'm the worst at it.''  Onstage, though, any lingering annoyance disappears, Sonefeld says.  ``It's not about money. It's not about anything in the world other than playing the music. That's the reason we all got together in the first place. It's what brings you back to the first time you ever had a gig together, you know. You've got your instrument, you've got your microphone and the crowd gets going. It's great!''  So great, in fact, that the musicians occasionally can't believe it, Rucker says. They are a long way from taking it for granted.  ``We were sitting around last night just having a beer,'' Rucker says, ``and thinking, `This is all part of the fantasy.'  ``And it's like I never want to wake up. Because I swear this is a dream, and one day my alarm's gonna go off and I'm going to be waking up in Charleston, S.C. and heading to the Music Forum to play a show.'' c.1996 Pentacom Productions  (Jeanne Wolf, who is based in Hollywood, reports on the entertainment industry for television, radio and print outlets.)  -0- SIDEBAR: HOOTIE AND THE BLOWFISH ON TOUR  This summer's tour will bring Hootie and the Blowfish to sites throughout the United States, including the following July dates: July 7, Mears, Mich.; July 8, Nobelsville, Mich.; July 9, St. Louis, Mo.; July 10, Kansas City, Kan.; July 12, Tinley Park, Ill.; July 13, East Troy, Wis.; July 14, Columbus, Ohio; July 16-17, Clarkston, Mich.; July 18, Cleveland, Ohio; July 21, Nashville, Tenn.; July 23, Cincinnati, Ohio; July 26, Burgettstown, Penn.; July 27-28, Bristow, Va.; July 30-31, New York City.

(Distributed by New York Times Syndicate) Includes a 200-word sidebar By SHERRY SUIB COHEN c.1996 Family Circle North American rights only. (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  There's something captivating about an opposite. Passion is aroused by a jolt of differences: It's exciting.  The opposite natures of couples can lend a marriage its most exciting challenges _ and balance. The very best marriages thrive on growth and change. But what if your differences become annoyances? Or worse, obstacles to your marriage?  What follows are four combinations of disparate individuals (all names have been changed) who are married to each other. If you find yourself in one or more categories, read on for tips on transforming your differences into strengths. THE INTROVERT &AMP; EXTROVERT: OPPOSITE TYPES  ``Steve was intensely private,'' says Ann from Florida. ``At first, it seemed intriguing and romantic.''  But after six months of marriage, ``the silence got dull. We're so different socially. I love people; his inspiration comes from empty rooms. Are we in trouble?''  ``We're talking about issues of safety here,'' says Rebecca Cutter, a Portland, Ore., psychotherapist and author of ``When Opposites Attract (Plume/Penguin, 1995).  Understanding is the key. The extrovert must recognize why her spouse won't choose to be social (he feels unsafe), and minimize the perceived danger for him. She should never put him in the spotlight without his prior knowledge (surprise parties are a definite no).  When the introvert trusts his mate, Cutter says, he'll risk a little more social activity knowing she won't do anything to hurt him (like desert him in a crowded room).  By the same token, the introvert must maximize the variety in the partners' lives or risk deadening the liveliness of the marriage.  ``Invigorating changes _ more travel, for example _ keep the relationship vital,'' Cutter says.  Another approach comes from Sybil Evans, president of Sybil Evans Associates, a New York organization specializing in conflict resolution.  ``We look for an `integrated solution' that satisfies both,'' Evans says, ``instead of the traditional `compromise' where neither ends up happy.''  For example, a traditional compromise might consist of Steve's reluctantly agreeing to a large party one week if Ann says yes to staying home the next. But rest assured, Evans says, that even though it's a compromise, he'll hate the party, and she'll feel like a prisoner at home. Both may become bitter and blame each other.  But here's the integrated approach: hosting a quiet, two-couple dinner instead of attending a large affair. The intimate party will satisfy Ann's need to interact with others, and it will meet her husband's need to limit socializing to a few people rather than having to painfully cruise a crowd. THE FISHERMAN &AMP; THE READER: OPPOSITE INTERESTS  ``Nancy was a client of mine,'' Evans says. ``At first, the city-lover in her was drawn to the outdoorsy him. But just because the ocean interested him didn't mean she wanted to do battle with 6-foot waves.''  The relationship worked all right initially _ when he went off to do things with worms and sharks, she explored the flea markets or simply stayed home with a novel.  Then Nancy noticed that there was something wrong with her husband's fish stories.  ``He'd come home with these wonderful tales about seeing whales and catching giant tuna,'' she told Evans, ``but I realized, I was just hearing the stories. I wasn't in them.''  At Evans's suggestion, Nancy came up with a plan. She goes on the boat a lot now but never without a book. Nancy enjoys reading during the more mundane parts, but she's also there to marvel when they see a giant turtle.  And when it's her turn to curl up with a book, he practices his fishing knots next to her on the same couch.  Two caveats: Blending interests only works when both partners share in the blending. And although it's great when it happens, partners with opposite interests can't always blend them, Evans warns. THE OPTIMIST &AMP; THE PESSIMIST: OPPOSITE OUTLOOKS  Jane, a Boston lawyer, was enticed, she says, by Randy's ``happy face and sunny outlook.'' And Jane, says Randy, was ``the most interesting, grounded woman'' he ever met.  When they married six years ago, they began to live the way they'd been brought up: Randy, a reporter, focuses not on problems but on finding solutions, and he believes that he and Jane can always turn roadblocks into opportunities. When he lost his job recently, he wasn't crushed _ he was confident that he'd find another.  Jane is steady and intelligent, but worry and distrust are her middle names. She often thinks Randy's being childish. In a shrinking economy she's sure he won't find another job. The two are wearing each other down. Is there any hope?  Cutter offers two coping tricks to help achieve a balance between negativity and positivity: ``When Randy Optimist is having a really difficult time with Janie Pessimist, he might try picturing her when she was 5,'' Cutter suggests.  Seeing your partner as a vulnerable child, Cutter says, helps you understand and respect her way of looking at life. It makes her an endearing _ instead of a cranky _ character.  If two opposite personalities can learn to talk peacefully and try to understand, then sometimes draw from each other's reverse outlook, a remarkable balance certainly can be achieved, Evans says.  Randy and Jane might try working out a ``best-case'' and a ``worst-case'' scenario for any given threat. The idea is to temper his enthusiasm while uplifting her gloominess. Working together, they will see that growth and strength lie in emotional moderation. THE SPENDER &AMP; THE SAVER: OPPOSITE IMPULSES  After 13 years of a difficult marriage, Sara from Colorado is doubtful that either she or Michael have many strengths the other needs _ or wants.  When they met, she was drawn to his financial stability and his quiet reticence. Like a moth to flame, he flew to the way she made him laugh.  Today she wouldn't give 5 cents for his quiet, and he doesn't find her so funny anymore.  Sara is a generous spirit. Her strongest impulse is to spend her money and to share her dreams and thoughts with all her friends, not just Michael.  She has a full-time job, and her checking and savings accounts are in both their names.  Conversely, Michael's deepest impulse is to hoard. His bank account is in his name alone: ``What's mine is mine, what's hers is ours because I earn more'' is the way he looks at finances. He also shares very little emotionally.  It's not too late for this couple to see that they have reconcilable differences, says Dr. Harville Hendrix, co-author of ``The Couples Companion'' (Pocket, 1994). And with work, they can weave gold from chaff.  ``They should recognize that both too much giving and too much hoarding are defenses,'' Hendrix says. ``The generous spirit and the miserly mate must understand each other's motivations.''  Giving, Hendrix says, is, among other things, a subtle attempt to get others to love you. Most ultragenerous spirits are trying very hard to build a wall against loneliness, which would make them too vulnerable. They think if they give things of value away _ and that includes emotions _ people will be devoted to them and that will be a defense against being alone.  The miserly mate is also trying to make something happen: He wants to feel secure, and he fears he hasn't enough resources or emotions to share. If he lets down his guard, tells his secrets or spends his money, he'll be exposed and vulnerable.  What to do? The answer, like most good solutions, is disarmingly simple. Hendrix says that ``each must understand that the other's difference is precisely what's missing in themselves and then try to develop in themselves some of what they most object to in their partners.''  The miser must try to share more and protect less. He might start, Evans says, with joint banking accounts to promote trust in the marriage (both might still keep small separate accounts so each still has autonomy, and neither has to ask ``permission'' to spend money).  The emotional hoarder must also attempt to give his partner more access to his inner world _ even if it doesn't immediately feel safe. When it becomes a habit, it will start to feel safe.  The partner who gives everything away needs to put limits on her largesse, needs to incorporate a bit of her mate's hoarding behavior. She has to understand that keeping some things to herself doesn't diminish but enhances her desirability to others, Hendrix says. -0- SIDEBAR: TURNING YOUR DIFFERENCES INTO STRENGTHS  These conflict-resolution methods will help keep you and your spouse close.  _ Check assumptions before leaping to conclusions. Agree to stop for a moment at an ``outlook impasse'' and entertain the possibility that this time the other's outlook may be right.  For example, she notices her wallet is gone and assumes it's stolen. He says she probably left it at home. Each must listen to each other's reasons for their conclusions _ then figure out together the most logical one.  No sarcasm is allowed.  _ Role play. Every few weeks, agree to creep into each other's skin for a day. He will try not to be Pollyanna, and she will not dwell on wort-case scenarios.  At any given crisis during the day, each must promise to think, ``What would my spouse do?'' Then each will do it in the other's way.  This approach gives spouses permission to step back and take another route other than the programmed one. It works.  _ Get funny. Try to look at your spouse's outlooks in a humorous way and don't take things too seriously. Laughing at yourself is a lovable act, and lovable acts cement relationships.

By CINDY PEARLMAN World rights except Chicago (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  What is it about Will Smith and aliens?  He battles extraterrestrial invaders in his role as a cocky, gifted Marine fighter pilot in ``Independence Day,'' opening July 3.  But while awaiting release of that film, which might be the summer's biggest hit, Smith is in a muggy New York City, on the set of ``Men in Black'' _ and he's chasing aliens again.  ``Men in Black,'' co-starring Tommy Lee Jones, is based on a popular comic book. It casts Smith as a New York City police officer recruited by the Men in Black, an elite force who combat aliens living among us.  ``I must have been crowned the alien man,'' Smith says with a laugh. ``The next thing you'll hear is that I've signed up for `Alien 4' with Sigourney Weaver. The poster will read, `Will Smith IS the Alien.'''  Alien-fighting is a strange business.  ``Tommy Lee Jones is my partner,'' explains Smith over the phone from his trailer on the set. ``This morning, Tommy Lee blew this guy's head off in front of me. I was about to arrest Tommy Lee for murder. All of a sudden his victim's head grew back.  ``It's pretty creepy stuff.''  Filming the $70-million ``Independence Day'' was less bizarre, he says. In fact, it was downright boring.  ``When I would look in the sky, I didn't see the aliens. They were put in later with a computer,'' Smith says. ``So I'd be standing there looking at nothing but clouds and then I would have to freak out.''  Even the air combat scenes were exercises in imagination.  ``There were no other jets or little green guys flying them,'' he says. ``I was just sitting there in this easy chair throwing my body around and yelling, `Explosion!' or `There must be 12,000 aliens in that spaceship!'  ``Anyone could do it at home.''  Given his apparent specialization in alien movies, what does Smith think about real-life ETs?  ``I just think it is arrogant for us to believe we are the only life force (in the universe),'' he answers. ``How can we think we're it?  ``I have to say that my dreams are getting a little weird. I'm getting beamed to a lot of places. Weird little people show up. I think, `Will, you have to get a hobby or something.' I just can't stop thinking about aliens.  ``Everywhere I go, it's the same thing. I'm in a restaurant and the waitress will say, `Will, do you want fries with that and do you believe in aliens?' People seem very excited about it.''  After six years as television's ``Fresh Prince of Bel Air,'' Smith is excited about a movie career that has taken off. Offers are pouring in, including a sequel to ``Bad Boys'' (1995), his hit action film that cracked the $100 million mark.  ``It's funny. This June marks my 10th anniversary in show business,'' the 28-year-old says. ``In many ways it seems like I just started. Then I have days where everything just seems to be happening too quickly.''  Smith was born in Philadelphia, where he grew up with two sisters and a brother. His mother worked with the school board, his father at an ice company.  Despite his raffish charm and quick wit, Smith was not the class clown as a boy, he says.  ``I was a little shy, especially with women. I was interested in computer engineering. Math was my best subject, and I thought I'd have a nice little 9-to-5 job someday.''  It was his hobby that derailed those plans: In his spare time, Smith liked to rap.  ``It was just something to do,'' he recalls. ``I started rapping at age 12, but I never had big plans to cut a record or anything.''  In 1986, Smith and Jeff Townes formed a group, D.J. Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince. During his senior year of high school, a talent scout from Jive records heard their music. One month before high-school graduation, Jive released the duo's first record, ``Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble.''  The group earned a 1988 Grammy Award for best rap performance for ``Parents Just Don't Understand,'' the hit single from their second album, ``He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper.'' They also won a Grammy for the single ``Summertime,'' from their fourth album, ``Homebase,'' which was released in 1991 and went platinum.  When producing legend Quincy Jones heard their music and called Smith to offer him the lead role in ``Fresh Prince of Belair,'' the rapper didn't have to think twice.  ``At the time, I thought, `Why not? I'm just so very good. I'm talented, I should have a TV series.' I'm so cocky!'' he says.  ``After six years on `Fresh Prince,' I'm gonna miss it a little bit,'' Smith admits. ``I do keep in touch with everyone. Our job was to have fun on that set and there are wonderful memories. You just can't spend your life looking back.''  Throughout the run of the series, Smith had used his hiatuses for film roles in such features as ``Where the Day Takes You'' (1992), ``Six Degrees of Separation'' (1993) and ``Made in America'' (1993). Now, with the series having ended, he can be a movie machine if he likes.  ``All these offers roll in,'' he says. ``It's hard to know what to do or who to trust to steer me in the right direction.  ``I trust me. That's the only person you can really trust in this business. People in this business just want to make money off you, and usually it's not in your best interests. I'm excited about a movie career, but cautious too.''  In an effort to revive his musical career, he plans to spend more time in New York, which wasn't possible during the run of ``Fresh Prince.''  ``There is just no creative inspiration in Los Angeles. It pulls my creativity down,'' Smith says. ``There's a huge difference between New York and Los Angeles in the way rap music is performed. In New York, I feel there is more hope in the music and more comedy. That's what I like.''  The end of the series will also give him more time to spend with his son, Willard C. Smith III, nicknamed ``Trey.'' Smith is divorced from his son's mother and is currently dating actress Jada Pinkett, who stars this summer in ``The Nutty Professor.''  Feeling a little played out, Smith says he will take the rest of the summer off after ``Men in Black'' wraps.  ``Jada and I talk about doing something together. We've got to strengthen the relationship first. You must get yourselves together first, before you put a movie in the mix. Otherwise you just get too stressed out.''  Not that Smith isn't enjoying his success.  ``I'm not shy with girls anymore,'' he says. ``Seriously, for the first time in my life, I feel that women like me. There was always the other guy. I was always told, `Will is fun and he makes me laugh.' I was always the best friend and it stunk. Now women like me better.''  And why not? You never know when you may need to chase away some aliens, and Will Smith is a good man to have around for that sort of thing.  But not to hear him tell it. This Independence Day, his plans don't involve any world-saving.  ``I'll be at the barbecue,'' he says. ``I'm the grill man. The only thing I'll be saving is the hamburgers from falling into the flames.'' c.1996 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of the band Hootie and the Blowfish and a sidebar listing the band's July tour dates in the Midwest. By JEANNE WOLF (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  No tuxedos for Hootie and the Blowfish, not even when they appeared on the Grammys or sang for royalty in Monaco.  ``We're just not a tux band,'' lead singer Darius Rucker explains. ``We've borrowed tuxes for some shows because it was a respect thing, but that's not us.''  No problem for this astoundingly successful band. They can wear and sing whatever they want in the wake of their record-setting first album. More than 13 million copies of ``Cracked Rear View'' (1994) were sold, and the record was still on the charts when they went back to the studio to record their much-awaited follow-up album, ``Fairweather Johnson.''  It's no coincidence that this very American group headed off on a European tour shortly after the new album came out in May.  ``We wanted to get away from all the hype and everything,'' Rucker says bluntly, ``'cause, you know, hype sucks.''  The band has encountered plenty of hype _ unsurprisingly so, given that theirs was the second-best-selling debut album in recording history, trailing only Boston's 1976 first effort.  But with the hype came intimidatingly high expectations for their second album, along with fears of the dreaded ``sophomore jinx'' which has made many artists' second albums into disappointments. Many predicted that these South Carolina college buddies, more used to playing minor clubs and small gigs all over the South, would crumble under the pressure.  But Rucker says that when they hit the studio they were fearless.  ``We had a lot of ideas and we weren't worried about it. We were just ready to do another album and we weren't scared at all.''  The group also was ready for flak from critics, who have never really been kind to them.  ``We worried about the critics at first, but not any more,'' Rucker says. ``We figured out that the media didn't sell our record. First it was the music and then it was the radio and then people just seemed to like it.''  ``We had pressure on ourselves, but from a different angle,'' agrees bassist Dean Felber. ``We're a live band and we wanted to tour, and in order to do that we needed new songs. And we were kind of worn out on the old stuff.  ``All of the pressure we put on ourselves is easier pressure to handle than when it's outside sources pushing you in a certain direction. We got to pick our own course.''  Felber says the group was braced for inevitable, probably unfavorable comparisons to its first album.  ``You can't expect something like that twice,'' he says. ``We didn't expect it the first time, you know _ it was kind of a gift. It was timing or whatever.''  He shrugs.  ``To create that twice in a row ... I don't know if that could be done.''  Guitarist Mark Bryan says that they were eager to try some new ideas.  ``I'm proud that we're still growing. I'm proud of our songwriting abilities, which are maturing,'' he says. ``I enjoy the songs from `Fairweather Johnson' the way I enjoyed the songs from `Cracked Rear View' when we first wrote them.  ``Most of all, I enjoy everyone getting together and playing. We can still have fun together and also make our music better.''  ``Fairweather Johnson'' has been in the top five since its debut. Now, as the group hits the road, Bryan looks forward to the chance to bring the new songs to live audiences.  ``We are trying as hard as we can to be anti-hype,'' he says. ``It's much more fun to just worry about your music and just play and not read about yourself every day.''  All the band members stress the group's commitment to live performances and present themselves as anti-stars _ working-guy musicians devoid of star glitter.  ``A six-week European tour, and two nights before I'm like, `OK, I gotta pack,''' Felber says. He claims that his secret to traveling comfort is to bring only two weeks' worth of clothing and do laundry every two weeks.  Bryan tries to see as much as he can in each new city they visit. He also calls home every day.  ``I try to talk to my wife every night,'' he says. ``It's important to keep yourself involved in your life back home.''  Drummer Jim ``Soni'' Sonefeld sums up his slant on the European experience:  ``It's pretty here but I can't afford a hamburger _ $38 for a burger! That's wild!''  ``We are not used to these four-star hotels,'' Felber says with a smile. ``You gotta understand, the nicest place in town in a lot of the cities we play is just an ordinary motel. I keep kidding that we don't really belong in this kind of luxury.''  And how do these hot young rockers spent their time on the road? Do they trash hotel rooms, party into the night or cruise the night scene?  No, because it might interfere with their real passion: This may be the world's only rock band which also makes up a foursome for golf.  ``Everyone asks us if success spoiled us,'' Sonefeld says. ``About golf, I can say yes! We get to play some of the nicest courses in the country and sometimes in the world.  ``We know there are people that are much more deserving who would die to play on these courses and they can't. We've been playing them for free, and we stink. We've been spoiled in that world.''  Another unusual aspect of this band is that, at least from an outsider's perspective, they reveal few signs of artistic or personal conflicts. To all appearances, all four Blowfish get along amazingly well, exchanging good-natured barbs and clearly enjoying what they do. Their only real conflicts arise from business discussions:  ``The biggest chafe these days is just trying to separate business from our music, 'cause business has become a big part of it,'' Sonefeld says. ``There's a lot of responsibility that comes with success and you've got to sit there and sort it out.  ``Though counting money isn't the biggest problem in the world to have, it can chafe people the wrong way when you're tired and you've just finished a big concert and the last thing you want to discuss is payroll taxes and investments.  ``We are all truly grateful, but we're in this for the music,'' he continues. ``And when you have to get into all these business details it can be a bit of a pain in the (butt), and tempers run a little short.''  He grins.  ``It's not a joking matter, (but) we're such lighthearted people and we still want to joke sometimes. I admit I'm the worst at it.''  Onstage, though, any lingering annoyance disappears, Sonefeld says.  ``It's not about money. It's not about anything in the world other than playing the music. That's the reason we all got together in the first place. It's what brings you back to the first time you ever had a gig together, you know. You've got your instrument, you've got your microphone and the crowd gets going. It's great!''  So great, in fact, that the musicians occasionally can't believe it, Rucker says. They are a long way from taking it for granted.  ``We were sitting around last night just having a beer,'' Rucker says, ``and thinking, `This is all part of the fantasy.'  ``And it's like I never want to wake up. Because I swear this is a dream, and one day my alarm's gonna go off and I'm going to be waking up in Charleston, S.C. and heading to the Music Forum to play a show.'' c.1996 Pentacom Productions  (Jeanne Wolf, who is based in Hollywood, reports on the entertainment industry for television, radio and print outlets.)  -0- SIDEBAR: HOOTIE AND THE BLOWFISH ON TOUR  This summer's tour will bring Hootie and the Blowfish to sites throughout the United States, including the following July dates: July 7, Mears, Mich.; July 8, Nobelsville, Mich.; July 9, St. Louis, Mo.; July 10, Kansas City, Kan.; July 12, Tinley Park, Ill.; July 13, East Troy, Wis.; July 14, Columbus, Ohio; July 16-17, Clarkston, Mich.; July 18, Cleveland, Ohio; July 21, Nashville, Tenn.; July 23, Cincinnati, Ohio; July 26, Burgettstown, Penn.; July 27-28, Bristow, Va.; July 30-31, New York City.

(Distributed by New York Times Syndicate) Includes a 200-word sidebar By SHERRY SUIB COHEN c.1996 Family Circle North American rights only. (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  There's something captivating about an opposite. Passion is aroused by a jolt of differences: It's exciting.  The opposite natures of couples can lend a marriage its most exciting challenges _ and balance. The very best marriages thrive on growth and change. But what if your differences become annoyances? Or worse, obstacles to your marriage?  What follows are four combinations of disparate individuals (all names have been changed) who are married to each other. If you find yourself in one or more categories, read on for tips on transforming your differences into strengths. THE INTROVERT &AMP; EXTROVERT: OPPOSITE TYPES  ``Steve was intensely private,'' says Ann from Florida. ``At first, it seemed intriguing and romantic.''  But after six months of marriage, ``the silence got dull. We're so different socially. I love people; his inspiration comes from empty rooms. Are we in trouble?''  ``We're talking about issues of safety here,'' says Rebecca Cutter, a Portland, Ore., psychotherapist and author of ``When Opposites Attract (Plume/Penguin, 1995).  Understanding is the key. The extrovert must recognize why her spouse won't choose to be social (he feels unsafe), and minimize the perceived danger for him. She should never put him in the spotlight without his prior knowledge (surprise parties are a definite no).  When the introvert trusts his mate, Cutter says, he'll risk a little more social activity knowing she won't do anything to hurt him (like desert him in a crowded room).  By the same token, the introvert must maximize the variety in the partners' lives or risk deadening the liveliness of the marriage.  ``Invigorating changes _ more travel, for example _ keep the relationship vital,'' Cutter says.  Another approach comes from Sybil Evans, president of Sybil Evans Associates, a New York organization specializing in conflict resolution.  ``We look for an `integrated solution' that satisfies both,'' Evans says, ``instead of the traditional `compromise' where neither ends up happy.''  For example, a traditional compromise might consist of Steve's reluctantly agreeing to a large party one week if Ann says yes to staying home the next. But rest assured, Evans says, that even though it's a compromise, he'll hate the party, and she'll feel like a prisoner at home. Both may become bitter and blame each other.  But here's the integrated approach: hosting a quiet, two-couple dinner instead of attending a large affair. The intimate party will satisfy Ann's need to interact with others, and it will meet her husband's need to limit socializing to a few people rather than having to painfully cruise a crowd. THE FISHERMAN &AMP; THE READER: OPPOSITE INTERESTS  ``Nancy was a client of mine,'' Evans says. ``At first, the city-lover in her was drawn to the outdoorsy him. But just because the ocean interested him didn't mean she wanted to do battle with 6-foot waves.''  The relationship worked all right initially _ when he went off to do things with worms and sharks, she explored the flea markets or simply stayed home with a novel.  Then Nancy noticed that there was something wrong with her husband's fish stories.  ``He'd come home with these wonderful tales about seeing whales and catching giant tuna,'' she told Evans, ``but I realized, I was just hearing the stories. I wasn't in them.''  At Evans's suggestion, Nancy came up with a plan. She goes on the boat a lot now but never without a book. Nancy enjoys reading during the more mundane parts, but she's also there to marvel when they see a giant turtle.  And when it's her turn to curl up with a book, he practices his fishing knots next to her on the same couch.  Two caveats: Blending interests only works when both partners share in the blending. And although it's great when it happens, partners with opposite interests can't always blend them, Evans warns. THE OPTIMIST &AMP; THE PESSIMIST: OPPOSITE OUTLOOKS  Jane, a Boston lawyer, was enticed, she says, by Randy's ``happy face and sunny outlook.'' And Jane, says Randy, was ``the most interesting, grounded woman'' he ever met.  When they married six years ago, they began to live the way they'd been brought up: Randy, a reporter, focuses not on problems but on finding solutions, and he believes that he and Jane can always turn roadblocks into opportunities. When he lost his job recently, he wasn't crushed _ he was confident that he'd find another.  Jane is steady and intelligent, but worry and distrust are her middle names. She often thinks Randy's being childish. In a shrinking economy she's sure he won't find another job. The two are wearing each other down. Is there any hope?  Cutter offers two coping tricks to help achieve a balance between negativity and positivity: ``When Randy Optimist is having a really difficult time with Janie Pessimist, he might try picturing her when she was 5,'' Cutter suggests.  Seeing your partner as a vulnerable child, Cutter says, helps you understand and respect her way of looking at life. It makes her an endearing _ instead of a cranky _ character.  If two opposite personalities can learn to talk peacefully and try to understand, then sometimes draw from each other's reverse outlook, a remarkable balance certainly can be achieved, Evans says.  Randy and Jane might try working out a ``best-case'' and a ``worst-case'' scenario for any given threat. The idea is to temper his enthusiasm while uplifting her gloominess. Working together, they will see that growth and strength lie in emotional moderation. THE SPENDER &AMP; THE SAVER: OPPOSITE IMPULSES  After 13 years of a difficult marriage, Sara from Colorado is doubtful that either she or Michael have many strengths the other needs _ or wants.  When they met, she was drawn to his financial stability and his quiet reticence. Like a moth to flame, he flew to the way she made him laugh.  Today she wouldn't give 5 cents for his quiet, and he doesn't find her so funny anymore.  Sara is a generous spirit. Her strongest impulse is to spend her money and to share her dreams and thoughts with all her friends, not just Michael.  She has a full-time job, and her checking and savings accounts are in both their names.  Conversely, Michael's deepest impulse is to hoard. His bank account is in his name alone: ``What's mine is mine, what's hers is ours because I earn more'' is the way he looks at finances. He also shares very little emotionally.  It's not too late for this couple to see that they have reconcilable differences, says Dr. Harville Hendrix, co-author of ``The Couples Companion'' (Pocket, 1994). And with work, they can weave gold from chaff.  ``They should recognize that both too much giving and too much hoarding are defenses,'' Hendrix says. ``The generous spirit and the miserly mate must understand each other's motivations.''  Giving, Hendrix says, is, among other things, a subtle attempt to get others to love you. Most ultragenerous spirits are trying very hard to build a wall against loneliness, which would make them too vulnerable. They think if they give things of value away _ and that includes emotions _ people will be devoted to them and that will be a defense against being alone.  The miserly mate is also trying to make something happen: He wants to feel secure, and he fears he hasn't enough resources or emotions to share. If he lets down his guard, tells his secrets or spends his money, he'll be exposed and vulnerable.  What to do? The answer, like most good solutions, is disarmingly simple. Hendrix says that ``each must understand that the other's difference is precisely what's missing in themselves and then try to develop in themselves some of what they most object to in their partners.''  The miser must try to share more and protect less. He might start, Evans says, with joint banking accounts to promote trust in the marriage (both might still keep small separate accounts so each still has autonomy, and neither has to ask ``permission'' to spend money).  The emotional hoarder must also attempt to give his partner more access to his inner world _ even if it doesn't immediately feel safe. When it becomes a habit, it will start to feel safe.  The partner who gives everything away needs to put limits on her largesse, needs to incorporate a bit of her mate's hoarding behavior. She has to understand that keeping some things to herself doesn't diminish but enhances her desirability to others, Hendrix says. -0- SIDEBAR: TURNING YOUR DIFFERENCES INTO STRENGTHS  These conflict-resolution methods will help keep you and your spouse close.  _ Check assumptions before leaping to conclusions. Agree to stop for a moment at an ``outlook impasse'' and entertain the possibility that this time the other's outlook may be right.  For example, she notices her wallet is gone and assumes it's stolen. He says she probably left it at home. Each must listen to each other's reasons for their conclusions _ then figure out together the most logical one.  No sarcasm is allowed.  _ Role play. Every few weeks, agree to creep into each other's skin for a day. He will try not to be Pollyanna, and she will not dwell on wort-case scenarios.  At any given crisis during the day, each must promise to think, ``What would my spouse do?'' Then each will do it in the other's way.  This approach gives spouses permission to step back and take another route other than the programmed one. It works.  _ Get funny. Try to look at your spouse's outlooks in a humorous way and don't take things too seriously. Laughing at yourself is a lovable act, and lovable acts cement relationships.

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Will Smith in a scene from ``Independence Day.'' By CINDY PEARLMAN World rights except Chicago (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  What is it about Will Smith and aliens?  He battles extraterrestrial invaders in his role as a cocky, gifted Marine fighter pilot in ``Independence Day,'' opening July 3.  But while awaiting release of that film, which might be the summer's biggest hit, Smith is in a muggy New York City, on the set of ``Men in Black'' _ and he's chasing aliens again.  ``Men in Black,'' co-starring Tommy Lee Jones, is based on a popular comic book. It casts Smith as a New York City police officer recruited by the Men in Black, an elite force who combat aliens living among us.  ``I must have been crowned the alien man,'' Smith says with a laugh. ``The next thing you'll hear is that I've signed up for `Alien 4' with Sigourney Weaver. The poster will read, `Will Smith IS the Alien.'''  Alien-fighting is a strange business.  ``Tommy Lee Jones is my partner,'' explains Smith over the phone from his trailer on the set. ``This morning, Tommy Lee blew this guy's head off in front of me. I was about to arrest Tommy Lee for murder. All of a sudden his victim's head grew back.  ``It's pretty creepy stuff.''  Filming the $70-million ``Independence Day'' was less bizarre, he says. In fact, it was downright boring.  ``When I would look in the sky, I didn't see the aliens. They were put in later with a computer,'' Smith says. ``So I'd be standing there looking at nothing but clouds and then I would have to freak out.''  Even the air combat scenes were exercises in imagination.  ``There were no other jets or little green guys flying them,'' he says. ``I was just sitting there in this easy chair throwing my body around and yelling, `Explosion!' or `There must be 12,000 aliens in that spaceship!'  ``Anyone could do it at home.''  Given his apparent specialization in alien movies, what does Smith think about real-life ETs?  ``I just think it is arrogant for us to believe we are the only life force (in the universe),'' he answers. ``How can we think we're it?  ``I have to say that my dreams are getting a little weird. I'm getting beamed to a lot of places. Weird little people show up. I think, `Will, you have to get a hobby or something.' I just can't stop thinking about aliens.  ``Everywhere I go, it's the same thing. I'm in a restaurant and the waitress will say, `Will, do you want fries with that and do you believe in aliens?' People seem very excited about it.''  After six years as television's ``Fresh Prince of Bel Air,'' Smith is excited about a movie career that has taken off. Offers are pouring in, including a sequel to ``Bad Boys'' (1995), his hit action film that cracked the $100 million mark.  ``It's funny. This June marks my 10th anniversary in show business,'' the 28-year-old says. ``In many ways it seems like I just started. Then I have days where everything just seems to be happening too quickly.''  Smith was born in Philadelphia, where he grew up with two sisters and a brother. His mother worked with the school board, his father at an ice company.  Despite his raffish charm and quick wit, Smith was not the class clown as a boy, he says.  ``I was a little shy, especially with women. I was interested in computer engineering. Math was my best subject, and I thought I'd have a nice little 9-to-5 job someday.''  It was his hobby that derailed those plans: In his spare time, Smith liked to rap.  ``It was just something to do,'' he recalls. ``I started rapping at age 12, but I never had big plans to cut a record or anything.''  In 1986, Smith and Jeff Townes formed a group, D.J. Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince. During his senior year of high school, a talent scout from Jive records heard their music. One month before high-school graduation, Jive released the duo's first record, ``Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble.''  The group earned a 1988 Grammy Award for best rap performance for ``Parents Just Don't Understand,'' the hit single from their second album, ``He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper.'' They also won a Grammy for the single ``Summertime,'' from their fourth album, ``Homebase,'' which was released in 1991 and went platinum.  When producing legend Quincy Jones heard their music and called Smith to offer him the lead role in ``Fresh Prince of Belair,'' the rapper didn't have to think twice.  ``At the time, I thought, `Why not? I'm just so very good. I'm talented, I should have a TV series.' I'm so cocky!'' he says.  ``After six years on `Fresh Prince,' I'm gonna miss it a little bit,'' Smith admits. ``I do keep in touch with everyone. Our job was to have fun on that set and there are wonderful memories. You just can't spend your life looking back.''  Throughout the run of the series, Smith had used his hiatuses for film roles in such features as ``Where the Day Takes You'' (1992), ``Six Degrees of Separation'' (1993) and ``Made in America'' (1993). Now, with the series having ended, he can be a movie machine if he likes.  ``All these offers roll in,'' he says. ``It's hard to know what to do or who to trust to steer me in the right direction.  ``I trust me. That's the only person you can really trust in this business. People in this business just want to make money off you, and usually it's not in your best interests. I'm excited about a movie career, but cautious too.''  In an effort to revive his musical career, he plans to spend more time in New York, which wasn't possible during the run of ``Fresh Prince.''  ``There is just no creative inspiration in Los Angeles. It pulls my creativity down,'' Smith says. ``There's a huge difference between New York and Los Angeles in the way rap music is performed. In New York, I feel there is more hope in the music and more comedy. That's what I like.''  The end of the series will also give him more time to spend with his son, Willard C. Smith III, nicknamed ``Trey.'' Smith is divorced from his son's mother and is currently dating actress Jada Pinkett, who stars this summer in ``The Nutty Professor.''  Feeling a little played out, Smith says he will take the rest of the summer off after ``Men in Black'' wraps.  ``Jada and I talk about doing something together. We've got to strengthen the relationship first. You must get yourselves together first, before you put a movie in the mix. Otherwise you just get too stressed out.''  Not that Smith isn't enjoying his success.  ``I'm not shy with girls anymore,'' he says. ``Seriously, for the first time in my life, I feel that women like me. There was always the other guy. I was always told, `Will is fun and he makes me laugh.' I was always the best friend and it stunk. Now women like me better.''  And why not? You never know when you may need to chase away some aliens, and Will Smith is a good man to have around for that sort of thing.  But not to hear him tell it. This Independence Day, his plans don't involve any world-saving.  ``I'll be at the barbecue,'' he says. ``I'm the grill man. The only thing I'll be saving is the hamburgers from falling into the flames.'' c.1996 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of the band Hootie and the Blowfish and a sidebar listing the band's July tour dates in the Midwest. By JEANNE WOLF (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  No tuxedos for Hootie and the Blowfish, not even when they appeared on the Grammys or sang for royalty in Monaco.  ``We're just not a tux band,'' lead singer Darius Rucker explains. ``We've borrowed tuxes for some shows because it was a respect thing, but that's not us.''  No problem for this astoundingly successful band. They can wear and sing whatever they want in the wake of their record-setting first album. More than 13 million copies of ``Cracked Rear View'' (1994) were sold, and the record was still on the charts when they went back to the studio to record their much-awaited follow-up album, ``Fairweather Johnson.''  It's no coincidence that this very American group headed off on a European tour shortly after the new album came out in May.  ``We wanted to get away from all the hype and everything,'' Rucker says bluntly, ``'cause, you know, hype sucks.''  The band has encountered plenty of hype _ unsurprisingly so, given that theirs was the second-best-selling debut album in recording history, trailing only Boston's 1976 first effort.  But with the hype came intimidatingly high expectations for their second album, along with fears of the dreaded ``sophomore jinx'' which has made many artists' second albums into disappointments. Many predicted that these South Carolina college buddies, more used to playing minor clubs and small gigs all over the South, would crumble under the pressure.  But Rucker says that when they hit the studio they were fearless.  ``We had a lot of ideas and we weren't worried about it. We were just ready to do another album and we weren't scared at all.''  The group also was ready for flak from critics, who have never really been kind to them.  ``We worried about the critics at first, but not any more,'' Rucker says. ``We figured out that the media didn't sell our record. First it was the music and then it was the radio and then people just seemed to like it.''  ``We had pressure on ourselves, but from a different angle,'' agrees bassist Dean Felber. ``We're a live band and we wanted to tour, and in order to do that we needed new songs. And we were kind of worn out on the old stuff.  ``All of the pressure we put on ourselves is easier pressure to handle than when it's outside sources pushing you in a certain direction. We got to pick our own course.''  Felber says the group was braced for inevitable, probably unfavorable comparisons to its first album.  ``You can't expect something like that twice,'' he says. ``We didn't expect it the first time, you know _ it was kind of a gift. It was timing or whatever.''  He shrugs.  ``To create that twice in a row ... I don't know if that could be done.''  Guitarist Mark Bryan says that they were eager to try some new ideas.  ``I'm proud that we're still growing. I'm proud of our songwriting abilities, which are maturing,'' he says. ``I enjoy the songs from `Fairweather Johnson' the way I enjoyed the songs from `Cracked Rear View' when we first wrote them.  ``Most of all, I enjoy everyone getting together and playing. We can still have fun together and also make our music better.''  ``Fairweather Johnson'' has been in the top five since its debut. Now, as the group hits the road, Bryan looks forward to the chance to bring the new songs to live audiences.  ``We are trying as hard as we can to be anti-hype,'' he says. ``It's much more fun to just worry about your music and just play and not read about yourself every day.''  All the band members stress the group's commitment to live performances and present themselves as anti-stars _ working-guy musicians devoid of star glitter.  ``A six-week European tour, and two nights before I'm like, `OK, I gotta pack,''' Felber says. He claims that his secret to traveling comfort is to bring only two weeks' worth of clothing and do laundry every two weeks.  Bryan tries to see as much as he can in each new city they visit. He also calls home every day.  ``I try to talk to my wife every night,'' he says. ``It's important to keep yourself involved in your life back home.''  Drummer Jim ``Soni'' Sonefeld sums up his slant on the European experience:  ``It's pretty here but I can't afford a hamburger _ $38 for a burger! That's wild!''  ``We are not used to these four-star hotels,'' Felber says with a smile. ``You gotta understand, the nicest place in town in a lot of the cities we play is just an ordinary motel. I keep kidding that we don't really belong in this kind of luxury.''  And how do these hot young rockers spent their time on the road? Do they trash hotel rooms, party into the night or cruise the night scene?  No, because it might interfere with their real passion: This may be the world's only rock band which also makes up a foursome for golf.  ``Everyone asks us if success spoiled us,'' Sonefeld says. ``About golf, I can say yes! We get to play some of the nicest courses in the country and sometimes in the world.  ``We know there are people that are much more deserving who would die to play on these courses and they can't. We've been playing them for free, and we stink. We've been spoiled in that world.''  Another unusual aspect of this band is that, at least from an outsider's perspective, they reveal few signs of artistic or personal conflicts. To all appearances, all four Blowfish get along amazingly well, exchanging good-natured barbs and clearly enjoying what they do. Their only real conflicts arise from business discussions:  ``The biggest chafe these days is just trying to separate business from our music, 'cause business has become a big part of it,'' Sonefeld says. ``There's a lot of responsibility that comes with success and you've got to sit there and sort it out.  ``Though counting money isn't the biggest problem in the world to have, it can chafe people the wrong way when you're tired and you've just finished a big concert and the last thing you want to discuss is payroll taxes and investments.  ``We are all truly grateful, but we're in this for the music,'' he continues. ``And when you have to get into all these business details it can be a bit of a pain in the (butt), and tempers run a little short.''  He grins.  ``It's not a joking matter, (but) we're such lighthearted people and we still want to joke sometimes. I admit I'm the worst at it.''  Onstage, though, any lingering annoyance disappears, Sonefeld says.  ``It's not about money. It's not about anything in the world other than playing the music. That's the reason we all got together in the first place. It's what brings you back to the first time you ever had a gig together, you know. You've got your instrument, you've got your microphone and the crowd gets going. It's great!''  So great, in fact, that the musicians occasionally can't believe it, Rucker says. They are a long way from taking it for granted.  ``We were sitting around last night just having a beer,'' Rucker says, ``and thinking, `This is all part of the fantasy.'  ``And it's like I never want to wake up. Because I swear this is a dream, and one day my alarm's gonna go off and I'm going to be waking up in Charleston, S.C. and heading to the Music Forum to play a show.'' c.1996 Pentacom Productions  (Jeanne Wolf, who is based in Hollywood, reports on the entertainment industry for television, radio and print outlets.)  -0- SIDEBAR: HOOTIE AND THE BLOWFISH ON TOUR  This summer's tour will bring Hootie and the Blowfish to sites throughout the United States, including the following July dates: July 7, Mears, Mich.; July 8, Nobelsville, Mich.; July 9, St. Louis, Mo.; July 10, Kansas City, Kan.; July 12, Tinley Park, Ill.; July 13, East Troy, Wis.; July 14, Columbus, Ohio; July 16-17, Clarkston, Mich.; July 18, Cleveland, Ohio; July 21, Nashville, Tenn.; July 23, Cincinnati, Ohio; July 26, Burgettstown, Penn.; July 27-28, Bristow, Va.; July 30-31, New York City.

FROST-HOUSE  WASHINGTON _ A smiling President Clinton looked over the audience at a New York fund-raiser early this year and joked about the dogged determination Rep. Martin Frost brought to his job as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ``When Martin Frost was up here announcing that this was the most successful event by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ever held outside Washington, I thought, `My God, even people in New York can't tell him no. Anything to get him off the phone,''' Clinton quipped. While Clinton got a few laughs from campaign contributors dining at the posh St. Regis Hotel, he also acknowledged that the work of the Dallas lawmaker since December 1994 to reclaim Congress for the Democrats has been no joke.

OSTRICHES-COMEBACK  MANSFIELD, Texas _ Ostrich, once the prey of fly-by-night investment schemes, is finally gaining the attention of slaughterhouses and white tablecloth restaurants. Prices for the flightless fowl plummeted as much as 90 percent nearly two years ago as a speculative ``breeders'' market fizzled.

ONE TON-RECORD COMPANY  DALLAS _ Take a look around the downtown Dallas office of One Ton Records and you'll see a ton of things: posters and fliers hyping North Texas bands such as the Toadies, Brutal Juice, Caulk and Baboon; a rehearsal area where various local bands jam; an office zone where TVs flicker and computers chirp; and a comfy living space where a quintet of cats wanders around, meowing and looking for affection. Hovering above it all is 26-year-old Aden Holt, who, one second, is helping his girlfriend, Lara Decker, answer the phone that never seems to stop ringing, and the next is fooling with his computer, and the next is finishing an upcoming concert flier. For the past two years, this has pretty much been Holt's daily routine.

"77657"	"he"	"thought"	" Now, he thought, at the age of 61, it was his turn. He knew enough about melanoma to know how deadly it was, that it was not usually susceptible to radiation or chemotherapy. Without waiting for a definitive diagnosis, he figured he had only a few more months, maybe only a few weeks, to live. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"
"77678"	"I"	"thought"	" ``You know, I didn't sit and think, `Oh, that's interesting _ a three-inch body of water goes to a stream, then to a river, then to an ocean.' Afterward, I thought, water is the symbol of the unconscious and a feminine symbol. Maybe that's why I did it, but I never would have thought of it intellectually. It just seemed visually and sensually correct. That's the level I want to operate on. That's why I hate interviews. Because I have to define what it is I did out of feeling. Basically, I do things because they feel right, and that's the truth of it. I go by my feelings. I always trusted my instincts, and when I haven't, I've been screwed.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"

"78186"	"I"	"thought"	" ``From the first moment I learned this, I thought, `Oh my God, I'm going to die.' I went from being at the top of my game, fourth in World Cup races in Leeds and Zurich, to being told I had cancer. Eventually you get over that.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"
"78473"	"he"	"thought"	" As for parachutes, Cooper got four, which made everybody wonder.

"78761"	"I"	"thought"	" ``When I was in high school, I would put acting on the back burner. My soccer game was more important. Once I got a taste of Hollywood, I thought, `Whoa.

"79421"	"I"	"thought"	" Like this one about ear hair: ``I found out about ear hair a couple years ago when I went to the Sharper Image to buy clippers for my nose hair. There I was, talking to the guy about different nose hair trimmers. He looked at me with a zealous pitchman's smile and said, `This will trim nose and ear hair.'

"79896"	"I"	"thought"	" McGrady, the soft-spoken phenom who arrived here from backwoods Auburndale, Fla., as the sleeper of the decade, said: ``When Coach rattled off the rules, I thought, `That's not me.' I really had my doubts because the Christian part was so different. But I needed the discipline and the academics. It's been easy to adjust and it's great to have the Lord in my life.'' As for basketball? ``I knew I was a great player but I never knew how to work hard until I came here,'' McGrady said. ``I was always out of shape back home.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"
"79993"	"I"	"thought"	" ``When I saw it, I went crazy for it,'' Scott Rudin, producer of ``The Addams Family'' and ``The First Wives Club,'' said of the stage version of McPherson's ``Marvin's Room.'' ``But when I heard that somebody had bought it, I thought, `This is a ridiculous idea.'

"80014"	"I"	"thought"	" Ms. Pfeiffer was the first person to get involved with the project. ``She's so glamorous and so beautiful, I thought, `Why would she want to be in a movie where she has to wear a housedress?' '' says Ms. Smiley. The film makers were concerned that audiences wouldn't accept Ms. Pfeiffer and Ms. Lange as gritty, rural wives.

"80454"	"I"	"thought"	" ``When I saw his arm cock, I thought, `Oh, no,''' said Mackovic, who had envisioned Brown scrambling around left end for a first down.

"80502"	"we"	"thought"	" In those days, pasta, then always called spaghetti, was considered bad for you, and steak, roast beef or ground round were nightly fare if you could afford them; their vitamins promised to make you strong. So, we thought, would milk and eggs, hence the respect for cheese souffles, ``prima donnas'' of the kitchen, according to Julia. She insisted her technique would produce a ``noncollapsible'' variety.

Johnny: `Since my wife found some in my glove compartment last year.'  _ Monica Mendoza  QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S `THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO'  The following are quotes from Jay Leno's monologue for the week of December 23, 1996:  ``Here we are day after Christmas. How many men still have some shopping left to do?''  ``Here's another question for you. You know that Tickle Me Elmo doll you bought for Christmas? Still think it's worth $1200 now?''  ``Yesterday on the news they showed footage of President Clinton shopping at a jewelry store in Washington. I understand he bought some really expensive gifts for his loved ones. Those Indonesian businessmen, they are tough to shop for.''  ``The President's staff got him an exercise bike for Christmas. They said in the paper today the bike was specially designed for President Clinton. That means it only backpedals.''  ``Yesterday a group of men in Washington, D.C., re-enacted George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River. Back then it was freezing cold, of course there was no food, and they didn't know if they'd make it alive. So in a sense, this was the very first Carnival Cruise.''  ``Unbelievable bad weather all across the country. Snow was so deep in Michigan this week Dr. Kevorkian had to revive a couple of dead passengers to help push his suicide van out of the snow.''  ``Here's a shocker. The head coach of the New York Jets resigned today. What a surprise!''  ``According to a new sports survey, the most-used name for college football teams is `Tigers.' Anybody know the least-used name for college football? `Graduates.'''  ``This week TV executives gave final approval to a ratings system that rates programs for sexual content and violence. The shows are gonna be rated with a little symbol in the corner of the screen within 15 seconds after the show begins. Fifteen seconds?

TRANSSEXUAL SUBTERFUGE  A guy walks into the lounge at work the day after Christmas and his coworkers ask: `Hey Johnny, what'd your wife get ya for Christmas?'  Johnny: `Women's underwear'  Coworkers: `Since when do you wear women's underwear?'  Johnny: `Since my wife found some in my glove compartment last year.'  _ Monica Mendoza  QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S `THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO'  The following are quotes from Jay Leno's monologue for the week of December 23, 1996:  ``Here we are day after Christmas. How many men still have some shopping left to do?''  ``Here's another question for you. You know that Tickle Me Elmo doll you bought for Christmas? Still think it's worth $1200 now?''  ``Yesterday on the news they showed footage of President Clinton shopping at a jewelry store in Washington. I understand he bought some really expensive gifts for his loved ones. Those Indonesian businessmen, they are tough to shop for.''  ``The President's staff got him an exercise bike for Christmas. They said in the paper today the bike was specially designed for President Clinton. That means it only backpedals.''  ``Yesterday a group of men in Washington, D.C., re-enacted George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River. Back then it was freezing cold, of course there was no food, and they didn't know if they'd make it alive. So in a sense, this was the very first Carnival Cruise.''  ``Unbelievable bad weather all across the country. Snow was so deep in Michigan this week Dr. Kevorkian had to revive a couple of dead passengers to help push his suicide van out of the snow.''  ``Here's a shocker. The head coach of the New York Jets resigned today. What a surprise!''  ``According to a new sports survey, the most-used name for college football teams is `Tigers.' Anybody know the least-used name for college football? `Graduates.'''  ``This week TV executives gave final approval to a ratings system that rates programs for sexual content and violence. The shows are gonna be rated with a little symbol in the corner of the screen within 15 seconds after the show begins. Fifteen seconds? By that time every character on `Melrose Place' has slept with every other character.''  ``Do you know what Michael Jackson calls the Tickle Me Elmo doll? Bait!''  ``RuPaul told Interview magazine it takes him an hour and a half to turn himself into a woman. So guys, next time you ask a woman out and she says, `Oh it's gonna take me about an hour and a half to get ready,' you could be in for a big surprise.''  OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN''  ON THE CBS TELEVISION NETWORK  (Monday, Dec. 23-Friday, Dec. 27)  ``I have an announcement from the New York City Department of Sanitation. If you want your Christmas tree picked up, here's what you do. Take all of the ornaments, take all of the festive trimming, all of the garlands, all of the tinsel, all of the multicolored lights --take all of that stuff off the Christmas tree. Then you take it outside onto the curb and you place it right next to last year's Christmas tree.''  ``Big Christmas down in Washington, D.C. I don't know what's going on, but President Clinton buys Hillary for Christmas a book about baseball. Isn't that odd? And here's the strange part about it -- for Joe Torre, he bought a black lace teddy.''  ``Mayor Giuliani is very excited about something because...New York City has a chance at finishing 1996 with fewer than a thousand homicides. Ladies and gentlemen, here's my promise to you: if, at 11:30 New Year's Eve, we have 999, I will personally go down to Times Square and whack Dick Clark.''  ``Ladies and gentlemen, here's good news for frequent flyers. United Airlines, for the second year in a row, was voted Best Airline Food.' That's right, Best Airline Food.' And, I thought, man, what a wonderful honor! That's like being named M.V.P. on the Jets.''  ``Let me remind you of one thing, especially here in New York City. If you have clothing you're not going to use, if you have canned goods you're not going to use, make sure that those go to somebody less fortunate than you are and, especially here in New York City, specify either Rich Kotite of the Jets or Dan Reeves of the Giants before you send it out.''  ``The Jets , God bless em, finished their 1996 season -- let me see if I have the record right here --the Jets finished their season 1-and-15. And, you know, Friday before the last game of the season, their coach Rich Kotite called a press conference and he announced to the assembled New York media, he said, I have not been fired. I am not quitting. I am stepping down.' Hard to believe this guy had difficulty communicating with his players, isn't it?''  ``The big story coming out of Los Angeles -- you probably read about this last week -- a supermarket cashier now claims to be pregnant with Christopher Darden's child. Isn't that amazing! Well, Chris, if you're watching, pal, maybe you should have spent a little more time trying to nail O.J.''  GOOD DAY, WIRE WANDERERS!!!!!  Offer not available in any store!

"86107"	"he"	"thought"	" It wasn't until May 1996 in a hotel lobby in Crystal City, Va., that Mosley handed Coates the manuscript. Upon receiving it, Coates cried. All of his efforts _ he started his company with $300 borrowed from two friends _ were paying off, he thought, as he and Mosley discussed the million-dollar deal. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"86377"	"I"	"thought"	" ``Richie Muneyhun was even larger than I could have imagined, biblically large,'' Lafayette, who is called Laf, says about meeting his girlfriend's sister's fiance, who has just been released from prison. ``He was Hoover Dam, a bull mastodon, an armoire, a sequoia, a John Deere harvester, Polyphemus in a sleeveless denim jacket.'' Laf asks him how it feels to be a free man. ``He said, Are any of us free? Uh-oh, I thought, determinism, Divine foreknowledge, the constraints of Fate. Richie's been reading Aquinas and Descartes in his cell.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"

"87234"	"I"	"thought"	" ``I was raised in convent schools and being nice was part of that upbringing. Mme. de Merteuil was the personification of everything I was taught not to be. So it was easy. Here is my chance, I thought, to be nasty, to drink, to be mean. I loved doing it. It was so much fun.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"87296"	"I"	"thought"	" ``I felt it on the first tee,'' she said. I felt like, `Let me do it for them.' After the third hole, I thought, `OK, Emilee, it's time to play some golf.' '' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"87335"	"we"	"thought"	" Charlie broke into a big grin and flashed his outstretched fingers to indicate 15 fat geese. A half dozen alighted among our decoys. Any second, we thought, Tom would give us the signal to rise and take them. But he didn't. The geese circled and moved on. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"87437"	"she"	"thought"	" But Ms. Alba, a slender, sly-smiling woman whose strong, dark features call to mind the artist Frida Kahlo, seemed to have no choice. For many months her periods had been getting longer and more severe. She bled like a soldier at Gettysburg, ruining bedclothes, hemorrhaging onto the office bathroom floor. She took painkillers by the fistful, yet she still suffered from blinding headaches and abdominal cramps. She was anemic and fatigued. Her job as a computer systems analyst was at risk, and so, too, she thought, was her mind. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"

"87718"	"I"	"thought"	" ``The first couple of games, I thought, `It's going to be like this the whole season,''' Luton smiled. Instead, his only double-figures effort for two months came against Loyola Marymount Dec. 23. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"87921"	"he"	"thought"	" Kesler said he was worried that the team might choose the last alternative. Students assigned to full-time special education rarely graduate from high school _ a harsh sentence, he thought, for an 8-year-old. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"88041"	"he"	"thought"	" For 10 years Hector Mendez had lived in the Bronx and, like many New Yorkers, had never set foot in the Empire State Building. It was always there, he thought, and one day when he had a day off from his job in a neighborhood bodega he would visit. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"88152"	"I"	"thought"	" ``It was my own mistake,'' Eisner said of the decision to hire Ovitz. ``My intentions were appropriate and, I thought, wise. It just didn't work out that way.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"

"88244"	"I"	"thought"	" He expressed only two regrets: that the towels didn't say ``White House'' on them, and that he had to sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom alone. ``What a great waste, I thought,'' said the mayor. ``Even I could have closed the deal in the Lincoln Bedroom.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"

Birds are breeding out of control, destroying land and threatening millions of lives. But the switch is that these birds _ snow geese _ are ruining their own breeding grounds, and the lives in danger are their own and their offspring's. The question facing an international coalition of wildlife managers is whether to use extreme and heretofore illegal means to kill off large numbers of the geese in order to save larger numbers in the future.

"88588"	"I"	"thought"	" ``Boy, the roof came off the theater,'' Reynolds said. ``They were furious at the play, called it racist, asked how I could write in the voice of a black woman and so on. When the dust settled, I thought, `This is a pretty good crucible for talking about these issues.''' Thanks to the Actors Studio, Reynolds had his second act. ``Then all the theaters in the world turned it down,'' he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199703.gz"

"88709"	"I"	"thought"	" For Woods, questions about the arrangement are not what she had expected. ``This was a very happy event in my life. How fabulous, I thought, to be the only Arkansas artist in the Smithsonian Institution,'' she said recently. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199703.gz"
"88738"	"she"	"thought"	" Joan Siff and her father, Martin Isaacs, were as close, she thought, as parent and child could be. She had always enjoyed the facility of his mind and the generosity of his heart. Though he never went to college, they would have lengthy talks about classical literature and class division in American society. His passion was poetry, and in 1991, Mrs. Siff's sons, Andrew and Michael, published a volume of their grandfather's verse as a family legacy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199703.gz"

"88916"	"I"	"thought"	" When I was about 8 years old, I spotted a picture of a checkerboard cake in a magazine. This, I thought, was one of the most incredible things I'd ever seen. I wanted one for my birthday. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199703.gz"
"89241"	"I"	"thought"	" Kosersky first encountered the Joe Louis phenomenon while selecting music for ``The Great Depression,'' a 1993 series for PBS that devoted considerable time to the boxer. Looking for material, she went to her usual sources: catalogs, collectors, discographies. ``Once I got beyond 10 Louis songs, I thought, `My God, this is more recordings than I've ever collected for any other athlete,'' said Kosersky, who has worked on documentaries about Joe DiMaggio, Jack Johnson, Jackie Robinson and Muhammad Ali. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200102.gz"

"89487"	"they"	"thought"	" Palestinian negotiators had come to see President Bill Clinton's ``peace team'' as apologists for Israel, and many prominent Palestinians had convinced themselves that their position would be stronger under President Bush.

"89521"	"I"	"thought"	" My assignment in this West African nation seemed simple: Get people to stop cooking meals over open-pit campfires and get them to use easy-to-make mud/adobe stoves or to buy affordable locally produced portable metal stoves. The reasons for the change were numerous and, I thought, very logical and easily comprehensible. We were providing them something that would improve their lives and was easy to obtain. My job taught me a valuable lesson: People do not change ingrained habits easily. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200103.gz"

"89641"	"I"	"thought"	" ``I made what Stanky later called an American League play,'' Rizzuto wrote in his 1994 book, ``The October Twelve.'' ``In other words, I did not take the ball out of my glove and tag him with the ball in my bare hand. I laid the glove, with the ball, I thought, firmly gripped in front of second base.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200103.gz"
"90068"	"I"	"thought"	" ``It was not easy, but I always wanted to keep my own way,'' she said. ``So with all those problems, I thought, once I get something I like to do, I'm going to give something back. and that was one of the reasons I started the training camp.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"90294"	"I"	"thought"	" ``When I read the script, I thought, 'Oh my God, will we be able to do something this ambitious with a first-time director?' '' recalls Martha Sosa, an executive producer of the movie and partner in Altavista Films, the young company that backed the risky project. ``I didn't know if I was going to be able to convince money people to risk so much on this guy.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"90319"	"I"	"thought"	" ``When he came on board, I thought, `That's it; the company's over the hump,''' said Assed Kalil, vice president for marketing at Internet Access. ``We knew what our technology could do if you put it in front of the right people, and as long as we believed that he could put us in front of those people, what happened at Covad didn't matter.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"90543"	"I"	"thought"	" ``I had completed a (doctorate) in materials engineering at MIT, but had decided that I did not want to be an academic,'' Nugent recalled. ``After the MIT seminar on what to do other than research, I thought, `Maybe I should try patent law.' '' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"90569"	"I"	"thought"	" ``At first, I thought, how depressing. But the longer I was with him, the more I developed an intense love for Texas history, too.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"90645"	"I"	"thought"	" At the very least, I thought, it might be a good conversation-starter with free-agent girls. But the girl I've had my eye on for some time didn't say, ``Cool idea.'' She said, ``You look like a dork.'' Well, there that went. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"90719"	"I"	"thought"	" In a letter to Lillian Ross about a collection of New Yorker interviews by her and her sister Helen, Burrows said he had been waiting to buy the book. Then he was inundated with complimentary copies. ``When the first two copies arrived, I thought, `How sweet. Lillian has sent me one and Helen has sent me one, too.' Then I sneaked a look at one of the flyleaves and it said, `To Eleanor.' I haven't been called Eleanor for years. Then I looked at the flyleaf of the other book and it said, `To Abe,' and the mystery was solved. At that very moment a third copy arrived, this one for Arthur Krim.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"90810"	"I"	"thought"	" ``At the time, when I first put it on, I thought, `Well, I'd better keep moving. Because if things aren't going well, I'm going to make a good target.' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz

, I guess,	 There were questions from the audience. A woman, perplexed, asked if he was going to keep painting. ``I'm a painter,'' Schnabel replied. ``I've made 1,000 paintings. I've made two movies. I'll probably make another movie. Basically I'm an artist. Whatever tool it is, whether it's a camera or it's a paintbrush, I'm kind of, I guess, expressing something and trying to find the right tool.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he said,	 In a visit shortly after ``Before Night Falls'' was nominated for an Oscar, for Best Actor, I ask Schnabel what movie he planned to do next. Harvey Weinstein had told me he thought Schnabel could be a ``major, major director,'' though he doubted that a studio would give Schnabel much more than $20 million for a movie. Bigger budgets, he said, require a director who can ``homogenize'' his or her vision. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz

ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS  (moving in `e' category)  COVER STORIES  FILM-MUSIC (Undated) _ For two years in a row, the Academy Award for best film score has gone to a classical composer: first John Corigliano for ``The Red Violin,'' then Tan Dun for ``Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.'' While cynics claim that this is the film industry's way of advertising its high-art pretensions, Hollywood may really be ahead of New York in acknowledging that the opposition between film music and concert music is a phantom of the last century. Today the two styles constantly interact. By David Schiff.  ART-TECHNOLOGY (Undated) _ Artists are engines of invention. Like children who make toys and games from pots and pans, popsicle sticks and bottle tops, artists reconfigure unlikely materials for unexpected purposes. Today they rearrange industrial goods and convert technologies to aesthetic ends, and the technological bit is becoming a contemporary specialty. In the early 20th century, art raised industrial materials to the status of a cause. In the 1960s, technology itself became the cause. Artistic appropriation of technology and collaboration with it has flourished ever since. By Vicki Goldberg.  With photo.  FILM  FILM-UMA-THURMAN (Undated) _ there are fair number of pretty faces in Hollywood, if you are not too fussy about their acting or diction and do not object to ``a clone-type of beauty,'' as the director James Ivory has put it. But for the demanding part of Charlotte Stant in their adaptation of ``The Golden Bowl,'' arguably the most challenging of Henry James' novels, Ivory and his producing partner, Ismail Merchant, were convinced that nothing less than a goddess would do. ``There was only one person who came to mind,'' said Ivory, ``who was our first choice from the very beginning, who was full of that kind of vitality and life, with a beauty that is very individual and completely beguiling, and that was Uma.''

THEATER  THEATER-NYRO (New York) _ When Diane Paulus was approached with the idea of directing a musical based on the songs of Laura Nyro, she had absolutely no idea who Laura Nyro was. Nyro's renown as a performer and songwriter is for the most part confined to Paulus' baby-boomer elders, many of whom found in Nyro's emotional, often spiritual albums a passionate expression of their own bliss and anguish.

MUSIC-COUNTRY (Undated) _ Country music these days is defined more by what it lacks than by what it is: it's '70s rock without the sexual knowingness; singer-songwriter narratives without the desperate confessions; friendly, slickly packaged Southernness with none of the region's literary flair or ungovernable eccentricities. By Anthony DeCurtis.  TELEVISION  TV-MANHEIM (Los Angeles) _ Camryn Manheim is the star and an executive producer of a new film for ABC, ``Kiss My Act,'' which is, in its own way, revolutionary. It's one of the rare television or feature films in which the fat girl actually gets the good-looking guy. ``It happens in real life but never in television and movies,'' she said. ``Face it: more women look like me than Julia Roberts. Why can't the fat girl end up with the handsome prince?'' By Bernard Weinraub.  ART/ARCHITECTURE  ART-U.S.-FOLKART (Boston) _ The gallery evokes a New England Eden. A wall painted to look like the side of a barn is stocked with a herd of copper weather vanes, a flock of decoys floats on a Mylar pool, a watercolor giraffe nibbles on his border of stenciled leaves. A carved wooden lion with fierce eyebrows growls. And a carousel greyhound in a red and gold harness leans, ears flattened, into an imaginary wind.

The show is the first devoted to the museum's important and growing collection of American folk art. By Deborah Weisgall.  With photo.

DRUMMOND AYRES JR. c.2001 New York Times News Service  The 2002 congressional elections are 18 months away, but already the White House is involved in the effort to tip the 50-50 balance in the Senate to the Republican side.  President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and the top White House political strategist, Karl Rove, are personally, even bluntly, injecting themselves into some races, pressuring candidates they consider weak to get out and urging reluctant but more promising runners (in the White House view) to get in.  Three weeks ago, Mayor Norm Coleman of St. Paul, Minn., felt the pressure. Coleman, who ran the Bush campaign in Minnesota last year, had been thinking about trying to unseat Minnesota's governor, Jesse Ventura, an independent, but the White House saw him as the best Republican bet to take on Sen. Paul Wellstone, a Democrat who some polls indicate is vulnerable.  Bush summoned Coleman for a little chat in the Rose Garden. Rove held a follow-up talk. Whereupon last weekend Coleman abandoned his hope to be governor and announced that he was ``putting the pieces together'' to take on Wellstone.  A couple of days later, the majority leader of the Minnesota House, Tim Pawlenty, felt the pressure.  Pawlenty was about to announce that he, too, intended to take on Wellstone. But then Cheney called, warning that a Pawlenty-Coleman primary fight might be too divisive. So rather than announce, Pawlenty renounced _ but not without lamenting as he departed that ``it makes you wonder about the integrity of the process.''  Meanwhile, next door in South Dakota, Rep. John Thune is beginning to feel the pressure. He wants to run for governor (the seat is open, with no serious Democratic opposition in sight), but the White House wants him to take on Sen. Tim Johnson, a Democrat who some Republican strategists think is vulnerable.  Bush had a talk with Thune in early March and then invited him and his wife, Kimberley, to the White House Thursday for a quiet dinner _ and more talk.  No word on how things went.  Looking Down the Road in a Trip to Louisiana  Speaking of the search for strong Senate candidates...  Bush is scheduled to make a swing through Louisiana this week to promote his congressional agenda, and if a new poll has it right, while he is there he might consider casting around a bit for someone to take on Sen. Mary Landrieu next year.  Landrieu, a moderate Democrat, won a first term in 1996 by fewer than 6,000 of the 1.7 million votes cast. And ever since, Republican strategists have regarded her as one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the Senate. In fact, one reason Bush is headed for Louisiana is to put pressure on her by lobbying for his tax and budget proposals while in her back yard.  But the new poll may give him pause, along with the once-confident Republican strategists.  The poll, conducted two weeks ago for a consortium of Louisiana television stations by Southern Media and Opinion Research of Baton Rouge, has Landrieu holding a 2-1 lead over each of the two Republicans who have indicated an interest in challenging her, Rep. John Cooksey, who hails from the 5th Congressional District in the state's northeast corner, and Suzanne Haik Terrell, the state's elections commissioner.  Landrieu called the poll ``pleasing,'' but noted that the campaign had hardly gotten under way.  Cooksey and Terrell did their best to find something pleasing in the numbers. Cooksey said he was encouraged by his level of support so early in the campaign. Terrell said she was flattered.  Perot's Battered Army Hangs On, and On  The Reform Party peaked in political power in the 1992 presidential election, when Ross Perot captured 19 percent of the vote. Since then, the trip has been all downhill.  It turned out that the party was not really a party. The party was Ross Perot, voluble billionaire, willing to spend millions to promote a populist, reformist agenda. Then he and the country lost interest.  But Russell Verney didn't lose interest.  Verney, Perot's political adviser, kept plugging away, hanging around Dallas, using the Perot name and sometimes a bit _ a pittance, really _ of the Perot money to somehow keep the wheezing organization on a lifeline. ``I believe in this'' was his mantra.  He hung on for nine long years, long enough to see the final remnant of the party implode at its 2000 nominating convention, long enough to see its nominee, Pat Buchanan, stumble across the finish line in November with 0.5 percent of the popular vote.  A few surviving Perotistas vow to continue the fight.  Verney is not among them.  Last week, he said he was negotiating to open a Dallas office for Judicial Watch, a conservative group that monitors legal affairs. Finally, he said, he will be leaving Perot's employ.  Forever and ever, amen?  ``I would never really leave Ross,'' he told The Fort Worth Star-Telegram. ``I love the man. He's my hero.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010421.0140 type=story > <HEADLINE> SPORTS COLUMN: JORDAN SHOULD COME OUT OF RETIREMENT </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-BKN-ARATON-COLUMN-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz

Glenn Cole, a biologist who retired last month from the Department of Environmental Conservation, said that in good years, the ratio of poults to adult hens in the fall is about 3 to 1; last fall that ratio was about 1 to 1, he said, many of the juveniles having been claimed by the inclement weather in early summer. A hen usually has 10 to 12 eggs in her nest. Newly hatched poults are subject to respiratory infections. When they are truly small, the hen can gather them under her and protect them from the elements, but soon there is not room for the entire brood.

Vancouver is one of the nicest corners of the world. Too bad a small number of its citizenry chose to be such noticeable morons . . . Prior to heading overseas for a first-hand look at some of Europe's best young junior talent, Islanders GM Mike Milbury _ ex- of the Bruins blue line _ said he will look to sign one goalie, possibly two, over the summer. The idea, he said, is to get former Boston University backstop Rick DiPietro some supporting help, similar to the role John Vanbiesbrouck filled this past season, prior to his being dealt to New Jersey. ``We like Ricky a lot,'' said Milbury, ``but we don't feel he's ready to handle 60 games a season yet.'' Milbury, likely to remain overseas for the remainder of the month, figures he won't name a new coach until early May. The candidates remain the same: Ted Nolan, Kevin Constantine, Robbie Ftorek, and Bryan Murray. Like his counterpart here in Boston, O'Connell, Milbury said he would like to feel he has a true partnership link with the guy he stands behind the bench . . . Word around Edmonton is that the Oilers have decided to exercise their right to switch places in the June draft with the Bruins. Figure the Oilers for No. 13 and the Bruins at No. 19. Oiler boss Kevin Lowe acquired that first-round contingency in the early-season trade that sent Bill Guerin here for Anson Carter. Moving up six rungs on the ladder is too attractive for the Oilers. The most recent Bruin to be picked 19th overall in the draft? Landon ``Of The Lost'' Wilson, originally drafted by Colorado and sent here with Anders Myrvold for Boston's first pick in the '98 draft _ which happened to be (drum roll here) No. 19 (Robyn Regeher, who played 71 games on the Calgary backline in 2000-01). The best No. 19 picks in recent years: Martin Straka (Pittsburgh/'92) and Keith Tkachuk (Winnipeg/'90) . . . Blackhawks GM Mike Smith, who drafted Tkachuk in his days as Winnipeg boss, recently told Chicago reporters he figures it's time to ``cut bait'' with the current squad. ``It became apparent to me in mid-November that our roster was lousy,'' he said. The Hawks have to upgrade their grit factor. Smith's one jewel to wheel would be former BU star Tony Amonte.

The setting, a mining camp in the Sierra Nevadas, sometimes overwhelms the characters, including Peter Mullan's rich and powerful man corroded from within.

His gross-out comedy is crude and stupid, but also rudely funny as it rides a subtext of parental violence toward children.

So much for the idea that technology was going to make everybody's life easier.  ``Forget it. Forget it,'' the former US labor secretary advised a group of 200 business and education leaders at the third annual Work Force Preparedness Summit in Natick, Mass. ``We were sold a bill of goods.''  Reich shook his head. And some of those in the audience agreed, it seemed, that the pace of life was getting a little too fast. But what to do, one asked?  ``Life is more than grades for college, getting a BA degree, and earning money,'' Reich told the group, many of them middle-aged parents with high demands on their children as well as themselves. ``Life is more than that.''  ``Some (of you) are having midlife crises now, just to find that out,'' he added.  The line drew big laughs. But everybody knew it was made of serious stuff.  Reich said the new global economy is producing undeniable benefits: greater wealth, flexibility in where work is done, and more innovation in how it's done. But its downside is pretty big, too, he noted. It includes longer work weeks, a drive for success that can often stifle creativity and individuality, and stresses on the family.  Much of this new pressure is being transferred to children as well, maintained Reich. They are pressured to have spotless academic records, overscheduled in activities parents believe will help their futures, pushed to win acceptance into top colleges. ``All the middle-class kids have to prove they are above average _ it's so ingrained in our society, it seems we can't change it,'' Reich said.  But it has to change, he added.  ``They have no time, no poetry, no realizations in their lives,'' he said. The result is that many young people may be quietly turning off.  ``That smell of resignation is what worries me,'' he added.  Reich said what worries him about parents is a different resignation _ one that has them convinced they have no choice but to run full tilt at work _ whether they are making huge incomes or struggling to pay the weekly bills.  ``It's robbing us of a lot of our lives outside of work,'' he said. ``the average middle-class family with children today is doing seven weeks more paid work (a year) than they did in l990.''  That, he added, doesn't include extra time spent at night checking and replying to e-mail on the home computer _ time taken away from family activities.  Reich said it was the dwindling time he had to spend with his own family, particularly his two sons, that led him to resign his Cabinet post in Washington and return to Massachusetts. He is currently a professor at Brandeis University, and the author of a new book, ``The Future of Success.''  All the extra work Americans do is not even benefiting most families in a significant financial way, he said. Reich told the group that only the top tier of middle-class families _ he put it at the top 5 percent _ have made substantial income gains in the last decade.  For middle-class families below that tier, he said, the median family income in Massachusetts adjusted for inflation rose barely at all, about $10,000 totally since l990.  Workers at the bottom did even worse. ``It is not easily reversed,'' he said, but it needs to be. ``We don't want to live in a two-tier economy.''  Firms don't see Net  as source of growth  Nearly 40 percent of small and midsize companies recently surveyed by the Conference Board expect to be acquired or form operating partnerships with major firms in order to survive and grow over the next five years. But the Internet does not factor greatly in the expectations of most.  ``Surprisingly, very few of the surveyed companies say the Internet will play a major role in their future growth,'' the Conference Board said. Indeed, Howard Muson, author of the survey for the Conference Board, said many companies ``are still scared to death of the Internet.''  The survey found only 10 percent of the companies identified the Internet as a key source in expected growth, with the majority concerned about the costs and complexities of Internet technology itself. Most companies said they expected growth from new customers, new products and services, and from acquisitions.  The Conference Board said is survey included 184 firms in a wide range of industries across the country.  Diverse industry base  a draw for top execs  So where do managers and executives go to find new jobs when they've been let go and want to get out of their hometowns?  Look no further than Chicago, San Diego, Denver, Austin, and Charlotte, N.C., according to a survey by Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas Inc., the international outplacement firm.  ``From a job seeker's point of view, these cities are perceived to have the most to offer in terms of employment,'' said John A. Challenger, chief executive of the Chicago firm. He said each city was cited for having a diverse industry base to help insulate the local economy during recessions and economic slowdowns.  But the so-called livability of the five cities was also cited. Noting his hometown is Chicago, Challenger said it was a top-pick city for relocating executives in part because it is seen ``as the most livable among large US cities.'' However, he gave no specific reasons for such a view.  San Diego was cited for its climate and ocean; Denver for the allure of the Rocky Mountains; and Austin and Charlotte were viewed as thriving yet still manageable new economy cities despite their rapid growth. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010423.0179 type=story > <HEADLINE> PLAYING BLUFF WITH SELLING ARMS TO TAIWAN </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-GREENWAY-COLUMN-BOS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz

By Sandra Blakeslee.  SCI-TELLER-HBOMB (Undated) _ After a heart attack, Dr. Edward Teller sat down with a friend and a tape recorder and discussed the secret history of the hydrogen bomb. The first design, he said, ``was made by Dick Garwin.'' Teller, now 93, was not ceding the laurels for devising the bomb _ a glory he claims for himself. But he was rewriting how the rough idea became the world's most feared weapon. His tribute, made more than two decades ago but just now coming to light, adds a surprising twist to a dispute that has roiled historians and scientists for decades: Who should get credit for designing the H-bomb? A transcript of the conversation was made available to The Times. By William J. Broad. (2100 words)  With photos, NYT1,2.  SCI-BRAZIL-GENOMICS (Sao Paolo) _ The Research Support Foundation of the State of Sao Paulo is rapidly becoming a powerhouse in genomics and a model for scientific investigation in the third world. In July, a Brazilian consortium organized and financed by the foundation became the first anywhere to decode the genome of a plant pathogen, Xylella fastidiosa, an insect-borne bacteria that infests oranges. A few months later, the foundation, known as Fapesp, announced it had completed the genetic sequence of a second pest that plagues this country's thriving fruit export industry, Xanthomonas citri, or citrus canker. The twin successes not only established its international reputation but also led to collaborations with other important research agencies. By Larry Rohter. (1590 words)  With photo, NYT6.  SCI-HEART-TRAINING (Undated) _ Health clubs and cardiologists all over the country compute the maximum heart rate by subtracting a person's age from 220. Trouble is that formula doesn't work for at least 40 percent of the population, and that has ramifications for cardiac testing. Even the man who devised the formula says it's only an approximation that has taken on a life all its own. By Gina Kolata. (1750 words)  SCI-IONIC-LIQUIDS (Undated) _ Substances with chemical structures similar to table salt _ but look and flow like water _ may one day become environmentally friendly replacements for some of the noxious solvents used by industry. They're called ionic liquids, essentially salts with low melting temperatures. Although still years away from widespread industrial use, ionic liquids are attracting the interest of Exxon Mobil, BP Amoco and other companies. By Kenneth Chang. (890 words)  SCI-MESOSCALE-BIOLOGY (Undated) _ One submicropscopic area remains largely a mystery to experts: This is the region containing matter on a scale of 10 to 1,000 angstroms (an angstrom being one billionth of a meter) _ bigger than a simple molecule but smaller than a living cell. This is the realm in which the constituents of cells interact with one another. Now scientists are trying to penetrate that realm, known as the mesoscale. By Sandra Blakeslee. (1585 words)  SCI-DOG-BARKS (Undated) _ A small band of researchers around the world, trying to separate fact from speculation, are finding that dogs almost always bark for a reason, even if that reason isn't apparent to humans. Dog barks can be noisy, harmonic or a combination of the two, depending on their context and purpose. One study shows how different barks express different emotions, including loneliness, fear, distress, stress and pleasure, as well as a need for care among puppies _ and serve to alert other dogs, people or animals to changing external circumstances.

Lack of it may play a role in a number of modern maladies, including cardiac arrhythmia, irritable bowel syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis. Late last year the American Heart Association recommended that everyone include salmon or tuna in his diet at least twice a week, the first time the organization has departed from a general guideline to recommend a specific food. By Jim Robbins. (1200 words)  With photo, NYT5.  SCI-VENTILATION-HEALTH (Undated) _ As the population ages and medical technology gets better, the number of patients in the United States receiving long-term mechanical ventilation has been rising, from 6,000 in the mid-1980s to at least 12,000 and perhaps 20,000 or more today, experts on critical care say. The number of centers caring for these patients has also grown, from about 100 in 1990 to 240 today. Their care is expensive, and some tough decisions have to be made about financing it.

But, she noted, in a wide range of breeds physical expression is limited because of the lack of a tail, floppy ears and other physical characteristics. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz

Petrobras was also cited for inappropriately using detergents while cleaning up the smaller of the two spills, caused by an uncontrolled gush of oil earlier this month. A final report on the cause of the explosion that killed eleven workers and sank the company's largest oil platform in March is still pending.  EUROPE  GERMANY: CONFIDENCE GAUGE FALLS  A closely watched barometer of German business confidence dropped again in March, providing new evidence that the U.S. economic slowdown has affected Europe. The IFO index of business confidence, based on a monthly survey by the IFO research institute in Munich, dropped for the ninth month in a row and reached its lowest level in 12 months. But the decline was much smaller than last month, and it merely seemed to corroborate expectations that economic growth in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, will drop from about 3 percent last year to nearly 2 percent this year. Despite signs of trouble, the European Central Bank reiterated its view that European growth would remain relatively healthy and that there was no need to emulate the United States in lowering interest rates.  BRITAIN: HOTEL ACQUISITION  As hotel operators compete for trade among Europe's business travelers, Hilton Group PLC, which owns the Hilton chain outside the United States, said it would buy Sweden's Scandic Hotels AB for $890 million, adding 133 hotels in Scandinavia and 21 in other parts of Europe. The price represented a 31 percent premium over Scandic's closing price last Friday. The Swedish company's stock rose by as much as 34 kronor to a record 144 kronor, and Hilton's stock was up 18 pence in London at 238.5 pence. Hilton's chief executive, David Michels, said he was seeking acquisitions in Europe. As hotel groups consolidate in Europe, Marriott International and Bass PLC's Holiday Inns are also moving to extend chains on the continent.  ITALY: PHONE DIRECTORY PURCHASE  Seeking European dominance in the telephone directory business, Italy's acquisitive Seat Pagine Gialle SpA said it had agreed to buy Sweden's Eniro AB for $2.7 billion, a 36 percent premium over Friday's closing price. Analysts said the price was high, and Seat PG stock fell by 10 percent to 1.33 euros, compounding big losses over the past 12 months. Eniro's stock rose by up to 12.4 per cent to 136 kronor. The deal will give Seat PG new business in northern and eastern Europe and sharpen competition with British Telecommunications PLC and Telefonica SA of Spain in online directory services, analysts said.  ASIA  KOREA: MORE BAILOUT MONEY  South Korea's finance minister, Jin Nyum, said Monday that the government would have to plow another 28 trillion won, more than $20 billion, into banking institutions this year to keep them afloat. The government has already spent 134.7 trillion won ($102 billion) trying to put the country's financial sector back on a firm footing since the onset of the economic crisis in late 1997. Many banks in South Korea are overstaffed and inefficient and have huge amounts of bad debt on their books. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010423.0276 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-HEARST-NEWS-BUDGET-1STLD-WRITETHRU-HNS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Monday, May 31, 2001  Editors  The Hearst News Service will file the following for Tuesday.

TAIWAN-U.S. (Washington) _ President Bush is expected to accept the recommendation of his defense secretary and not sell Taiwan high-tech destroyers equipped with the Aegis combat radar system, two government officials said Monday. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Pentagon has recommended that Taiwan get four Kidd-class destroyers. Those vessels have a much less potent ship-borne radar system but would still be a step forward for Taiwan's navy. The officials did not disclose Bush's decision, but said it was expected that he would follow Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's lead. (Summary from wires) By David E. Sanger.  PERU-U.S. (Washington) _ The United States and Peru offered scant information Monday about the downing of an American missionary flight, playing down what the White House called an ``isolated incident'' and trying to keep it from scuttling one of its few successful counterdrug operations. U.S. officials said three civilian CIA employees aboard a U.S. aircraft had tried to stop a Peruvian jet from firing on the aircraft.

But he was rewriting how the rough idea became the world's most feared weapon. His tribute, made more than two decades ago but just now coming to light, adds a surprising twist to a dispute that has roiled historians and scientists for decades: Who should get credit for designing the H-bomb?

, he deadpanned,	 Not flashy? Asked if there is a tendency to underestimate the defensive talents of the players around Robinson and Tim Duncan, Spurs coach and sourpuss Gregg Popovich mumbled, ``I don't know.'' Asked to describe the defensive brilliance on display Monday, he deadpanned, ``We're a good defensive team.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, she thought,	 Lynn Esden was a 36-year-old assistant branch manager for the Bank of Vermont when its corporate parent in Boston laid her off. Her traditional defined-benefit plan had been converted to cash-balance the year before. From the traditional plan, she received a lump-sum benefit of $3,772; her cash-balance account came to $1,548 _ not much, she thought, for a year as a manager. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz

, he said,	 Because of its modular design, Gorlov's turbines, he said, could be adapted easily for everything from floating ``islands'' in major currents, such as the Gulf Stream, that could each produce many megawatts, to small units suitable for businesses or even for an individual home. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, you know,	 Occasionally the Greifs got e-mails asking if they raised genetically modified crops. The CornCam's sponsors, a seed company and a farm journal, advised the Greifs not to touch it. The Greifs grow some genetically modified corn _ Starlink corn. Sharon Greif, therefore, was vague in answering the e-mail. ``Greenpeace could come out and destroy your test plot, you know,'' she says. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz

, she said,	 ``Before, the rivers were full of shrimp and there was enough water for everyone,'' said Montiel's wife, Ubalda Cortes, who is hiding out in a safe house. But after the timber companies came, she said, the wells dried up and ``that's when the farmers began to lose their crops.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he said,	 Slitt said airlines use the Internet to promote travel to lagging markets. For example, in the wintertime, Chicago isn't a popular destination for weekend travelers. Often, he said, hourly flights from Washington, D.C., to Chicago's O'Hare airport were nearly empty until the Net Saavers program. Now the flights are usually full. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he said,	 In some situations, talking on a cellphone could be medically necessary, he said, citing examples such as surgery being broadcast by videophone, taking calls from a doctor in the field during a natural disaster, an emergency phone consultation with another doctor, or an urgent call about another patient in distress. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz

, they say,	 The people interpreters are speaking for are an increasingly diverse bunch. Much has been made of the new census numbers, but among court interpreters, the growing variety in New York's ethnic makeup has been known for some time. Over the past 10 years, they say, not only has the need for interpreters increased dramatically but also the need for different languages among interpreters. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, they say,	 Interpreters are instructed not to aid or advocate for their clients. Their job, they say, is to translate. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he added,	 ``It's a marathon,'' said Jesse Miranda, a professor of urban studies at Vanguard University, a Pentecostal university in Costa Mesa, Calif. ``One group after the other.'' Referring to frequent services in MacArthur Park in Los Angeles, he added, ``Intentional, aggressive evangelism is really what is at the core of Pentecostalism. We go out to you and tell you about liberation.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, it appears,	 And, it appears, some attacked people simply because they were white. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, I believe,	 Nonsense. I've never said such a thing, because I don't believe it. Under the accepted legal definition of a hate crime as an act committed against someone because of the victim's race, sexual orientation, ethnicity or religion, I believe, for example, that a gay person who singles out a straight person could be charged, and a Jew who singles out a Muslim could be charged _ and yes, a black targeting a white can be charged. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he said,	 Wu noted, though, that the muted reaction to the U.S. decision was somewhat misleading. If the White House had suspended or radically scaled back the weapons program, he said, it would have been a rude shock to an island that depends on Washington to protect it from China. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, she said,	 The pressure merely to qualify for the Napa 500, she said, will be enormous. Robinson has tested at the Fontana track, near Los Angeles, but Kranefuss said she wrecked during the first day and almost wrecked again. Because Kranefuss' team is in its first year, it cannot use provisional starting positions given to racing teams at the end of every season. So Robinson must be one of the 36 fastest drivers to make the 43-car starting grid. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he says,	 Part of what attracted him to the New School, he says, was that its founding president, Alvin Johnson, came from Nebraska. The affinity runs even deeper. The original New School might be seen as the highest intellectual flowering of progressivism, which was very much a product of the Midwest. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he added,	 ``Most venture people would like to be in a position to make management changes where they think those changes are necessary for the success of the company,'' observed Ken Boger, a partner with Kirkpatrick &AMP; Lockhart in Boston. If things get ugly, he added, ``ultimately, the people who have the money, one way or the other, they're going to call the shots.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he said,	 ``I was pushed out of ArsDigita by the venture capitalists and managers that I brought in,'' Greenspun says on his personal homepage. He hasn't been invited to a board meeting since December, he said in an interview, despite his 60 percent ownership stake in the company. A few weeks ago, he received a letter from one of the venture partners, suggesting that he step down. The next day, he said, ``they locked me out of the building.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he said,	 Metcalfe said a lawsuit won't help the company or the investors if it lingers. He said Greenspun is smart and strong-willed. But, he said, ``Greylock is a first-rate firm. If they think he shouldn't be working there, they're probably right.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he said,	 Souter expressed doubt that episodes like Atwater's are widespread. They are probably rare, he said, because of ``the good sense (and, failing that, the political accountability) of most local lawmakers and law-enforcement officials.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he said,	 Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia, said Bush doesn't have much chance of changing the contentious climate. In order for Bush to bring back civility, he said, he would have to squelch all the party committees. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, they counsel,	 This is what pastors do _ they preach, they counsel, they perform marriage ceremonies, and they eulogize and bury the dead. They watch their congregations grow as the years pass. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he says,	 Tipps admits that he is naive _ in fact, he's proud of it. Remember, he says, that 200 years ago, not many would have predicted the decline of slavery around the world. And he doesn't appear concerned about the danger he would be exposed to in trouble spots where he might be taken hostage or shot on sight. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he responded,	 The essence of techno-savvy he did not convey. When asked if he had much experience with that premillennial invention, the Internet, he responded, ``I'm starting to.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he said,	 Schultz grew up in federal housing projects in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn, the son of a blue-collar worker who sometimes did not know where the family's next meal was coming from. He recalls curling up in a sleeping bag on the sidewalk outside Madison Square Garden to purchase tickets the next morning for Knicks playoffs games, and scalping some of the tickets, he said, ``so that I could afford to see the games.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz

, he said,	 ``It is a powerful phenomenon,'' said Tesser, now retired. ``It's so robust, it's hard to turn off.'' That is especially true these days, when Caller ID and voice mail make it possible for those in charge of hiring to dodge job hopefuls indefinitely. And the longer they procrastinate, he said, the harder it becomes to do their duty. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he said,	 Maybe he was naive, David Singer said, who was brushed off twice during a recent job search, but it took a while for him to catch on. The hiring process for a previous job had taken three months, he said, so a stretched-out time frame seemed reasonable. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he postulates,	 Smith makes much of Grant's failures as a soldier and businessman prior to the Civil War. Enduring humiliation, he postulates, made Grant determined to treat others with respect when he eventually held the upper hand, either in war or government. If he had a fatal flaw as general and president, he believes, it was his unwavering habit of believing the best about almost everyone else. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he may,	 ``If an officer has probable cause to believe that an individual has committed even a very minor criminal offense in his presence, he may, without violating the Fourth Amendment, arrest the offender,'' wrote Justice David Souter for the majority. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he said,	 Sanctions, Annan wrote to the council, ``cannot be an end in themselves.'' He also said that the decision by the United States to shut down the Taliban's office in New York has led to Taliban threats to close U.N. offices in Afghanistan and the disruption of peace talks that began last year. Increasingly, he said, noting the destruction of two giant Buddha figures at Bamiyan last month by the Taliban, the group is dominated by ``more radical elements.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, she said,	 The new program, she said, directly fits with major changes taking place at TNN. Once called the Nashville Network, TNN tried to appeal to people with Southern tastes with reruns of programs like ``Dallas'' and ``Dukes of Hazzard.'' Last fall it changed its name to the National Network, and Robina said it was now switching directions and trying to appeal to a broader and younger audience with as much original programming as possible. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, I found,	 The more chefs do to oysters, I found, the better they taste. Plain wood-roasted oysters at Beacon in Midtown make a pleasant few bites, but either Babalu's or Patria's would almost do for dinner. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, she bakes,	 She has jelly beans in Drawer No. 1, chocolate in Drawer No. 2 and hard candies in the cut-glass jar on the front counter. She nourishes her favorite plant. She smiles at everyone. She laughs, she bakes, she calls everyone ``hon.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he added,	 The packaging strategy works, he added, ``only if it makes sense and there's a fit'' among the disparate elements, otherwise ``if we're trying to force inventory on someone who doesn't need it, we'll lose ground.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, they said,	 The producers admit they had relatively little to do with the creative development of the show; that, they said, was primarily handled by Brooks, Meehan, Stroman and Glen Kelly, the music supervisor. The producers' contributions were largely managerial, and of course, financial. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he said,	 But, he said, ``I don't feel like I did a darn thing wrong.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he said,	 But it is the theater, he said, that has long held sway over his emotions. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he said,	 He has. Polite and soft-spoken, with pale blue eyes and a lean stature, Wiseman is one of those actors who seem truly alive only when speaking about what they do. His voice, usually almost a whisper, fills with energy and his eyes light up. When he is not onstage, he said, he stays engaged in what is going on in the play. ``I see people backstage doing crossword puzzles when they're not on, and I envy them,'' he said. ``When I come to the theater, I can't let the play go for the three hours I'm there. I sit offstage and listen.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, she says,	 BE UP FRONT. Alert prospective partners about your interest in an alliance, says Mimi Donaldson, co-author of ``Negotiating for Dummies'' (Hungry Minds Inc., 1996). Don't keep your purpose to yourself until you have felt them out. But, she says, ``keep quiet on the details of the proposed partnership until you are in the same room. This will enable the prospective partner to bring colleagues critical to such discussions to the first meeting yet ensure your specific plans are kept proprietary until you know there is interest in the deal.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz

, I presume,	 Andrews, for one, is well aware of the broadcast's spectacle status. ``I think that the world in general has become used to a new thrill, a new event, a new something,'' she said in a telephone interview at the end of a long day of rehearsals in Los Angeles. ``And this, I presume, falls into that category a little bit. So right now it is the thing to be doing.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, they say,	 ``They see the movie very differently (from guys),'' Bay says. ``I do small test screenings at my house. I have friends bring some high school or college girls. We talk about the movie. It really helps because there are a bunch of guys cutting the movie. Things that we as guys see as cheesy, they say, `No, no. You gotta keep that in. It's sweet.''' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he whispered,	 As Twist switched on a tape, the puppets leaped into the air to the lively rhythms of a joyous Russian dance. The Moor, his head swathed in a purple turban and gold jewelry sparkling on his bare chest, rose in a royale, his green and gold trousers shimmering as he leaped into the air. The Ballerina and Petrouchka expertly and un-self-consciously spun into pirouettes, still dressed in their underclothes. Working with Twist, the costume designer known as David was finishing the Ballerina's elegant gold lace tutu and Petrouchka's red and blue checkered pants and tasseled blue hat, modeled after Nijinksy's in the original Ballets Russes production. ``I thought I'd only use these puppets for rehearsals and make new ones for Lincoln Center,'' Twist said. ``But now we love them very much, so I just keep replacing their parts when they become damaged.'' Glancing at them fondly, he whispered, ``How could I do otherwise?'' </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010424.0344 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-BJT-ADVISORY-KIDS-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> The Atlanta Journal-Constitution story slugged KIDS-SPOTLIGHT will not move this evening.

, he said,	 ``We decided it was good enough, so we officially launched it'' on Sunday, said Dr. Teng Kwong Yeoh, the senior manager of in-flight services and entertainment for Singapore. Over the next 12 to 14 months, he said, Singapore will spend more than $100 million to equip 55 other 747s with the new service, which is supplied by Tenzing Communications Inc., a two-year-old Seattle-based company that is also providing similar satellite-based air-ground systems to other airlines rushing to meet the demand. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he said,	 Ultimately, he said, ``the price will be very much like what an ISP charges on the ground,'' for passengers who sign up for personal or corporate accounts, with monthly billing. Per-flight and per-use billing (at about $1 per e-mail of about 50 words) is also being considered, he said. Within a year to 14 months, Singapore expects to have 55 more planes equipped with the service n which Yeoh said he expects will then be operating at data-transmission speeds in excess of 64 kbs. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he added,	 Souter stressed that courts are not to second-guess whether the crime was serious enough to justify detaining the individual. The court, he added, refused to create a new constitutional right insulating an individual from being taken into custody and held when the crime involved could result only in a fine, not jail time. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he said,	 The motoring public, he said, is protected because ``if the police arrest everybody, there is going to be political protest.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he said,	 Attorney General Reilly replied that the regulations drafted by his office do not prohibit advertising to adults. Rather, he said, they are aimed appropriately at preventing children from illegal activity _ buying tobacco products _ and ``becoming the next generation of smokers induced by the powerful and overwhelming advertising'' of the cigarette companies. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he said,	 Thompson advocates transferring all shows on videotape to a digital disk format like DVD. But Loughney of the Library of Congress cautions against relying too much on new technology. Highly compressed digital videotape, he said, is ``thinner and less physically robust than the older tapes,'' and, as for DVD's, they ``have not been tested as an archival storage medium.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he said,	 That may have been true at the time, Blanton's lawyer, John C. Robbins, said in his own opening statement. But Blanton's segregationist beliefs, Robbins stressed, do not prove that he was a bomber. The prosecution's case against Blanton is utterly circumstantial, he said, and he encouraged the jury not to be swayed by the emotional tug of the deaths of Denise McNair, who was 11, and Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Wesley, who were 14. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he said,	 The jurors, he said, would hear from a man who scared off several men, including one who resembled Blanton, after seeing them acting suspiciously outside the church, late at night, about two weeks before the bombing. Another witness, he said, would testify that on the night before the Sept. 15 bombing he saw Blanton busily moving materials into the trunk of his car at a sign shop that served as a Klan gathering place. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, she said,	 Nansel noted that the lack of detailed information and the fact that the questionnaire was not intended specifically to address bullying limited the findings. In addition, she said, students may have had varying interpretations of the meaning of bullying, although the term was defined in the questionnaire. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he said,	 The administration would talk with them, he said, ``once an environment of genuinely free discussion has been restored.'' Read: the administration will not negotiate with the sitters-in until they quit the building. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he said,	 The city of Cambridge, too, is backing the protesters. On Monday night, the City Council passed the latest of several resolutions calling on Harvard to pay its workers more, and Mayor Anthony Galluccio visited the Yard to express support. Rudenstine is a nice guy, he said, and nice guys should support a living wage. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz

, he added,	 ``Really good progress has been made in a bipartisan way,'' Lott, R-Miss., said before introducing Education Secretary Rod Paige, who attended the weekly Senate Republican lunch. But, he added, ``just money is not the only answer, it's not the answer. We must have reform connected with it.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, I understand,	 ``I have to go check my rule book, I understand, because I thought they started counting three seconds when you go into the lane,'' Dunleavy said. ``I didn't realize that they didn't start counting three seconds until you stopped and camped out. I'd better get that clarification.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, she explained,	 Now, the French are debating whether it is suited for 2-year-olds. ``Studies suggest that there is not any great advantage for middle-class 2-year-olds but there is clearly a benefit for poor children,'' said Agnes Florin, a psychologist at the University of Nantes who has studied preschool education for 2-year-olds. Poor children, she explained, profited from preschool exposure to games, activities and social interaction often missing at home. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he said,	 The space station partners have not estimated how much work could be lost because of a work slowdown or its financial cost to the project, Hawes said. Tito's agreement is solely with the Russians, he said, and at no point during the latest negotiations did the issue of sharing profits with the other partners come up. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz

, he said,	 Dr. Jeffrey M. Drazen, The Journal's editor-in-chief, said that persuading scientists to divulge personal financial data was not easy. ``We have to work at it,'' Drazen said. When researchers ignore inquiries about conflicts, he said, many journals, including his own, assume none exist. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz

, he said,	 At that session, he took no questions and refused to speak directly about the allegations that he had taken gifts. Tuesday, choosing his words carefully, he told reporters that he had told his colleagues that ``there simply were no illegal gifts, no illegal gifts.'' He also told them, he said, ``that it was painful and difficult but that i have to believe in the process.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he said,	 Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut said he missed Torricelli's speech. But asked whether the New Jersey Democrat should consider resigning, he said, ``I would hope not.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he added,	 Immergluck, though, said he thought the pilot program appeared designed to fail. If Citigroup is serious about improving industry practices, he added, the company should quit battling laws against predatory lending. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he added,	 Yerington said that residents of his city had not complained when their tax dollars paid for disaster recovery elsewhere. Referring to the floods of 1993, he added, ``No one thought we'd suffer 300-year floods twice in eight years.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, she said,	 ``Basically, this is a new administration,'' said Bruemmer. ``I don't think they really know or understand the history of Davenport. He's correct in that we need to look at flood control in some form'' _ but not, she said, a flood wall that would cut the city off from the river. ``We're hoping to have that conversation and that he become sympathetic to our position,'' Bruemmer said of Allbaugh. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, she said,	 Anderson said she had lived through the flood of 1993 in Ottumwa, Iowa, in a trailer park. She lost her home in that flood, she said, and has lived in Davenport since July. But like most people here, her family lives uphill and their home is not affected by the flood. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, it said,	 For many years, the panel said, researchers tended to view men as the norm or the standard, and scientists tended to ``underreport rather than highlight sex differences.'' This habit, it said, ``can still be found in the current medical literature,'' even though the study of sex-based differences has produced information beneficial to the health of both men and women. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, it said,	 In addition, it said, women are more sensitive to certain types of pain, and a woman may feel more or less pain from the same stimulus at different stages of the menstrual cycle. These differences have important implications for the treatment of illnesses, the panel said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, it said,	 The panel urged scientists to investigate sex differences at the level of cells and molecules, not only in the reproductive system, but in other parts of the body, for, it said, ``every cell has a sex'' _ every cell contains a full set of chromosomes, including the sex chromosomes. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, it said,	 The panel said it had found many intriguing and significant sex differences. Women, it said, are more likely than men to recover language ability after suffering a stroke that affects the left side of the brain. Likewise, it said, estrogen, the female sex hormone, appears to improve the reading ability of post-menopausal women. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010424.0456 type=story > <HEADLINE> MARKET PLACE: LUCENT LEARNS ITS LESSONS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-LUCENT-MARKETPLACE-1STLD-WRITETHRU-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he noted,	 ``This particular period is unparalleled,'' Belt said. Before the court-ordered breakup of AT&AMP;T, he noted, telecom companies were usually considered to be utilities. But in recent years, the sector has boomed as companies tried to rapidly build out networks to serve everything from cellular phones to high-speed Internet access. But when the dot-coms started collapsing, so did much of the interest in building out huge data networks. And many of the sales predictions have fallen short of reality. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he explained,	 Looking backward, JDS fell victim to a chain of events, Langley said. The telecommunications service providers were hit first, he explained, cutting back their orders to equipment-makers, who then in turn wound up buying fewer parts from companies like JDS, putting it at the back of a line of tumbling dominos. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz

By Indira A.R. Lakshmanan. 850 words.  FOOT-TOURISM (Satterthwaite, England) _ Tourists are drawn by the indelible images of Romantic poets like William Wordsworth, who found inspiration here.

Like Jackie Robinson, Muhammad Ali, and Arthur Ashe, Woods could become ``a rare race sportsman,'' Johnson writes. ``He can even force us to accept the prickly and potentially combustible issues surrounding the growing acknowledgment of ethnically mixed Americans, and the practical, intellectual and political impact of this new category of citizens upon each of us.''

, he says,	 The summer movie season is almost upon us, and as much as we love to cheer the hero, we need a bad-to-the-bone villain to sneer. But in Movieline, always-hilarious Joe Queenan argues that in too many recent movies, ``the villain is not sufficiently villainous.'' Standards of villainy have dropped so much, what we are left with, he says, is Matt Damon in ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' as ``the giggliest, nerdiest, least disturbing psychopath since Dr. Evil,'' in the ``Austin Powers'' movies. ``The world as we know it is still evenly divided between good and evil people, and recognizing this, Hollywood has always attempted to depict the epic struggle for the human soul as a part of everyday life. But it has also understood that for the triumph of Good to resonate, Evil must be a worthy adversary, a countervailing force to the hero,'' Queenan writes. ``Otherwise, it's the Yankees ganging up on the Astros.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he says,	 The best recent movie villain, he says, was one moviegoers never saw _ the Blair Witch of ``The Blair Witch Project.'' ``By refusing to identify who was responsible for the murders taking place in the wilds of rural Maryland, the filmmakers forced the audience to confront their own personal demons, and construct highly personal images of the murderer.'' And what highly personal image of the Blair Witch did Queenan construct for himself? ``A 150-year-old leprosy-ravaged succubus with the body of Oprah Winfrey and the personality of Courtney Love. And I haven't slept well for the 18 months since I saw the film.'' </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010425.0147 type=story > <HEADLINE> MILES PLUGS INTO VALLEY BOYS' POLITICAL NETWORK </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-BOOK-DEMOCRATS-BOS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz

You know it all, you do, you have all the answers. But, unfortunately, success and tremendous accolades and access and people basically catering to your whims can distort your values.

And, I think, a lot of people would admit that that's a little bit of an interest; not so much wanting to see someone die, but seeing these cars crash at 200 miles per hour is exciting.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, I think,	 ``It's definitely a double-edged sword,'' Schneider says, calling from his Austin home. ``It gets the name out there. On the other hand, people are like, `That's the only reason we're hearing about him,' and I understand why people react like that. Sometimes I'm like that. Any time I see someone's name in bold print before I know what they're about, I think, `They must (be lousy.)' It's a shallow attitude, but I can't say I haven't been there myself.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz

The price, installed, is from $16 to $20 a foot; better-quality fences carry a 30-year warranty. (Some homeowners might be able to save money by attaching two sides of mesh fencing to the permanent perimeter fencing, forming an ``L'' of removable fencing and saving half the cost.) </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz

, I think,	 That these place-particular songs were appealing to Icelandic listeners at precisely a time when Sigur Ros was mesmerizing European rock sophisticates _ and major-label execs _ as an opening act for Radiohead on its big tour last summer is evidence, I think, of a globalization more complicated and more hopeful than the dark prophets of a looming imperial pop-monoculture would have us believe. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz
, he said,	 Over a couple of beers Arni Matthiasson, for 15 years the music critic of Iceland's leading daily paper, patiently explained how his city emerged as an internationally recognized rock-music laboratory. It really went back to the early 1980s, he said, when the members of Sigur Ros were toddlers and punk hit Reykjavik.

Harvey Weinstein had told me he thought Schnabel could be a ``major, major director,'' though he doubted that a studio would give Schnabel much more than $20 million for a movie. Bigger budgets, he said, require a director who can ``homogenize'' his or her vision. </P> 	nyt_eng_200104.gz

The street outside was dark, with not a single light to be seen, nothing but the iron grates pulled down tight in front of what surely were the shabbiest, seediest-looking shops in London. ``You have reached your destination,'' it insisted, this time, I thought, with a touch of impatience. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"90916"	"I"	"thought"	" I left the festival thoroughly satisfied and planning to enjoy the spring and summer winds at home. A few miles north, I stopped at the site of Orville and Wilbur's flight.

"92108"	"I"	"thought"	" She's got a point, I thought. My chance for becoming a prodigy had passed, and I was still doing nothing about what I once thought of as my greatest passion. I was in my late 20s, surely an adult, I thought, and so I ought to find myself an adult profession.

"92589"	"I"	"thought"	" As a young rebel without a cause, I particularly liked to downshift a car with a nice set of pipes so the engine compression would cause a series of backfires.

He is still quite conservative on a lot of issues.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"

It was so horrible I had never seen anything like it before. At first, I thought, `No, these people are just joking to get free entrance into the stadium, but when I saw they weren't moving, I said, `Oh God, what has happened?' '' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"93275"	"they"	"thought"	" When the Irish imagined the inclusion of millions of Polish farmers ``with two cows apiece'' in the European Union, Coughlan said, they thought, ``Our money would be going to farmers, but it wouldn't be going to Irish farmers, it would be going to Polish farmers.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"93458"	"I"	"thought"	" ``Halama pitched well, I thought,'' Bochy said. ``We only had one pretty good chance with the bases loaded.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"93514"	"I"	"thought"	" ``Things never got that bad. We limited the damage to one club,'' said Chris Wall, who has invited his brother back for a return engagement as his caddie at the Open. ``But it was kind of weird. When I heard a `pop' and saw the clubhead fall to the ground, I thought, `Oh, boy.' But we got in. We beat the odds.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"93671"	"I"	"thought"	" Several months later, he was back after a protracted bout of chest pain. He said he was not doing well. His angina was becoming more frequent and more severe, and it was often accompanied by an oppressive sensation of breathlessness. He was regularly popping nitroglycerin.

"95183"	"I"	"thought"	" ``I met Ryan briefly,'' she recalls, ``and then we went our separate ways and were mostly talking on the phone. Suddenly I decided to fly across country to see him.

If I could make her laugh, I reasoned, endorphins would be released in her body to ameliorate her pain.

The real drama for me, though, came in a private online connection. Using newly acquired e-mail addresses, I was at last able to express condolences to my best friends from kindergarten on the tragic death of their little brother last summer.

If you have questions, please call Susie McBee or Tim Spence at 202-298-6920.  For Thursday:  INTERNATIONAL NEWS (``i'' category)  AFGHAN-WEATHER (Kahoja Dahauddian, Afghanistan) _ If U.S. military forces deploy to this region, its most formidable foe won't be the Taliban. It will be the weather. Blinding sandstorms that engulfed this town in rebel-held territory this week are not uncommon throughout the country. Wind-whipped sand sometimes blocks the sun and brings air travel to a halt. By JIM MICHAELS. (Already filed.)  WASHINGTON NEWS (``w'' category)  TERROR-ECONOMY (Washington) _ President Bush and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill unveil an emergency proposal for up to $75 billion in added federal spending and tax breaks to lift the economy from a threatened recession aggravated by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. By STEWART M. POWELL. (Already filed.)  OLYMPIC-SECURITY (Washington) _ Organizers of the 2002 Winter Olympics were planning to spend $265 million on security before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States. Now the Salt Lake City organizers are asking congressional leaders for millions more to guard against terrorism. By KATHRYN A. WOLFE.  TERROR-BIOCHEMICAL (Washington) _ Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson tells Americans to be calm about any prospects of a biochemical attack. But he also warns that people should be vigilant and check any unusual cold symptoms with a doctor. By JUDY HOLLAND. (Already filed.)  TERROR-WORKERS (Washington) _ Aviation workers, saying they were left out of a $15 billion bailout for the airline industry, urge Congress to pass a separate relief package to help more than 100,000 people in their industry who have lost their jobs. Several lawmakers support their pleas. By DAVID EGGERT. (Also filed in ``f'' category.)  NATIONAL NEWS (``a'' category)  BUS-ATTACK (Undated) _ A Greyhound bus crashes after one of the passengers slit the driver's throat, killing six of the 38 people aboard and prompting Greyhound to temporarily halt all service nationwide as a precaution. The response to this attack and crash, while apparently not linked to terrorism, was amplified by the aerial attacks three weeks ago. By MICHAEL HEDGES.  STOLEN-FLAGS (Kent, Wash.) _ Is this a sign of our times? A national cemetery south of Seattle is reporting that professional-like burglars managed to get into its secure premises and steal 38 American flags that had draped the coffins of veterans and were donated to the cemetery by their families. By ELAINE PORTERFIELD. (Already filed.)  DRUGS-HEROIN (Undated) _ The U.S.-led war on terrorism will initially target Islamic extremists based in Afghanistan _ but law enforcement sources say an important battle will be combatting the lucrative heroin trade that fuels key terrorist groups. By BILL WALLACE. (Already filed.)  TERROR-ARMY (Fort Bragg, N.C.) _ The war against the terrorists, President Bush says, will be a war like no other and to fight it, the United States has an Army like no other in its history. The U.S. Army is smaller, older, smarter than it was even 10 years ago. It is more like a family (half the soldiers are married) and it is more at peace with itself. But there are few soldiers around today with the ultimate military experience _ combat. By CARL NOLTE.  TERROR-BROADWAY (New York) _ Broadway is springing back to life, the lights are back on and the theaters are filling back up. By ERIC BRAZIL.  BATHTUB-SLAYINGS (Houston) _ A district judge sets a Jan. 7 trial date for Andrea Pia Yates, who is accused of drowning her five children in the bathtub. Last month, a jury found the 37-year-old mother competent to stand trial on capital murder charges. By CAROL CHRISTIAN.  JAILED-JOURNALIST (Houston) _ The federal government's decision to imprison self-described journalist Vanessa Leggett sends the wrong message to a world that looks to the United States as a beacon of free speech, a South American media advocate says after meeting with the writer. Leggett was jailed more than a month ago for refusing to turn over to a federal grand jury taped recordings of her interviews with a suspect in a murder trial. By EDWARD HEGSTROM.

COMMENTARY (``k'' category)  HELEN-THOMAS (Washington) _ I don't think you'll be hearing President Bush attack the federal government or bash Washington bureaucrats again any time soon. The world has changed for him, as it has for all of us. More than ever, he needs a strong government in Washington. By HELEN THOMAS. (Already filed.)  For Sunday:  WASHINGTON NEWS (``w'' category)  TERROR-BIN-LADEN (Washington) _ Osama bin Laden views the United States as a weak and decadent nation whose armed forces suffer from what he once described as ``low spiritual morale.'' Terrorism experts say that in launching the Sept. 11 attacks, bin Laden expected either a withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Gulf region, or a U.S.-led air war that would be ineffective and indiscriminate in its casualties. That, he thought, would lead the Arab world to unite against America. By DAN FREEDMAN. (2ndl-writethru filed.)  COMMENTARY (``k'' category)  THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ There are times when the best politics is to be non-political. This is one of those times _ when Americans expect their leaders to band together in a non-partisan manner. Al Gore and Bill Clinton have, in recent weeks, abided by the axiom that politics stops at the water's edge. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON.

"100831"	"he"	"thought"	" As a seasoned housekeeper, Lucille Francis took immense pride in polishing the brass and vacuuming the much-trod carpets of Windows on the World on the 107th floor of 1 World Trade Center. She always insisted that her rooms be as perfect as the view. And although she was scheduled to come to work at 9 a.m. on Sept. 11, ``she went in early as usual,'' said Joseph, the oldest of her four sons. In fact, he thought, she should not have gone in at all: She had insisted on working the week before despite a bout of the flu, and the previous Thursday her boss had demanded she go home, telling her, ``Don't come back until you're ready,'' Joseph Francis said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"

"101485"	"she"	"thought"	" Many of the letters had religious references, typically a red flag for officials in a school system that did not even require the Pledge of Allegiance until last month. But Ginsberg said the letters brimmed with such kindness and curiosity that she shared them with students and encouraged them to respond. If nothing else, she thought, it could be a valuable geography lesson for the PS 82 students, many of whom immigrated from Bangladesh, El Salvador, Guyana and other countries but have rarely set foot outside New York City since coming to the United States. So last month, PS 82 students with names like Naresh, Sufian and Keiona mailed responses to Arkansas children named Danielle, Tiffany and Jedidiah.

I walked outside, and at that exact moment the shuttle flew over, an orange tail of fire trailing behind a bright point of light. In some ways, it impressed me even more than the meteor shower. There are humans inside that fireball, I thought, astronauts who have seen the Earth from above, and now they are coming home unscathed. What an amazing world we live in. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"102083"	"I"	"thought"	" But bristlingly accurate and even dangerous as Breillat's film is,  its ending, I thought, was a disappointing cop-out.

"103670"	"I"	"thought"	" When Jennifer Star, 32, an executive recruiter, was shopping last year for an apartment on the Upper East Side, she never considered a prewar building. She eventually found a 1,000-square-foot one-bedroom place with an alcove in a white-brick building for $350,000; the seller was a rabbi who had inherited the place from an older unmarried woman in his congregation who had lived there since the 1960s. ``Who thinks of a prewar anymore?'' Star said. ``You adjust your tastes completely. This apartment was totally a mess when I first saw it. I wound up gutting it completely.

Hopkins, the chief financial officer of Lucent _ and, she thought, chief executive-in-waiting _ who was ousted last May, essentially for being perceived as too pushy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"103868"	"I"	"thought"	" Sharon said his chief goal as prime minister has been to achieve peace. ``There was one thing I wanted to accomplish: to reach a political settlement which will lead to peace with the Palestinians and the rest of the Arab world,'' he said. ``That, I thought, would be the last thing I would do in a political life. Then I would have been glad to go back to the farm, ride the horses.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"103924"	"I"	"thought"	" ``We got lucky,'' admits Stehlin. ``The thought of being on stage with him was such an exciting possibility, but because of the immense success he's been enjoying, I thought, 'Who knows if it will ever happen?' A guy like that could be called away at any minute by somebody making a movie.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"104034"	"I"	"thought"	" ``To make the big money, though, you're working nights and weekends ... you get burned out,'' said Gehrke, 41, of Carrollton. ``You're constantly stressed out. Looking back, I thought, `How did people deal with me?' '' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"104125"	"I"	"thought"	" ``When I read that, I thought, My gosh, he's going from the frying pan to the pot,'' said Roloff, who is aware of Henry's problems in Florida. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"104168"	"I"	"thought"	" No need this time to cross far away from the main border post at Chaman, Pakistan. No need to go undercover wearing a full ``burqa'' veil to disguise my nationality. There would be no dead bodies on the way this time. No armed guards at the Kandahar airport confusing my interpreter for an enemy Arab. This time, I thought, it would be smoother. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"104172"	"I"	"thought"	" No need this time to cross far away from the main border post at Chaman, Pakistan. No need to go undercover wearing a full ``burqa'' veil to disguise my nationality.

"104188"	"I"	"thought"	" ``Jason, I thought, was huge,'' Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. ``He just gave us the confidence. He played like a great player. A lot of kids put up numbers in other games. He put them up in a great game. It takes a great player to do that. He's a great player.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"104194"	"I"	"thought"	" ``By the sixth or seventh session, I thought, 'Hmmm ... they're in pretty deep now,' '' says the star of CBS' ``Everybody Loves Raymond.'' ``It was only after about the 10th session that I started feeling OK because at that point, they had no other choice.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"104195"	"I"	"thought"	" So, I thought, the day's count was a fox sparrow, a pair of hawks, some mergansers and a kingfisher _ worthy birds all. No doubt colder weather will soon send eagles to nearby waters. Nonetheless, a small twist on an old song makes good advice for any bird-watcher, ``If you can't see the one you love, love the one you see.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"104196"	"I"	"thought"	" ``By the sixth or seventh session, I thought, 'Hmmm ... they're in pretty deep now,' '' says the star of CBS' ``Everybody Loves Raymond.'' ``It was only after about the 10th session that I started feeling OK because at that point, they had no other choice.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"104410"	"I"	"thought"	" A friend and I recently traveled from upstate New York to lend our support to New York City. After enjoying a play and some great food, we took a taxi to Pennsylvania Station to catch a train home to Utica. Unfortunately, I left my pocketbook in the cab, which we chased but were unable to catch. A police officer reported what had happened, to another officer in a passing patrol car, and that, I thought, would be the end of that. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"104640"	"I"	"thought"	" But there was one aspect of being rich that really appealed to me: the personal assistants. Real luxury, I thought, was having someone on hand to cut red tape for you, manage your schedule and sweat life's administrative details (not to mention come to your home and teach you the computer). </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"105035"	"we"	"thought"	" In late March, she gave birth to three kittens: Cicero, called Cis; his brother, Fat Boy, which was my favorite; and a female we dubbed Fluffy because she alone had a long and luxurious coat. We kept the little family in a box in the bathroom, safe, we thought, from predators, but we hadn't counted on the most deadly threat of all. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"105053"	"I"	"thought"	" ``So I just said to myself, `Who are my fans?,' '' Johnson says. ``It's young girls. Then I said to myself, `How can I get this to them?' Best way, I thought, was ``take'' it to them.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"105284"	"he"	"thought"	" Until that fateful kick Warner had, he thought, overcome a thumb injury that he reinjured ``three or four times'' during the game. He had, he thought, overcome two interceptions. He was looking forward to the Rams' next possession. Instead, he watched the Patriots drive down the field and celebrate a world championship, a painful sight to his eyes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"105335"	"I"	"thought"	" In the afternoon he had still not called. I began to call him. There was no one at home and no one at work. Neither of the two emergency rooms closest to his home had heard of him. I knew he lived alone. At the end of the day, I thought, I would call the police. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"105644"	"I"	"thought"	" ``I was raised to avoid the dependency thing at all costs,'' Olson went on. ``And what I learned is that the only thing worse is independence. I was a poster child for it. Finally, I thought, `What have I proven?' My generation went out of the gate full tilt, propelled to have a career, and for some number maybe that choice didn't reflect who we were. I felt very propelled by my mother's frustration. She was meant to be a warrior, and my father was uncomfortable with the idea of her working. I would have just liked to have had 10 kids.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"

It was Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford. For Oxfordians, this is the answer to ``Who Wrote Shakespeare?'' It is a position long argued, and one that has gathered momentum in recent years. Most of the academic world has ignored the authorship question for generations, or belittled it as the obsession of idiosyncratic amateur scholars, while building altars in students' minds to the image the tragedian David Garrick promoted during the 1769 Shakespeare jubilee that created the Stratford tourism business: the man of humble origins who rose to the top of the literary pantheon. The vast majority of academics still subscribe to that belief. By William S. Niederkorn.  With photo.  THEATER-SHAKESPEARE (Los Angeles) _ The debate over who actually wrote Shakespeare's works is not generally a laughing matter. For the most part, literary scholars soberly consider and reconsider the scant details of Shakespeare's life, hoping they can finally prove, or disprove, his links to what many consider the greatest plays in Western literature. But the playwright Amy Freed has opted for a different approach; she has found humor in the authorship debate. Her comedy ``The Beard of Avon,'' which received its premiere last June at South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa, Calif., and closes Feb. 10 at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, portrays Shakespeare as a dim but determined bumpkin who abandons country life in Stratford for the excitement of London. By David Mermelstein.  With photo.  FILM-SHAKESPEARE (Undated) _ Into the ``who was Shakespeare'' fray now comes a documentary film _ Michael Rubbo's ``Much Ado About Something,'' which opens on Feb. 13.  FILM  FILM-COLLATERAL-DAMAGE (Undated) _ The Arnold Schwarzenegger revenge picture ``Collateral Damage,'' which opens on Feb. 8 had its original release date in November postponed when Warner Brothers executives speculated that the sight of the hero's wife and young son being blown up by terrorists would be in poor taste. That it would be in poor taste at any other time probably hadn't occurred to them _ and why should it have? It might turn out that, far from being traumatized by the horrors of ``Collateral Damage,'' audiences will find themselves reassured to see terrorist attacks on American soil framed in so familiar a way: as more grist for an endless stream of movies that use the murder of women and children to justify wanton vigilante retribution. By David Edelstein.  With photo.  DANCE  DANCE-MONTREAL-BALLET (Montreal) _ When Gradimir Pankov arrived from Europe two years ago to be the artistic director of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens de Montreal, he found a company beset with problems. Morale was low among its 35 dancers. The company had endured a decade of cutbacks in an effort to eliminate a roughly $600,000 deficit. Audiences were shrinking despite a generally well-danced repertory of short works by internationally acclaimed choreographers. Then 60, Pankov, at an age when many are planning to retire, began immediately to transform the 45-year-old company. By Linde Howe-Beck.  THEATER  THEATER-BEA-ARTHUR (New York) _ ``I figured since I'm not going to retire, because I'm old'' _ Bea Arthur deliberately raised the volume on that last word _ ``that rather than wait around for the next great role, which may or may not ever come around again, I thought, well, we'll do this.'' Arthur, 78, is alluding to her show ``Bea Arthur on Broadway: Just Between Friends,''which began previews on Jan. 29 and opens Feb. 17 at the Booth Theater for a six-week run. By Anita Gates.

Newton spent much of his life trying to escape the constricting labels of ``hero'' and ``criminal'' affixed to him by both political friends and political enemies. So it's no surprise that ``A Huey P. Newton Story,'' which will be broadcast by PBS on Feb. 13 at 9 p.m. to commemorate the 60th anniversary of his birth (on Feb. 17), is a work that defies categorization. By Ron Jenkins.  PHOTOGRAPHY  PHOTOGRAPHY-CHIC-CLICKS (Boston) _ You might think ``but is it art?'' is as outdated a question as ``is the bride a virgin?,'' but don't be too sure. The Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston puts an up-to-the-minute slant on the first question in ``Chic Clicks: Creativity and Commerce in Contemporary Fashion Photography,'' on view through May 5.

Arthur, 78, is alluding to her show ``Bea Arthur on Broadway: Just Between Friends,''which began previews on Jan. 29 and opens Feb. 17 at the Booth Theater for a six-week run. By Anita Gates.  With photo NYT48.  MUSIC  ROCK-STARS-REDUX (Undated) _ Aging rock stars have long chased younger audiences, of course, often hiring producers half their age. But this kind of strategic repurposing _ the selling of postrelevance _ is something new. By John Leland. with photo NYT50.  OPERA-TITLES (Undated) _ Supertitles: salvation, or the end of opera as we used to know it? By Matthew Gurewitsch. With photo NYT49.  MUSIC-SAN-FRANCISCO (San Francisco) _ The San Francisco Symphony Orchestra has become increasingly exciting during Michael Tilson Thomas' seven-year tenure as music director. In a city that prizes mavericks, Thomas, at 57, has found a congenial home. By James R. Oestreich.  TELEVISION  TV-HUEY-NEWTON (Undated) _ Huey P. Newton spent much of his life trying to escape the constricting labels of ``hero'' and ``criminal'' affixed to him by both political friends and political enemies. So it's no surprise that ``A Huey P. Newton Story,'' which will be broadcast by PBS on Feb. 13 at 9 p.m. to commemorate the 60th anniversary of his birth (on Feb. 17), is a work that defies categorization. By Ron Jenkins.  PHOTOGRAPHY  PHOTOGRAPHY-CHIC-CLICKS (Boston) _ You might think ``but is it art?'' is as outdated a question as ``is the bride a virgin?,'' but don't be too sure. The Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston puts an up-to-the-minute slant on the first question in ``Chic Clicks: Creativity and Commerce in Contemporary Fashion Photography,'' on view through May 5.

(Coded `t')  COVER STORIES  TRAVEL-CALIF-DESERT (Undated) _ March is the time to catch the wildflower bloom in this vast desert state park in Southern California. By Lisa Fugard.  INSIDE THE SECTION  AIRLINE-FOOD (Undated) _ Eat up before boarding. What used to be lunch may now be a bag of pretzels. By Mark Bittman with Susan Catto.  TRAVEL-LOS-ANGELES (Los Angeles) _ The Venice and Santa Monica neighborhoods of Los Angeles have sand, surf, dining and shopping for the budget-minded traveler. By Daisann McLane. with photos NYT 29, 30 and 31.  TRAVEL-BRITAIN-MILLS (London) _ When Britons look back on the Industrial Revolution that spread their influence and their empire, they reserve a special place for the textile mill _ the clattering red brick institution that, along with railways and smokestacks, became the emblem of the nation's new and global economic power in the 19th century. By Alan Cowell.  REGULAR FEATURES  TRAVEL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Lead item: Baseball fans unable to wait for opening day on March 31 can catch their favorite Major League teams at spring training camps in Florida and Arizona from Feb. 27 through March. Older fans can take part in one of Elderhostel's spring training programs in either state. In addition to taking in preseason games, participants have the opportunity to learn about various aspects of baseball from retired players and coaches, league executives, and sportswriters and broadcasters.  CYBER-TRAVEL (Undated) _ More single travelers are looking for companions on the Web. By Bob Tedeschi.  TRAVEL-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Travel questions and answers on paying bills while away from home, archaeological tours in Cyprus and freighter travel between Marseille and Barcelona. By Paul Freireich.  PRACTICAL-TRAVELER (Undated) _ Missed your connection? It could take you a while to get the next one. By Susan Stellin.  TRAVEL-BARGAINS (Undated) _ Special prices on rail travel come in the form of passes and tours, in North America and Europe. By Joseph Siano.  FINANCIAL  (Coded `f')  (Coded `f')  ON THE COVER  ENRON-REFORM (Undated) _ Nothing's perfect, including Corporate America, and Enron has revealed several areas that need policy fixes in areas, including the SEC; accounting practices; 401(k) and pension plans; banking regulation/Glass-Steagall issues; energy regulation; corporate governance; regulation/oversight of derivatives; restrictions on analysts; securities litigation. Various writers assess different aspects of the Enron debacle and need for reform. WITH GRAPHIC.  MARKET-WATCH (New York) _ Since Enron imploded, it has become clear that an investor did not have to own Enron shares to have been hurt by the scandal. Each revelation about Enron has fueled suspicions that Enron may not be an anomaly in Corporate America, that much greater risk resides in stocks today than investors had thought. So it is not surprising that stock prices have sunk. By Gretchen Morgensen. WITH GRAPHIC.  ADDITIONAL FEATURES  WHISTLEBLOWER-WOES (Undated) _ Sherron Watkins became an overnight icon of workplace integrity, celebrated as a corporate insider who had the courage to confront her boss about possible wrongdoing in high places. For warning Enron's chief executive last summer that the energy company could ``implode in a wave of accounting scandals,'' Watkins has been called a fearless upholder of business ethics. Other whistle-blowers should be so lucky. Though Watkins has been basking in the glow of the media's softest lights, experts say such hero treatment is far from the norm, and retaliation is likely. By Marci Alboher Nusbaum.  SIMULATED-MARKET-RESEARCH (South Pomfret, Vt.) _ MIT business students, participating in a mock stock exchange, received instant feedback from the wireless network that linked them. The students were not trading securities but the traits of various goods and services, like automobiles and ski resorts. The exercise was part of an effort to prove that simulated trading could answer that most basic of all product development questions: What do consumers want? By Barnaby J. Feder. WITH PHOTO NYT9.  AGGRESSIVE-JOBHUNTERS (Undated) _ Business specialists say the recession has created a new, onerous chore for corporate executives: coping with more intrusive, insistent pleas for work than ever before. ``All the rules of networking have flown out the window,'' said Andrea Nierenberg, a consultant. ``It's as if they've forgotten their manners.'' The most shocking aspect of the trend, experts say, is the experience level of the people who most often commit these networking faux pas: they are not scrappy, young executives, but senior-level ones who should know better. By Melinda Ligos.  CORPORATE-MUNI-BONDS (Undated) _ When Kmart filed for bankruptcy protection, more than $214 million in municipal bonds across the country went into default. The troubled bonds belong to a class of quirky securities issued by municipalities but dependent on corporations for their stream of payments. When corporate revenues falter, the bonds can decline in value. A.G. Edwards calls them ``corporate munis,'' and includes in the category industrial development bonds, like those issued for Kmart, as well as bonds to finance construction of projects for airlines. Many investors who thought they were holding safe, steady municipal bonds have had some unpleasant surprises. By Abby Schultz. WITH GRAPHIC.  DAYTRADER-BOOK-REVIEW (London) _ Thrillers blending business dealings and derring-do form a genre in their own right, and ``The Day Trader,'' by Stephen Frey, fits admirably into this high-octane niche. It is a tale of market-scams and murder with characters ranging from traders shorting stocks to table-dancers dealing in quite different commodities. By Alan Cowell.  INVESTING  INVEST-COMMODITIES (Undated) _ Stocks have recovered moderately well since the post-Sept. 11 sell-off, but commodities have not. That may be an opportunity for adventurous investors, for two reasons. One is that if the economy is set for a rebound, a rally could be in store because commodity prices are very low. The other is that commodities tend, over time, to move in the opposite direction of stocks, so they are a good way to bring diversification to a portfolio. By Jonathan Fuerbringer. WITH GRAPHIC.  INVEST-EUROPE (Undated) _ To stock investors, the United States has been a more rewarding place than Europe for several years. Since the market lows in September, however, Europe has begun to close the gap, and there is a consensus among market strategists in Europe and on Wall Street that European stocks will benefit more than domestic ones if the U.S. economy rebounds out of recession. By Conrad de Aenlle. WITH GRAPHIC.  INVEST-INSIGHT-DEFENSE (Undated) _ Howard A. Rubel, aerospace and defense analyst at Goldman Sachs, is interviewed about the industry and which companies are best positioned to benefit from President Bush's proposed increase in military spending. By Robert D. Hershey Jr.  INVEST-LIBERTY-ACORN (Undated) _ John H. Park, who runs the $100 million Liberty Acorn Twenty fund, isn't overly concerned about labels like growth and value. ``We'll buy whatever's out of favor,'' Parks said from his office in Chicago. ``We tend to shift between growth and value stocks depending on where they are in the cycle.'' Despite high fees, the fund has soundly beaten its peer group. By Carole Gould. WITH GRAPHIC.  COLUMNS  ECON-COLUMN (Undated) _ With surpluses giving way to deficits and the prospects evaporating for reducing the national debt, the debate over President Bush's budget will focus new attention on a fundamental difference between the two parties. Do budget deficits and rising debt inherently harm the economy by pushing up long-term interest rates? Or are deficits, and a reasonable level of debt, acceptable prices to pay for taking steps like cutting taxes that will help the economy in the long run? By Richard W. Stevenson. WITH GRAPHIC.  AUTOS  ABOUTCARS-INTERNET (Undated) _ A pesky reality that car-selling sites have struggled with since their inception: buyers use the Internet for research, but that the moment of truth tends to occur at their local dealers. By Catherine Greenman. WITH GRAPHIC.  AUTO-SHOW (Undated) _ Chicago's auto show is no longer the nation's pre-eminent industry gathering _ Detroit gets the spotlight now _ but the domestic manufacturers made themselves at home in the Windy City during previews last week.  STYLE  (Coded `L')  BROOKLYN-DATING (New York) _ For decades Brooklynites have put on their slinky best and commuted to Manhattan to visit clubs in the hope of meeting Mr. or Ms. Right. Now, in a reversal of the old bridge-and-tunnel migration, young Manhattanites discouraged by the sky-high expectations of the opposite sex in their home borough are dressing down, in faded jeans and vintage leather, and heading to bars and loft parties in Brooklyn. There, where lower rents have encouraged an influx of arty postcollegiates, dating success doesn't require a big bankroll or blinding beauty. Many young women in Manhattan have their own set of complaints about the warped expectations of men from their borough who think life is a hip-hop video with bikini-wearing girls and luxury cars. By Julia Chaplin.  WTC-DEPARTMENT-STORE (New York) _ To thousands of New Yorkers and visitors from abroad, Century 21, the discount department store near the World Trade Center, was retailing's holy of holies. Some still wax effusive about the store, calling it a shrine, a temple of style and a mecca. Their descriptions attest to a cultish devotion that it inspires even now, some five months after the Sept. 11 attacks forced it to close. Kim France, a magazine editor, observed: ``Once you had been there, there was never any going back to conventional shopping. It was the gold standard of stores like that.'' The eulogy is premature. Century 21 stands intact, cleared of dust and other debris, and ready to reopen this month. By Ruth La Ferla.  FASHION-FAUXPAS (New York) _ As Fashion Week gets under way, the tents will once again be packed with some of the world's most coolly chic women, joined skinny hip to hip before the catwalks. The famous editors and important retailers will look, to the outside world, impossibly well put together, but every one of them has had her moments of fashion shame and has spent as many anxious minutes throwing on different outfits in the morning as the average woman. Fashion faux pas: every woman has committed them. By Kate Betts.  FASHION-GHESQUIERE (New York) _ Nicolas Ghesquiere, the designer of Balenciaga, might just be fashion's most ambiguous star. That he is a star in that small world mainly comprised of editors and photographers is undisputed. His pencil-slim pants and eccentrically embellished tops, his lariat handbags and 1980s-style blouson jackets have been copied everywhere. And already there are waiting lists at stores for his springtime cargo pants, now done in a pastel mix of silk and corduroy and costing $1,000. He is showin in New York for the first time. By Cathy Horyn.  WITH PHOTO NYT10.  (Editors: All clients receive all budgets, but only full-service clients receive all stories.

The reporter, whom I'll call Yuri, didn't admit to being a spy, but his cover was transparent. Great, I thought, what better ``Deep Throat'' source could I find than a KGB agent?

TERROR-ITALY (Rome) _ The Italian police said they had arrested four Moroccans in possession of large quantities of the deadly poison cyanide and maps of Rome highlighting the U.S. Embassy and the city's water supply. The police said they are probing possible links to Osama bin Laden. By Melinda Henneberger.  TERROR-MEDIA (Washington) _ The Defense Department official in charge of the new Office of Strategic Influence defends its mission, saying that no Pentagon officials will be allowed to lie to the public or the press. But he leaves open the possibility that private firms could be contracted to spread disinformation overseas and says no one should be ``naive'' about the military's need to mislead the enemy during times of war, which includes the present. By James Dao.  MIDEAST (Dateline to come) _ Israel launched fierce reprisal attacks with warplanes, warships and helicopter gunships in pre-dawn raids on Wednesday, killing at least 15 Palestinians. The assaults hit Palestinian security installations across the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Officials in a village in the southern Gaza Strip said that the Israelis had begun house-to-house searches on Wednesday. By James Bennet.  ISRAEL-JEWISH-IDENTITY (Jerusalem) _ In a landmark decision on the question of who is a Jew, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that people who have undergone Conservative and Reform conversions to Judaism should be listed as Jews in the Israeli population registry. Until now only Orthodox conversions were recognized for registration purposes. The ruling was another step toward official recognition of the Conservative and Reform movements in Israel, and further chipped away at the influence of the Orthodox rabbinate here.

It was only a year ago, after retiring from the army and moving to the South of France, that Moulessehoul revealed his true identity. Now, he thought, he could at last savor the life of a writer.

It was only a year ago, after retiring from the army and moving to the South of France, that Moulessehoul revealed his true identity. Now, he thought, he could at last savor the life of a writer. But if Moulessehoul believed that his double life was over, he was wrong. By Alan Riding.  HELL-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``Hell to Pay,'' by George Pelecanos, reviewed by Janet Maslin.

But I started it as a political statement. We're materialistic in our houses, but we're also spiritually inclined. And in a magazine full of advice about where to buy the striped fabric, this is one place for open, heated conversation. Everything in life and in our houses is not perfect. We love the fantasy that it is, but it's not. My walls fall down; my kids leave garbage on the table. The turning point for me was when I couldn't take care of my garden anymore.

Perfect, I thought, we will have tacos; kids love tacos.

"114944"	"I"	"thought"	" The story begins and ends with her carrying out her husband's dying wishes. ``On a cold January morning before dawn, in the holy village of Rishikesh in northern India, I scattered Charles Mingus's ashes in the Ganges as he had asked me to do, immersing myself with them in the freezing river according to Hindu custom, certain that the raw air beneath the dark range of Himalayas was made for the life of the spirit and for reincarnation, as he believed,'' she begins. ``I walked to my one-room house on the Ganges, shivering and dripping water along the sand, and . . . imagined that one day I would nail a small sign above the entrance with his name and dates and the title of one of his tunes, `Tonight at Noon.' That was musician talk for time displacements on the gig, the topsy-turvy hours of work, an acknowledgment of a reversal in the order of things.

But when somebody else who's really skilled at defining your story tells it for you, they give it a lot more depth and a lot more content.

"116830"	"I"	"thought"	" I started at the Diamond Grille in Akron, my hometown, where I have been eating walleye since the Johnson administration, when I first noticed it lurking on a menu dominated by steaks. I went to grade school with Nick Thomas, the owner, a man of the old school who thinks nothing of taking orders and clearing tables on a busy night. Grille it may be, but not when it comes to walleye; the direct heat is too intense, Thomas told me. So his fish is quickly pan-fried, sauced with a bit of melted butter and served with lemon on the side. A perfect benchmark, I thought, for the fancier dishes to come: Would they succeed as well in catching the subtle essence of the walleye? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"

Bryan, the show's curator, who is chairwoman of Near Eastern studies at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. ``Most people are not aware how similar the ancient Egyptian beliefs were to those of the Judeo-Christian tradition. They believed in heaven and hell and that what you did when you were alive guided what would happen after death.

That method yielded slightly less juicy sausages, but it produced crunchy bits at the edges of the brats.

"119228"	"I"	"thought"	" I was in a group of 10 women, ranging in age from 21 to 30. We were a wide spectrum of athletic condition and natural talent. An assistant coach herded us from one drill to the next. ``Step up, ladies!'' he yelled, and we all got in line to run the 40 or do another suicide shuttle drill between sets of orange cones. It occurred to me what a wonder it was to hear ``ladies'' barked out on the 50-yard line, and not as an insult. This, I thought, is progress. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"

"120715"	"I"	"thought"	" The best way to eat at Nahm is to order the ``traditional Thai meal,'' which includes a half-dozen courses or more and costs $70, excluding drinks and tip. Miang som oo turned out to be a combination of crab and pomelo (the citrus ancestor of grapefruit), with roasted coconut and caramel dressing. It showed, I thought, how many different tastes we describe as sweet. A salad of squid, grilled pork and young ginger was equally unconventional _ savagely hot and sour. Hoi shenn pat khaa orn was more familiar, gentler and highly aromatic, a stir-fry of scallops with Thai basil. A thick, grainy red curry of beef, made from brisket, was reminiscent of Indonesian rendang. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"
"120819"	"I"	"thought"	" When I first heard abut this film, I thought, swell, another subject for one of those hoity-toity critics' contests in which writers try to out-exotic and out-obscure each other.

Minardi, who has two sons, was at the game with his 9-year-old, Vince. ``The last time there was a strike, in '94, it turned a lot of people away,'' Minardi said. ``It took Sosa and McGwire and Ripken to bring them back.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"

It is to Istanbul and to this company that Serebin is drawn for the sake of Tamara, an ailing former sweetheart, since he is deeply devoted to women. ``In this life, he thought, there is only one thing worth waking up for in the morning, and it isn't getting out of bed and facing the world.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"

That should have been, in my judgment, a wake-up call that terrorists would hit us on our own soil with devastating effect. Secondly, that was augmented by the attacks on the Prince Sultan barracks, and then, a few months later, the Khobar Tower barracks in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, the bombings of our embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, August 1998, about some two years, a year and a half later on the calendar, then the USS Cole, another year and a half later. You can see the pattern came about. So when September the 11th came, I thought, ``Gosh, this is _ this is a massive failure of intelligence.'' And why, why didn't we put information together? Were there bits and pieces of information, had it been shared or fused, by the CIA, NSA, FBI and other, DIA, other agencies? Could that possibly have thwarted or mitigated the attacks? ... </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"

NEW YORK _  Dear Diary:  I'm a recreation therapist at a hospital in Manhattan. An acquaintance brought me a large spray of rue from his back yard. I put it in a vase and admired it from time to time.  One day I noticed a black and yellow caterpillar on a stem. Then there was another one.  I looked them up in an insect book and discovered they were black swallowtail butterflies. The book said they ate parsley, but these guys looked very happy eating the bitter rue.  After a week or two, one morning I came in to see a large, greenish splat next to the vase and one missing caterpillar.  A few days later, another splat. I thought maybe the cumulative effect of the bitterness of the herb had done them in. I threw out the much-chewed-on bouquet.  A week, two weeks went by. I was working on a Sunday when I noticed movement by the window. I was dumbstruck by what I saw _ two 5-inch-wingspan, velvety black swallowtails in my office!  I just stared at them for several minutes and then decided they needed to be set free. I captured one, and before I released it I showed it to the security guard.  When I returned, I thought, ``Take a picture!'' I took a photograph of the other one among my windowsill treasures before I set it free, too. I found one empty chrysalis on the hidden side of a brown mailing tube _ I wonder where the other one is.  _ LINN SCHLAIFER  Overheard by Louise Heikes: A young woman on her cell phone, near the Great Lawn in Central Park at the start of a New York Philharmonic concert, obviously trying to find a friend: ``I'm standing near a tree!''  Dear Diary:  I mentor an 11-year-old girl through the 52nd Street Project, which matches children of Hell's Kitchen with professional actors. Like me, she loves to read, so I decided to take her on a tour of the libraries in Manhattan.  She had never been to the main public library on Fifth Avenue, so one day we went. I showed her the renovated reading room, the computerized catalogs and all the other wonderful things the library has to offer. I then topped it off by introducing her to Patience and Fortitude, the two stone lions on guard in front of the building.  I thought she was unimpressed with all of it, until one night when I invited her to my home for dinner. She told the other guest about our trip to the various libraries and especially the one to the main library. ``We saw the reading room,'' she said, ``and then we saw the two lions, Patience and Attitude.''  _ KIM SYKES  Dear Diary:  In the early '60s, I worked in Florida and took a few business trips to New York. One October, I was in the subway in my normal Florida get-up: a suntan and a light shirt. An elderly woman across the aisle quizzed me on why I was not wearing a coat, since it was rather cold.  I tried to explain Florida weather, but she would have none of it. Out of the side of her mouth, looking at me but directing her comment to the man next to her, she said, ``Harry, give the kid your coat.''  Harry was flabbergasted and protested that he needed his coat. She paid no attention and commanded, ``Harry, give the kid your coat; he needs it in this weather.''  As Harry started to struggle out of his coat, the subway stopped and I said, ``This is my stop, my hotel is just upstairs, and there's a store and I'll buy a coat.'' This seemed to satisfy the woman.  As I went out, Harry whispered, ``Thanks a lot, kid.''  _ LEO COLLINS  Dear Diary:  Observing children of the millennium always brings a smile to me.  While on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 15th Street, I saw a toddler (probably about 18 months old) in her stroller. Her executive-type mother was wheeling her toward the curb, where I was waiting for the light to change.  Without any sign from the pretty mother, the child raised her right hand and very loudly said, ``Taxi!''  _ GABRIELLA BUCCIERI  I FORGOT MY UMBRELLA!  I know it's raining out  Because the elevator smells like  Wet messenger.  _ JEFF MILES  Dear Diary:  After bringing in our luggage for a stay at my cousin's 20th-floor apartment in the East Village while he was away on vacation, my husband and I got locked in. I had casually turned the knob on the bottom lock, then couldn't open it. Mild panic set in while we struggled with the lock, imagining our week's stay shut in against our will. Pliers found in a drawer, used to force the inside knob, only made things worse.  Then my clever husband remembered Houdini and his motto of success: Locks are made to keep you out, not in. Screwdriver, please! Off came the lock plate and knob, and after a few careful wiggles of the interior mechanism we were free. Later, as my husband walked into a nearby hardware store, lock cylinder in hand, the clerk handed him a new lock from the shelf. Neither man uttered a word. Must happen all the time.  _ KATIE HAMMER  Dear Diary:  On my way home from work in the financial district, I stopped to buy a cantaloupe and a honeydew. I don't normally shop for these items downtown, because they're too heavy and bulky to take on the subway. But being in the mood for fruit salad, I bought them.  When I arrived at my train station at 96th Street, I lifted the bag and the honeydew rolled out. I watched in horror as it rolled all the way down the car (everyone laughed hysterically). As I made my way through the car, I noticed that the honeydew had stopped rolling under the feet of a man. As I approached him, he reached down, picked up the honeydew, put it into my bag and said, ``I prefer watermelon.''  _ VIVIAN ROSENBERG </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020922.0184 type=story > <HEADLINE> IN NEW JERSEY, SOME DRY TOWNS START TO THINK ABOUT GOING WET </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WILLINGBORO, N.J.

In the past few weeks, though, I have come to realize that the magazine itself takes a side in this argument, and is becoming the voice and the echo chamber of those who truly believe that John Ashcroft is a greater menace than Osama bin Laden.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"

The water was a bit brisk due to currents from Antarctica, and the waves breaking over the reefs were big, powerful, and daunting. Mastering these, we thought, must be like skiing the famed High Rustler at Utah's Alta resort at the end of a sunny day; you've got to have your wits about you.

"127638"	"we"	"thought"	" Vineyard-hopping in Margaret River could easily fill two weeks. A nice way to set a suitable pace, we thought, would be to bicycle around the region, as in Napa and Sonoma. Our stay was painfully brief; it was not even enough time for the espresso maker at the Urban Bean in Margaret River to start to know us, though I'm convinced a third visit would be all it would take. But if you can't stay a week or two and you're not prepared to move here, a couple of days is good enough to feel like you've left it all behind. Very, very far behind.

She sang of her heartbreak at learning her young son, from whom she separated at birth, had died. She sang of her plan to commit suicide, a way, she thought, to rejoin her son. Kanyova staggered among the tables of the convent's sick ward, fell to the floor, and raised herself again. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"

But it turned out that my luncheon companion, Pierre Veilletet, the voluble former editor of Sud-Ouest, Bordeaux's daily newspaper, wanted to make a point right away. The Bordelais, he said, ``think they invented the United States,'' because 18th-century Bordeaux was a forcing-bed for the Enlightenment, and Montesquieu, whose political ideas helped form the U.S. Constitution, served as president of the Bordeaux parliament. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"

"132229"	"I"	"thought"	" ``A View From the Bridge'' is also a New York opera, set in Red Hook, Brooklyn, with the lights of Manhattan as a backdrop. Its big-hit tune is a love song to New York, ``The New York Lights,'' which, appropriately, evokes more than a touch of Broadway in its composition. ``When the whole 9/11 thing was going on, I thought, too bad nobody knows this great aria,'' Malfitano said. ``They might have used it.'' And, she added, there was something moving _ ``a sense of profundity'' _ about doing the work in this city after the terrorist attacks.

NATIONAL  CONGRESS -- WASHINGTON -- The new Congress convenes Tuesday, the first in nearly 50 years to be under Republican control during a Republican presidency. In the short term, its task is to renew unemployment benefits and to provide fresh funds before a temporary budget resolution expires Saturday. The long-term agenda includes major social and economic legislation. (Shepard, Cox News Service)  WAN: Atlanta, National, U.S. Government  STROM-THURMOND -- EDGEFIELD, S.C. -- Outgoing Sen.

(Riddle, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution)  NC-REP-CLAYTON -- LITTLETON, N.C. -- When Eva Clayton entered Congress in 1993, she captured attention with her election as president of the 69-member Democratic freshman class. That election, combined with the notoriety she drew as North Carolina's first black woman in the House, left many wondering how high Clayton's star would rise on the national level. The 1994 election brought a Republican revolution to Congress, and Clayton's circumstances changed. As a member of the minority party, leadership opportunities faded, and Clayton's focus turned to farmers, rural residents and the poor. With her retirement from Congress becoming official last Friday, her work in those areas will be the legacy she leaves behind, political allies and analysts said.

TER-PRINTS -- WASHINGTON -- A fingerprint found on a gun in Montgomery, Ala., might have prevented -- or shortened -- the Washington-area snipers' spree. But it didn't because Alabama, like 30 other states, can't directly communicate with the nation's fingerprint computer. Now, as the nation turns its eye to homeland security, fingerprinting will be an important part of tracking would-be terrorists. A look at the National AIFIS fingerprint database, how expensive it is to hook up and why more states haven't done it.

BUSINESS  CREATIVE-RESUME -- ATLANTA -- You've followed all the resume rules: White- or buff-colored paper. Buzzwords and keywords galore -- and industry-specific, of course. Proper formatting for easy electronic scanning. Plenty of action words. And still that crafted-by-the-rules resume has turned up no interviews. Maybe it's time for a change, suggests Ralph Mobley, director of career services at Georgia Tech. Maybe it's time to get creative. (Mallory White, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.  LIFESTYLE  ALONE -- ATLANTA -- After her husband died in a plane crash also carrying golfer Payne Stewart, Dixie Fraley desperately sought solace. She neatly arranged the gold fish, meditation book and Bible she'd received from sympathetic friends. She joined a widows group. ``But I would hear more sad stories and I would leave with more sadness,'' said the 44-year-old Fraley. Besides her anguish, she felt overwhelmed by tax filings, legal issues and other details relating to selling her husband's successful business. What widows and other single women need, she thought, was not only a place to share their grief, but also a comfortable environment to get advice on practical issues.

NFK-BULLY -- ATLANTA -- Are you a bully or a bully's victim, or have you watched a bully pick on someone? Psychologists and teachers who study types of bullying -- which include teasing, rumor-spreading, name-calling, keeping others out of a group and trashing property -- say it's likely that you've been in at least one of these groups.

(Thompson, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.  TV-MOLE -- WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- ``The Mole'' is the Rodney Dangerfield of reality shows. It gets no respect. Survivor, while not as popular as it once was, still generates considerable watercooler buzz. Over 18 million viewers watched the first edition of ``The Bachelor.'' MTV's ``Real World'' has been on the air for, like, 35 years. ``Fear Factor'' continues to capture a sizable audience as does ``The Amazing Race.''

ROKY -- AUSTIN, Texas -- For decades, cult music icon Roky Erickson was practically paralyzed by schizophrenia. He played multiple televisions and radios at the same time. He rarely left home. His hair was wild, beard full, teeth rotten. Eighteen months ago -- over the objections of other family members -- his younger brother Sumner had Roky declared incompetent and became his legal guardian. Today, Roky is on his meds, has had his teeth fixed, and occasionally makes public appearances. Meanwhile, a movie, documentary and book about his life are in the works.

The show sold out in 24 hours.'' Helander's publisher recognized a hit. He asked the artist to make a different set of letters so that they could be made into prints.

ALPHABET-COLLAGE -- PALM BEACH, Fla. -- About five years ago, Bruce Helander made a set of collages based on the letters of the alphabet for a show at a West Palm Beach art gallery. ``Jane Buffett bought the B for Jimmy,'' Helander said. ``Someone else bought the C. The show sold out in 24 hours.'' Helander's publisher recognized a hit. He asked the artist to make a different set of letters so that they could be made into prints. Helander created two print editions, which have been exhibited in more than 19 one-man shows across the country. (Sjostrom, Palm Beach Daily News) 22. MOVED.  COW-SCULPTURE -- PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Zach and Marilyn Morfogen were having a get-together recently at their home in Palm Beach. While other guests munched sandwiches, olives and cheese, Zach Morfogen led his neighbor Martin Karlin to the balcony to meet the star attraction. There, with her big eyes framed by curly eyelashes, stood a life-sized sculpture of a Holstein cow. Zach Morfogen commissioned the cow in 1991 from artist Henry Loustau as a present to his wife for their 35th anniversary. (Sjostrom, Palm Beach Daily News) 26. MOVED.

Yet Governor Gray Davis will be subject to a recall election on Oct. 7. He ought to prevail, not because he has been an effective governor but because a victory for him would discourage further attempts to destabilize state government.  California's political society was far simpler in 1911 when Governor Hiram Johnson inserted the recall provision into the state Constitution along with for initiative petitions allowing voters to make laws. Johnson felt that the biggest problem facing the state was control by the railroads. Once their power was reduced, he thought, voters could be counted upon to act wisely.  That might have made sense in 1911, when California was more homogeneous and lightly populated with 3.4 mise.  Instead, California gets democracy by blunt plebiscite. Once the voters approved Proposition 13 in 1978 to limit property taxes, they put a straitjacket on local government and discouraged the state from raising other taxes by requiring approval by a two-thirds majority in the Legislature.  Davis, already unpopular for his handling of California's electricity crisis, won reelection last year mainly because he financed an ad campaign to block his strongest rival from winning the Republican nomination. This year he deserves the voters' scorn for failing to put aside enough money during the Internet boom to cushion the blow of the recession.  The same could be said about New York's George Pataki, Massachusetts's Paul Cellucci (had he not resigned to become US ambassador to Canada), and no doubt other governors. Hiram Johnson's recall amendment, which has never been$ucgd against a statewide official in California, ought to be reserved for malfeasance, not miscalculation.  Unless the California Supreme Court discovers fraudulent signatures on the recall petitions, voters will be able to reject Davis on Oct. 7 and on the same ballot choose a replacement from a long list of candidates, almost all Republicans. A new governor could be chosen with a fraction of the 3.1 million votes Davis gained as a Democrat in the 2002 final election.  The California Senate is working on an agreement to close a $38 billion budget gap. This would require further negotiations and more revenue in succeeding years. Davis should be trying to solve this crisis, not fighting for political survival. The recall is a distraction as the state faces a financial shortfall that dwarfs anything that politicians of the Hiram Johnson era could have envisioned. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20030724.0052 type=advis > <HEADLINE> FORGOTTEN FAMILIES </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 07-24-03 19:16:00EDT (BC-EDITORIAL-CHILD-BOS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> President Bush showed his disdain for the working poor Thursday with his visit to a federal check processing center in Philadelphia from which the first batch of child tax credit checks will be mailed to middle-income families. To the 6.5 million families who aren't getting a check because their wages are too low, the photo op was an inauspicious reminder that the president recently signed a $330 billion tax cut that left them out.  Bush should correct the problem by insisting that the House and Senate work out their differences before the House leaves for summer vacation and give him a bill to sign that would extend child care tax credits to low-income families without further exploding the deficit.  A compromise proposal that three senators offered to House leaders on Tuesday would do more damage than good: a $50 billion, 10-year fix for a problem that requires $3.5 billion to repair. Under the proposal, higher-income families would get three times more in benefits than low-income families. Nearly $11 billion in new tax cuts would go to families with incomes exceeding $110,000; just $3.5 billion would go to the working poor.  House Democrats were right this week to object to that proposal and use one of the few toore credits to the working poor. These families should never have been excluded from the tax cut to begin with. Republicans who argue the fact that low-wage earners do pay regressive payroll taxes, property taxes, and sales taxes.  Despite soaring prosperity for some, it is still easy to work full-time in America and not earn $27,000 _ $519 a week. Indeed, those left out of the child tax benefit include millions of hard-working waitresses, farm workers, health aides, cabdrivers, and secretaries, according to the Children's Defense Fund.  The most sensible solution is for Bush to press for the bill the Senate approved in early June. It would provide $10 billion for child tax credits for the working poor paid for through Customs Department fees charged to process passengers and merchandise. The House-passed bill is laughable; it proposes to solve the problem by adding $82 billion over 10 years to the deficit, mostly through additional tax cuts for the wealthy, and does not raise offsetting revenue.  For the next three Fridays, some 25 million Americans will be receiving $400 rebate checks for each child. The checks will bear the phrase: ``Tax relief for America's families.'' The only way the working poor can truly be considered part of the American family is if they, too, receive those checks. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20030724.0053 type=story > <HEADLINE> Compensation picture to change </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> ATLANTA  (BC-OPTIONS-0727-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200307.gz"

They cheerfully dubbed the property _ the site of an annual hippie baking contest and fair during the 1960s _ Cheesecake, and proceeded to plan a Utopian weekend community where they would eventually live together over time, sharing common living spaces, a kitchen and library with individual bedrooms they could call their own.

NEW YORK -  Dear Diary:  I was at a hip New York bar recently celebrating my boyfriend's birthday.  At the table next to us were a group of out-of-towners discussing their plans to visit the Empire State Building the following day.  Needing help with transportation, one of the women turned to our party and said, ``Do y'all ride the subway?''  Before we could answer, she asked a follow-up question: ``Oh, wait, are y'all from here?''  Our group replied in unison, ``Yes.''  The thoughtful tourist paused for a moment and then quickly rephrased her question: ``Excuse me, do youse guys ride the subway?''  - JAMIE L.

Ahead of her was a tall, well-dressed woman with a strong Midwestern accent. She was ordering her breakfast bagel and clearly didn't want much cream cheese on it.  The Hispanic man behind the counter looked puzzled as the customer's nasal twang requested ``a sesame bagel with just a teensy, weeensy, weeeeensy bit of low-fat cream cheese, please.''  After saying several times in a strong Latino accent, ``I don't understand,'' the counterman looked even more perplexed.  The woman mimed the universal finger and thumb sign for just a little bit as she repeated slowly and patiently, ``A little, teensy bit of cream cheese.''  Suddenly, the man's face lit up. ``Ah!'' he said. ``You want a schmeer!'' - TONY AND SARA SOLL  Dear Diary:  Being a teacher and writer of Irish Gaelic - a minority language even in Ireland - and new to the New York area, I was Eagur to find out if there were other Irish speakers in the city. I found, to my delight, that a group met regularly in a Midtown bar.  Having first arranged by e-mail to meet them, I arrived at the bar and scanned the clientele. Indeed, around a table was a group deep in conversation, and I asked them in Irish if I could join them. ``Why not?'' came the reply in Irish, and I sat down with them and ordered a drink. It seemed strange to me that none of their names were familiar, but they seemed more than happy to talk to me, if a little puzzled.  After five minutes of inconclusive stop-start conversation, however, one of them finally asked me why I, a total stranger, had joined their group.  Beginning to realize my error, and somewhat embarrassed, I looked around the bar again. This time, behind a screen in the restaurant at the end of the bar, I found my Internet colleagues on their second bottle of wine and amazed to learn that I had, quite by accident, blundered into another group of Irish speakers.  The first group, no less astonished, came up to us before they left the bar and, amid much laughter, we wondered how many more of us were lurking around the city's corners.  - BRIAN O'BROIN  Dear Diary:  Updating Blanche DuBois, I am learning to depend on the kindness and generosity of computers. During a recent trip to New York, to maintain propriety, I found I needed a new belt, size 34. To gird /y midsection, I headed south of Midtown to what may be America's best-known department store.  I found a suitable belt, marked $27.50, and carried it to a nearby clerk. He turned to the computer and scanned the belt's bar code. Doing a small double take at the readout, surprised but dutiful, he said, ``It reads, `1 cent.''' And that's what I paid for the new belt, a penny. The receipt states, ``Total Amount Due Store $0.01,'' and the employee was trained to obey electronic commandments.  As I left, the clerk said, ``I think I should get me one of those belts.''  - ROY MEADOR </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20040202.0001 type=story > <HEADLINE> GOV.

"140060"	"she"	"thought"	" The cover story is an excerpt from Bob Colacello's forthcoming book Ronnie and Nancy: Their Path to the White House. You'll read about the saga of the late president and his lady from their first meeting to their marriage in 1952. In 1949, Reagan was in a deep funk. He and actress Jane Wyman had divorced a year earlier, and his personal life was a shambles. Although he was president of the Screen Actors Guild, his film career was on the skids. That fall, a friend of Reagan asked him, as SAG chief, to defend new starlet Nancy Davis against claims that she was -- incredibly, it seems now -- a Communist sympathizer. After he cleared her of any leftist affiliations, Nancy asked to meet him. When she entered the room, she thought, This is wonderful. He looks as good in person as he does on the screen. Soon they had their first date, and the rest, as they say, is history. Ronny and Nancy will be published in September. Check out, too, the profile of 24-year-old Texas-born pop star Jessica Simpson. Her mom claims she has an I.Q. of 160, somewhere in the Einstein range. I love being the labeled the ditz, Jessica says, explaining her tendency to blurt idiotic things. That was how I got the guys. Another piece looks at Anita Brenner, who posed for Edward classic 1925 photo Pear-Shaped Nude and served as a cultural bridge between Mexico and the United States. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"

We just hang out where they hang out, Rucker-Graves said. Close to the housing projects, close to the supermarket, close to the rescue mission. People who are most at risk know frighteningly little about the disease, the nurses say. Some young women were under the impression that condoms weren't necessary for oral sex because, they thought, oral sex was not really sex.

"142091"	"I"	"thought"	" (Terry Pace is the entertainment editor of the TimesDaily in Florence, Ala) </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20040902.0170 type=advis > <HEADLINE> EDITORS, PHOTOS ARE AVAILABLE OF JULIE BENZ IN THE CURRENT NYTRNG GRAPHICS FOLDER OF THE ART LIBRARY. ----- </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> ATLANTA, Ga. </DATELINE> <TEXT> Julie Benz spent eight years walking a fine line between the living and the dead.  Between memorable movie roles in Jawbreaker and As Good As It Gets, the versatile young actress originated the role of seductive, centuries-old bloodsucker Darla on television's supernatural cult favorite, Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  As the longtime lover of Angel -- a vampire-with-a-soul played by David Boreanaz -- both the character and the actress later crossed over to the show's eerie spinoff, Angel.  Over the course of the two series, the former ice dancer from Pittsburgh developed the complex, constantly changing Darla from an evil immortal into a sensitive, compassionate human being. The character made a dramatic and emotional exit from the franchise as the self-sacrificing mother of the first baby born to undead parents.  When you work with writers like Joss Whedon and David Greenwalt, they come up with such amazing ideas and you just go along for the ride, says Benz, one of the scheduled guests for Dragon Con, the annual science-fiction, fantasy and horror expo that begins Friday and continues through Monday in downtown Atlanta.  Playing Darla has been such an amazing roller-coaster ride, added Benz, who made her debut as Darla after losing the leading role of teenage vampire hunter Buffy to subsequent series star Sarah Michelle Gellar. The Darla character dates back to the Buffy pilot episode that aired in 1997.  At first I was just known as 'Vampire Girl,' and then I got a name, Benz explained in a phone interview. I died and was brought back to life, and then I had a baby and died again. Every time I died, I thought, 'This is it.' I couldn't see past what was put in front of me. I just don't think as big as the writers do.  Benz will be joined at Dragon Con by her husband of six years, John Kassir, perhaps best known for voicing the creepy Tales from the Crypt host known as the Cryptkeeper.  We have an amazing team going, Benz remarked. We're best friends and fellow actors, and we support each other through everything. For me, having a stable home life allows me to go out and take chances as an actress. He's my touchstone and my soulmate and he's a huge influence on my work. I feel very lucky to have the right person in my life.  Something for everyone  Each year's Dragon Con festivities -- which encompass two downtown hotels -- draw more than 30,000 fans of Buffy, Angel, Star Trek, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Doctor Who, The X-Files, Harry Potter, The Muppets and other aspects of sci-fi, horror, fantasy, comics, anime, music, art, space and science.  The thing that has put Dragon Con above all other Southern conventions is that it's put on by the fans and done for the fans, says Brooke Perry, a Florence, Ala.-based writer, actor, director, teacher and sci-fi and horror enthusiast who plans to attend this year's convention.  Everything is planned with the fans in mind, whether you're into 'Buffy,' 'X-Files,' 'Farscape,' 'Star Trek,' gory slasher films, 'Lord of the Rings,' classic horror, 'Star Wars,' whatever, Perry explained. There's something there for everyone who's a fan of the different genres.  Activities includes an independent film competition, an art show, a writing workshop, a costume contest, concerts and specialized programs with titles like Queer Eye for the Trek Guy: The Missing Minority, Elf Ears and Other Makeup Tips, Oh, Muse! Where Art Thou? and How to Make a Zombie (Or Anything Unreal) Real. There's even a Miss Klingon Beauty Pageant.  Last year was my first year at Dragon Con, noted Jason Behel, a University of North Alabama art student from Tuscumbia, Ala. I'm not like a Trekkie or anything, so I kind of had a preconceived idea about it. But I was really impressed, especially with the art show -- it was amazing.  Behel was so inspired by the pieces he saw that he entered his own work in this year's Dragon Con art show.  I'm doing some science-fiction-inspired pottery for the show, and I've got a small booth there, he added. I'm more into the older science fiction and fantasy, like H.P. Lovecraft and Tolkien and things along that line. I have a piece there that's inspired by Lovecraft.  All-star guest lineup  In addition to Benz and Kassir, this year's eclectic lineup of Dragon Con celebrity guests includes comedy legend Soupy Sales, musical madman Dr. Demento, jazz pianist Chick Corea, authors Harlan Ellison and Anne McCaffrey, artists Olivia, Bernie Wrightson and Bill Stout, Playboy model Sandra Taylor and actors David Carradine (Kill Bill, Vol. 2), Ernie Hudson (Ghostbusters), Peter Davison (Doctor Who), Dee Wallace Stone (E.T.), Glenn Shadix (Beetlejuice), Garrett Wang (Star Trek: Voyager), Adam Baldwin (Firefly), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca from Star Wars), Virginia Hey (Farscape), June Lockhart(Lost in Space), Marc Singer (The Beastmaster), Margot Kidder (Superman), Gil Gerard (Buck Rogers) and Dean Haglund (The X-Files).  The most meaningful part of doing these shows is getting the chance to say 'hi' and meet the fans, says Haglund, who played the Ramones-loving computer geek Langley, one of the Lone Gunmen trio of government-conspiracy theorists who made their debut assisting Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully (Gillian Anderson) on The X-Files before starring in their own short-lived spinoff.  The Lone Gunmen played a special role in the 'X-Files' world, Haglund believes. We were basically there for all those people who couldn't relate to two gorgeous-looking FBI agents who happen to be hunting aliens. I think the appeal of the Lone Gunmen is that we look like Hanson 20 years later.  (Terry Pace is the entertainment editor of the TimesDaily in Florence, Ala.)

A decade on, though, Ross still hasn't made the cut, the sportswriters of America still hating his guts and all. Close enough to induction, though, to undergo a routine record check, it's discovered that three hits from one game were erroneously credited to Ross.

"143626"	"I"	"thought"	" In a New Yorker profile a couple of weeks ago, Teresa Heinz Kerry got some grief for her grasp of English idiom after she called her detractors scumbags. I doubt that she knows the literal meaning of 'scumbag,' wrote the reporter, Judith Thurman, but perhaps, after forty years in America, nearly thirty of them as a political wife . . . she should have learned it. Thurman does not, however, enlighten her audience; maybe she assumes that all New Yorker readers know what Heinz Kerry does not. If so, I suspect she's wrong: When I wrote about the word in 1998, after Indiana congressman Dan Burton called President Clinton a scumbag, dozens of people who knew scumbag told me they'd had no idea of its origins. Though it's now usually just an all-purpose derogation, a cop-show synonym for dirtbag or creep or lowlife, scumbag originally meant condom (to many, used condom -- scum being slang for semen). But if lots of Americans, including Teresa Heinz Kerry, don't know this, do we really want to spread the word? Or are we better off letting scumbag enjoy life as a nonspecifically nasty term of abuse? A few slang words, after all, have outrun their unsavory origins. Bollix for mess up is no longer vulgar, having left ballocks in the dust; nuts (though it used to be euphemized nerts) is likewise untainted by its past. Screw up is now acceptable, though other uses of screw vary in their vulgarity ratings. Futz around, which may be either a euphemism for you-know-what or a descendant of the Yiddish arumfarzen (no translation necessary), is not uncommon in print nowadays, and even putz around is gaining ground. (Its resemblance to putter may make it seem milder than futz, though in fact its root is Yiddish slang for penis.) Origins are not, in any case, what makes a term taboo; it was cultural consensus, not any secret meaning, that once made bloody Britain's worst swear word. These days, though, consensus can be hard to find. Newspapers try to hold a conservative line on language -- The New York Times, for instance, will print crap shoot, but you can't say crap unless you're Lyndon Johnson (and dead). But print editors are the Canutes of usage, trying to turn back the usage tide rolling in from TV, pop music, and the Internet. For would-be gatekeepers, the speed of slang evolution keeps reviving the essential scumbag question: How dirty can a word be if nobody knows it's dirty? For the past decade, the slang word most delicately balanced on this usage bubble has been sucks, as in Mom, these sneakers suck. Seven years ago, when I first wrote about it, I was sure it was headed for respectability: The kids using the term had no sense of any sexual meaning, after all, and (as my then-teenage daughter pointed out) the new usage was intransitive; there was no grammatical object being sucked. Sucks may have been borrowed from the slang for fellating, but innocent employment, I thought, would neutralize its iffy past. It had respectable relatives, too. Sucks to you! (origin unknown) had been ordinary British youthspeak since the early 20th century, and suck up to, though probably of indelicate ancestry, was so thoroughly domesticated that in 1953, C.S. Lewis used it in one of his Narnia books for children. Besides, suck has so many standard uses that you can't really quarantine the syllable. Sucker meaning dupe, for instance, is merely a babe in the woods, a still-suckling newborn; and to children in many parts of the country, a sucker is an innocent lollipop. But I didn't reckon with the literalists, who decided kids should know this was a bad word, even if they'd prefer that someone else explained why. We could have told the kids sucks was short for sucks lemons and left well enough alone, but no: Parents banned it, then Red Sox fans adopted it for their (increasingly pathetic) slogan, and some of them, just to show that they really meant to be crude, wore their Yankees suck T-shirts with Jeter swallows on the back. This is a shame, for though every civilization needs a store of taboo words, sucks is a useful slang verb. The finger-waggers say we should use more descriptive words -- that movie was execrable, perhaps, and the Yankees are evil -- but in fact, sucks energetically fills a syntactical role that would otherwise belong to to be, that essential but uninspiring verb. Strunk and White (Use the active voice) would have to approve, and so do I. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20041005.0068 type=story > <HEADLINE> IF FRIGHT EXCITES YOU, HERE'S THE TRICK </HEADLINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz

You'd create just a little hole and he was such a great north-south runner, he'd be gone. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"
"149389"	"she"	"thought"	" Mary Lou Quinlan knew that her life was going awry when she dreamed that she had broken her leg -- and woke up sorry that the dream wasn't true. At least, she thought, it would have kept her in bed. There she was, to all appearances, living the perfect life: happy marriage, great job, lots of friends. But after 23 years of nonstop work, she desperately needed a break. Yet she could not bring herself to take time off. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"
"149569"	"he"	"thought"	" Elderhostel was founded in 1975 by two former educators, Marty Knowlton and David Bianco. Knowlton had traveled in Europe and been impressed by its youth hostel system, as well as by the century-old Scandinavian tradition of folk schools, in which adults attend retreats or camps and study cultural subjects. Why not, he thought, combine the two back in America? The idea was to offer older vacationers an alternative to the vegetative inertia of retirement communities and endless rounds of golf. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"
"149673"	"they"	"thought"	" The players were guilty of doing the math. The league offered to settle, they thought, for a salary cap of $42.2 million. The union countered with $49 million. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"
"150246"	"I"	"thought"	" Until the day I die, I will never forget today, Brennan said. When we did it the first time, I thought, 'Man, this is neat.' When we did it the second time, I thought, 'This is unbelievable.' The third time, I'm thinking, 'God almighty, how does this keep happening?'  </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"150253"	"he"	"thought"	" Bergstrom was intrigued. He had been pushing Enron to combine its European operations with Dynegy's. Maybe, he thought, that idea had gained appeal. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"150256"	"I"	"thought"	" Never, Alomar said. I never thought I'd be a major league baseball player. When I signed a professional contract, I thought, 'Well, let me give it a try.' But when I went to spring training and I saw all those people out there you've got to compete with, I thought: 'Oh, my, that's a lot of people. Never in a million years.'  </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"150322"	"she"	"thought"	" Why not update the idea, she thought, by building a modern pool in a barge, a (relatively) low-rent version of a pool in a cruise ship? The floating version would cost less than buying land and constructing a standard pool, and could move to and from communities without public pools. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"150391"	"she"	"thought"	" Denise thought about stopping her medication for high blood pressure. If I die, she thought, then surely they would let Shanell come home for my funeral. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"150661"	"I"	"thought"	" Just as (Louisa May Alcott) took inspiration from her family for her fiction, I thought, 'Well, to find out the character for this absent father, I'll look at her real father,' Brooks says. And that was the great gift-wrapped package that came flying in the window, because Bronson Alcott is such a fabulous, fabulous character. I am completely in love with him. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"150998"	"I"	"thought"	" Michael Macko, the men's fashion director of Saks Fifth Avenue, who viewed the Dsquared collection in Milan last winter, said he was somewhat taken aback. Hmm, I thought, 'Religion as a fashion theme. That's a little different from corduroy or camel. How do we handle this?' Undeterred, Saks bought the Dsquared line for its stores across the country. We bought it as a fashion item, not as a moral statement, said Ronald Frasch, the chief merchant of Saks. We sell crosses, and it's not a big step from crosses to sweaters. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"151166"	"I"	"thought"	" If I tell him now, I thought, he could clean out his desk and print out anything he might need. But he also could lose his severance and have a black mark on his National Association of Securities Dealers forms. If I tell him later, he might think of things he would have done if he had known and hate me. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"151215"	"I"	"thought"	" I love him very much, said Augustine Arumugam, 30, of Sri Lanka. But when I saw him for the past two or three years, I thought, 'Why is he suffering like that?' Now I understand that he did all of this for us. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"151386"	"I"	"thought"	" I think of teaching as a form of public service, said Bradley Ballinger, professor of mathematics at the University of California at Davis. Publishers, I thought, were victimizing students to a large extent, thinking of them as an extension of their parents' wallets. If you price things so that only parents can afford them, you put them out of reach of students who don't have wealthy parents. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"151423"	"I"	"thought"	" I remember it vividly, Terrapins coach Terry Rupp said. He was right out there in front of the dugout. When I saw him throw that way, I thought, 'Whoa, we may have something here.' He has the right body type for it. He's kind of a long, lanky guy. I asked him about possibly pitching that way, and he said sure, he was willing to give it a try. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"151461"	"I"	"thought"	" I spied a single vacant RV spot, just 100 feet from the office at most. No way that's mine, I thought, and left my rig parked by the office as I walked over to find the lot-number sign. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"

"151906"	"I"	"thought"	" I opened the envelope, read them, and thought, 'These are the best stories I've ever read,' he said. He called her, and soon sold the collection to Villard, a division of Random House. She was delighted, but he recalls her saying, Peter, I will never write a novel. Though he didn't argue, he says now, I was so blown away by the stories, I thought, 'She has to do a novel.' Eventually he talked her into it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"

"152088"	"I"	"thought"	" I fought the good fight. When the grass came up tufty and uneven, I stepped up the food and switched from a push mower to a power machine. When all else failed, I thought, Why not go to sod? Right on cue, a truckload of the stuff rolled up to the house next door. By the end of the day, the workmen had turned that parched yard into a vision of emerald radiance. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"152131"	"I"	"thought"	" And when I realized how many people didn't recognize me when I cut my hair off, I thought, 'It's probably a good thing that I cut it.' I don't want to be a haircut.

"152223"	"I"	"thought"	" I think he got great touches. He got great looks. We're not a team that's going to be one-dimensional at the end of the game, like Duncan. We're a team that's got to go to the situation or the hot hand, and Melo, I thought, got at least 50 percent of the touches down the stretch. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"152257"	"I"	"thought"	" But as an adult, I could watch her without her shooing me from the kitchen. I could learn her recipes, I thought, by seeing how she added just enough of the broth to dumplings to make them pliable and soft. I saw that she salted and peppered the chicken, not the flour, before dusting it and frying. I really tried hard to pick up her curiously gentle technique for handling the buttermilk biscuit dough. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"152296"	"I"	"thought"	" Great, I thought, wishing I hadn't understood it. I had intended to sample some adventurous food, but maybe not this adventurous -- not escamoles -- and not on my first night in the Mexican capital. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"152412"	"I"	"thought"	" As soon as I saw that big cloud of white (washers) billow up, I thought, 'Oh, my God, this can't be good,'  Stimpson reflected last week. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"152436"	"she"	"thought"	" I think it was in mid-2003, Griffin said. It was just myself and some friends and business associates in the professional advertising community. We just started reading Gawker because we thought it was a hoot. She said that after realizing that they were all single, young, well-paid and casting their gaze on this fertile space, she thought, We've got to get on that. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"152534"	"I"	"thought"	" OK, now we're getting somewhere, I thought, and complied. Freddie and I parted amicably, and I went for a walk -- partly to see if I could spy a truck working on a nearby line. I didn't. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"152549"	"I"	"thought"	" When I was in character, working in the O.R. in boots, breathing in tired hot air because the A/C on the set has to be off so the button mikes don't pick up the sound, I thought, 'How dare I?'  she told the crowd of 400-plus in the Venetian Ballroom. I'm standing over an extra's body, covered in fake blood, and trying to imagine what the real thing was like. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"152735"	"I"	"thought"	" Last Sunday, after a cup of coffee, I made my first offering, a smart critique, I thought, of an article about liberal politics in The New York Review of Books by Thomas Frank, the author of What's the Matter With Kansas? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"152821"	"I"	"thought"	" When I first heard about the houses, I thought, this culture is so underground, said Brandon Harp, a member of the Atlanta House of Ultra-Omni.

"152902"	"he"	"thought"	" This was 20 minutes after the fact, and Silvertand was standing in the winner's circle area where cures for the shakes aren't usually found.

"152968"	"I"	"thought"	" If you blow that lead, everyone is going to call you a choker or a dog. And you get stuck with that name and that's not fair, said Perry, who alleviated those concerns with front-nine birdies at Nos. 1 and 5 to discourage his pursuers. I knew the first hole was very important to me. It was the most important hole on the golf course. ... When I made an easy birdie, I thought, 'We're all right.'  </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"153166"	"we"	"thought"	" Once we found a small hole in his yard and we used sticks to determine that the hole pretty much went on forever.

"153497"	"I"	"thought"	" For Jennifer Walton, Jim's estranged wife, that concept consisted largely of putting a family in disarray on TV and showing only the negative. To sit and watch us, I thought, 'That really can't be our family,' but it really was, she said. It was hard to watch. They never showed the good, like how well the kids were doing in school. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"153502"	"I"	"thought"	" After I spent as much money as I did on a tuxedo, I thought, I'm going to wear whatever the (pause) tie I want. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"153519"	"I"	"thought"	" Even at the beginning of this year I wasn't sure how good I was, Ross says. Once I got this feedback from Andrew Lloyd Webber, I thought, OK, this is something I have to continue with. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"153578"	"I"	"thought"	" About three months after that, she said, I found myself thinking about cochineal again, and it was red geraniums that did it. During the brutal winter of 2000-2001, I was housebound so many days. I found myself going in the kitchen, standing and staring at my geraniums, just looking at that color. I would lose track of time and it improved my mood. One day, while I was looking at them, I thought, 'What if that were it? What if that were the only color I had, if color were that rare?' It got me thinking about cochineal. I understood how people had risked their lives for it. It was easier for me to understand how hungry you could be for color, why it would be an object of great passion and desire. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"153947"	"I"	"thought"	" The morning I was to traverse the famous plains of Castile, I ran across a couple of old ladies in the last village before the climb up. They warned me of tormentas y mal tiempos. At last, I thought, some real medieval action. Torments and evil jived nicely with the Cecil B. DeMille pilgrim tableau playing in my head. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"154080"	"he"	"thought"	" He saw her, too. She was always so well-dressed, he thought. He noticed her huge green eyes, how they looked so intense when she read the paper. A bomb could go off in here, he thought, and she would not notice. He saw it as a sign of her determination. He did not realize she was one of the TV news people. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"154218"	"I"	"thought"	" For some reason, when I thought about it and why it was up for sale, I thought, 'There's no reason to sell it,' he said. I think it is something I need to keep around. He asked the woman if they could cancel the deal, and she agreed. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"154288"	"I"	"thought"	" When I told her I already knew from the Web site that the Old Rectory was booked solid for the next two years, she seemed undeterred. That's OK, she said. I've circled about 30 different houses that I just love. Surely you can find at least one that is available for the holidays.

"154307"	"I"	"thought"	" Touring the steeply sloping garden on four acres around the Tiffanys' house, an 18th-century stone mill on the Tohickon Creek that the couple renovated 10 years ago, I thought, Where are all the hostas? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"

"154590"	"he"	"thought"	" The Boss hit the send button and turned to the screen, just as Robinson Cano ripped a single to drive in Derek Jeter. Six-nothing. This kid's something, he thought, and Joe Torre was right on the money when he told the writers, We're not shopping him around, that's for sure. What, do these guys think I'm compulsive enough to trade the next Roberto Alomar for some quick-fix old pitcher? Think again, misguided scribes! </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"154610"	"I"	"thought"	" Despite the close partisan numbers and all the mistaken turns the 2005 Legislature took, I was still optimistic all day Thursday. At their core, I thought, Tim Pawlenty, Dean Johnson and Steve Sviggum are reasonable people who love this state. They won't let Minnesotans wake up Friday morning to the news that their state government no longer works. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"154809"	"she"	"thought"	" Rebecca Berkman, visiting Jerusalem from Long Island, N.Y., said she was tempted to cancel her 18-year-old daughter Danielle's trip to Tel Aviv after hearing of the London attacks. Surely, she thought, if there was an attack on England, there might well be one in Israel. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"154987"	"I"	"thought"	" Not recognizing this as the start of a panic attack at the idea that we were potentially people without a country, doomed to wander this vacant stretch of land forever, I decided I was having an allergy attack. It must be the tomatoes, I thought, or even the peppers. I'd never been allergic to any foods, but then I'd never before eaten 14 s hopska salads in a row. What if my throat closed? We were in no-man's-land, with no medical facilities and, long before cell phones, no way to get help. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"154988"	"I"	"thought"	" I clung to the door handle as John drove; then, as the Greek border station came into view, my anxieties subsided. My breathing returned to normal, and we were ushered into Thessaloniki. For the first few days in Greece, though, I passed on the fresh tomato salads, which were served sans the spicy peppers. After a while, I couldn't resist, and a dozen more tomato salads during our stay didn't cause any attacks. Must've been the peppers, I thought, but once back home I couldn't resist searching out the wax pepper and making a s hopska salad. Delicious -- and no ill effects. I've been eating them ever since, and Hungarian yellow wax peppers were the first peppers I planted when we got the farm. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"155048"	"I"	"thought"	" But then I walked outside, looking for a cab. The sun was shining. The streets were busy. The joggers were circling Hyde Park. A clutch of tourists passed, their map open, heading in the direction of Buckingham Palace. And for the first time, I thought, this is what it must be like in Beirut, or Tel Aviv -- where the threat of terrorism is always present, where the possibility of a car bomb or a terrorist attack at any moment hovers in the air, and yet, life goes on. This is what passes for normal. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"155094"	"I"	"thought"	" The historic courtesy is that you tell someone if you [are going to] refer to a speech he made on the Senate floor, and he called Santorum in advance, Kennedy said in an interview Wednesday. It was his opportunity to apologize and he refused. The fact that he refused to apologize, I thought, with comments that equate the academic excellence [of the Boston area's universities] with somehow fostering child abuse was irresponsible and inexcusable. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"155163"	"I"	"thought"	" Actor Jim Dale, one of my favorite stage actors, won a Grammy for his rendition of the Rowling oeuvre; surely, I thought, his tapes could save me now. Not only is Dale quite a ham; he also had several advantages over me. For one thing, he got to read the book through before performing it. And as he explained in a radio interview a few years back, Dale made sure the various characters' voices stayed consistent by keeping a tape recording of them by his side in the studio. Most of all, he had the luxury of having his flubs and stumbles edited out (from what he said, the bloopers tape would be a riot, if it ever was released.) </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"155174"	"I"	"thought"	" On to summer vacation with my three daughters: 13-year-old Alexandra, 11-year-old Victoria and 8-year-old Isabella, the injured one who smashed her left big toe. Life is good, I thought, as we left Texas temperatures nearing 100 in exchange for the near-perfect San Diego weather of 70s in the day and 60s at night. And a nonstop flight on Southwest Airlines from Austin reminded me why I picked San Diego this year. It's a no-brainer if you have children.

"155484"	"I"	"thought"	" I will never forget the moment last fall when, about an hour into the third presidential debate, John Kerry brought up the statistic that half of the black men in New York City are unemployed.

In your face, Cleveland. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"155534"	"I"	"thought"	" A rather harsh assessment, I thought, of our honorables. Alas, along with watching the diligent folks who represented the people back home, this fellow had long observed those who partook of too many goodies, large and small, who picked the pockets of special-interest lobbyists and the people for whom they worked for campaign contributions even if the likeliest opponent in their re-election bids was a ham sandwich.

"155611"	"I"	"thought"	" Q: That had to ruin your day. A: At the time, I thought, (Shoot.) That's a drag. But say, by some miracle, I had gotten to the minors.

, he believed,	 Like Ford, Fuller designed his own automobile, a polliwog-shaped wonder called the Dymaxion Car (only three were ever built); more ambitiously, he sought to bring the principles of mass production to bear on housing. It was absurdly wasteful, he believed, to construct houses onsite, each one compromised by the limitations of the builder and the availability of materials. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he argued,	 In his privately published 1928 manifesto, 4D Timelock, Fuller sketched out a future in which houses would roll off assembly lines and be delivered fully built by zeppelin (trains, he argued, couldn't carry a house of any width and ships couldn't go inland). Cities would disappear as dirigible-distributed homes spread into a worldwide carpet of habitation. Thanks to Dymaxion Cars with retractable wings (a design element that did not make it into his prototypes), there would be no need for a connecting grid of roads. So enamored was Fuller of his delivery system that he proposed that a house's foundation be dug from the air as well: A bomb would be dropped on the desired site, and the home lowered into the resulting crater. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz

Tensegrity spheres, he wrote, were so light and strong that one could build lighter-than-air cities out of them that could be moored to mountaintops.

Hence the sort-of-new Jim Carrey vehicle Fun With Dick and Jane, what may be the first post-Enron comedy. Based on the 1977 Me Generation laugh-in of the same title with Jane Fonda and George Segal, this comic redo doesn't so much update the plight of its fast-sinking upwardly mobile couple as dust off the story's central conceit: namely, the flip side of the American dream is a nightmare but, you know, also kind of funny. </P> 	nyt_eng_200512.gz
, they really,	 One of the film's insights is that poverty stinks, which could be news only in the la-la land of Los Angeles big-studio moviemaking. It's nonsense to expect social commentary from a high-concept comedy, especially one as self-congratulatory as this one (they care, they really, really care), but this is the rare studio comedy set in something like the real world. If the film never settles into a groove, zigging and zagging from belly laughs to pathos, it's because Enron remains raw as a wound. Too many cooks probably didn't help: directed by Dean Parisot, Fun With Dick and Jane has a screenplay credited to Judd Apatow and Nicholas Stoller, and, according to The Los Angeles Times, includes the efforts of David Koepp, Ed Solomon, Ted Griffin, Peter Tolan, Alec Berg, David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer. </P> 	nyt_eng_200512.gz

For the latest photos and graphics from The New York Times, go to www.nytimages.com.  INTERNATIONAL (i code)  IRAQ-SADDAM (Baghdad) -- As his trial continued, Saddam Hussein charged in open court that he has been beaten and tortured while in American custody and still has the marks on his body. In one of the most specific and direct accusations in testimony, a witness testified Wednesday that Saddam's half-brother, Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, ate grapes while a man screamed in agony in a torture chamber. By John F. Burns.  MIDEAST(Jerusalem) -- Worried about the rising political strength of Hamas, Israel threatened to prevent Palestinians in East Jerusalem from voting in the Jan. 25 elections, a move that prompted officials of the Palestinian Authority to threaten a delay in the vote. By Greg Myre.  AFGHAN (Kabul, Afghaniztan) -- President Karzai's chief political rival wins a vote to be speaker of the lower house of parliament; Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld confirms a 3,000-member American troop reduction during a visit to Kabul, deflects questions about detainee abuse.

RUSSIA-RIGHTS (Moscow) -- Parliament approves amendments to soften a bill restricting non-governmental organizations at the request of President Vladimir V. Putin, reacting to an outcry by Western governments and rights groups. By Steven Lee Myers.  BRITAIN-ELTON (Windsor, England) -- If there were any anti- or pro-gay demonstrators in the crowd, they were being unusually shy. No one was screaming religious slogans, carrying angry placards, wearing in-your-face outfits or loudly forecasting the end of civilization as we know it. The most striking thing, in fact, about the people gathered along the streets here on Wednesday for Sir Elton John's civil partnership ceremony with his boyfriend, David Furnish, was how little they appeared to care, one way or the other, about the couple's sexuality. By Sarah Lyall.  WASHINGTON (w code)  CONGRESS (Washington) -- The Senate passed the budget on Wednesday morning, with Vice President Dick Cheney casting the tie-breaking vote. By Carl Hulse.  .PATRIOT-ACT (Washington) -- The vote on the extension of the Patriot Act goes down to the wire. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.

By Eric Lichtblau and James Risen.  .NATIONAL GENERAL (a code)  KATRINA-HOTELS (Columbia, S.C.) -- While most hurricane evacuees have moved out of their hotels, getting the problem children into apartments is among the thorniest problems in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Even in states like South Carolina, where a relative handful remain in hotels, some officials have begun to throw up their hands. The people who could fend for themselves, they said, have moved on; rooms are now occupied mainly by the elderly, disabled or mentally ill. Many are felons whose applications for apartments are routinely rejected, or people with a string of evictions who seem to be waiting to be tossed out again. By Jodi Wilgoren.  SANTA-PHONE-CALL (Atlanta) -- Parents may have found an antidote to the growing sophistication of the grade-school set. Increasingly, they are turning to commercial services that provide phone calls from a Santa who knows not only what is on the child's wish list, but the names of siblings, friends and teachers and what was under the tree last year. By Shaila Dewan.  EVOLUTION-ASSESS (Harrisburg, Pa.) -- After Tuesday's court ruling in Pennsylvania, where does the intelligent design movement go from here? By Laurie Goodstein.  With:  EVOLUTION-TEXAS (Odessa, Texas) -- A dispute over what textbook to use to teach a Bible elective course is just beginning in a school district in Odessa, Texas. The trustees voted late Tuesday to adopt the textbook from the National Council on Bible Curriculum in Public Schools, endorsing the recommendation of the schools superintendent and rejecting the opinion of teachers and administrators who had favored a different book. A parent has threatened a lawsuit over the course. By Barbara Novovitch.  NY-TRANSIT-STRIKE (New York) -- Lede-all on the New York City transit strike, now in its second day. By Janny Scott and Steven Greenhouse.  NY-STRIKE-SUFFER (New York) -- A look at the growing misery of the transit strike. The first day was one of adventure, stiff-upper lips, whatever. The second was, well, exponentially worse. By Richard Perez-Pena.  SCIENCE (a' category)  DIABETES (Undated) -- A 17-year federal study answered one of the most pressing questions about diabetes: Can tight control of blood sugar prevent heart attacks and strokes? The answer, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, is yes. Intense control can reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes by nearly half. By Gina Kolata.  VIET-FLU (Undated) -- Two fatal cases of avian flu in Vietnam were resistant to the drug Tamiflu, New England Journal reports. By Lawrence K. Altman and Andrew Pollack.  FINANCIAL (f code)  DEUTSCHE-BANK (Frankfurt) -- The head of Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, will be sent back to court for a retrial over windfall bonuses he approved for departing executives of Mannesmann, the German federal court said. He and five others had been acquitted by a regional court last year of wrongdoing in paying almost 60 million euros ($71 million) in bonuses and benefits five years ago. By Mark Landler.  TIME-WARNER (Undated) -- Time Warner names Jeff Bewkes president and chief operating officer.

By Simon Romero.  KAZAHKSTAN-ECON (Almaty, Kazakhstan) -- The Kazahk economy is colored by the close entwinement of business and politics, corruption, lack of transparency and a small oligarchic class as in neighboring Russia, and significantly, a prominent role for members of the president's immediate family.

"161213"	"I"	"thought"	" Once the studio had given its tentative approval for period music, the production then recruited Roy Prendergast, a New York-based movie music editor with a background in classical music and composition. When I looked at the film, I thought, this is opera buffa, this is farce, he said in a telephone interview, and I realized that the opera repertory could provide the most cinematic material. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"

"161583"	"I"	"thought"	" My father died in January 1991; the Gulf War began the day of his funeral. It was only fitting, I thought, because in those last few weeks in the hospital he seemed to have withdrawn into the television over his bed, into CNN's coverage of the countdown to war.

"163945"	"I"	"thought"	" Cox News Service DUNWOODY, Ga. -- Everything looked normal Tuesday morning at Jeff Williams' home on a quiet cul-de-sac in Dunwoody. Only the constant ringing of the telephone let slip that this was an unusual day for the 19-year-old University of Georgia freshman. It was, it still is, insane, said a barefoot, still sleepy Williams. When the 'Today' show called, I thought, 'Oh my gosh, this is crazy.' Friends and media outlets began calling and visiting as soon as Williams and his parents, Dave and Cindi Williams, arrived home Monday evening from Monaco, where he won $1 million over the weekend at the European Poker Tour main event. It was his first live tournament. He beat almost 300 other card sharks. Williams, a soft-spoken, slender young man with a wide smile, said he remembers very little of the winning moment: I know I yelled, but I'll have to watch the video to see what else. He said his winning hand -- an ace of spades and a 10 of clubs -- was not a bluff, and that he had played his final opponent before, online. I knew he was very aggressive and I knew he would go all in. I had only bet a third of my chips, so even if I lost that hand, I would still have a shot. Williams said he played about 2,000 hands of Texas Hold 'Em during the tournament. He hasn't played since winning the pot, mostly because of visits from friends and family and calls from media outlets. He also said he needed to take a break from the intense concentration required to win. Two thousand hands, and everyone of them I could have gone broke on, Williams recalled. I really had to pay attention. Williams' parents -- mom's a real estate agent and dad's a regional manager for a security firm -- flew to Monaco to surprise him when they realized how close he was to winning the tournament. Cindi Williams said Tuesday that she and her husband always talked honestly with their children, Jeff and his 16-year-old sister, Amanda, about everything, including gambling. That kept him from gambling behind their backs, she said. Basically, we've tried to make them look at the consequences of their behavior, whether it was good or bad, Cindi Williams said. She said they also stressed that he should never wager more than you can lose. So far, that advice has stuck. Williams spent just $40 to enter the first of two online tournaments that earned him a spot in the Monaco tournament. Entry into that tournament was bankrolled by PokerStars.com, which paid $12,000 apiece for the top nine players in the second online tournament to play in Monaco. Williams said he will probably spend the remainder of this week, the last of his spring break, in New York where he was invited to tape a segment for NBC's Today show. That would be another once-in-a-lifetime experience, he said. In one week, going from being an average college student to making an appearance on national TV. Williams attributes his poker prowess to practice. He had been playing cards with his sister and their mother, mostly gin rummy and quarter poker, for most of his life. He began playing online poker two years ago, but only seriously six months ago. Williams said he preferred Texas Hold 'Em to other poker games because, It has the most skill in it. The math whiz was able to take on more seasoned players, he said, because he can play four to six hands at a time online. That gives me a lot of practice so I can kind of catch up to guys who have been playing for 20 years and it helps me see a lot of hands, said Williams, who added that he's always had a good memory for cards. Perhaps improbably, Williams studies neither mathematics nor statistics at UGA. He's a political science major who's already laughing about the benefits that a world-class poker face could bring to a desired career in politics. I'd like to run for office someday, but if not that, maybe something in the Department of State, or Defense, he said. In the interim, he doesn't plan any Pentagon-size spending sprees. Once he gets the money in hand, Williams said, he'll set aside about $400,000 to pay taxes, and plans to invest most of the rest. My mom's a real estate agent so I think I'll get a few condominiums that I can rent and leverage that for investments, Williams said, adding that he would put the rest in mutual funds. He also might treat himself to a few good dinners, although there's not yet a girlfriend to share them. I thought about a new car, something pretty and fast, maybe an Infiniti, but I'm not going to do that now. The 1993 brown Honda Accord sitting in his driveway is just fine, he said, for now. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"

BUSH (Washington) -- The overhaul of the White House staff intensified on Wednesday as Karl Rove, one of the president's most powerful and feared advisers, gave up day-to-day control over administration policy to concentrate on the midterm elections and Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, said he was stepping down. The departure of McClellan gives President Bush a chance to put a new public face on the White House at a time when it is beset by problems. But Rove's changed status may be the more telling sign of the extent of the shakeup being undertaken by Bush and his new chief of staff, Joshua B. Bolten. Bumiller. With photos, NYT1-4.  Subs slug; an early story, BUSH-RESIGN, leading with McClellan, has moved.  NEGROPONTE-INTEL (Washington) -- For months the top Republican and Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee have been deeply divided over everything from pre-war reports on Iraq to the National Security Agency's domestic eavesdropping. Rep. Peter Hoekstra of Michigan, the Republican chairman, and Rep. Jane Harman of California, the ranking Democrat, have come together in a remarkable show of unity on one issue: their disquiet with the first-year performance of John D. Negroponte, the director of national intelligence. They fear the intelligence czar's office is becoming just what critics feared it might -- another blanket of bureaucracy that muffles rather than clarifies the government's view of the world. DNI staffers deny the charge and Negroponte himself will have a chance on Thursday to defend his record in what even critics say is an impossible job in an appearance at the National Press Club.

On Tuesday afternoon, with 68 people trapped in a pair of gondolas hundreds of feet above their heads, rescue workers were faced with a nerve-wracking puzzle: how to turn the jungle-gym-like contraption into a moving platform that would travel across the cables, pull up alongside the swaying gondolas and bring the passengers safely back. When officials realized it would take another two hours to reassemble the cage and remove passengers stuck in the second gondola, the city officials tracked down the owner of a Queens crane company at dinner and asked him to send over a 20-ton monster that could reach passengers. Half an hour later, a Hydraulic All Terrain Crane arrived, a contract was hastily signed and rescue workers set to work figuring how they might turn the crane into a Deus Ex Machina. So it went in one of the stranger rescue operations in the history of New York City. By Andrew Jacobs.  STORMS-TEXAS (Houston) -- To the long list of adjectives used to describe Texans since last summer's hurricanes -- munificent, intrepid, scrappy -- add one more: fed up. Seven months after two hurricanes blew through the Gulf Coast region, elected officials, law enforcement agencies and many residents say that Texas is nearing the end of its ability to play good neighbor without compensation. Houston is straining along its municipal seams from the 150,000 new residents from New Orleans, officials say. Crime has spiked, and the schools are struggling to educate thousands of new children. To the east, Texans argue that the fallout from Hurricane Rita, which took an unexpected turn away from Houston shortly after Katrina last fall to wreak havoc elsewhere in the state, has been forgotten in the swirl of attention given to New Orleans' devastation.

DISABLED-ROMANCE (Undated) -- In what experts say is the latest frontier in the disability rights movement, many young men and women in their 20s and 30s, who once would have been given sex education only to protect them from exploitation and disease, are being prepared by social workers to have successful romantic and intimate relationships, sometimes over the objections of protective parents and agencies more likely to stress the prevention of abuse, disease and pregnancy.

MYSPACE-ADS (Santa Monica, Calif.) -- Almost on a lark, Chris DeWolfe bought the Internet address MySpace.com in 2002, figuring that it might be useful someday. DeWolfe noticed the popularity of Friendster, a rapidly growing Web site that let people communicate with their friends and meet the friends of their friends.

Off-lede:  FDA-MARIJUANA (Washington) -- The FDA said Thursday that no sound scientific studies support the medical use of marijuana, providing ammunition to federal officials who are trying to squelch state efforts to legalize medical uses. A spokesman for John Walters, the federal drug czar, hailed the FDA statement. But the FDA statement contradicts years of research as well as a 1999 review by the National Academy of Sciences, the nation's most prestigious scientific evaluative agency. The national academy found that marijuana is moderately well suited for particular conditions, such as chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and AIDS wasting.

IMMIG-EMPLOYERS (Washington) -- The apprehension on Wednesday of more than 1,100 illegal immigrants employed by a Houston-based pallet supply company, as well as the arrest of seven of its managers, represents the kickoff of a more aggressive federal campaign intended to hold employers accountable, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said on Thursday. Describing the hiring of millions of undocumented workers as a form of organized crime, Chertoff, a former federal prosecutor, said the government would try to crack down on the practice with techniques similar to those used to shut down the mob. His remarks came just days before the Senate is to reconvene and perhaps restart a debate over a comprehensive rewriting of immigration laws. By Eric Lipton.  TRIBECA-FILM-FEST (New York) -- Imagine you are at the multiplex. There are 18 movies -- indies, comedies, dark dramas, foreign films and documentaries.

Now multiply by 10, and you have some idea of the scope and reach of the TriBeCa Film Festival, the downtown cinema orgy that begins with the premiere of United 93 on April 25. The festival, conceived as a civic gesture to help the neighborhood get back on its feet after the Sept. 11 attacks, has mushroomed into the film fest that ate downtown; last year it sold 135,000 tickets to 700 screenings.

Skilling's laser-sharp intelligence and know-it-all self-assurance helped propel him to transform Enron from a no-nonsense pipeline company into an energy colossus. But in his eight days on the witness stand, jurors in the federal trial here also saw a side of him that had increasingly bothered managers at Enron: someone who did not like to be questioned, to be told he was wrong, to be cut off when he was speaking.

, they said,	 Last fall, a team of scientists tied bats to the deadly SARS outbreaks. Bats in China, they said, are likely where the virus hides between human outbreaks. Then, in December, another group of researchers suggested that bats in Africa serve as a reservoir for the vicious virus for Ebola hemorrhagic fever, which causes its human victims to bleed to death. Bats have also been definitively tied to two other recently discovered viruses that are lethal to humans: Nipah and Hendra. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, they reported,	 After the 2003 outbreaks of SARS, which attacks the respiratory system, scientists initially identified an animal known as a civet as the disease's reservoir, the place where the virus sustains itself between outbreaks in humans. But further testing found that civets were not widely infected. In a paper published online by the journal Science last September, a team that included Epstein and scientists from China and Australia named a new suspect: cave-dwelling horseshoe bats. These bats, they reported, carry a family of viruses very similar to the one that causes SARS. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, he said,	 But why did this happen when it did? One intriguing possibility is that it is linked to China's economic boom, according to Peter Daszak, a co-author of the SARS paper who is executive director of the Consortium for Conservation Medicine. With the newfound wealth there, he said, animal markets have grown as more people can afford fresh animal meat. As the markets grow, so grow the chances that a virus will jump from one species to the next. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz

, he said,	 For example, he said, his team wants to measure the dynamics of the virus during the year. It may turn out that the ebbs and flows of the virus can be tied to factors like migration, when the animals are under more stress.

He started the series just after 9/11, and the large response to it showed, he says, that poetry sustains us in hard times. But if many of his choices here are about loss, there's an almost playful quality to the scope of the selections. He focuses on everything from poems by international writers unfamiliar to most mainstream readers, to poems about sports, Nebraska, insomnia and New York City. As in his 1999 book, How to Read a Poem, the unifying thread is his pleasure in telling us about them. If one of the great joys of reading poetry is sharing your favorites, talking about them and trading them like baseball cards, Hirsch can count himself a happy man. Among the writers whose work he includes are Gary Snyder, John Berryman, Stuart Dybek, Robert Pinsky, Pablo Neruda and Denise Levertov. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz

BBN-METS-ZAMBRANO (San Francisco) -- As the Mets got dressed in their clubhouse on Tuesday afternoon to prepare for their night game against the Giants, they could look up at any number of TV sets and see ex-Met phenom Scott Kazmir pitching live in Yankee Stadium. The same scene unfolded last week in San Francisco, when Kazmir pitched in Fenway while the Mets prepared for a game against the Padres. Everywhere, it seems, the Mets turn, there is a constant reminder of the July 31, 2004 trade the Mets made, when they sent Kazmir to Tampa Bay for Victor Zambrano, the pitcher who now depresses the Mets every five days when he takes the mound. By Ben Shpigel.  BBN-BONDS (San Francisco) -- Barry Bonds had already told reporters that he was not talking on Monday night and now he was one simple act away from bolting out of the Giants' clubhouse. All Bonds had to do was put on his white sneakers. But, these days, nothing seems simple for Bonds. As Bonds sat in a chair, he hunched forward while carefully slipping his right foot into a sneaker. Then Bonds tried to do the same thing with his left foot. But Bonds had to put his hand on the big screen television by his locker to steady himself before he could finally push his foot into place. The snapshot, about a minute in the day of a player with 709 homers and seven Most Valuable Player Awards, was one more reminder that Bonds' body is weakening and that 41, in baseball years, can be very old.

Burton does not envision himself posing for the before and after shots in a diet ad. But he has reluctantly become something of a poster boy for GlaxoSmithKline's foray into the lucrative weight-loss business.

CANADA-CASUALTIES (Toronto) -- Prime Minister Stephen Harper faced a storm of criticism on Tuesday for his decision to halt the flying of the flag at half-staff for Canadian troops killed in Afghanistan, and for refusing to allow news coverage of the return of the bodies of four soldiers recently killed there. Opposition political figures and some family members of the four soldiers, whose bodies were returned to a Canadian military base on Tuesday evening, say Harper is trying to blunt negative images that may erode public support for Canada's increasingly dangerous combat role in Afghanistan.

TERROR-WIRETAP (Washington) -- A federal appeals court on Tuesday returned the criminal case against an Islamic scholar to a trial judge to determine whether the Bush administration's domestic spying program was used to gather evidence against him. In a two-page order, a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted a request from Ali al-Timimi, a suburban Washington Islamic cleric, to let a federal judge determine whether the government secretly intercepted his conversations or those of others who were key to his case. Al-Timimi, who is serving a life sentence, was convicted last year of urging young Muslim men to join the Taliban and fight U.S. troops overseas in statements he made at a dinner shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

CALIF-ROCKSLIDES (Montara, Calif.) -- In a state prone to earthquakes, wildfires, floods and deadly mudflows, many Californians would consider a road closed by rockslides as a minor nuisance. Unless they live near Devil's Slide, a breathtaking coastal bluff along Pacific Coast Highway south of San Francisco, known as much for its precarious pitch as its panoramic vistas. Devil's Slide has been something of a recurring nightmare for residents living here and in several other coastal towns separated from San Francisco by it. Rain or shine, the Slide, as it is known, has been inching down the San Pedro Mountains in an uncontrollable march toward the sea, gradually taking with it a stretch of the coastal highway.

However, when it comes to family members and, I suspect, numbers of people in New York City where 9/11 is still very close, they have to decide for themselves when the right time is to see it.

What she found, she says, is that just avoiding eating too much wasn't really a solution. A lot of times, when I work, I don't take the time to eat properly, she admits.

, they observe,	 Coincidentally, two other liberal writers, John Halpin and Ruy Teixeira, have just finished a long study that comes out in exactly the same place. Surveying mountains of polling data, they conclude that the Democrats' chief problem is that people don't think they stand for anything. Halpin and Teixeira argue that the message voters respond to best is the notion of shared sacrifice for the common good.

They told of rigged smokestack tests, of polluted wastewater dumped under cover of night, of regulators stalled at the front gate while flagrant safety violations were hidden. Workers, they said, were blamed for accidents even when shoddy equipment or inadequate training was the real cause. Prosecutors called it the McWane way. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, they said,	 Defense lawyers were no less critical of the Justice Department, contending that a sloppy and overzealous prosecution had used trickery and intimidation to squeeze false testimony from unreliable witnesses.

, he said,	 Traditionally, one of the most cinematically exploitable aspects of New York has been its reputation as a cauldron of organized crime, corruption and narcotics. The author and screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi (GoodFellas) said Hollywood reflected, or at least dramatized, this reality in the '30s with gangster films like The Roaring Twenties. In the '50s, he said, it was the corrupt city exemplified by 'Sweet Smell of Success,' with its malevolent gossip columnist, J.J. Hunsecker. In the '60s, narcotics arrive, and the city becomes a horrendous place. The director William Friedkin memorably hammered home this point in 1971 with The French Connection, in which the hero cop, played by Gene Hackman, is nearly as corrupt and brutish as the criminals he's chasing. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, he said,	 But many filmmakers have to burrow deeper or look farther afield for fresh perspectives on New York life. Mazursky has devised an idea for a New York film about, he said, this old guy, somewhat like me, who goes back to New York and can't find it; he meets his old friends, who are doddering wrecks, and their kids, some of them doing well, some of them not. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, he added,	 Sanders foresees a new crop of filmmakers who will chart new territory in movies about the crosscurrents emanating from ethnic neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. We are going to see the story of a Pakistani kid meeting the Hindu kid, he said. In fact, he added, because the very nature of the city forces people into close contact with one another, New York still transcends the malls, the box stores and the coming of Trader Joe's. There is no rival for the life of the street, Sanders said. You run into lovers, ex-lovers. There are so many ways for different kinds of people to meet each other. That has never changed. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060427.0001 type=story > <HEADLINE> HEDLINE HERE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz

, he said,	 But if a witness' evidence is relevant and important, he said, the law seems to allow the government to force a former defendant before a grand jury to testify about his crimes and to jail him in an effort to coerce his testimony.
