"138127"	"she"	"binges"	" Murphy's Molly is the orphaned daughter of a deceased '60s rock legend, a poor little rich girl in an urban fairy-tale apartment who has blossomed into a self-centered, serial dating 22-year-old cutie-pie. Nakedly needy and emotionally hyperactive, she doesn't date, she binges, and her latest obsession is ``rock 'n' roll poet sex god'' Neal (Jesse Spencer). (!She's sick of his attention one second and stalking him the next. She gets away with it, too, until her fund manager leaves her broke and abandoned, a child-woman adrift in the real world of work, rent and weekly budgets. That, of course, makes her the perfect nanny for Ray (Fanning), a pint-size hypochondriac and snotty control freak all but abandoned by her mother (Heather Locklear), a high-powered music-industry player. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200308.gz"
