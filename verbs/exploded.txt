INDIA-PAKISTAN-U.S. (Washington) _ The Bush administration, warning on Friday that ``tensions have risen to serious levels'' between India and Pakistan, urged the estimated 60,000 Americans in India for business, study or tourism to leave immediately and advised non-essential diplomats and dependents to depart. By issuing the travel warning, the State Department avoided a more grim step of ordering U.S. Government employees out of India and instead chose, for now, to make the departures voluntary. Canada, Britain, Australia and Germany all issued travel advisories of their own Friday. By Thom Shanker and Elisabeth Bumiller.  An early version of this story has moved.  INDIA-PAKISTAN-ASSESS (Islamabad, Pakistan) _ With South Asia teetering on the edge of war, President Bush has imposed on Pakistan the burden of dragging it back into balance. But the question making its way through the Pakistani capital is whether the country's president, Pervez Musharraf, has as much power as President Bush implies. A news analysis by Dexter Filkins.  RUSSIA-ANTI-SEMITISM (Moscow) _ The sign was the size of a large poster, pounded into a green roadside about 20 miles southwest of here. It stated its ugly message in thick, block letters: ``Death to Yids.'' Although commuters streamed past it for a day, it was Tatyana Sapunova, a 27-year-old Muscovite, who stopped her car on Monday to tear it down. But when she gave it a tug, it exploded, ripping wounds in her legs, hands and face. Doctors say she may not regain the sight in her left eye. Anti-Semitism has deep roots in Russian history and is still present among ordinary people and local authorities, far beyond any attempts by President Vladimir Putin to control or curb it. Yet after suffering state-sponsored oppression for decades under the Soviets and before that for centuries under the czars, Jews in Russia are enjoying a rebirth. Not since the early days of the Bolshevik revolution have there been so many prominent Jews in public life. By Sabrina Tavernise.  STARBUCKS-VIENNA (Vienna, Austria) _ It takes hubris to bring an American coffee shop to Vienna, the city of cafes, and then ban smoking in it. But no one has ever considered Starbucks humble. And the move, a keystone of Starbucks' rapid expansion in Europe, appears to have paid off. Since the Karntnerstrasse coffeehouse opened in December in the heart of Vienna, it has been a resounding success. By Steven Erlanger.  TERROR-FBI (Washington) _ Developments in the inquiry into missed warnings of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. By James Risen and David Johnston.  LIBRARIES-INTERNET (Undated) _ A federal appeals court struck down a law on Friday requiring Internet filters in libraries, saying that the technology blocks so much constitutionally protected material that it would violate the First Amendment rights of library patrons.

ENTERTAINMENT (Moved in ``e'' category)  CREATIVE-CLASS (Undated) _ Should Pittsburgh recruit gays to jump-start its economy? Should Buffalo _ another fiscally flat-lining city _ give tax breaks to bohemians? As policy prescriptions go, these sound absurd. But Richard Florida, a professor at Carnegie Mellon, says that in today's technology-driven economy, towns that have lots of gays and bohemians are likely to thrive. The reason, Florida says, involves an emerging economic force that he dubs the ``Creative Class.'' Comprising doctors, lawyers, scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs and computer programmers _ almost everyone, in short, who is paid to think for a living _ the creative class now accounts for nearly 30 percent of the workforce, Florida writes in his new book, ``The Rise of the Creative Class: And How It's Transforming Work, Leisure, Community and Everyday Life'' (Basic Books). And the presence of gays and bohemians signals an open-minded and varied community of the sort that appeals to software engineers and entrepreneurs. By Emily Eakin.

ACHILLES-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``The Shield of Achilles: War, Peace and the Course of History'' by Philip Bobbitt: It is easy to feel _ as Virginia Woolf once said about an earlier cataclysm _ that after Sept. 11 human consciousness changed, that once the world was more innocent, that no one could guess at the kinds of traumas and transformations that were about to unfold. But judging from this book the historian Philip Bobbitt had a pretty good idea. Even apart from a postscript added on Dec. 13, 2001 and a smattering of inserted footnotes and allusions, Bobbitt's evolutionary map of warfare's impact on the state anticipated the kinds of events still unfolding. Everything that has happened since _ even last week's announcement that Russia is now affiliated with its onetime nemesis NATO _ fits eerily well with his speculations. By Edward Rothstein.
