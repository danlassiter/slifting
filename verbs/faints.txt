As roving diplomatic troubleshooter for the Clinton administration, he has gone in recent years where most Americans fear to tread: North Korea, Cuba, Iraq, Serbia, Nigeria and Myanmar. Now, this Mexican-American politician faces the challenge of using his negotiating skills full time, with the whole world, as President Clinton's nominee for United States ambassador to the United Nations.

Revived by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater this week at City Center, it is a classic with an unquenchably youthful spirit. Created in 1971, the piece is an affectionate, teasing salute to the music of Otis Redding, whose songs provide the dance with a series of mini-plots.

FOR SUN., DEC. 13 -- INVEST-STAMPS-CLR, 12-13 -- Stamps are risky investments, but collectors are seeing steadily higher prices. For Wade Saadi of Manhattan, who owns a computer software business, a collection of stamps from 1869 brought a six-figure profit. ``I discovered that letting go doesn't have to be so painful,'' he explains. (John Sotomayor/New York Times Photo) *LITE  (NYT7) NEW YORK -- Dec. 13, 1996 -- REDDY-MUSIC-REVIEW-CLR, 12-13 -- Helen Reddy performing at Rainbow and Stars. With her taut phrasing, clipped diction and complete absence of romantic involvement in her material, Ms. Reddy has always treated songs as the sort of no-nonsense communications exchanged over a back fence by neighbors hanging out their laundry.

FOR SUN., DEC. 13 -- FUR-CLR, 12-13 -- Many women are so fed up with the aggressive tactics of some fur protesters that they are wearing fur with a new fear-free, militant attitude. ``All my friends have started wearing fur again,'' says Joy Rosenthal, the president of the Rosenthal Bee Co., a jewelry concern, who admits she used to be ``a little afraid'' and had once been confronted by shouting protesters.

Despite its founder's early misgivings, in five of the last six years Ford has earned more from lending money than from selling cars. And now, the car company is expanding into a lending market that would have baffled Henry Ford: borrowers with records of not paying on time.

And this Christmas, Mattel and Bloomingdale's are selling the Calvin Klein Barbie. Gray short-sleeve crop top flaunts a pretty vinyl midriff; black cotton underwear (note the CK waistband peeking from the top of the mini-skirt); blue denim micromini-skirt, with real front pockets (for tiny little credit cards?).

After the leader of the Grateful Dead died of a heart attack at a drug rehabilitation center in August 1995, the estate cut off Carolyn Garcia's monthly payments of $20,883. Garcia's will left one-third of his estate and most of his possessions to his third wife, Deborah Koons Garcia, with most of the rest to be divided among his daughters.

Revived by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater this week at City Center, it is a classic with an unquenchably youthful spirit. Created in 1971, the piece is an affectionate, teasing salute to the music of Otis Redding, whose songs provide the dance with a series of mini-plots.

With her taut phrasing, clipped diction and complete absence of romantic involvement in her material, Ms. Reddy has always treated songs as the sort of no-nonsense communications exchanged over a back fence by neighbors hanging out their laundry. And at Tuesday's opening-night performance of a four-week engagement, that attitude of streamlined efficiency seemed more pronounced than ever.

FOR SUN., DEC. 13 -- FUR-CLR, 12-13 -- Many women are so fed up with the aggressive tactics of some fur protesters that they are wearing fur with a new fear-free, militant attitude. ``All my friends have started wearing fur again,'' says Joy Rosenthal, the president of the Rosenthal Bee Co., a jewelry concern, who admits she used to be ``a little afraid'' and had once been confronted by shouting protesters.
