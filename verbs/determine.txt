"166946"	"they"	"determine"	" The three fishing buddies - State Representative Judd Thompson, John Williams, and Brad Swanson - peruse flies at the Maine Guide Fly Shop and discuss the prospects. Fly hatches are just starting, they determine, so most fishing will be below the surface. Smelt patterns, bead heads, and sinking line are key to getting to the fish this time of year, but the three can't resist the bins of mayflies, grey ghosts, and Hornbergs, and they load up the gear with the promise that accompanies most fishing trips. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
