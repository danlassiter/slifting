"159441"	"you"	"hope)"	" In Mary Kelly's lively exhibition at the Postmasters Gallery in Chelsea -- which is not part of Performa 05 -- you can find a relatively static, object-oriented re-enactment. It consists of three large light-box images that show the restaging of part of a 1970 women's liberation demonstration outside the Albert Hall in London, protesting a beauty contest. Wearing strategically placed lights over their clothing, the participants seem to have swayed and wiggled (in an overtly sexual manner, you hope), creating a rising frenzy of moving light. The work exemplifies the easy intersection of politics and performance art and may look better here than it did the first time around. Mainly, you are glad that this bit of hilarious performance art has now been enshrined for posterity. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
