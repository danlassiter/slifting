"91938"	"she"	"laments"	" In ``A Free Soul,'' she doesn't want to marry; she just wants to enjoy an illicit love affair with the gangster played by Clark Gable. And what goes on in his top-of-the-world aerie is pretty obvious _ no need for the graphic huffing-and-puffing bedroom scenes of today's movies. The same goes for Garbo's Susan Lennox (``Susan Lennox: Her Fall and Rise'') in her passionate, beleaguered affair with Gable, though in her case a wedding ring is all she desires. Ditto Barbara Stanwyck's femme fatale in ``Baby Face.'' When George Brent ``disappoints'' her by buying her the world's biggest jewels, she laments, ``I'd like to have a `' on my tombstone.'' The higher-minded Garbo even throws Gable's ring into the mud, something neither Stanwyck nor Harlow would think of doing _ at least not unless its diamond was simply too small a fish to keep. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"
