NATIONAL _ GENERAL  (Moved in `w' category)  CLINTON-WHITEWATER (Washington) _ The 1990 bank loans at the core of the case prosecutors are building against Bruce Lindsey, President Clinton's most trusted adviser, seem obscure, but during the 1992 presidential race they were the subject of heated debate among campaign aides worried that they could pose a serious political threat. By Jeff Gerth.  FOSTER (Washington) _ Dr. Henry Foster Jr.'s prospects to be surgeon general improved considerably this week, his supporters say. Democrats are increasingly optimistic that Republican efforts to prevent a vote on his nomination will fail. By Robin Toner.  (Moved in `a' category)  CLINTON (East Lansing, Mich.) _ President Clinton came within earshot of the Michigan Militia Friday and in ringing tones denounced as ``wrong and un-American'' any suggestion that citizens' grievances against the federal government could ever justify the threat of violence by paramilitary groups. By Todd S. Purdum.  OKLA-BOMB-SITE (Oklahoma City) _ Barely 14 hours after they called off their mournful search for victims, hundreds of firefighters, police officers and other rescuers Friday stood shoulder to shoulder beside the shattered ruin of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, silent witnesses at a memorial service signaling the end of hope and beginning of healing in this wounded city. By David Gonzalez.  (ART ADV: A photo, NYT14, showing a bomb disposal technician kissing his 2-year-old son, has been sent to NYT photo clients.)  SC-SANDY-ISLAND (Sandy Island, S.C.) _ Sandy Island is one of the two remaining islands in coastal South Carolina that do not have a bridge to the mainland. Its 9-by-12-miles are filled with black water swamps, rolling sand hills, dense forests of tupelo gums and 200-year-old oak trees, and stands of ancient long leaf pine that are home to endangered red cockaded woodpeckers. The island's 135 black residents, mostly descendants of slaves who worked the area's vast rice plantations, have lived for years in virtual isolation as one of the last Gullah communities, a culture in which African customs are preserved. By Ronald Smothers.  (ART ADV: A photo, NYT13, showing the Rev. George Weathers returning to Sandy Island by boat has been sent to NYT photo clients. A graphic locator map has been sent to NYT graphic clients.)  INTERNATIONAL  (Moved in `i' category)  EUROPE-ISLAM-II (Paris) _ Europe's struggle to integrate its minority of 10 million to 13 million Muslims is in crisis. It is more than a profound cultural conflict. It is one with grave echoes of racism, fundamentalism and fears of terrorism. Whether Europe succeeds or fails could have important lessons for the United States, with its own large, new Muslim presence. By Craig R. Whitney. (Second of two articles.)  (ART ADV: A photo, NYT11, showing Yves Hiestand, an accountant who lives in a housing project in Paris that is occupied mostly by Algerian immigrants, has been sent to NYT photo clients.)  BRITAIN-CHANNEL-ISLANDS (St. Helier, Jersey) _ For years the behavior of the Channel Islanders during the German occupation has been a proud footnote in Britain's history. Their storied treatment of the German soldiers with a kind of icy contempt was regarded as emblematic of the fortitude of the British spirit. But recently a spate of documents and studies are emerging that look at the darker side of the occupation, casting a small cloud over the 50th anniversary celebration of what the Channel Islanders call ``Liberation Day,'' on May 9, one day after V-E Day. They show that some did not acquit themselves so well after all. By John Darnton.

A graphic locator map has been sent to NYT graphic clients.)  U.S.-RUSSIA-ASSESS (Washington) _ News Analysis: President Clinton and his top advisers know exactly what they would like to get out of next week's meeting with President Boris Yeltsin of Russia. The trouble, as the advisers concede, is that they no longer see much chance of getting it. By Douglas Jehl.  BUSINESS DAY  (Moved in `f' category)  U.S.-JAPAN-TRADE-1STLD (Undated) _ A last-ditch effort to avoid a major confrontation with Japan over trade in automobiles and parts failed Friday night, and Clinton administration officials said they would decide Saturday what kind of trade sanctions to impose on billions of dollars in Japanese goods imported into the United States. By David E. Sanger.  CIGARETTE-PRICES (Undated) _ Displaying new confidence that the heated legislative climate surrounding the tobacco industry has cooled enough to permit a price increase, the largest U.S. cigarette makers raised their wholesale prices Friday by 3 cents a pack, or nearly 4 percent for premium brands. By Glenn Collins.  RUSSIA-HOTEL (Moscow) _ When Paul Tatum, an American businessman, found that his offices at the luxury hotel he had helped build were locked and sealed off by his erstwhile Russian partners, he donned a bulletproof vest and used an electric drill to force his way in. Such Road Runner-cartoon antics are typical of the frenzied and bizarre battle for control of one of the best-known joint ventures in Russia, the Radisson-Slavyanskaya. Almost all partnerships between Western and Russian companies have experienced financial disputes and cultural misunderstandings, and many have crumbled. But the clash over Moscow's first American-run hotel is the strangest of them all. By Alessandra Stanley.  (ART ADV: A photo, NYT15, showing Paul Tatum barricaded in his hotel room has been sent to NYT photo clients.)  SPORTS  (Moved in `s' category)  BBA-SMITH-COLUMN (Undated) _ These days, Len Coleman, the National League president, worries that precious few households hold baseball in high regard. Somewhere along the way, he knows, the passion and compassion baseball used to generate in large segments of society have withered. Years of labor strife, negative headlines and, most recently, a devastating 234-day strike have seen to that. And as the public votes against the sport by staying away from ball parks, Coleman, a history buff as well as a sports fan, says, ``Baseball needs a Marshall plan.'' By Claire Smith.  RAC-DERBY (Louisville, Ky.) _ ``Sometimes in your mind,'' Julie Krone was saying Friday, ``you have to back up a little and say, `This is just another race.' But galloping Suave Prospect this morning, and breezing him the other day, I got the real feeling that this is what it is: the Kentucky Derby. And I can win it.'' By Joseph Durso.  HKN-PLAYOFFS (Undated) _ After a regular season that was delayed and truncated by a contentious lockout, the Stanley Cup playoffs mark an upbeat return to happy normalcy in the NHL. The top 16 teams pair off in a true test to discover the best. Each round is best-of-seven games. This two-month tournament, beginning Saturday night, promises to present hockey the way it ought to be, even if the Cup isn't won until July 1. By Joe LaPointe.  (ART ADV: A graphic showing the playoff matchings has been sent to NYT graphic clients.)  AMERICA'S-CUP (San Diego) _ There is a moment of truth that comes with any sport, a suspended string of seconds when the world thinks and the competitors feel that things could go either way. In the Super Bowl, it's the opening kickoff. In the World Series, it's the first pitch. And in yachting, it's the first boat over the starting line in the America's Cup. By Barbara Lloyd.  OPINION _ COMMENTARY  (Moved in `k' category)  HERBERT-COLUMN (Undated) _ Why can't we focus on the downsizing buzzsaw? By Bob Herbert.  BAKER-COLUMN (Undated) _ Talk radio aims to please. By Russell Baker.  OBITUARIES  (Moved in `a' category)  PRESTON-OBIT (Washington) _ Lewis Preston, former World Bank president, dies at 68. By David Binder.  SALEMME-OBIT (Undated) _ Antonio Salemme, sculptor and painter, dies at 102. By Roberta Smith.  The N.Y.

(NYT14) LONDON. -- May 16, 1995 -- COVENT-GARDEN-CLR, 5-16 -- The Royal Opera House at Covent Garden, seen at right, has applied for Government help with its scheduled $290 million renovation. Yet for all its confidence that a ``new'' opera house will be born before the year 2000, Covent Garden is not yet home free. Because the funds it is seeking from the Arts Council will come from the profits of a new national lottery, the issue is not just whether the 137-year-old theater needs modernization.

R.E.M.'s listenership has grown since 1989, as its quieter songs have reached a broad radio audience. Since it released its first single in 1981, R.E.M. has written tuneful, assured music for songs suffused with doubt. (Jim Wilson/The New York Times Photo.)  (NYT11) BERKELEY, Calif. -- May 16, 1995 -- ORGANIC-FOODS, 5-16 -- Shoppers for organic produce at places like Berkeley Bowl in Berkeley, Calif., depend largely on the industry to police itself.

Fidelity's explosive growth -- total stocks, bonds and other assets under management have nearly tripled in five years to $294 billion _ is strong testament to its skill in earning money for investors.

(NYT5) KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- May 16, 1995 -- AGING-MOTHERS-KAN-CLR, 5-16 -- Paula (left) and Grace Montgomery visit their mother, Norma, who lives in a Kansas City, MO., nursing home. As the American population ages, a growing number of baby boomers -- those between the ages of 40 and fiftysomething -- are becoming caregivers for aging, severely ill parents.(Talis Bergmanis/Kansas City Star Photo.)  (NYT4) DOUGLAS, Ariz. --May 16, 1995 -- AZ-CHAINGANGS-AZG-2-CLR, 5-16 -- Chained prisoners go about their new job of pounding big rocks into little rocks Monday in the ``bone yard'' at Arizona State Prison. While officials don't know when the last chain gang worked in Arizona -- if one ever did -- Warden John Hallahan said it's an idea whose time has come. (Mark Henle/Phoenix Gazette Photo.)  (NYT3) DOUGLAS, Ariz. --May 16, 1995 --AZ-CHAINGAINS-AZG-1-CLR, 5-16 --Leg chains and guards with shotguns keep prisoners captive while they work outside Arizona State Prison for the first time Monday. The prisoners were cutting and piling brush in ditches along state Highway 191. The prisoners earn 10 cents an hour while working on the chain gangs. (Mark Henle/Phoenix Gazette Photo.)  (NYT2) TEMPE, Ariz. -- May 16, 1995 -- TURTLE-REPAIR-AZG-CLR, 5-16 --Frosty the turtle was squished by a car in the driveway of its owner's home on April 25 but lived with the help of a deft-handed veterinarian and a Corvette repair kit, used to rebuild the turtle's shell. Miles Wickersham holds the family pet, who lost an eye in the accident. (Amy Blodgett/Phoenix Gazette Photo.)  (NYT1) LOS ANGELES. -- May 16, 1995 -- L.A.-YOUTH-PROGRAM, 5-16 -- He tries shocking them; he tries loving them. He orders them to do push-ups; he lets them dance. Detective Frank DiPaola of the Los Angeles Police Department pulls out all the stops in his innovative program for troubled teen-agers, but for most of them, he knows, it is useless.

(NYT20) NEW YORK. -- May 16, 1995 -- NY-MUSEUM-DINOSAURS, 5-16 -- The Tyrannosaurus rex, as newly rendered at the American Museum of Natural History,  now looks more like an attacking bird than like Godzilla. But the ferocious jaw and teeth still threaten to rend unwary flesh. The old version is against the wall. (Fred R. Conrad/New York Times Photo.)  (NYT19) NEW YORK. -- May 16, 1995 -- U.S.-JAPAN-TRADE, 5-16 -- Imposition of a 100 percent tariff may decimate American sales of 13 luxury car models imported from Japan, including the Nissan Infiniti. Potential customers inspected a car at Pepe Infiniti in White Plains. (Chris Maynard/New York Times Photo.)  (NYT18) NEW YORK. -- May 16, 1995 -- HAITIAN-DEFENDER, 5-16 -- Sony Eskite is in immigration limbo: approved to enter the United States but then barred from seeking asylum because of drug conviction. What sets him apart from probably every detainee in immigration custody across the country is that Eskite, a 36-year-old fisherman from southern Haiti, has a U.S. Army colonel fighting to set him free. (Angel Franco/New York Times Photo.)  (NYT17) POTSDAM, NY -- May 16, 1995 -- TECH-CONTEST-EDUC, 5-16 -- At Clarkson University, engineering students learn by taking part in engineering competitions. Tuesday, at the university's Center for Advanced Materials Processing, students placed solar panels on the the composite shell of a solar-powered car they are building for next month's 1,150-mile Sunrayce. (Michael Okoniewski/New York Times Photo)  (NYT16) NEW YORK. -- May 16, 1995 -- STROKES-CHILDREN, 5-16 -- Strokes are not something commonly associated with children. ``Pediatric stroke is not common, but it's not uncommon,'' said Dr. Steven G. Pavlakis, clinical assistant professor of neurology and pediatrics at Cornell University Medical College in New York. At left, Shawntell Royal, now 18, with her brother Terrance Dalton. She has had two strokes. (Scott Anger/New York Times Photo). At right, Starricha Bailey, now 6, had a stroke at the age of 3 and must still wear a brace on one leg. (Terrence McCarthy/New York Times Photo)  (NYT15) NEW YORK. -- May 16, 1995 -- DOUGLAS-WRITER-PROFILE, 5-16 -- Ann Douglas at the Algonquin. ``Terrible Honesty'' is feisty, arguing, among other things, that modern American culture began in the 1920's with the fusing _ the ``mongrelization'' _ of black and white cultures, a theory that runs counter to the separatist underpinnings of contemporary multiculturalism. The book is the work of a formidably restless mind. (Jose R. Lopez/New York Times Photo.)  (NYT14) LONDON. -- May 16, 1995 -- COVENT-GARDEN-CLR, 5-16 -- The Royal Opera House at Covent Garden, seen at right, has applied for Government help with its scheduled $290 million renovation. Yet for all its confidence that a ``new'' opera house will be born before the year 2000, Covent Garden is not yet home free. Because the funds it is seeking from the Arts Council will come from the profits of a new national lottery, the issue is not just whether the 137-year-old theater needs modernization. (Johnathan Player/New York Times Photo.)  (NYT13) NEW YORK. -- May 16, 1995 -- ARIADNE-OPERA-REVIEW-CLR, 5-16 -- Wolfgang Sawallisch and members of the Philadelphia Orchestra. It was resonant with old-world geniality, its good-natured charm informed by long experience, its cheerfulness verging on wisdom. This concert, along with several ``Ariadnes'' in Philadelphia (the last is Saturday night), are Sawallisch's first full-scale opera performances in the United States. (G. Paul Burnett/New York Times Photo.)  (NYT12) MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- R.E.M.-MUSIC-REVIEW, 5-16 -- Michael Stipe of R.E.M at Shoreline Ampitheater in Mountain View, Calif., on Monday night. R.E.M.'s listenership has grown since 1989, as its quieter songs have reached a broad radio audience. Since it released its first single in 1981, R.E.M. has written tuneful, assured music for songs suffused with doubt. (Jim Wilson/The New York Times Photo.)  (NYT11) BERKELEY, Calif. -- May 16, 1995 -- ORGANIC-FOODS, 5-16 -- Shoppers for organic produce at places like Berkeley Bowl in Berkeley, Calif., depend largely on the industry to police itself. The Government is considering regulating organic foods. (Terrence McCarthy/New York Times Photo.)  (NYT10) BOSTON, Mass. -- May 16, 1995 -- FIDELITY-FORTUNE-BOS-CLR, 5-16 -- Fidelity trading room in Boston. Fidelity's explosive growth -- total stocks, bonds and other assets under management have nearly tripled in five years to $294 billion _ is strong testament to its skill in earning money for investors. But as its investment portfolios grow, so do the number of executives who feel Fidelity's grip on their companies is too tight. (Frank O'Brien/Boston Globe Photo.)  (NYT9) PROVIDENCE, RI. -- May 16, 1995 -- GEHRIG-BOS-CLR, 5-16 -- Providence Journal columnist Brian Dickinson prepares to work on a column at his computer. His son Andy helps him line up his computer control. Brian suffers from Lou Gerhig's disease. Dickinsons' primary caregivers are his wife and three sons -- besides Andrew, there are the 25-year-old fraternal twins, Jonathan and Matthew -- who have become his dressers, nurses, cooks, drivers, readers, page turners and companions. Working a shift has become known as being ``on Dad.''(Mark Wilson/Boston Globe Photo.)  (NYT8) UNDATED. -- May 16, 1995 -- BRAIN-MUSIC-SCI, 5-15 -- Sound entering ear is converted into nerve impulses by hair cells in cochlea. Impulses are transmitted into auditory cortex, where specialized regions, especially in right cerebral hemisphere, are thought to analyze musical features like pitch and timbre. (Michael Reingold/New York Times Illustration.)  (NYT7) SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. -- May 16, 1995 -- MISSILE-PARK-SFCRHON-2-CLR, 5-16 -- Ron Parshall, who used to work at the Fort Berry Nike base during the Cold War helped restore an underground bunker that now houses an unarmed Hercules missile. The base lay fallow for years, rusting, as did nearly 400 other Nike missile sites nationwide that were also closed in the 1970s. (Brant Ward/San Francisco Chronicle Photo.)  (NYT6) SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. -- May 16, 1995 -- MISSILE-PARK-SFCRHON-1-CLR, 5-16 -- The missle tracking radar at the Fort Berry Nike missle site attracts a crowd during tours of the recently opened facilty. The site was once a top-secret base, but is now open to visitors. The Army abandoned the base in 1974 as part of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, turning over the keys to the Park Service.

"23893"	"he"	"knows"	" There, he knows, waits Chavez, the fading Mexican superstar whom Gonzalez wants to unseat both as WBC champion and as champion of all Mexico. It borders on hubris for a young Mexican fighter to think such thoughts, yet Gonzalez does so even though he knows such a fight might keep his mother in the church chapel for weeks before it happened. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"25110"	"he"	"knows"	" Behind the weird look and the menacing eyes, though, Gonzalez likes his laughs. His accent is outrageous, he knows, and he chuckles when he mispronounces an Anglo-Saxon expletive. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"27735"	"he"	"knows"	" Seattle's Randy Johnson accepted all this with a shrug and a smile as he hovered over a low microphone like some sort of mustachioed vulture. This, he knows, is Hideo Nomo's All-Star Game, perhaps even the Japanese pitching sensation's year, and Monday's media frenzy only served to underscore the point. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"30990"	"he"	"knows"	" ``Call Gene Orza, he knows,'' was the advice of a New York Times baseball guru, during an SOS call to the office. No, thank you. This was already becoming a tad too laborious without having to consult another cranky players' union lawyer. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"31612"	"she"	"knows"	" When our little girl goes over the handlebars, there is one less experienced voice to tell us she'll heal. When our basement floods, there is one less person to advise against a costly drainage system. Next spring, she knows, the underground streams will shift again and the house next door will flood. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"35186"	"he"	"knows"	" He will watch, he knows, until the moment medical science and his mind agree his left shoulder is healed sufficiently to allow him to play. At that moment, regardless of what Scott Zolak may have done in his absence, Drew Bledsoe will get the clicker back in his hand. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"37161"	"he"	"knows"	" ``Bubby's been there, he's seen it, he knows,'' coach Rich Kotite said after practice Thursday. Granted, Brister didn't see Carolina's Sam Mills Sunday when he attempted a shovel pass and ended up shoveling it to Mills. But we're talking short-term survival here. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"40195"	"she"	"knows"	" Her oldest daughter, a gifted 15-year-old, will take courses at Mesa by next fall. America's campuses, she knows, are stocked with criminal and anti-social notions regarding date rape and physical abuse. Changing these attitudes is obviously more important than the symbolism of punishing Parker. But then, to impressionable kids, symbols do count. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"
"42034"	"he"	"knows"	" This, he knows, is unacceptable. Yet while some fans boo and others grow concerned that ``The Franchise'' may have turned out to be a mirage, Bledsoe is unconcerned, or at least not overly concerned. That is not the same as not being unhappy, because he is that. But Bledsoe knows this valley is just something he must pass through on his way to Pleasant Valley, where fans cheer and teammates stay for the whole season and even the biggest contract seems justified. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
"42265"	"she"	"knows"	" Stringer is in no way frightened by the challenge that is Rutgers. There are nuggets to be found there, she knows, like the large population base, the administrative support, the opportunity and the potential. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
"43135"	"she"	"knows"	" Sure there's skeptics out there, she knows, media cynics. But . . . </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
"52887"	"he"	"knows"	" His team is struggling, he knows, and it's time to try something different. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"
"53057"	"he"	"knows"	" Basketball, he knows, is like religion here, and not because the Wildcats have players named Mohammad and Pope. The argument could be made that Pitino is the perfect U.K. coach, an obsessive basketball junkie for an insatiable basketball audience. DiRaimo still worries that his friend is in for incalculable grief should he happen to lose next weekend in New Jersey. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"
"54130"	"he"	"knows"	" But the avenue to fulfilling his responsibility, he knows, is public education, which, ``for all its widespread and longstanding entanglement with racial segregation,'' is ``predicated on the completely democratic assumption that individual development, self-realization and self-fulfillment is a matter of inspiring learning contexts not of one's family background and certainly not a matter of one's ancient racial forebears.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"
"57862"	"she"	"knows"	" Soon, she knows, the site will be graded, the road extended across it, and the Thunder Mountain Ranch development will begin stretching across 91 acres at the west end of Sedona, with 87 single-family lots and 56 town homes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"
"59289"	"she"	"knows"	" To her, the effort and the result are the same thing. Others, she knows, only see the result. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960517.0277 type=story > <HEADLINE> FRIDAY'S EUROPEAN MARKETS: BONDS, STOCKS GAIN; DOLLAR STEADY </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> London, May 17 (Bloomberg) (BC-EUROPEAN-MARKETS-BLOOM) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"

"65232"	"he"	"knows"	" But, of course, he knows, and much of America now knows, what with the huge sales of his best-selling memoir, ``My American Journey,'' just released in paperback (Ballantine, $6.99). This is a quintessential Horatio Alger tale, the kind of good-guy-makes-good story that makes readers feel good about the subject and themselves. Which may be why Random House paid this first-time author an advance of $6 million, the highest ever. Even when Powell warned that, in this age of tell-all, he is no tattler. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"
"65725"	"she"	"knows"	" After playing professionally in Italy, Japan, Spain and France since leaving the University of Georgia in 1986, Edwards is ready to come home as the women's game prepares to try again on the professional level in America with not one but two competing leagues. All that will be made easier, she knows, by a gold medal here in Atlanta, and she takes her role as the wizened veteran seriously. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"
"66369"	"he"	"knows"	" This sort of opportunity, he knows, may never come his way again. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"
"68680"	"he"	"knows"	" The fight is for Rosenblatt's lightly regarded World Boxing Union supermiddleweight title. Pazienza, a three-time world champion who is 40-6 with 27 knockouts, can still apply pressure well and keep his hands high. But a devastating loss, he knows, will probably mean his career is over. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199608.gz"
"69061"	"he"	"knows"	" Meanwhile, his celebrity and his passion, he knows, are the best things to happen to the paralyzed since Jon Voight made love to Jane Fonda in the film ``Coming Home'' (1978). </P> "	"nyt_eng_199608.gz"
"69221"	"he"	"knows"	" Meanwhile, his celebrity and his passion, he knows, are the best things to happen to the paralyzed since Jon Voight made love to Jane Fonda in the film ``Coming Home'' (1978). </P> "	"nyt_eng_199608.gz"
"69339"	"he"	"knows"	" Meanwhile, his celebrity and his passion, he knows, are the best things to happen to the paralyzed since Jon Voight made love to Jane Fonda in the film ``Coming Home'' (1978). </P> "	"nyt_eng_199608.gz"
"69613"	"he"	"knows"	" Some boats do turn back. He sees them coming past heading back toward the Vineyard. The ones that keep on, he knows, have electronic tracking devices, LORAN (land stations) or GPS (satellites). He has always eschewed these gadgets as an unnecessary expense in waters he knows so well, and since most summers rarely have any serious fog. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199608.gz"
"70769"	"he"	"knows"	" This is not the time for hot rhetoric, he knows, because his team already is in danger of a meltdown. His players do not need to hear him hollering and threatening and complaining because everywhere the Patriots go they hear people hollering and threatening and complaining. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"
"71192"	"he"	"knows"	" The concern is real for senior TCU defensive lineman Gaylon Hyder. Any play, he knows, could be the one that sidelines him. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"
"74410"	"she"	"knows"	" Her third husband, a sea captain, takes her to Virginia, where she meets her mother-in-law, played by Diana Rigg with a sternness that turns to wit. Moll discovers that her mother-in-law is her own long-lost mother; she has unknowingly married her brother. The mother-in-law is sorry to see that marriage break up. While some men wouldn't mind sleeping with their sisters, she knows, her son would. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"
"79190"	"he"	"knows"	" That sentiment, he knows, is by no means universal in L.A. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"
"81574"	"he"	"knows"	" ``Ty Detmer, he knows, he better not ever make another comment like that as long as he's an Eagle football player,'' Rhodes said. ``He knows I don't condone that, and he knows it was very inappropriate to say something like that.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"
"98555"	"he"	"knows"	" Eric Ramirez mans a subway token booth in downtown Brooklyn for a living. He has never been a soldier and never expected to face the dangers of going to war. Still, Ramirez, 38, understands that if terrorists hit the subways, he may suddenly find himself in the thick of the battle. The front line, he knows, may come to him. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"

"100725"	"she"	"knows"	" Eventually, she knows, she will have to stop the neighbors from bringing dinner and the schoolteachers from excusing the children from tests and Tommy, over at Lou's Hot Dogs, from feeding the family free. She needs to do this because she is determined to teach them, as Joe would have taught them, that they are not entitled to anything they aren't willing to work for. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"101216"	"she"	"knows"	" The present, she knows, is more clouded. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"

"103957"	"she"	"knows"	" Her celebrity, which she jokes about, and her willingness to tell her story, which she has never apologized for, have cost her. It made her a household name even as it smudged her dignity. Many people, she knows, wanted her to vanish. As Republicans celebrated the damage she did to Democrats, Democrats attacked her credibility. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"

"104839"	"she"	"knows"	" That's the way it is and ought to be, in her view, and not just in Belle Glade but in all the other places with MLKs _ and that, she knows, is a lot of places, because every place she goes, she looks. ``Every town,'' she says, ``got a Martin Luther King.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"106537"	"she"	"knows"	" This, she knows, is how dreams are fulfilled, one class, one day, one stunning opportunity at a time. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"106919"	"he"	"knows"	" At every given opportunity, Weld displays deep disdain for the Republicans, Democrats, and independents who twice elected him governor of this state. Why? Maybe it has something to do with the fact that those same voters were smart enough not to send him to Washington as their senator. Now, Weld doesn't just think, he knows, he is way too smart for the likes of us. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
