"38680"	"you"	"scream"	" ``We'll be in hallways and outside closed doors, we'll be talking to congressmen and their staff,'' said one veteran lobbyist. ``At this point, not too many people are debating policy. They are debating the dollars,'' he said. ``They are trying to get it all to fit. Add up.'' ``If you think you are getting cut out, you scream, you scream louder than anyone else -- in private and in public,'' the lobbyist said. Ugoretz isn't screaming. The head of the ERISA Industry Committee is talking softly, saying that allowing firms to dip into overfunded employee pension funds makes sense. ``It is a very reasonable proposal and it wouldn't jeopardize any pension plan -- none,'' Ugoretz said. ``There are several companies whose pension funds are so well funded that they if they took $2 billion out, and never made another contribution, they could still pay off all liability for the next 30 years,'' he said. More than a dozen of the 100 most overfunded pension funds are run by ERISA Industry Committee members. They are: GTE, Citibank, BellSouth, Prudential Life, Hearst, Ameritech, Mutual Life Insurance, Bankers Trust, Pacific Telesis Group, Textron, Chemical Bank, Pfizer, Digital Equipment, Ralston Purina, Chase Manhattan Bank, Whirlpool, Anheuser-Busch and Goodyear. Proponents maintain the provision would generate $9.5 billion in revenue for the government over seven years, by subjecting money withdrawn from pension funds to federal taxes. Perhaps so. But President Clinton fears the provision could lead to a corporate raid on pension funds. And he has the power of the veto. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"

"155005"	"you"	"scream"	" I scream, you scream, we all scream for little nuggets of ice cream that we can pop into our mouths while driving. Who knew? Edy's new Dibs, bite-size chocolate-coated ice cream in five flavors, make eating ice cream an on-the-go occasion. A serving is 26 frosty nuggets, easy to blast through while concentrating on something else, say, traffic. At least it allows for less messy eating than bringing a Drumstick or popsicle along in the car, and you can always stop at five or six nuggets. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"171351"	"they"	"scream"	" Costner plays Ben Randall, the veteran Coast Guard swimmer taken off active duty and charged with whipping a new class of recruits into shape. Swimming champ Jake (Kutcher) has the most promise, but Randall believes, when push comes to shove, he'll choose himself over people in need. The two fight, they scream, they vomit, they bond. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
