Stories are moving in the category shown at the end of each budget item.  Lifestyle, Entertainment  ADVENT _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Christians seem to have split personalities in December. They celebrate Advent, that four-week period of happy preparation for Christmas that began Sunday. Christmas carols, shopping, parties and pageants fill every minute. Right? Or is Advent a penitential season that awaits the coming of Christ in judgment at the end of time? That would mean hymns of longing and time on your knees in repentance and prayer. So, is Advent a time of happy anticipation or solemn preparation? Yes. (l)  GARDENLIFE _ undated _ GARDENING LIFE: Tree guarantees and allergies.

(a)  SHAMING-2takes _ FORT PIERCE, Fla. _ Circuit Judge Larry Schack is a meticulous man who is almost fanatical about following the law to the letter. Recently, however, he has joined judges nationwide who are going beyond the statutes to impose unconventional punishments to shame law-breakers into changing their ways. Last month, Schack sentenced a child molester to post a sign on his home warning children away. He announced plans to make another child molester wear a T-shirt advertising his conviction. This month, he ordered a woman to place a newspaper ad publicizing the fact that she bought drugs while her children were with her in the car.

(s)  Commentary  EZZARD-COLUMN _ undated _ First Lady Hillary Clinton is about to put on her policy-adviser hat again _ this time on welfare reform _ and we can expect her detractors to aim their hollow arrows at it anew. Her best shield for deflecting them may be to let her hair down, to show more passion for her cause. (k)  SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Each year I use the Hitchcock thriller ``Rear Window'' as a teaching tool, not only as a prep for a writing assignment, but as a subtle means of showing my eighth-graders that movies can be engrossing without being graphic and that people can be in love without heavy panting and prurient acrobatics. At first they don't get it. Before long they're involved. (k)  BORDERS-COLUMN _ NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Texas music for driving down a red-dirt road.
