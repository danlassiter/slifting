"43397"	"he"	"drinks"	" Many of the movie's silliest laughs are provided by Burgess Meredith, who plays Lemmon's lewd 95-year-old father. He smokes, he drinks, he eats bacon, and he has sex on the brain. In one of the suplots, he shamelessly hits on Loren's mother, played with angry passion by Ann Guilbert _ yes, Millie Helper from ``The Dick Van Dyke Show'' and Fran Drescher's grandmother on ``The Nanny.'' As with the other relationships in this movie, their friction is a sure sign of love. In a less entertaining subplot, Kevin Pollack and Daryl Hannah return as Matthau's son and Lemmon's daughter, this time with a severe case of the premarital jitters. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
