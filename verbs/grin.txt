"160754"	"we"	"grin"	" BOREDOM -- WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- There are things that we do -- ridiculous, borderline criminal -- during our teens and early 20s that we don't do later in life. Recalling the incidents, we grin, shake our heads and forget. But logging onto boredom-induced.com will bring everything back. It's here that a group of South Florida teens and twentysomethings have taken to recording short skits, pranks, videos -- anything, really -- and uploading them to the Web. Posting weekly or biweekly for nearly three years, the group has already produced more than 100 episodes. (Marion, The Palm Beach Post) </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
