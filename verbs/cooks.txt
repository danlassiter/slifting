Get beyond the recipes that attempt to out-Food &amp; Wine Food &amp; Wine and you understand why Madison thinks it's important to leave her hometown market in Santa Fe, N.M., to travel to Madison, Wis., to San Francisco, to Alabama, to Calgary in Canada, and of course to Union Square in Manhattan. She shops, she cooks, she samples restaurants, she takes very good notes. Her vignettes capture the seductiveness of gathering in an open-air spot to buy local peaches from the people who picked them. She observes that markets make a small town out of a big one, and she moves past the cliche of smiling, happy shoppers in the photographs to offer the more trenchant observation that ``rage is rare'' in farmers' markets. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
