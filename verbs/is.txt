They move weekly to clients of the New York Times News Service.   G: General audiences. Nothing that would offend parents if viewed by children.   PG: Parental guidance suggested. May contain some material parents consider inappropriate for young children.   PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for preteens.   R: Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking children.   NC-17: No one under 17 admitted. Replaces the X rating.   NR: Not rated.   . . STILL PLAYING   Above the Rim R   A perfectly commendable above-average after-school special, except for one problem: It thinks it's a real movie, aimed, perhaps, at the ``New Jack City'' crowd. Duane Martin (a Knicks prospect-turned-actor) stars as a high school hotshot who sees a college athletic scholarship as his ticket out of Harlem and into the NBA.   Ace Ventura: Pet Detective PG-13   Jim Carrey, the ``In Living Color'' regular plays an animal-loving goofball who specializes in missing pets. The script, alas, is the sort of appalling mishmash often used to launch cross-over stand-up comics. It's full of needless T-and-A jokes and homophobic humor that make it inappropriate for the younger teens who'd otherwise get the biggest kick out of the star's antics.   Baby's Day Out PG   A very long day indeed, for Baby and for the audience. This John Hughes-ian spin on ``The Ransom of Red Chief'' is best recommended to die-hard slapstick fans who've always wanted to see a remake of ``Three Men and a Baby,'' starring the Three Stooges. Posing as baby photographers, three bumbling crooks (Joe Mantegna, Joe Pantoliano, Brian Haley) kidnap 9-month-old Bennington August Cottwell IV, a.k.a., Baby Bink. They quickly learn that grabbing a curious tot is a lot easier than holding onto him.   Bad Girls R   Madeleine Stowe, Andie MacDowell, Drew Barrymore and Mary Stuart Masterson are working girls out West, on the run to Oregon, after Stowe plugs a murderously unruly client. While it's nice to see, finally, that even cowgirls get to ride off into the sunset, overall, ``Bad Girls'' just wants to have fun. You will, too.   Bitter Moon R   One loony movie. Internationally known naughty-boy Roman Polanski takes us on a luxury cruise with two couples. Nigel and Fiona (Hugh Grant and Kristin Scott Thomas) are stiff-upper-lip Brits trying to rekindle their marriage. Wheelchair-bound Oscar and his voluptuous wife, Mimi (Peter Coyote and Emmanuelle Seigner) are . . . well, what they are is pretty much the point of this hilariously preposterous tale of sexual obsession.   Blink R   Never mind the stink-bomb title. This is a sublimely entertaining romantic thriller with a pair of stars (Madeleine Stowe and Aidan Quinn) who are that rare thing: startlingly beautiful actors who can also act. Quinn is a Chicago detective with a messy murder on his hands. Luckily, he's got an eyewitness . . . of sorts. Stowe may have seen the killer leave the scene. The operative word is may; thanks to a recent corneal transplant, she's still not sure what she sees and what she thinks she sees.   Blown Away R   This so-so thriller won't blow anyone away. Jeff Bridges is a steely nerved, magic-fingered veteran of the Boston Bomb Squad; Tommy Lee Jones is a psycho who can ``make a bomb out of Bisquick.'' Because of a shared shady past, Jones becomes obsessed with Bridges and starts blowing away everyone near and dear to him.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19940708.0057 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(2ndtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> City Slickers II -- The Legend of Curly's Gold PG-13   Not as feel-good slick as its hugely popular predecessor, but funnier and far loopier in its own shaggy-dog way. Billy Crystal co-wrote, produced and stars in this sequel that sends him out West in search of buried gold. The movie is a half-hour too long, but at least Crystal hasn't pulled a ``Rocky,'' i.e., re-made the exact same movie and affixed a Roman numeral to it.   The Cowboy Way PG-13   The Woody Way. This action-comedy is going to catapult Woody Harrelson waaaaay up the ranks of Hollywood leading men. His self-assuredness -- make that, cocksuredness -- is the most interesting aspect of this otherwise sadly synthetic fish-out-of-water film. Harrelson and Kiefer Sutherland play rodeo champs from New Mexico who brave the arcane terrors of New York City to rescue a Cuban friend and his daughter.   The Crow R   The true- life tragedy hanging over this action film -- a misfired prop gun that killed star Brandon Lee on the set -- is a lot creepier than anything in the movie itself. Still, it's more than a morbid curiosity, thanks to the young star himself; this doomed son of the late Bruce Lee inherited more from his famous dad than bad karma. Lee plays a dead rock musician who rises from the grave to avenge the murders of himself and his fiancee.   D2: The Mighty Ducks PG   The mightiest thing about the first ``Mighty Ducks'' was its box-office clout -- far more than anyone expected from a hackneyed rehash of ``The Bad News Bears,'' with an almost-has-been Emilio Estevez as its star. This lame sequel simply repeats the same underdog plot.   The Endless Summer II PG   It's been a long time between waves for filmmaker Bruce Brown who, in 1964, parlayed a $50,000 paean to the zen of surfing into a $30 million hit. The surf's still up in this sequel of sorts as Brown focuses his camera on impish Robert ``Wingnut'' Weaver and towheaded Pat O'Connell. These two embark on a globe- trotting odyssey from Costa Rica to Java, in search of the perfect wave. When the movie stays in the water, it is, to coin a phrase, awesome. But on dry land, the movie is all wet.   Even Cowgirls Get the Blues R   Even talented directors make mistakes. And Gus Van Sant (``My Own Private Idaho'') has made a doozy with this abysmal adaptation of Tom Robbins's 1976 novel. The movie focuses on Sissy Hankshaw (a blank Uma Thurman), a former model who's also the best hitchhiker in the nation. Her secret: thumbs the size of kumquats.   Fear of a Black Hat R   It's a black thing and everyone will understand. That's how very funny, how very accessible this hilarious spoof is. No matter how rap- savvy you are or aren't (you can't tell Kris Kross from Salt-N-Pepa or you know every track on ``Fear of a Black Planet''), you'll be knocked out by this rude, crude, no-holds-barred satire. Filmmaker Rusty Cundieff does for rap what ``Spinal Tap'' did for heavy metal; he skewers it with a mix of affection, wit and insight.   The Flintstones PG   Hits rock bottom. The early buzz around Hollywood on this live-action version of the '60s animated TV series was that it ``skewed young.'' Translation: It's even stupider than they meant it to be. The plot, which somehow needed the talents of 35 writers, follows Fred's (John Goodman) precipitous ``Hudsucker Proxy''-ish rise from quarry worker to vice president of Slate and Co. when a villainous exec (Kyle MacLachlan) and his shapely assistant (Halle Berry) need a fall guy for their greedy schemes.   Forrest Gump PG-13   Tom Hanks is clueless in America in Robert Zemeckis's half-baked fable about an idiot-savant of sorts, skimming through the last half of the 20th century and colliding, ``Zelig''-like, with history. Forrest, who has the IQ of a kumquat, nevertheless manages to play football for Bear Bryant, become a hero in Vietnam, visit with presidents, play pingpong in Mao's China, etc. It's Hollywood's idea of an offbeat yet profound fable about the meaning of life; alas, it comes off like an Oliver Stone movie starring Gomer Pyle. Zemeckis creates an effective and often hilarious running gag in Forrest's constant run-ins with destiny -- whether teaching Elvis his swivel-hipped shimmy or calling security on a certain fateful night at the Watergate Hotel. But the movie is a one-trick pony, a superb technological gimmick/cultural cosmic joke tied to a TV-movie plot. Far more impressive than Zemeckis's techno- sleight-of-hand is the steadying integrity of the Hanks portrayal. His Southern- fried Holy Fool brings the movie focus, giving it a heart to make up for its lack of brains.   Four Weddings and a Funeral R   Hugh Grant is a charming British bachelor -- the always-a-groomsman-never-the-groom type -- who meets an equally charming American (Andie MacDowell) at the first of the film's nuptials. His not-quite- pursuit, not-quite-not-pursuit of her is the main plot-thread of this stylish froth. However, most of the film is about the delicate balance of emotion and humor that's inherent in such life-changing social rituals. This dapper valentine of a movie delivers even more than the title promises: four weddings, a funeral and a happy ending.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19940708.0058 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(3rdtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Getting Even With Dad PG   The Mac is back -- sans ballet slippers and doing what he does best. Namely, acting out every kid's fantasy of outwitting every available adult and getting away with it. A ponytailed Ted Danson plays an ex-con who's been tempted into one last job -- stealing a cache of rare coins. However, he's suddenly saddled with his estranged son (Macaulay Culkin) who soon figures out what Danson is up to and has his own plan for the purloined coins, i.e., using them as blackmail to make his dad behave like a dad for a week.   Go Fish R   Director/writer Rose Troche has made one of the best relationship movies of the year; it just happens to be about same-sex relationships. Set in a vibrant lesbian community in Chicago, this romantic comedy is a girl-meets-girl story whose gender orientation may be specific and, for most mainstream audiences, exotic. However, the film's ruefully on-target observations about the perils of the dating game are pretty universal.   I Love Trouble PG   I love Julia Roberts and I love Nick Nolte but I didn't love their movie, no matter how hard I tried. Chances are, you won't either. The two play rival reporters working the same story. The movie just gets thinner and thinner until there's nothing to hold your attention except the leads. Luckily, that's what Nolte and Roberts do best: he's grizzled and adorable; she's incandescent and adorable. But their movie gives them nothing but trouble.   The Inkwell R   Where is Charles Burnett when we need him? This extremely promising material -- about family clashes, summer crushes and more during a 1976 beach vacation -- has been directed by Matty Rich (``Straight Out of Brooklyn'') who simply doesn't yet have the maturity to explore the story's wonderful array of characters and contradictions.   Jurassic Park PG-13   Steven Spielberg's spectacular dinosaur extravaganza has raptors and brachiosaurus and more oh-my! than any movie in recent memory.   Like Water for Chocolate R   Set in the early 20th century on a sprawling ranch near the U.S. border, the movie is about Tita (Lumi Cavazos) who's literally born in a kitchen and then tied to her tyrannical mother's apron strings by a family tradition that decrees the youngest daughter must never marry (instead, she must devote her life to taking care of mom). Relegated to the role of family cook while her sister marries her beloved (Marco Leonardi), Tita becomes something of a kitchen magician, i.e., whatever she's feeling is channelled into whatever she's cooking.   The Lion King G   A royal entertainment, fit for kids and kings. This classy, beautifully drawn cartoon effortlessly takes its place in the superb cycle of Disney neo- classics.The lion cub Simba (voice by Jonathan Taylor Thomas, then Matthew Broderick) must reclaim his throne after his evil uncle, Scar (Jeremy Irons doing Claus Von Bulow with a mane), connives to have Simba's father, King Mufasa (James Earl Jones), killed.   Little Big League PG   A baseball-mad 12-year-old (Luke Edwards) becomes the new owner/manager of the Minnesota Twins when his gramps (Jason Robards) leaves him the team in his will. The boy helps the Twins discover their winning ways by reclaiming their inner child. The movie is innocuous enough, if you don't mind how brazenly it rips off the far better ``Rookie of the Year.''   Little Buddha PG   You won't find nirvana in this visually ravishing, dramatically inept epic about Buddhism. The picture is an unwieldy hybrid of two stories. In the past, Prince Siddhartha (Keanu Reeves) leaves his protected palace to learn about suffering and death. In the present, an aged Tibetan monk goes to Seattle to see if a boy named Jesse is the reincarnation of his former master.   Maverick PG-13   In the parlance of its poker-playing hero, this dumb- fun western draws a winning hand. Not a royal flush, perhaps, but a solid three- of-a-kind -- the three being Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and James Garner, who glide smoothly over the movie's rougher spots.   Monkey Trouble PG   An innocuously enjoyable kids' film with some nice things to say about responsibility and learning to get along with stepfamilies. Thora Birch (``Paradise'') stars as an animal-mad 9-year-old who really wants a pet. Trouble is, her new stepdad is really allergic to fur. So when an adorable Capucin monkey literally drops out into her arms out of nowhere, she's ecstatic -- and very careful to keep him hidden. What she doesn't know is that her new pet in on the lam from his brutal owner (Harvey Keitel) who trained him as a pickpocket par excellence.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19940708.0059 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(4thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Naked Gun 331/3 PG-13   More comic overkill from the ``Naked Gun'' hit factory. Leslie Nielsen is back as Lt. Frank Drebin, the best (worst?) thing to happen to law enforcement since Inspector Clousseau. Newly retired from the squad, he's called back into duty to foil a terrorist plot being hatched by Fred Ward.   The Paper R   OK, so it's about as accurate about life at a newspaper as the ``Naked Gun'' movies are about police work. That said, this is still an awfully entertaining picture, one that captures the cynicism, the sick humor, the deadline pressure and the sheer adrenaline-rush love of putting out a daily.   Philadelphia PG-13   Tom Hanks gives an Oscar- winning performance as a fast-track lawyer who sues his former firm after being fired for incompetence (hmmm, and they just gave him a promotion). Convinced he was let go because he was HIV-positive, Hanks wants his day in court to prove it.   The Princess and the Goblin G   This is a perfectly pleasant animated feature based on a popular Victorian children's novel by Scotsman George MacDonald. Princess Irene ventures out of her protected castle one day and discovers there are goblins out there. Literally. Worse, they're plotting to take over her father's kingdom. The movie's still-timely message -- find the magic inside yourself -- is imparted by Irene's ghostly great-great grandmother who can make roses appear out of thin air.   Schindler's List R   Steven Spielberg's hauntingly powerful, must-see Holocaust epic. This is the true story of an unlikely saint named Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson.) who during World War II saved more than 1,100 Jews from the Nazi ovens.   Serial Mom R   How nice to report that John Waters is still alive and well (in his own peculiar fashion) and living in Baltimore. His movie is a frisky suburban farce about a homicidal happy homemaker (Kathleen Turner) who just has to express herself when she sees someone who doesn't recycle or refuses to rewind their rental video.   The Shadow PG-13   It's a shame ``The Shadow'' came along after ``Batman'' and ``Dick Tracy.'' It borrows the best elements of both -- ``Batman's'' brooding cityscapes and eerie atmosphere, combined with ``Tracy's'' lighter touch and wittier art design. But the inevitable comparisons make Russell Mulcahy's film seem redundant even though Alec Baldwin does a sterling job as Lamont Cranston, the mysterious, slouch-brimmed figure from '30s radio and pulp fiction.   Sirens R   Poised somewhere between soft- core porn and sex farce, this droll examination of the ongoing clash between status-quo conservatism and artistic freedom isn't always successful. But it has its moments. In '30s Australia, a proper minister and his wife (Hugh Grant and Tara Fitzgerald) are sent to a painter's (Sam Neill) retreat. Their mission: to persuade Neill to replace his ``vulgar'' (so says the bishop) paintings in a Sydney museum with something more suitable.   The Snapper R   A rowdy warmth and exhuberant high-spirits permeate every frame of Stephen Frears' terrific little Irish comedy. Sharing the same author (novelist Roddy Dyoe) and working-class Dublin setting as ``The Commitments,'' the movie centers on the Curley family in which 20-year-old Sharon (Tina Kellegher) has a bit of a surprise for her parents (Colm Meaney and Ruth McCabe). She's pregnant -- and she's not saying who the father is.   Speed R The perfect summer-movie rush. ``Speed'' hits the ground running and never lets up. The gimmick is simple: A wacko (Dennis Hopper) has put a bomb on a city bus. When the bus hits 50 mph, the bomb goes on; if it slows below 50, the bomb goes off. And so the chase is on -- with a busload of terrified passengers, a hurt driver, a spunky civilian at the wheel (the winning Sandra Bullock) and one very determined cop (Keanu Reeves) in pursuit.   Sugar Hill R   There's very little that's sweet in this mean-streets melodrama about two brothers who become successful Harlem drug lords. Wesley Snipes is the good son, who brings his derelict-junkie dad (Clarence Williams III) chicken soup and is increasingly conscience-stricken about how he earns a living. Michael Wright is the prodigal son -- hotheaded and hooked on his own poison. Not quite art-house solid, not-quite action- flick slick, ``Sugar Hill'' is something of a hybrid. But it's exceedingly well- crafted, expertly performed and certainly worth a look.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19940708.0060 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(5thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Surviving the Game R   Ernest Dickerson, best known as Spike Lee's cinematographer, proves he's far more than just the man behind the Spike with this story about wealthy, debauched hunters who pay billions to hunt a human prey. A homeless man (Ice-T, exuding a quiet cool) is the innocent, smoothly recruited by a seemingly caring social worker and sent running for his life through the gorgeous northwest wilderness.   3 Ninjas Kick Back PG   Pure formula, but pure fun. Like its hugely successful predecessor, this sequel is an unpretentiously entertaining kids' film -- a slow starter that just gets better and better as it goes along. This time, our three brothers (Sean Fox, Max Elliott Slade, Evan Bonifant) accompany their grandpa (Victor Wong) to Japan where they stumble into a ``Raiders''-like adventure involving an ancient dagger, a secret treasure cave and three ``jerko metalheads.''   When a Man Loves a Woman R   A movie that proves Meg Ryan looks better with a bad hangover than most of us looked at our senior prom. She and Andy Garcia play a seemingly perfect couple. There's just one little problem: Ryan drinks like a fish. However, the movie is less about her alcoholism than the effect it has on her family.   White R   Wonderful. The second film in Polish director Krystof Kieslowski's trilogy inspired by the French tricolor flag and motto (liberty, equality, fraternity) couldn't be more different from its melancholy, mystic predecessor, ``Blue.'' An expatriot Polish hairdresser (Zibgniew Zamachowski), returns home (in a hilarious ordeal) from Paris when his luscious wife (Julie Delpy) divorces him. After losing everything -- she accuses him of impotence, takes all his money and sets the French police after him -- he enjoys an incredible reversal of fortune in the economic hurly-burly of post-Communist Warsaw and hatches a bizarre scheme to win Delpy back.   Widows' Peak PG   Widows peek a lot in this winning Irish comedy. They also snoop, meddle, gossip, sneak around and generally engage in every possible manifestation of the time-honored art of exercising female power in a close-knit society (a.k.a., the Nosy Neighbor Network). Set in 1920s Ireland, the title refers to a hill above a small village that's entirely populated by well- heeled widows. The movie stars Joan Plowright, Mia Farrow and Natasha Richardson.   With Honors PG-13   Joe Pesci is part Ali MacGraw in ``Love Story,'' part Dustin Hoffman as Ratso Rizzo in this well-intentioned but decidedly unwieldy story of a homeless man (Pesci) adopted by a Harvard senior (Brendan Fraser) and his housemates (Moira Kelly, Patrick Dempsey and Josh Hamilton).   Wolf R   A slickly entertaining guilty pleasure. Jack Nicholson, Michelle Pfeiffer and Mike Nichols have lavished their A-list talent on a '90s version of an old Lon Chaney Jr. werewolf movie.   Wyatt Earp PG-13   Directed by Lawrence Kasdan and starring Kevin Costner as the famed lawman, this is a really good movie that's a half hour too long. The film covers a lot of territory as it follows Wyatt from his Kansas boyhood to his adventures out West, ricocheting from Wichita to Dodge and finally to Tombstone and 30 seconds of immortality at the O.K. Corral. .  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19940708.0061 type=story > <HEADLINE> FOOD: SEPTUAGENARIAN SALAD BOWLS OVER A NEW GENERATION WITH ITS AGELESS APPEAL </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-CAESAR-SALADS-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199407.gz"

They move weekly to clients of the New York Times News Service.   G: General audiences. Nothing that would offend parents if viewed by children.   PG: Parental guidance suggested. May contain some material parents consider inappropriate for young children.   PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for preteens.   R: Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking children.   NC-17: No one under 17 admitted. Replaces the X rating.   NR: Not rated.   Bad Company R   This designer noir would like to take its place alongside such dark gems as ``Prizzi's Honor,'' ``The Grifters'' and ``The Last Seduction.'' But it's a poseur. As in his Goldie Hawn vehicle ``Deceived'' (1991), director Damian Harriss wamps the movie in portentous nocturnal shadows and slows things to a crawl just when the flick needs a good jolt. Laurence Fishburne and Ellen Barkin star. Rated R for strong sexuality, violence and language. -- Steve Murray   Before Sunrise R   Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke play strangers on a train who become lov ers in Vienna, Austria, when she accepts his impetuous invitation to join him for an all-night waltz around the city. It sounds terribly romantic and, at times, it is, but their relationship -- with the audience and each other -- never grows. Director Richard Linklater, whose ``Slacker'' and ``Dazed and Confused'' were such brilliant distillations of a certain generation, has given us little more than a one-night-stand to remember.   Billy Madison PG- 13   ``Saturday Night Live's'' Adam Sandler brings his ultrasophisticated brand of dry humor (insert armpit noise here) to this comedy about a lovable slacker who must repeat all 12 grades of school in order to secure a place in his millionaire father's will. Not prescreened for critics. -- Doug Hamilton   Blue NR   Krzysztof Kieslowski's coolly stunning mood piece stars Juliette Binoche (``Damage'') as a young widow. After her husband -- a world-famous composer -- and daughter are killed in a car crash, Binoche cuts herself off from family, friends, lovers and, most crucially, any semblance of the passionate, creative person she was before the tragedy (it's hinted she wrote her husband's music). Binoche brings a lovely stillness to her role, leaving the emotionalism to director Kieslowski, whose lush soundtrack and immaculate images have a hypnotic pull.   Boys on the Side R   Whoopi Goldberg, Drew Barrymore and Mary-Louise Parker are smack in the middle of a highly entertaining New Age weepie. Though the on-the-road ambience suggests ``Thelma &AMP; Louise'' (Whoopi even makes a crack about ``not driving off a cliff with you two!''), this movie's true model is ``Terms of Endearment.'' Only, these are definitely '90s terms, with some definitely '90s ideas of alternative families and a healthy smattering of such now-familiar talk-show fodder as lesbianism, unwed moms and AIDS. Goldberg is an acid- tongued Manhattan club singer who needs to get out of town. So she answers a ride-share ad posted by Parker, a terminally perky real estate agent who enjoys Carpenters sing-alongs. The pair then pick up Goldberg's old pal Barrymore, rescuing her from an abusive boyfriend. Thanks to an illness and a pregnancy, their road trip ends in Tucson, Ariz., where they set up an unorthodox household much like the eccentric extended family in ``Bagdad Cafe.'' Director Herbert Ross isn't exactly the cutting-edge type, but he knows how to handle actors and he's not afraid to take the material on its own terms -- as a hip tear-jerker, as agile as it is blubbery. This isn't a profound film or even a risky one, but it's solid through and through. Rated R for language and adult themes.   Demon Knight R   A tongue-in-cheek gorefest that's not quite cheeky enough, spun off the ``Tales From the Crypt'' TV series. Billy Zane stars. Rated R for violence and language. -- Steve Murray  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950210.0074 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(2ndtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Disclosure R   Michael Crichton's provocative best seller about a female boss (Demi Moore) who manhandles -- so to speak -- a male underling (Michael Douglas) and then charges him with sexual harassment isn't a bad set-up for a movie. But, thanks to director Barry Levinson's ham-fisted approach, the material has been reduced to the level of ``Basic Instinct''/``Fatal Attraction'' trash. Rated R for sex and language.   Dumb and Dumber PG-13   The final entry in Jim Carrey's Doofus Trilogy '94, after mega-hits ``Ace Ventura: Pet Detective'' and ``The Mask.'' Easily the most lowbrow ridiculous of the three, ``Dumb'' is barely a movie at all -- it's more like a visual volume of ``Truly Tasteless Jokes'' occasionally interrupted by the most anemic suspense plot imaginable. It's also a riot. Rated PG-13 for language and adult situations. -- Doug Hamilton   Far From Home:   The Adventures   of Yellow Dog PG   Set in the spectacular forests of British Columbia, this pleasant family picture is a straightforward tale of a boy and his dog. Only this boy (Jesse Bradford from ``King of the Hill'') and this dog -- a soulful blond lab named Dakotah -- are lost together in the Canadian wilderness. Rated PG for mild violence.   Higher Learning R   John Singleton's third film proves that trouble is just as preval ent outside the hood in ``Higher Learning.'' Set on a fictional, racially mixed university campus, Malik Williams (Omar Epps), Kristen Connor (Kristy Swanson) and Remy (Michael Rapaport) face race and social relations at their worst, all in the course of one year. When the final bell rings, ``Higher Learning'' is as emotionally taxing as tonight's blood-drenched evening newscast. Both are stirring, true. But one's free. Rated R for offensive language, nudity and violence. -- Sonia Murray   Houseguest PG   In this latest prefab comedy from the Disney assembly line, comic Sinbad stars as Kevin, a big Pittsburgh dreamer wanted by loan sharks. He shakes them by posing as Derek, a long unseen friend of businessman Gary (Phil Hartman), who's expecting him for a weekend visit in his plush suburban home. The film has fun near the start, as Kevin/Derek tries to piece together clues about his alter ego's occupation, but every time the movie starts to rev up some wild energy, the tired formula slows everything down. Basically this is the story of a role-model homeboy who moves into the Laura Ashley suburbs, loosens up Hartman's uptight WASP character, and solves the family's domestic problems. He's the street-smart Barney. -- Steve Murray   Immortal Beloved R   As visually lush as it is musically glorious, this clever conjecture on Beethoven's love life emphasizes entertainment, not accuracy. Gary Oldman stars. -- Steve Murray   In the Mouth of Madness R   A rip-roaring horror flick from John Carpenter. Sam Neill plays a private investigator hired to find a missing best-selling horror writer named Sutter Cane (Jurgen Prochnow). Worse, as far as his publisher, Charlton Heston, is concerned, he's disappeared before finishing his next book. Neill smells a PR scam, especially when he hears rumors about Cane's books driving some readers mad. But he agrees to go with Cane's editor (Julie Carmen) to New England in search of Cane. What they find . . . well, that would be telling. Let's just say that Carpenter, who practically reinvented the horror film with ``Halloween,'' still knows his way around scary stuff -- from dead-eyed children to ax-wielding maniacs. The niftiest thing about the film is the way its feverish tone evokes cult horror writer H.P. Lovecraft.   Interview With the Vampire R   As richly textured as a dark brocade, threaded with existential dread and drenched in plasma, Neil Jordan's film will disturb many viewers. It's filled with snapping necks, slit throats, rats and wrists draining crimson into goblets, and other bloody bits of necro-fun. But it's likely to thrill Anne Rice fans and seduce those unfamiliar with her books. Starring Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. Rated R for violence, gore, nudity and sexuality. -- Steve Murray   I.Q. PG-13   Directed by Fred Schepisi (``Roxanne''), this comedy about the romance between hearty mechanic Ed (Tim Robbins) and heady mathematician Catherine (Meg Ryan) zips by with sparkle. It's not a 4.0, but ``I.Q.'' scores high enough to pass. Rated PG for mild language and adult themes. -- Steve Murray   The Jerky Boys R   With their phone-crank outrages, the Jerky Boys personify the urban id unleashed. Ranting about hemorrhoids and all things anal, they shatter the daily grind with scatological rudeness. Bless 'em. Too bad they're being packaged in this pathetic showcase, a tired, Disneyfied chase comedy involving the mob and crooked cops. The lame plot line might have worked 30 years ago as a crossover vehicle for, say, the Monkees. But it deflates the Boys' furious nonsense. And tames the previously faceless Johnny Brennan and Kamal Ahmed into a couple of paunchy, bland ``lowlifes from Queens,'' who don't exactly exude star charisma. The guys' phone riffs -- especially the unstoppably foulmouthed Brennan's -- are still potent for their sheer gleeful shockmanship and political incorrectness (especially Brennan's highly offensive ``gay'' voice). But the movie they're stuck in is strictly Prince Albert in a Can. Rated R for strong language. -- Steve Murray  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950210.0075 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(3rdtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> The Jungle Book PG   For kids, there's a bunch of cool animals. For adults, there's Jason Scott Lee in a loincloth. But for Rudyard Kipling fans, there's not much. It's like director Stephen Sommers' ``Adventures of Huck Finn'' last year -- another example of great source material that lacked an animating spark. -- Steve Murray   The Last Seduction R   Probably the sleeper of the year. In the tradition of ``Double Indemnity'' and ``Body Heat,'' director John Dahl (``Red Rock West'') pairs a smart, sexy, no-good dame with a hunky sucker who's not half as smart as he thinks he is. Linda Fiorentino is a one-woman wrecking crew as a tough cookie with a lotta leg and even more nerve who easily gets nice-guy Peter Berg in her thrall. Rated R for sex, violence, language, nudity and adult themes.   Legends of the Fall R   Think of the very best ``Bonanza'' episode you ever saw; then cast it with the likes of Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt and Aidan Quinn; finally add in the sibling rivalry/father-always-liked-you-best themes of ``East of Eden.'' Yummy. Rated R for sex, nudity and violence.   The Lion King G   Disney's feature-length cartoon is royal entertainment. Sort of ``Bambi'' meets ``Hamlet'' on the Serengeti, it roars onto the screen with vivid characters and expert animation. Featuring the voices of James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons and Matthew Broderick. Rated G, but there is a death that may disturb young children.   Little Women PG   Director Gillian Armstrong (``My Brilliant Career'') and her solid cast, including Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon, have imbued the third screen version of Louisa May Alcott's classic with considerable care and craftsmanship -- every scene looks like a Currier and Ives print. Rated PG for mild adult themes.   The Madness   of King George Not rated   The year is 1788. King George III (Nigel Hawthorne) already has lost the Colonies. Now he's losing his mind. Based on Alan Bennett's much- praised play and artfully transferred from the stage by Nicholas Hytner, this historical whimsy recalls ``The Lion in Winter'' or ``The Ruling Class.'' But Hawthorne's extraordinary portrayal gives ``Madness'' its own unforgettable voice. He's definitely Oscar-worthy.   The Mask PG-13   Forget the superhero plot of this live-action cartoon and focus on the Looney-Tunes special effects, the immensely likable Jim Carrey and Milo the mighty Jack Russell terrier. Directed by Chuck Russell. Rated   PG-13 for mild violence.   Miami Rhapsody PG-13   Percolating to a mix of heady one-liners and romantic angst, writer- director David Frankel's disarmingly witty comedy examines the pitfalls of love (and lust) in the '90s. Sarah Jessica Parker is the film's invaluable motor, equally adept at spewing Mensa-level quips and dipping into slapstick. Frankel peppers his script with so many zingers, you want to curb your laughter so as not to miss the next one. Rated PG-13 for language and adult themes. -- Steve Murray   Murder in the First R   The more-or-less true story of a history-making case. In 1941, after spending years in solitary confinement for attempted escape (the usual maximum was 19 days), Alcatraz inmate Henri Young (Kevin Bacon) killed the convict who'd ratted on him in front of 200 witnesses. An ambitious young attorney (Christian Slater) took the case and decided to put the system on trial. This is good material and the actors give it their best. Alas, director Marc Rocco is his own -- and their -- worst enemy. His distinctively active camera has a certain panache, but it soon becomes an irritating affectation that detracts from the performances and the story. Rated R for violence, nudity, language and sex.   Nell PG-13   A gentle miracle of a movie with an Oscar-worthy performance by Jodie Foster. She plays the title character: a feral backwoods North Carolina woman who's been raised in almost total isolation from the modern world (No phone, no TV, etc.). Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson are rival doctors who become fascinated by her. Rated PG-13 for nudity.   Nobody's Fool R   Even when director Robert Benton grabs for the heartstrings, star Paul Newman tempers the sentiment and gives a career-capping performance as a father at the crossroads. Rated R for language and nudity. -- Steve Murray   Pulp Fiction R   Pop goes the pulp in this smashing sophomore effort by Quentin ``Reservoir Dogs'' Tarantino. Winner of the Golden Palm at Cannes and subject to Oscar-time whispers, the picture is a gleefully lurid mix of hardboiled gangster-movie conventions and hip post-Warhol irony. Starring John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. Rated R for violence, language, nudity and drug use.   The Quick and the Dead R   A dead-on western from Sam Raimi (the ``Evil Dead'' movies). Reprising his avuncular villainy from ``Unforgiven,'' Gene Hackman plays the Big Cheese in a tiny western town who, for his own amusement and ego gratification, annually sponsors a quick-draw competition. Among the gathering of gunfighters lured by glory, money or both are a flashy gambler (Lance Henriksen), a pipe-smoking hired gun (Keith David), and Hackman's own son (Leonardo DiCaprio), a likable, cocky kid who really is as good as he says. There's also one of Hackman's ex-cronies (Russell Crowe), who's turned from a man of the gun to a man of God, yet is forced by Hackman to compete (i.e., draw or die). Finally, there's a mysterious stranger (Sharon Stone) with an old score to settle. Stone is getting most of the advance publicity (and yes, she's just fine), but essentially she's just one among a colorful and accomplished cast who knows exactly how to match Raimi's imaginative over-the-top tone. Though the aforementioned ``Unforgiven'' comes to mind, Raimi's true model is Sergio Leone -- especially ``Once Upon a Time in the West.'' One heck of a homage to the spaghetti western, ``The Quick and the Dead'' is flavored with its own homemade sauce.   Red R   The capstone to Krzysztof Kieslowski's exquisite tricolor triptych (after ``Blue'' and ``White''), this simply affecting film centers on the odd relationship that develops between a part-time model (Irene Jacob of ``The Double Life of Veronique'') and a reclusive retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant).  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950210.0076 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(4thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Speechless PG-13   While it's often true that politics makes strange bedfellows, politically themed romantic comedies often make endearing ones. That's certainly the case here with Geena Davis and Michael Keaton cast as rival speechwriters working for opposing candidates during a senatorial race. Rated PG-13 for language and adult themes.   Strawberries and Chocolate NR   Havana homophobia is the ingredient in a Cuban drama too vanilla for its own good. Think of a Lite ``Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' and you get the picture. Tomas Gutierrez Alea's film follows the edgy nonmating dance between flaming artiste Diego (Jorge Perrugoria) and revolutionary student David (Vladimir Cruz). Diego lures the young man home with the promise of banned books. What he really wants is all too clear in Perrugoria's lip-licking performance. Repelled, David tells his militant roomie that he knew Diego was ``a fag'' by his choice of ice cream: ``There was chocolate, he took strawberry.'' But David visits Diego again with plans to report the man's ``subversive'' activities; and instead finds himself intrigued by Diego's theatrical approach to life. Throw in an unstable hooker next door (Mirta Ibarra) with eyes for David, and you've got the makings of an Almodovar souffle. But ``Strawberry'' is weighted with lard. Set in 1979, it might have had more impact if it had actually been made then. Shot last year, it plays like a passe example of consciousness raising, the lukewarm tale of a noble Nell who makes emotional sacrifices for the stalwart young hetero. Though at least -- unlike William Hurt in ``Spider Woman'' -- Diego doesn't have to die in the process. That's some sort of progress. -- Steve Murray   To Live NR   Famed Asian filmmaker Zhang Yimou (``Raise the Red Lantern'') tackles epic melodrama in this decades-spanning film set in China. Starring Ge You and Gong Li. Not rated, but there are adult themes and some violence.   Vanya on 42nd Street PG   Collaborating with stage director Andre Gregory, Louis Malle has created an ardent love letter -- to the theater, to great acting, to the tragicomic genius of Anton Chekhov. This pared-down performance of Chekhov's ``Uncle Vanya'' celebrates the fleeting glory of live performance as well as the enduring timelessness of the play. Starring Wallace Shawn and Julianne Moore. Rated PG for adult themes.

As in his Goldie Hawn vehicle ``Deceived'' (1991), director Damian Harris wamps the movie in portentous nocturnal shadows and slows things to a crawl just when the flick needs a good jolt. Laurence Fishburne and Ellen Barkin star. Rated R for strong sexuality, violence and language. -- Steve Murray   Before Sunrise R   Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke play strangers on a train who become lovers in Vienna, Austria, when she accepts his impetuous invitation to join him for an all-night waltz around the city. It sounds terribly romantic and, at times, it is, but their relationship -- with the audience and each other -- never grows. Director Richard Linklater, whose ``Slacker'' and ``Dazed and Confused'' were such brilliant distillations of a certain generation, has given us little more than a one-night stand to remember.   Billy Madison PG-13   Continuing pop culture's dalliance with idiot chic, this low-watt comedy is the first full- blown star vehicle for ``Saturday Night Live's'' resident smirky boy, Adam Sandler. He plays the title character, a dim-bulb slacker of the manor born who must repeat all 12 grades of school in order to win the respect of his father (Darren McGavin) and gain control of the family's zillion-dollar hotel business (doting dad bought off his teachers the first time around). Sandler is a likable goof with palpable charisma, but ``Billy Madison's'' feature-film length exposes the chinks in his act. Blessed with a none-too-vast repertoire of scrunchy faces and kooky voices, the comedian simply runs out of ideas after a while. It's hard to imagine him as an enduring screen presence. Then again, stranger things have happened (see: Pauly Shore). Rated PG-13 for language and sexual innuendo. -- Doug Hamilton   Blue NR   Krzysztof Kieslowski's coolly stunning mood piece stars Juliette Binoche (``Damage'') as a young widow. After her husband -- a world-famous composer -- and daughter are killed in a car crash, Binoche cuts herself off from family, friends, lovers and, most crucially, any semblance of the passionate, creative person she was before the tragedy (it's hinted she wrote her husband's music). Binoche brings a lovely stillness to her role, leaving the emotionalism to director Kieslowski, whose lush soundtrack and immaculate images have a hypnotic pull.   Blue Sky PG-13   Jessica Lange snagged an Oscar nomination for her performance in this riveting family drama set against a backdrop of military cover-ups and abuse of power. Directed by Tony Richardson. Rated PG-13 for sex, brief nudity and adult themes.   Boys on the Side R   Whoopi Goldberg, Drew Barrymore and Mary-Louise Parker are smack in the middle of a highly entertaining New Age weepie. Though the on-the-road ambience suggests ``Thelma &AMP; Louise'' (Whoopi even makes a crack about ``not driving off a cliff with you two!''), this movie's true model is ``Terms of Endearment.'' Director Herbert Ross isn't exactly the cutting-edge type, but he knows how to handle actors and he's not afraid to take the material on its own terms -- as a hip tear-jerker, as agile as it is blubbery. This isn't a profound film or even a risky one, but it's solid through and through. Rated R for language and adult themes.   The Brady Bunch Movie PG-13   Stick with the reruns. To their credit, the cast of l ook- alikes -- headed by Shelley Long and Gary Cole as Carol and Mike, Christine Taylor as Marcia, Christopher Daniel Barnes as Greg and Jennifer Elise Cox as Jan -- play it straight and true. But to what purpose? What does it take to parody something that was pretty pathetic in its original form? As in the previous big-screen versions of ``The Beverly Hillbillies,'' ``The Addams Family'' and a half-dozen other recycled sitcoms, the plot calls for fictional TV characters to collide with the ``real'' world. In this case, an evil neighbor (Michael McKeon) wants to bulldoze the Brady's home, but they love every shag-carpeted inch of it and refuse to sell. The '70s vs. the '90s jokes are repeated ad nauseum, but there are a few good yuks at Marcia's expense (especially regarding the insanely jealous Jan). ``Brady'' is dull, safe, just more of the same-old, same-old; John Waters had much more fun covering the same territory in ``Serial Mom.'' If the filmmakers had really wanted to shake things up, they should've had loyal housekeeper Alice go after little Bobby. Or little Cindy.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950217.0061 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(2ndtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Clear and Present Danger PG-13   Even when this new installment in the Tom Clancy film-adaptation franchise is far from clear, it's dangerously entertaining. Reteaming director Phillip Noyce and star Harrison Ford as CIA analyst Jack Ryan, it's more convoluted than ``Patriot Games.'' But also more gripping. Rated PG-13 for some intense action, violence and language. -- Steve Murray   Disclosure R   Michael Crichton's provocative best seller about a female boss (Demi Moore) who manhandles -- so to speak -- a male underling (Michael Douglas) and then charges him with sexual harassment isn't a bad setup for a movie. But, thanks to director Barry Levinson's ham-fisted approach, the material has been reduced to the level of ``Basic Instinct''/``Fatal Attraction'' trash. Rated R for sex and language.   Dumb and Dumber PG-13   The final entry in Jim Carrey's Doofus Trilogy '94, after mega-hits ``Ace Ventura: Pet Detective'' and ``The Mask.'' Easily the most lowbrow ridiculous of the three, ``Dumb'' is barely a movie at all -- it's more like a visual volume of ``Truly Tasteless Jokes'' occasionally interrupted by the most anemic suspense plot imaginable. It's also a riot. Rated PG-13 for language and adult situations. -- Doug Hamilton   Erotique NR   One person's sex fantasy is another's so-what. This anthology of sex tales, directed by a trio of female directors, isn't overtly offensive. However, it is overtly boring. You'd have to a a pretty sex- starved individual -- say, you hadn't gotten any since Eisenhower -- to find these pieces a turn-on. The first, directed by the erratic Lizzie Borden (``Working Girls'' good; ``Love Crimes'' bad), is about a struggling actress (Kamala Lopez-Dawson) who pays the rent working as a phone-sex operator. In the second, directed by Monica Trent, two glamorous lesbians (Priscilla Barnes and Camilla Soeberg) decide to pick up a Eurotrash stud (Michael Carr) for their delectation. Finally, there's Clara Law's rather sweet Hong Kong-set sex comedy about an assimilated Asian guy (Tim Lounibos) who wants to win his girl's (Hayley Man) heart by appealing to her heritage. The idea of an all-girl team of directors is a condescending tease. By relying on PC bully tactics -- these are female fantasies -- the film gets away with being little more than run-of- the-mill soft-core porn (phony moans and bad acting). And while the recurring theme of women on top isn't bad in itself, the movie sends an ugly message: Dominant women inevitably need men who are helpless, humiliated, or dead. And that is certainly not what most women want.   The Adventures   of Yellow Dog PG   Set in the spectacular forests of British Columbia, this pleasant family picture is a straightforward tale of a boy and his dog. Only this boy (Jesse Bradford from ``King of the Hill'') and this dog -- a soulful blond lab named Dakotah -- are lost together in the Canadian wilderness. Rated PG for mild violence.   Forrest Gump PG-13   Tom Hanks is clueless in America in Robert Zemeckis' half-baked fable about an idiot-savant of sorts, skimming through the last half of the 20th century and colliding ``Zelig''-like with history. Rated PG-13 for adult themes.   Heavyweights PG   While it may not be a ton o' fun, pound for pound, this Disney flick about a camp for hefty- size kids is a perfectly pleasant time-passer. Initially, the premise sounds a little crummy, but as one veteran (Atlanta native, Keenan Thompson) explains to rookie Aaron Schwartz (a ``Mighty Ducks'' alum), ``No one picks on you, because you're not the fat kid; everybody's the fat kid.'' Unfortunately, the camp has changed hands and the new owner (Ben Stiller) is a pumped-up psychopath who intends to use his corpulent campers as the unlikely -- and unwilling -- stars of his new weight-loss video. Turn the camera on and he's an energized evangelist for veggies, jogging and clean living; turn it off and he's the personal trainer from hell. The movie eventually succumbs to the usual Disney formula of ``go for it'' overkill (there are at least two climaxes too many), but Stiller is very buff, very funny and the kids make fine foils. Holding it all together is Tom McGowan who wowed Broadway a few years back in the faux- Moliere, ``La Bete.'' Here, he's thoroughly engaging as an overweight counselor who learns he can stand up against the Stillers of the world.   Higher Learning R   John Singleton's third film proves that trouble is just as prevalent outside the hood in ``Higher Learning.'' Set on a fictional, racially mixed university campus, Malik Williams (Omar Epps), Kristen Connor (Kristy Swanson) and Remy (Michael Rapaport) face race and social relations at their worst, all in the course of one year. When the final bell rings, ``Higher Learning'' is as emotionally taxing as tonight's blood-drenched evening newscast. Both are stirring, true. But one's free. Rated R for offensive language, nudity and violence. -- Sonia Murray   Immortal Beloved R   As visually lush as it is musically glorious, this clever conjecture on Beethoven's love life emphasizes entertainment, not accuracy. Gary Oldman stars. -- Steve Murray   In the Mouth   of Madness R   Sam Neill plays a private investigator hired to find a missing best-selling horror writer named Sutter Cane (Jurgen Prochnow) in this rip-roaring flick from John Carpenter, who practically reinvented the horror film with ``Halloween.'' Carpenter still knows his way around scary stuff -- from dead-eyed children to ax-wielding maniacs. And he even leaves us with a message worth pondering: When the world goes mad, the mad go to the movies. Rated R for violence, language and gore.   Interview With the Vampire R   As richly textured as a dark brocade, threaded with existential dread and drenched in plasma, Neil Jordan's film will disturb many viewers. It's filled with snapping necks, slit throats, rats and wrists draining crimson into goblets, and other bloody bits of necro- fun. But it's likely to thrill Anne Rice fans and seduce those unfamiliar with her books. Starring Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. Rated R for violence, gore, nudity and sexuality. -- Steve Murray  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950217.0062 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(3rdtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> I.Q. PG-13   Directed by Fred Schepisi (``Roxanne''), this comedy about the romance between hearty mechanic Ed (Tim Robbins) and heady mathematician Catherine (Meg Ryan) zips by with sparkle. It's not a 4.0, but ``I.Q.'' scores high enough to pass. Rated PG for mild language and adult themes. -- Steve Murray   The Jerky Boys R   With their phone-crank outrages, the Jerky Boys personify the urban id unleashed. Ranting about hemorrhoids and all things anal, they shatter the daily grind with scatological rudeness. Too bad they're being packaged in this pathetic showcase, a tired, Disneyfied chase comedy involving the mob and crooked cops. Rated R for strong language. -- Steve Murray   The Jungle Book PG   For kids, there's a bunch of cool animals. For adults, there's Jason Scott Lee in a loincloth. But for Rudyard Kipling fans, there's not much. It's like director Stephen Sommers' ``Adventures of Huck Finn'' last year -- another example of great source material that lacked an animating spark. -- Steve Murray   Just Cause R   By the end you can count the cliches: Yes, the brutal rapist- killer will kidnap the blonde, evade his pursuers via the standard drive-in-the- wrong-lane-of-traffic car chase, and then flee to exactly the spot police expect him to go. In this formula thriller, Sean Connery plays a Harvard law professor who reopens the case of a Florida death-row inmate (Blair Underwood) set to fry for the rape and murder of a young (white) girl. Laurence Fishburne is the local detective who tries to intimidate Connery out of town. As packed with crackers as a bowl of oyster stew, the film's small-town setting reeks of the socially conscious flicks of the '60s (``In the Heat of the Night''). Forget whodunit; you may be distracted by the movie's racial-sexual politics. With its hackneyed view of the South, it cues us to see Underwood's imprisonment as a symbolic punishment for a black male's taboo violation of a white female (whether he did it or not). Yet by the convoluted end, the movie all but endorses the same distasteful stereotype it pretends to explode. Still, Connery and Fishburne are predictably fine, and Ed Harris as a corn-pone Hannibal Lecter clone jumps on his Bible-spouting part with deep-fried relish. -- Steve Murray   The Last Seduction R   Probably the sleeper of the year. In the tradition of ``Double Indemnity'' and ``Body Heat,'' director John Dahl (``Red Rock West'') pairs a smart, sexy, no-good dame with a hunky sucker who's not half as smart as he thinks he is. Linda Fiorentino is a one-woman wrecking crew as a tough cookie with a lotta leg and even more nerve who easily gets nice-guy Peter Berg in her thrall. Rated R for sex, violence, language, nudity and adult themes.   Legends of the Fall R   Think of the very best ``Bonanza'' episode you ever saw; then cast it with the likes of Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt and Aidan Quinn; finally add in the sibling rivalry/father-always-liked-you-best themes of ``East of Eden.'' Yummy. Rated R for sex, nudity and violence.   The Lion King G   Disney's feature-length cartoon is royal entertainment. Sort of ``Bambi'' meets ``Hamlet'' on the Serengeti, it roars onto the screen with vivid characters and expert animation. Featuring the voices of James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons and Matthew Broderick. Rated G, but there is a death that may disturb young children.   Little Giants PG   This time, the Bad News Bears . . . I mean, the Mighty Ducks . . . I mean . . . Let's start over. This time, a gang of lovable kiddie misfits pull together and become a heck of a Pee Wee League football team. The only discernable twist is that the Giants' coach (Rick Moranis) and the coach of the all-star opposing team (Ed O'Neill) are brothers with a longstanding rivalry. Given a fourth-down-and-long situation, director Duwayne Dunham punts for formula and lets his cast fumble along as best they can. Rated PG for mild language.   Little Women PG   Director Gillian Armstrong (``My Brilliant Career'') and her solid cast, including Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon, have imbued the third screen version of Louisa May Alcott's classic with considerable care and craftsmanship -- every scene looks like a Currier and Ives print. Rated PG for mild adult themes.   A Low Down Dirty Shame R   Racist, sexist, homophobic and rude, Keenen Ivory Wayan's new action comedy is also shamelessly entertaining, turning genre cliches into a romp. Rated R for violence, strong language and sex. -- Steve Murray   The Madness   of King George NR   The year is 1788. King George III (Nigel Hawthorne) already has lost the Colonies. Now he's losing his mind. Based on Alan Bennett's much-praised play and artfully transferred from the stage by Nicholas Hytner, this historical whimsy recalls ``The Lion in Winter'' or ``The Ruling Class.'' But Hawthorne's extraordinary portrayal gives ``Madness'' its own unforgettable voice. He's definitely Oscar worthy.   The Mask PG-13   Forget the superhero plot of this live-action cartoon and focus on the Looney-Tunes special effects, the immensely likable Jim Carrey and Milo the mighty Jack Russell terrier. Directed by Chuck Russell. Rated PG-13 for mild violence.   Miami Rhapsody PG-13   Percolating to a mix of heady one-liners and romantic angst, writer- director David Frankel's disarmingly witty comedy examines the pitfalls of love (and lust) in the '90s. Sarah Jessica Parker is the film's invaluable motor, equally adept at spewing Mensa-level quips and dipping into slapstick. Frankel peppers his script with so many zingers, you want to curb your laughter so as not to miss the next one. Rated PG-13 for language and adult themes. -- Steve Murray  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950217.0063 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(4thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Murder in the First R   The more or less true story of a history-making case. In 1941, after spending years in solitary confinement for attempted escape (the usual maximum was 19 days), Alcatraz inmate Henri Young (Kevin Bacon) killed the convict who'd ratted on him in front of 200 witnesses. An ambitious young attorney (Christian Slater) took the case and decided to put the system on trial. This is good material and the actors give it their best. Alas, director Marc Rocco is his own -- and their -- worst enemy. His distinctively active camera has a certain panache, but it soon becomes an irritating affectation that detracts from the performances and the story. Rated R for violence, nudity, language, sex.   Nell PG-13   A gentle miracle of a movie with an Oscar-worthy performance by Jodie Foster. She plays the title character: a feral backwoods North Carolina woman who's been raised in almost total isolation from the modern world (No phone, no TV, etc.). Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson are rival doctors who become fascinated by her. Rated PG-13 for nudity.   Nobody's Fool R   Even when director Robert Benton grabs for the heartstrings, star Paul Newman tempers the sentiment and gives a career-capping performance as a father at the crossroads. Rated R for language and nudity. -- Steve Murray   Pulp Fiction R   Pop goes the pulp in this smashing sophomore effort by Quentin ``Reservoir Dogs'' Tarantino. Winner of the Golden Palm at Cannes and already subject to Oscar-time whispers, the picture is a gleefully lurid mix of hardboiled gangster-movie conventions and hip post-Warhol irony. Starring John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. Rated R for violence, language, nudity and drug use.   The Quick and the Dead R   A dead-on western from Sam Raimi (the ``Evil Dead'' movies). Reprising his avuncular villainy from ``Unforgiven,'' Gene Hackman plays the Big Cheese in a tiny western town who, for his own amusement and ego gratification, annually sponsors a quick-draw competition. Among the gathering of gunfighters lured by glory, money or both are a flashy gambler (Lance Henriksen), a pipe- smoking hired gun (Keith David), and Hackman's own son (Leonardo DiCaprio), a likable, cocky kid who really is as good as he says. There's also one of Hackman's ex-cronies (Russell Crowe), who's turned from a man of the gun to a man of God, yet is forced by Hackman to compete (i.e., draw or die.) Finally, there's a mysterious stranger (Sharon Stone) with an old score to settle. Stone is getting most of the advance publicity (and yes, she's just fine), but essentially she's just one among a colorful and accomplished cast who knows exactly how to match Raimi's imaginative over-the-top tone. Though the aforementioned ``Unforgiven'' comes to mind, Raimi's true model is Sergio Leone -- especially ``Once Upon a Time in the West.'' One heck of a homage to the spaghetti western, ``The Quick and the Dead'' is flavored with its own homemade sauce. Rated R for violence and language.   Quiz Show PG-13   Robert Redford directs a dazzingly entertaining movie about the quiz-show scandals of the '50s. The medium's message: Forget it, Jake; it's television. Starring Ralph Fiennes, John Turturro and Rob Morrow. Rated PG-13 for adult themes.   Richie Rich PG   Another chance for Macaulay Culkin to smirk. As comic-to-celluloid mutations go, it's what you'd expect: thin on script, fat on sets (the Riches' abode is Asheville's Biltmore Estate). The film offers a spectacularly twisted message from filmmakers wanting to play both sides of the fiscal fence. After endorsing the Riches' dollar-happy delirium, the movie claims that Richie's true wealth is a new set of friends (a Rainbow Coalition of street urchins enticed to come play with his expensive toys). Rated PG for mild violence and language. -- Steve Murray   Stargate PG-13   An engaging sci-fi yarn with a flying pyramid, three moons and Jaye Davidson in a dress. Again. We start on Earth, where a linguist named Daniel (James Spader) deciphers Egyptian hieroglyphics on a circular mechanism unearthed near the Pyramids. It's the Stargate, a thingamajig that, when uncoded, becomes a portal to a twin gate on a sandy planet across the universe. Daniel gets enlisted for a space-jumping expedition, led by gruff Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell), since he's the only one who can crack the code on that second Stargate. But first they have to face the sun god Ra (Davidson), a cosmic vampire. Like a Tintin adventure set in the cosmos, the movie has an enjoyable retro feel. But it's harder to get revved up by it. Rated PG-13 for violence. -- Steve Murray  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950217.0064 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(5thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Strawberry and Chocolate R   Havana homophobia is the ingred ient in a Cuban drama too vanilla for its own good. Think of a Lite ``Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' and you get the picture. Tomas Gutierrez Alea's film follows the edgy nonmating dance between flaming artiste Diego (Jorge Perrugoria) and revolutionary student David (Vladimir Cruz). Diego lures the young man home with the promise of banned books. What he really wants is all too clear in Perrugoria's lip-licking performance. Repelled, David tells his militant roomie that he knew Diego was ``a fag'' by his choice of ice cream: ``There was chocolate, he took strawberry.'' But David visits Diego again with plans to report the man's ``subversive'' activities; and instead finds himself intrigued by Diego's theatrical approach to life. Throw in an unstable hooker next door (Mirta Ibarra) with eyes for David, and you've got the makings of an Almodovar souffle. But ``Strawberry'' is weighted with lard. Set in 1979, it might have had more impact if it had actually been made then. Shot last year, it plays like a passe example of consciousness raising, the lukewarm tale of a noble Nell who makes emotional sacrifices for the stalwart young hetero. Though at least -- unlike William Hurt in ``Spider Woman'' -- Diego doesn't have to die in the process. That's some sort of progress. Rated R for language and strong sexuality. -- Steve Murray   Tom and Viv PG-13   With its genteel English settings, its repressed famous writer and his couldn't-be-more-different spouse, this story of T.S. Eliot and his first wife, Vivian Haigh-Wood, comes off as something of a ``Shadowlands'' wannabe. However, director Brian Gilbert and writer Michael Hastings haven't quite made a love story; worse, they're not quite sure what they have made. Viv (Miranda Richardson) is a vivacious heiress; Tom (Willem Dafoe) is a poor Yank at Oxford who falls for her country manse, her family, her sheer Englishness. But as Viv's brother (Tim Dutton) notes, ``She thought Tom was going to rescue her from tight little England, but tight little England was just what Tom wanted.'' Their marriage is a sad mismatch -- as her high spirits spill overboard into high-strung neuroticism and neediness, he becomes more withdrawn. But the film does little more than skim through their dilemma. If you didn't already know ``The Waste Land'' or ``Prufrock,'' you'd think Tom was an obnoxious prig, not worth Viv's trouble. Conversely, though her mother (Rosemary Harris in a strong supporting role) hints of ``female trouble,'' we never get more than Viv as a generic society loony. The film has moments of genuine emotional connection, but overall, this is a hollow movie.   Vanya on 42nd Street PG   Collaborating with stage director Andre Gregory, Louis Malle has created an ardent love letter -- to the theater, to great acting, to the tragicomic genius of Anton Chekhov. This pared- down performance of Chekhov's ``Uncle Vanya'' celebrates the fleeting glory of live performance as well as the enduring timelessness of the play. Starring Wallace Shawn and Julianne Moore. Rated PG for adult themes. .  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950217.0065 type=story > <HEADLINE> 50 YEARS LATER, IWO JIMA VETERANS REMEMBER </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> ATLANTA  (BC-IWOJIMA-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199502.gz"

They move weekly to clients of the New York Times News Service.   G: General audiences. Nothing that would offend parents if viewed by children.   PG: Parental guidance suggested. May contain some material parents consider inappropriate for young children.   PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for preteens.   R: Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking children.   NC-17: No one under 17 admitted. Replaces the X rating.   NR: Not rated.   Bad Company R   This designer noir would like to take its place alongside such dark gems as ``Prizzi's Honor,'' ``The Grifters'' and ``The Last Seduction.'' But it's a poseur. As in his Goldie Hawn vehicle ``Deceived'' (1991), director Damian Harris wamps the movie in portentous nocturnal shadows and slows things to a crawl just when the flick needs a good jolt. Laurence Fishburne and Ellen Barkin star. Rated R for strong sexuality, violence and language. -- Steve Murray   Before Sunrise R   Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke play strangers on a train who become lovers in Vienna, Austria, when she accepts his impetuous invitation to join him for an all-night waltz around the city. It sounds terribly romantic and, at times, it is, but their relationship -- with the audience and each other -- never grows. Director Richard Linklater, whose ``Slacker'' and ``Dazed and Confused'' were such brilliant distillations of a certain generation, has given us little more than a one-night stand to remember.   Billy Madison PG-13   Continuing pop culture's dalliance with idiot chic, this low-watt comedy is the first full- blown star vehicle for ``Saturday Night Live's'' resident smirky boy, Adam Sandler. He plays the title character, a dim-bulb slacker of the manor born who must repeat all 12 grades of school in order to win the respect of his father (Darren McGavin) and gain control of the family's zillion-dollar hotel business (doting dad bought off his teachers the first time around). Sandler is a likable goof with palpable charisma, but ``Billy Madison's'' feature-film length exposes the chinks in his act. Blessed with a none-too-vast repertoire of scrunchy faces and kooky voices, the comedian simply runs out of ideas after a while. It's hard to imagine him as an enduring screen presence. Then again, stranger things have happened (see: Pauly Shore). Rated PG-13 for language and sexual innuendo. -- Doug Hamilton   Blue NR   Krzysztof Kieslowski's coolly stunning mood piece stars Juliette Binoche (``Damage'') as a young widow. After her husband -- a world-famous composer -- and daughter are killed in a car crash, Binoche cuts herself off from family, friends, lovers and, most crucially, any semblance of the passionate, creative person she was before the tragedy (it's hinted she wrote her husband's music). Binoche brings a lovely stillness to her role, leaving the emotionalism to director Kieslowski, whose lush soundtrack and immaculate images have a hypnotic pull.   Blue Sky PG-13   Jessica Lange snagged an Oscar nomination for her performance in this riveting family drama set against a backdrop of military cover-ups and abuse of power. Directed by Tony Richardson. Rated PG-13 for sex, brief nudity and adult themes.   Boys on the Side R   Whoopi Goldberg, Drew Barrymore and Mary-Louise Parker are smack in the middle of a highly entertaining New Age weepie. Though the on-the-road ambience suggests ``Thelma &AMP; Louise'' (Whoopi even makes a crack about ``not driving off a cliff with you two!''), this movie's true model is ``Terms of Endearment.'' Director Herbert Ross isn't exactly the cutting-edge type, but he knows how to handle actors and he's not afraid to take the material on its own terms -- as a hip tear-jerker, as agile as it is blubbery. This isn't a profound film or even a risky one, but it's solid through and through. Rated R for language and adult themes.   The Brady Bunch Movie PG-13   Stick with the reruns. To their credit, the cast of l ook- alikes -- headed by Shelley Long and Gary Cole as Carol and Mike, Christine Taylor as Marcia, Christopher Daniel Barnes as Greg and Jennifer Elise Cox as Jan -- play it straight and true. But to what purpose? What does it take to parody something that was pretty pathetic in its original form? As in the previous big-screen versions of ``The Beverly Hillbillies,'' ``The Addams Family'' and a half-dozen other recycled sitcoms, the plot calls for fictional TV characters to collide with the ``real'' world. In this case, an evil neighbor (Michael McKeon) wants to bulldoze the Brady's home, but they love every shag-carpeted inch of it and refuse to sell. The '70s vs. the '90s jokes are repeated ad nauseum, but there are a few good yuks at Marcia's expense (especially regarding the insanely jealous Jan). ``Brady'' is dull, safe, just more of the same-old, same-old; John Waters had much more fun covering the same territory in ``Serial Mom.'' If the filmmakers had really wanted to shake things up, they should've had loyal housekeeper Alice go after little Bobby.

And he even leaves us with a message worth pondering: When the world goes mad, the mad go to the movies. Rated R for violence, language and gore.   Interview With the Vampire R   As richly textured as a dark brocade, threaded with existential dread and drenched in plasma, Neil Jordan's film will disturb many viewers. It's filled with snapping necks, slit throats, rats and wrists draining crimson into goblets, and other bloody bits of necro- fun. But it's likely to thrill Anne Rice fans and seduce those unfamiliar with her books. Starring Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. Rated R for violence, gore, nudity and sexuality. -- Steve Murray  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950224.0087 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(3rdtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> I.Q. PG-13   Directed by Fred Schepisi (``Roxanne''), this comedy about the romance between hearty mechanic Ed (Tim Robbins) and heady mathematician Catherine (Meg Ryan) zips by with sparkle. It's not a 4.0, but ``I.Q.'' scores high enough to pass. Rated PG for mild language and adult themes. -- Steve Murray   The Jerky Boys R   With their phone-crank outrages, the Jerky Boys personify the urban id unleashed. Ranting about hemorrhoids and all things anal, they shatter the daily grind with scatological rudeness. Too bad they're being packaged in this pathetic showcase, a tired, Disneyfied chase comedy involving the mob and crooked cops. Rated R for strong language. -- Steve Murray   The Jungle Book PG   For kids, there's a bunch of cool animals. For adults, there's Jason Scott Lee in a loincloth. But for Rudyard Kipling fans, there's not much. It's like director Stephen Sommers' ``Adventures of Huck Finn'' last year -- another example of great source material that lacked an animating spark. -- Steve Murray   Just Cause R   By the end you can count the cliches: Yes, the brutal rapist- killer will kidnap the blonde, evade his pursuers via the standard drive-in-the- wrong-lane-of-traffic car chase, and then flee to exactly the spot police expect him to go. In this formula thriller, Sean Connery plays a Harvard law professor who reopens the case of a Florida death-row inmate (Blair Underwood) set to fry for the rape and murder of a young (white) girl. Laurence Fishburne is the local detective who tries to intimidate Connery out of town. As packed with crackers as a bowl of oyster stew, the film's small-town setting reeks of the socially conscious flicks of the '60s (``In the Heat of the Night''). Forget whodunit; you may be distracted by the movie's racial-sexual politics. With its hackneyed view of the South, it cues us to see Underwood's imprisonment as a symbolic punishment for a black male's taboo violation of a white female (whether he did it or not). Yet by the convoluted end, the movie all but endorses the same distasteful stereotype it pretends to explode. Still, Connery and Fishburne are predictably fine, and Ed Harris as a corn-pone Hannibal Lecter clone jumps on his Bible-spouting part with deep-fried relish. -- Steve Murray   The Last Seduction R   Probably the sleeper of the year. In the tradition of ``Double Indemnity'' and ``Body Heat,'' director John Dahl (``Red Rock West'') pairs a smart, sexy, no-good dame with a hunky sucker who's not half as smart as he thinks he is. Linda Fiorentino is a one-woman wrecking crew as a tough cookie with a lotta leg and even more nerve who easily gets nice-guy Peter Berg in her thrall. Rated R for sex, violence, language, nudity and adult themes.   Legends of the Fall R   Think of the very best ``Bonanza'' episode you ever saw; then cast it with the likes of Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt and Aidan Quinn; finally add in the sibling rivalry/father-always-liked-you-best themes of ``East of Eden.'' Yummy. Rated R for sex, nudity and violence.   The Lion King G   Disney's feature-length cartoon is royal entertainment. Sort of ``Bambi'' meets ``Hamlet'' on the Serengeti, it roars onto the screen with vivid characters and expert animation. Featuring the voices of James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons and Matthew Broderick. Rated G, but there is a death that may disturb young children.   Little Giants PG   This time, the Bad News Bears . . . I mean, the Mighty Ducks . . . I mean . . . Let's start over. This time, a gang of lovable kiddie misfits pull together and become a heck of a Pee Wee League football team. The only discernable twist is that the Giants' coach (Rick Moranis) and the coach of the all-star opposing team (Ed O'Neill) are brothers with a longstanding rivalry. Given a fourth-down-and-long situation, director Duwayne Dunham punts for formula and lets his cast fumble along as best they can. Rated PG for mild language.   Little Women PG   Director Gillian Armstrong (``My Brilliant Career'') and her solid cast, including Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon, have imbued the third screen version of Louisa May Alcott's classic with considerable care and craftsmanship -- every scene looks like a Currier and Ives print. Rated PG for mild adult themes.   A Low Down Dirty Shame R   Racist, sexist, homophobic and rude, Keenen Ivory Wayan's new action comedy is also shamelessly entertaining, turning genre cliches into a romp. Rated R for violence, strong language and sex. -- Steve Murray   The Madness   of King George NR   The year is 1788. King George III (Nigel Hawthorne) already has lost the Colonies. Now he's losing his mind. Based on Alan Bennett's much-praised play and artfully transferred from the stage by Nicholas Hytner, this historical whimsy recalls ``The Lion in Winter'' or ``The Ruling Class.'' But Hawthorne's extraordinary portrayal gives ``Madness'' its own unforgettable voice. He's definitely Oscar worthy.   The Mask PG-13   Forget the superhero plot of this live-action cartoon and focus on the Looney-Tunes special effects, the immensely likable Jim Carrey and Milo the mighty Jack Russell terrier. Directed by Chuck Russell. Rated PG-13 for mild violence.   Miami Rhapsody PG-13   Percolating to a mix of heady one-liners and romantic angst, writer- director David Frankel's disarmingly witty comedy examines the pitfalls of love (and lust) in the '90s. Sarah Jessica Parker is the film's invaluable motor, equally adept at spewing Mensa-level quips and dipping into slapstick. Frankel peppers his script with so many zingers, you want to curb your laughter so as not to miss the next one. Rated PG-13 for language and adult themes. -- Steve Murray  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950224.0088 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(4thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Murder in the First R   The more or less true story of a history-making case. In 1941, after spending years in solitary confinement for attempted escape (the usual maximum was 19 days), Alcatraz inmate Henri Young (Kevin Bacon) killed the convict who'd ratted on him in front of 200 witnesses. An ambitious young attorney (Christian Slater) took the case and decided to put the system on trial. This is good material and the actors give it their best. Alas, director Marc Rocco is his own -- and their -- worst enemy. His distinctively active camera has a certain panache, but it soon becomes an irritating affectation that detracts from the performances and the story. Rated R for violence, nudity, language, sex.   Nell PG-13   A gentle miracle of a movie with an Oscar-worthy performance by Jodie Foster. She plays the title character: a feral backwoods North Carolina woman who's been raised in almost total isolation from the modern world (No phone, no TV, etc.). Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson are rival doctors who become fascinated by her. Rated PG-13 for nudity.   Nobody's Fool R   Even when director Robert Benton grabs for the heartstrings, star Paul Newman tempers the sentiment and gives a career-capping performance as a father at the crossroads. Rated R for language and nudity. -- Steve Murray   Pulp Fiction R   Pop goes the pulp in this smashing sophomore effort by Quentin ``Reservoir Dogs'' Tarantino. Winner of the Golden Palm at Cannes and already subject to Oscar-time whispers, the picture is a gleefully lurid mix of hardboiled gangster-movie conventions and hip post-Warhol irony. Starring John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. Rated R for violence, language, nudity and drug use.   The Quick and the Dead R   A dead-on western from Sam Raimi (the ``Evil Dead'' movies). Reprising his avuncular villainy from ``Unforgiven,'' Gene Hackman plays the Big Cheese in a tiny western town who, for his own amusement and ego gratification, annually sponsors a quick-draw competition. Among the gathering of gunfighters lured by glory, money or both are a flashy gambler (Lance Henriksen), a pipe- smoking hired gun (Keith David), and Hackman's own son (Leonardo DiCaprio), a likable, cocky kid who really is as good as he says. There's also one of Hackman's ex-cronies (Russell Crowe), who's turned from a man of the gun to a man of God, yet is forced by Hackman to compete (i.e., draw or die.) Finally, there's a mysterious stranger (Sharon Stone) with an old score to settle. Stone is getting most of the advance publicity (and yes, she's just fine), but essentially she's just one among a colorful and accomplished cast who knows exactly how to match Raimi's imaginative over-the-top tone. Though the aforementioned ``Unforgiven'' comes to mind, Raimi's true model is Sergio Leone -- especially ``Once Upon a Time in the West.'' One heck of a homage to the spaghetti western, ``The Quick and the Dead'' is flavored with its own homemade sauce. Rated R for violence and language.   Quiz Show PG-13   Robert Redford directs a dazzingly entertaining movie about the quiz-show scandals of the '50s. The medium's message: Forget it, Jake; it's television. Starring Ralph Fiennes, John Turturro and Rob Morrow. Rated PG-13 for adult themes.   Richie Rich PG   Another chance for Macaulay Culkin to smirk. As comic-to-celluloid mutations go, it's what you'd expect: thin on script, fat on sets (the Riches' abode is Asheville's Biltmore Estate). The film offers a spectacularly twisted message from filmmakers wanting to play both sides of the fiscal fence. After endorsing the Riches' dollar-happy delirium, the movie claims that Richie's true wealth is a new set of friends (a Rainbow Coalition of street urchins enticed to come play with his expensive toys). Rated PG for mild violence and language. -- Steve Murray   Stargate PG-13   An engaging sci-fi yarn with a flying pyramid, three moons and Jaye Davidson in a dress. Again. We start on Earth, where a linguist named Daniel (James Spader) deciphers Egyptian hieroglyphics on a circular mechanism unearthed near the Pyramids. It's the Stargate, a thingamajig that, when uncoded, becomes a portal to a twin gate on a sandy planet across the universe. Daniel gets enlisted for a space-jumping expedition, led by gruff Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell), since he's the only one who can crack the code on that second Stargate. But first they have to face the sun god Ra (Davidson), a cosmic vampire. Like a Tintin adventure set in the cosmos, the movie has an enjoyable retro feel. But it's harder to get revved up by it. Rated PG-13 for violence. -- Steve Murray  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950224.0089 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(5thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Strawberry and Chocolate R   Havana homophobia is the ingred ient in a Cuban drama too vanilla for its own good. Think of a Lite ``Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' and you get the picture. Tomas Gutierrez Alea's film follows the edgy nonmating dance between flaming artiste Diego (Jorge Perrugoria) and revolutionary student David (Vladimir Cruz). Diego lures the young man home with the promise of banned books. What he really wants is all too clear in Perrugoria's lip-licking performance. Repelled, David tells his militant roomie that he knew Diego was ``a fag'' by his choice of ice cream: ``There was chocolate, he took strawberry.'' But David visits Diego again with plans to report the man's ``subversive'' activities; and instead finds himself intrigued by Diego's theatrical approach to life. Throw in an unstable hooker next door (Mirta Ibarra) with eyes for David, and you've got the makings of an Almodovar souffle. But ``Strawberry'' is weighted with lard. Set in 1979, it might have had more impact if it had actually been made then. Shot last year, it plays like a passe example of consciousness raising, the lukewarm tale of a noble Nell who makes emotional sacrifices for the stalwart young hetero. Though at least -- unlike William Hurt in ``Spider Woman'' -- Diego doesn't have to die in the process. That's some sort of progress. Rated R for language and strong sexuality. -- Steve Murray   Tom and Viv PG-13   With its genteel English settings, its repressed famous writer and his couldn't-be-more-different spouse, this story of T.S. Eliot and his first wife, Vivian Haigh-Wood, comes off as something of a ``Shadowlands'' wannabe. However, director Brian Gilbert and writer Michael Hastings haven't quite made a love story; worse, they're not quite sure what they have made. Viv (Miranda Richardson) is a vivacious heiress; Tom (Willem Dafoe) is a poor Yank at Oxford who falls for her country manse, her family, her sheer Englishness. But as Viv's brother (Tim Dutton) notes, ``She thought Tom was going to rescue her from tight little England, but tight little England was just what Tom wanted.'' Their marriage is a sad mismatch -- as her high spirits spill overboard into high-strung neuroticism and neediness, he becomes more withdrawn. But the film does little more than skim through their dilemma. If you didn't already know ``The Waste Land'' or ``Prufrock,'' you'd think Tom was an obnoxious prig, not worth Viv's trouble. Conversely, though her mother (Rosemary Harris in a strong supporting role) hints of ``female trouble,'' we never get more than Viv as a generic society loony. The film has moments of genuine emotional connection, but overall, this is a hollow movie.   Vanya on 42nd Street PG   Collaborating with stage director Andre Gregory, Louis Malle has created an ardent love letter -- to the theater, to great acting, to the tragicomic genius of Anton Chekhov. This pared- down performance of Chekhov's ``Uncle Vanya'' celebrates the fleeting glory of live performance as well as the enduring timelessness of the play. Starring Wallace Shawn and Julianne Moore. Rated PG for adult themes. .  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950224.0098 type=story > <HEADLINE> COMMENTARY: DEADLY VIGILANTISM A SPECIOUS RESPONSE TO VANDALISM </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> MIAMI  (BC-KLEINBERG-COLUMN-$ADV26-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199502.gz"

When he does come strutting into full view, his tail feathers will be extended like a giant fan and his wing tips will be dragging on the ground. If you see only a portion of the bird, and the beard dangling from his chest isn't visible, don't shoot. Hens sometimes respond to yelping. When the bird is close enough to shoot, no more than 30 yards with a shotgun, it is, if in the open, close enough to be easily identified as male or female.

But Delia doesn't either, really: The police report her safety to her family within days; they send grumpy cards and emissaries; but mostly, life proceeds as it had. While this sameness testifies to Delia's former ephemeral status, it also has a tinge of too much sugar in it. Would any family, even one as cheerfully ungrateful as the Grinsteads, just allow the silent maternal governor to disappear? And could she do it without profound distress, whether guilt or guilt over lack of guilt? Delia cries into her pillow every night and Sam writes a blandly anguished letter, but the sorrows on all parts mostly seem chalkish: no raised voices and no real hell to pay. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"

The apolitical Swedish scientists who took charge after his death have done an excellent job of building the authority of the prizes over time.(It wasn't easy, for political forces and the nobility tried for 30 years to shoulder the scientists aside.) The result is an excellent high-resolution rearview mirror in which to see the science behind us and infer something of the science ahead.

"45443"	"it"	"is"	" So the defeat in ``The Moor's Last Sigh'' is mythic as well as personal; if its story overwhelms at times, it is, like Moor's beloved Bombay, a world of passionate excess. The ironic distance that sometimes drives the novel may be a fortunate byproduct of biculturalism; Rushdie _ born in India, relocated to England _ knows that ``civilisation is the sleight of hand that conceals our natures from ourselves.'' Teeming with both civilization and the abominable, global lack of it, ``The Moor's Last Sigh'' is a novel of great intelligence and noble moral suasion. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960115.0377 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MOVIE-GUIDE-BOS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> GLOBE CRITICS RATE FILMS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) c.1996 The Boston Globe  ! poor, !! fair, !!! good, !!!! excellent   The Gate of Heavenly Peace !!! 1/2  Unrated  This brilliant, utterly absorbing three-hour documentary by Carma Hinton and Richard Gordon explores the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations, and subsequent massacre, in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. In addition to contemporary footage, there are interviews with several participants and a fascinating primer on 20th-century Chinese history.  Two If by Sea !!  R  The charms of Sandra Bullock and Denis Leary, a blue-collar couple with little aptitude for art theft, are almost swamped by Leary's surprisingly lame script. The gang-that-can't-steal-straight stereotyping of working-class Boston would be rejected by all but the dumbest sitcom.  Dead Man Walking !!! 1/2  R  Susan Sarandon plays a nun forced to put her beliefs on the line, and Sean Penn gives the performance of his career as a convicted rapist and murderer. Together, they make this anti-death-penalty film one of that genre's most powerful. Playing no small part in the film's impact is writer-director Tim Robbins' balance, restraint and compassion for all involved.  Dunston Checks In !! 1/2  PG  In the tradition of Disney's chimpanzee movies of the 1960s, this orangutan-run-amok movie is enjoyable on its modest terms. The rascally Dunston has been trained as a burglar by a phony British aristocrat (Rupert Everett). In a New York luxury hotel, the manager's sons try to foil the Brit and rescue Dunston from his life of crime and abuse. Comic relief is provided by Faye Dunaway as the hotel owner and Paul Reubens as an animal wrangler.  Bio-Dome !  PG-13  Aaargh! Where does one turn to find the point of Pauly Shore's existence? Shore actually plays the smarter of two dimwits who mistakenly lock themselves in a Biosphere-type isolation experiment. Stephen Baldwin plays the jelly-brained buddy. The level of comedy writing is numbingly, painfully low, but the dialogue does provide the movie's capsule review: ``nonstop moronathon.''  Eye for an Eye !  R  Sally Fields' fighting-mom persona is dragged through the first stupid thriller of 1996. She seeks revenge upon the sleaze (Kiefer Sutherland) who raped and murdered her daughter, only to slip through the justice system on a technicality.  French Twist !! 1/2  R  A sprightly French comedy that finally runs out of steam. A philandering husband finds himself dealing with some unexpected payback when his long-suffering wife gets involved with a lesbian truck driver played by the film's writer-director, Josiane Balasko.  Midnight Dancers ! 1/2  Unrated  This Filipino melodrama about the gay sex-club scene in Manila may leave even those enamored of young male sex objects feeling frustrated with its narrative laxity. The first half of the movie has a trio of hot-bod brothers contentedly plying their trade at Club Exotica, bringing their wages home to Mom and Pop. Then calamity strikes in soap opera fashion.  Public Access !!! Unrated  This piquant first film by ``The Usual Suspects'' director Bryan Singer has atmosphere to spare, as a disturbed stranger conquers a small town with his incendiary talk show called ``Our Town.'' The dark-underside-of-the-American-dream message is a bit thick, but Singer's expert touch could make ``The Music Man'' into a compelling thriller.  Salvaged Lives !! 1/2  Unrated  Barbara Leibovitz brings to light a unique rehabilitation program at the California Institution for Men at Chino: Prisoners are trained to be deep-sea divers upon their release.The straightforward documentary misses out on a mythic dimension to the subject that could have made the film more cinematically striking.  !!! 12 Monkeys  Fans of director Terry Gilliam (``Brazil,'' ``The Fisher King'') know to expect visionary settings and a certain looseness of story. They won't be disappointed in his newest, a rotting-civilization tale starring Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe and a wired Brad Pitt. The plot? Time travel, an attempt to save the world from viral plague and a great deal of uncertainty about who's crazy here.  !! 1/2 The Mystery of Rampo  Kazuyoshi Okuyama's striking gothic is filled with extravagant visuals and bracing satire, not to mention references ranging from Poe to Hitchcock. A Japanese crime-fiction writer is bedeviled by the tendency of fact to resemble his stories _ and the fun and cultural commentary outweigh too much repetition and too much portentousness.  ! 1/2 Four Rooms  Directors Alison Anders, Alexandre Rockwell, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino come up empty-handed in a quartet of short films set in a seedy LA hotel. Actors flocked to it, and a couple are funny _ Madonna as a witch, Antonio Banderas as a Latin gangster. Mostly, though, there's no room service at all here, especially from Tim Roth's painfully wide-of-the-mark homage to Jerry Lewis' ``The Bellboy.''  !!! Othello  Oliver Parker succeeds with a popularized ``Othello'' in the vein of Franco Zeffirelli's ``Hamlet'' with Mel Gibson. It's vigorous and straightforward, even if the trimming makes it seem truncated. And in Laurence Fishburne it's got the sexiest and most volcanic Othello ever put on screen. Kenneth Branagh plays Iago for contrast. He's colloqual, mercurial, making up Othello's downfall as he goes along, emboldened by how well it goes.  !!! 1/2 Shanghai Triad  Zhang Yimou's swimmy, luxuriant visuals usher us into a Shanghai underworld of the '30s that's more movie myth than actuality. Then he takes the gloves off. Gaudy, petulant bird-in-a-cage nightclub singer Gong Li finds she's not the queen of the underworld, as she thought, but merely a ruthless godfather's disposable plaything. Zhang avoids the gangster-movie cliches of both Hollywood and Hong Kong as he tells a story of a corrupt regime wielding life-and-death power and cutting women no slack at all.  !!! Balto  This animated adventure about sled dogs in Alaska is a treat. The title hero is a wolf/husky half-breed who comes through in the clutch when a shipment of medicine has to make it to Nome, Alaska, during a diphtheria epidemic in 1925. Balto's arrogant rival sled dog is a good villain; comic relief is well taken care of by a Russian-accented goose (voice by Bob Hoskins); and there's even a ``Lady and the Tramp''-style love story.  !! 1/2 Cry, the Beloved Country  A handsome, honorable production of Alan Paton's classic novel, with sterling performances from James Earl Jones and Richard Harris as fathers who lose sons to racism. But it often seems too stately and muted to spring to fully vibrant dramatic life.  !! 1/2 Cutthroat Island  Geena Davis plays Errol Flynn, Matthew Modine turns up in the Maureen O'Hara sidekick role _ and their gender switch is about the only twist on the traditional pirate saga. Old-fashioned and conventional as it is, though, it has its moments. Davis is convincing as the swashbuckler, and that much-discussed budget does show up onscreen, in lavish production details.  !! 1/2 Dracula: Dead and Loving It  The best of Mel Brooks' recent spoofs. It plays the Bram Stoker novel surprisingly straight, with Leslie Nielsen obviously doing his Bela Lugosi homework and playing the fanged count in a much less farcical style than you'd expect from the ``Naked Gun'' movies. Handsome as it is, it needs more goofiness: It's too mild.  !!! 1/2 Frankie Starlight  A beguiling little one-of-a-kind movie about a dwarf who gets hooked on astronomy and grows up to be a writer. As the young title-roleist, Alan Pentony unleashes 1995's best smile on film. Anne Parillaud is touching, too, as his sad French mother who stows away on a troop ship bound for Cork, and Gabriel Byrne is an asset as a customs officer who begins a complicated relationship with her.  !!! Grumpier Old Men  The Coot Pack is back in this enjoyable sequel to ``Grumpy Old Men,'' the 1993 hit that made aging look like a day at the playground. The formula is the same here _ the prank-filled war between Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon _ but there's nothing stale about it. This time, the lively Sophia Loren is on hand to go a few rounds with Matthau before stealing his heart.  !!!! Lamerica  A throwback to the great old days of foreign film, this one reinvents postwar Italian neo-realism. It tells what we think is going to be a story of Albanians fleeing post-communist chaos, and is _ but it widens into a story about emigration itself as a slick Italian scam artist, Enrico Lo Verso, finds himself stripped of his identity and thus is in the same boat as the desperate Albanians.  !!!! Nixon  Oliver Stone's surprisingly sympathetic and restrained portrait of the late Watergate president as a haunted man, surrounded by darkness, engineering his own destruction, yet also gifted and in some ways visionary. What brings it to life is Anthony Hopkins' amazing performance, which humanizes Nixon more than he was able to humanize himself. Joan Allen's Pat Nixon is a standout, too.  !! 1/2 Tom and Huck  Casting Mark Twain's ``The Adventures of Tom Sawyer'' as a buddy movie isn't a bad idea, and Jonathan Taylor Thomas' Tom and Brad Renfro's Huck are both appealing. But the timeworn adventures are presented without much imagination, and the movie becomes forgettable almost before the credits roll.  !!! Waiting to Exhale  Glossy, high-powered soap opera about four black professional women helping one another through a bad year in Phoenix. Their problems arise because their love lives are as frustrating as their professional lives are rewarding. Lots of involving warmth, glamour and star power from Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon _ with seamless direction by Forest Whitaker.  !!! Heat  It's too long, and it's otherwise flawed _ but it's also Hollywood's ultimate cops-and-robbers morality tale, with Al Pacino as the work-aholic cop risking his crumbling marriage to nab icy master thief Robert De Niro in a Los Angeles noir universe.  !! Jumanji  Lots of computer-generated technical dazzle in this fantasy about jungle animals escaping a supernatural board game and terrorizing a New Hampshire town. Robin Williams is sympathetic as a grown boy trapped in the game. But a lame script holds down the enjoyment level.  !! 1/2 Sabrina  Not a bad remake of Billy Wilder's 1954 original about the chauffeur's daughter contended for by two rich brothers, in this case Harrison Ford's workaholic and Greg Kinnear's pipsqueak playboy. Julia Ormond gives the title role a good try, but she can't muster the late Audrey Hepburn's magic (who could?). And the fact that the script focuses more on Ford and money than on Ormond and love keeps it from reaching the original's fairy-tale charm. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960115.0378 type=story > <HEADLINE> A KNIGHT'S BOLD MOVES </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-MOVIES-MCKELLEN-BOS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"

While no doubt there are inherited factors in behavior, it is, after all, much harder to define types of behavior than it is to diagnose physical diseases.

Second, most scientists agree that behaviors probably result from the interaction of many genes, each having a small effect, and these genetic factors, in turn, interact with many environmental influences. ``Every biological object, but especially a human being, is the nexus of a large number of weakly interacting causes,'' Lewontin says. ``It is this structure of interaction of multiple causal pathways that makes living creatures free in a way that inanimate objects are not.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"

Once-a-day supplements such as vitamins C and E and beta-carotene aren't the only things flying off the shelves these days. Health-minded shoppers are filling their baskets with more esoteric _ but no less potent _ over-the-counter mind, body and even sex-life rechargers such as melatonin and glutathione.  What's more, many are finding doctors who will write prescriptions for still more powerful _ and controversial _ elixirs.  How come? Quite simply, if you don't replenish these hormones, proteins, antioxidants and other vital substances that start to dwindle as early as age 30, you lose them.  The good news: Your body's crucial chemicals can be restored _ often with simple and safe tactics such as exercise, diet and dietary supplements. Hard-core longevity seekers can ask their doctors about hormone replacement or prescription drugs.  What follows is a guide to today's hot rejuvenation supplements.  A word of caution: Don't start any restorative therapy program without first discussing it with your doctor. Acetylcholine: The Memory Pill  As acetylcholine (ACh) runs low, mental function may take a hit, especially memory. Choline or lecithin supplements can help boost ACh levels.  In a recent study at Florida International University, people over 50 who took 13.5 grams of lecithin a day for five weeks went from 35 memory lapses a week to 19. Cardiolipin: The Brain Booster  Cardiolipin protects mitochondria _ the tiny ``energy plants'' for every cell in the body. Many experts think mitochondrial slowdown underlies every aspect of aging _ so cardiolipin may be a key to aging itself.  A cardiolipin replenisher may be on the way: Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR), now being tested by Sigma Tau, Inc., for treating Alzheimer's disease, boosts cardiolipin in old rats.  ALCAR is available in Europe, where it's widely prescribed not only for Alzheimer's but to slow normal brain aging. DHEA: All-Purpose Youth Tonic  Dubbed the ``mother of all hormones'' (its offspring include the sex hormones estrogen and androgens), DHEA may also buffer the effects of stress hormones and prevent age-related diseases.  ``DHEA levels are a fairly significant predictor of longevity,'' says Stanford University biologist Robert Sapolsky  Low DHEA has been linked to a number of diseases, including breast cancer, obesity, high cholesterol, hypertension and heart disease. Even under normal circumstances, DHEA levels decline by as much as 75 percent between early adulthood and old age.  In animals, DHEA replacement works wonders, fighting obesity, protecting against diabetes, sharpening memory and warding off infectious diseases. But in humans DHEA supplementation is controversial. Though it's long been used in Europe as an anti-obesity and anti-aging drug, some scientists warn high doses may lead to liver damage and excessive testosterone levels.  On the plus side, when Dr. Samuel S.C. Yen and his colleagues at the University of California School of Medicine in La Jolla gave 50 milligrams of DHEA daily for six months to 13 men and 17 women ages 40 to 70, they reported ``a remarkable increase'' in physical and psychological well-being, deeper sleep and an improved ability to handle stress.  DHEA is very potent and should not be taken without consulting your doctor. Dopamine: Smart Medicine  It's long been known that Parkinson's disease patients have extra-low levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Now studies suggest low dopamine may be part of normal aging, especially in men, and may play a role in memory loss.  Prescription dopamine boosters such as levo-dopa, bromocriptine and selegeline (Deprenyl) are used to treat Parkinson's. Can they also help the healthy?  A 1992 study by Dr. Richard A. Depue and his colleagues at the University of Minnesota Medical School showed that eight 20- to 35-year-old women who took 2.5 milligram doses of bromocriptine scored an average of 44 percent higher on spatial memory tests than women who took only a placebo. Estrogen: The Sexy Mood Lifter  The ``female hormone'' helps regulate reproduction functions in both sexes and is essential for growth and bone development. It may also be involved in mood (low levels are linked to PMS and postnatal depression), memory and even strength, balance and coordination.  The debate over estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) is fierce. On the plus side, estrogen can lower cardiac risk by boosting ``good'' HDL cholesterol and lowering ``bad'' LDL. Estrogen replacement also helps maintain bone mass and lowers fracture risk in women with osteoporosis. It fights menopause symptoms such as ``hot flashes.''  The downside is ERT may raise breast cancer risk. But studies have been conflicting on this. Glutathione: Nature's Health Insurance  Not as hyped as vitamins C and E and beta-carotene, glutathione is a heavyweight antioxidant. It's also a major natural detoxifier, neutralizing environmental poisons and carcinogens.  Some experts hold that glutathione levels decline as we age. People with age-related diseases such as heart disease, arthritis and Type II diabetes have lower levels of glutathione than healthy people.  According to one study, ``elderly people with high blood glutathione levels are physically, psychologically and sociologically healthier.''  Glutathione is sold in health-food stores, but you can also get it in foods such as fresh, unprocessed pork; veal; chicken and even ground beef. Fresh whole fruit and vegetables (not juices) are also high in glutathione, especially citrus fruits, melons and raw carrots. GH: The Hardbody Hormone  The potent human growth hormone (GH) is one of the most controversial anti-agers. In children and adolescents, the hormone is essential for growth and physical development. In adults it affects how lean or flabby we are, and may boost the immune system.  GH declines start in young adulthood and accelerate with age. Some adults _ especially ones with more sedentary lifestyles _ may produce no GH at all. GH enthusiasts link its decline to the shrinking muscles and loss of strength that often accompany aging.  In early studies, GH seemed to be an awesome anti-aging supplement _ older people who took it lost fat, gained muscle and had improved skin tone.  But recent trials raise doubts: The benefits of GH seem modest and brief, with such side effects as water retention and insulin resistance.  On the other hand, a 1991 study at the University of Innsbruck Medical School in Austria reported that GH had simulated immune system cells that fight off bacterial infections.  You can boost GH levels naturally with vigorous exercise such as weight training. As a drug, GH is approved by the FDA only for the treatment of unusually short children. Take this drug only after consulting a doctor. Melatonin: Miracle Body Mender  Rapidly emerging as a major anti-ager, melatonin is a powerful antioxidant and a regulator of the body's clock, causing sleepiness in response to darkness. It also primes the immune system to fight infectious diseases and perhaps even cancer.  Some scientists say that as we age, free radicals cripple melatonin-making cells in the pineal gland. People over 65 have only one-fourth the melatonin levels of 25 year olds. The results: declining immune function, sleep disturbances and possibly increased vulnerability to cancer.  Melatonin supplements are sold in health-food stores. Myofibrillar Proteins: Prime Muscle Builders  Without this family of proteins, we'd be immobile. They underlie the muscle connections that drive all movement.  Dr. Stephen Welle of the University of Rochester found that production of myofibrillar protein in men over 62 was up to 44 percent slower than in men ages 21 to 31. This may explain the loss of muscle size and strength associated with aging.  The key to boosting muscle proteins is exercise, specifically weight training. Testosterone: The Sex-Drive Stimulant  The ``male hormone'' (a misnomer: Women produce it too) is crucial to growth, sexual maturation and perhaps maintenance of sex drive in later years.  Experts think that testosterone declines in one-third of men over 55 _ perhaps contributing to the loss of strength, sagging sexual desire and depression.  In the last five years studies have shown that in men over 54, testosterone replacement can boost lean body mass, strength and sex drive.  Although once testosterone was believed to hasten heart disease, more research shows it actually increases HDL, reducing heart risk. Thymosins: Immunity Boosters  Helping regulate and stimulate the immune system, these hormones also spur the production of neurotransmitters and sex hormones.  The thymus gland, which makes thymosins, shrinks from walnut- size in youth to pea-size in mature adulthood. By old age the gland has virtually disappeared, producing no thymosins.  Thymosins are routinely prescribed in Europe to treat cancer and diabetes. In the United States, alpha-thymosin is FDA-approved for the treatment of hepatitis B.  But you may not have to take thymosins to restore their activity: At least one study has shown that supplements of 400 milligrams of zinc sulfate per day can produce the same results.

(--Mexico, Central America, South America: PAUL FINCH in Los Angeles, 310-996-0075; fax, 310-996-0089. Includes a 200-word sidebar By STACEY COLINO From Child magazine c.1996 Stacey Colino (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  Each year in the United States an estimated 16 million children require treatment at emergency rooms, and of the 600,000 that are hospitalized, an astounding 23,000 die because of injuries.  But the majority of these injuries could be prevented, according to pediatric health-care providers.  Here are some lifesaving lessons from ER doctors and emergency medical service (EMS) workers to help you prepare for unexpected emergencies.  Lesson 1: Don't put off taking CPR.  Learning to perform pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation can save your child's life if he stops breathing. Courses are offered (usually with basic first aid techniques) at local hospitals and Red Cross centers, and through the American Heart Association.  Lesson 2: Always put your child in a safety seat or a seat belt.  Car crashes are the No. 1 cause of death and disability among children.  Car seats and seat belts could have prevented many of those injuries. Yet often parents who strap themselves in make the mistake of holding a child in their laps, believing that if there is an accident, they'll be able to hold onto the child.  ``That's impossible even at low speeds of 20 or 30 miles per hour,'' says Dr. John P. Santamaria, attending physician at the Pediatric Emergency Center at St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa, Fla.  For small infants or low-birthweight babies, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in Chicago recommends strapping infants in an infant car seat that faces the rear of the car. A convertible seat that faces forward should be used for children who weigh more than 20 pounds or are a year old.  A booster seat that properly positions the seat belt is best for kids who have outgrown convertible seats. Once a child is tall enough to wear a shoulder strap and a lap belt comfortably he's safest in the backseat.  Lesson 3: Remove small objects from a young child's environment.  Take a close look at your child's surroundings from her point of view (by getting down on your hands and knees) to remove any hazards.  If your child swallows an object, observe her symptoms before acting. If she's not breathing because the object is obstructing her airway and she's over a year old, use the Heimlich maneuver and call 911, Santamaria advises.  But if she's under 1, coughing and choking slightly but getting air in, don't touch her _ instead, call an ambulance. Patting her on the back, doing the Heimlich maneuver or upsetting her can create a total obstruction of the airway, so it's better to have an emergency medical technician come to your home to treat her.  If your child swallows an object and seems to be none the worse for it, call your pediatrician or local ER for advice. Some objects, such as button batteries, can pose a problem because of their potential to leak, so they need to be removed. Other items may safely make it through your child's digestive tract without intervention.  Lesson 4: Poison-proof your home.  Approximately 32,000 kids under the age of 15 were hospitalized because of poisoning in 1991.  As far as prevention goes, here are the basics:  _ Put child-proof locks on cabinets;  _ use child-proof containers for medications, vitamins and alcohol;  _ keep household chemicals locked up. Always be on the lookout for household hazards, such as peeling paint, that your child could eat. And never put medicines or chemicals in food containers.  If your child ingests a toxin, call your local poison control center before doing anything else. It's smart to keep ipecac syrup in your medicine cabinet, but in some instances, making a child vomit may do more harm than good, so you need to find out what to do first.  There isn't any one telltale sign of poisoning: Symptoms vary with the substance but can include uncommon clumsiness, profuse sweating, paleness, choking, a racing or slowing heartbeat or seizures.  Lesson 5: Supervise children when they're in danger of falling.  Falls account for more than a third of kids' injuries seen in emergency departments. According to Dr. Jean Ogborn, director of the Pediatric Emergency Medical Fellowship Program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore.  Playgrounds are fraught with danger. Choose an area with a surface that has six to 12 inches of soft material, such as rubber matting, sand or mulch, for gentle landings. And check the equipment for excess wear and tear or rust _ which could cause a swing to break apart, for instance.  Lesson 6: Keep your child flat after a serious fall.  If your child falls and ends up with a head injury and appears dazed or unconscious or is bleeding profusely, or if she falls a great distance, such as out of a second-story window, keep her in a flat position and call 911 immediately. Then return to your child.  If she stops breathing or if you're not sure if she's breathing, remove any obvious obstructions from in front of her face, nose or mouth, but don't go fishing into the mouth.  Position her on her back with her head and neck in a straight line and check for breathing by feeling in front of the nose. Then try a rescue breath or two by pinching her nose and breathing into her mouth to see if you can get her chest to rise, Ogburn says.  Lesson 7: Monitor your child after a moderate fall.  With less traumatic falls or head injuries, make sure that your child can comfortably move her arms and legs, and that her pupils aren't dilated (larger than normal). Also watch out for behavioral changes, such as disorientation or persistent crying.  ``It's a fallacy that a child should not be allowed to go to sleep,'' says Dr. Alfred Sacchetti, research director of the department of emergency medicine at Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center in Camden, N.J. But it is important to wake her up every hour or two to see how she's acting.  Over the next few hours, also keep an eye out for these problems: If she vomits more than twice or has a significant headache, call an ambulance or go to the emergency room.  Lesson 9: Insist that your child wear protective gear for sports  More than 2.5 million kids a year visit ERs because of sports injuries. And we're not just talking about football and baseball. The in-line skating craze has spawned an epidemic of wrist, forearm, elbow, knee and ankle injuries. Bike accidents can cause serious head injuries, as well as lacerations and broken bones.  Protective gear is the key to preventing these injuries. And the onus is on parents to make sure the proper pads, guards and helmets are worn every time your child plays a sport.  Lesson 10: Go to the ER if a laceration is large or deep.  Cuts that are deep and gaping wide open, bleeding profusely for more than 10 minutes or located on a joint, hand or the face need to be treated quickly in order to stop the bleeding, to prevent infection and to speed healing.  Lesson 11: If a burn appears severe, call 911.  An estimated 350,000 kids under the age of 19 are treated for burn injuries in ERs each year.  With third degree burns (the most serious), blisters often form right away and the skin may appear white, charred or hard. Third-degree burns may not be painful because they often damage nerve endings.  With a second-degree burn, the skin is likely to blister but remain pink according to Dr. Bob Schafermeyer, associate chairman for the department of emergency medicine at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, N.C. And if the skin turns red _ like a sunburn _ and your child feels considerable pain, that's probably a first-degree burn.  Any burn that covers the equivalent of three of your child's palms needs medical attention.  How to treat first-degree burns: If something hot has spilled on your child, strip her clothes off immediately. Run the burn under cold water for 10 to 15 minutes or until the pain subsides.  For small burns, apply a topical antibiotic cream, such as Neosporin or Bacitracin, after 15 to 20 minutes. Never put butter on a burn _ this will only hold the heat in. And resist the urge to kiss it, to reduce the risk of infection.  If the burn blisters, have it checked by a doctor.  Lesson 13: Protect kids from large and small bodies of water.  ``Among babies and toddlers, the most common drownings are in bathtubs and buckets of water,'' explains Dr. Richard Cantor, chairman of pediatric emergency medicine for the American College of Emergency Physicians in Washington, D.C. ``A toddler can drown in four inches of water.''  If a toddler reaches into a bucket of water, he could fall in and be unable to right himself.  To prevent such tragedies, never leave a child unattended in a bathtub or on a toilet. Tubs should be drained after use, and toilet covers should be closed and locked until your child is over 5.  To stay safe at the swimming pool, make sure there's at least a 5-foot-high fence with a self-latching lock around the area, and never leave kids unsupervised.  Pre-ER treatment: If, after being submerged in water, your child is breathing hard, has a change in color or is coughing, call 911. If your child is not breathing or if her heart stops, call 911 and initiate CPR. -0- SIDEBAR: ARE YOU PREPARED FOR AN EMERGENCY?  When an accident happens, you don't want to rack your brain for phone numbers or other crucial information. Here's how to gauge if you're well prepared:  _ Do you have the local poison control number, the emergency access number (if it's not 911) and your pediatrician's number posted by the phone?  _ Do you know where the nearest emergency room is _ and the fastest route to get there? Which hospital in your area has the best trauma or pediatric center?  _ Is your child's immunization record up to date and in a place where you can quickly grab it?  _ Do you know which medications your child is allergic to?  _ Does your child wear a Medic Alert bracelet to inform caregivers of medical problems such as diabetes, medication allergies or heart problems?  _ Have you been trained in CPR or basic first aid techniques? If not, contact your local chapter of the American Red Cross or the American Heart Association.  _ Do you have a first aid kit at home? It should contain Ace bandages, antibiotic cream. Band-Aids, adhesive tape, gauze, tweezers, scissors with rounded tips, acetaminophen, instant-activating ice bags, a first aid manual and ipecac syrup.

Includes a color slide of Glenn Close in a scene from ``101 Dalmatians'' By CINDY PEARLMAN World rights except Chicago (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  First it was bunnies, now it's puppies. Is anyone in the animal kingdom safe from Glenn Close?  Actually, the woman who killed a little girl's pet rabbit in ``Fatal Attraction'' (1987) and goes after two kids' cute puppies in ``101 Dalmatians,'' opening Nov. 27, says that she hates that image.  ``I feel absolutely terrible, like I'm some monster,'' Glenn Close says. ``I completely adore dogs!''  The actress looks nothing like her cartoonish Cruella DeVil character in an interview at New York's Rihga Royal Hotel. Dressed in a black Armani pants suit with boyish, close-cropped blonde hair, she is, in fact, quite charming.  Unless you're a puppy, perhaps. As ``Dalmatians'' co-star Joely Richardson reports, the film's many dogs didn't take to Close.  ``The first time Glenn came onto the set, Perdy (the lead female Dalmatian) took one look at her and went running off,'' Richardson says in a separate interview. ``Perdy either smelled her cats or didn't like the bold colors Glenn was wearing. Finally on the fourth take, she stayed put. She realized Glenn wasn't going to hurt her.''  And in the hotel today, a group of the film's dogs, brought in for photo opportunities, cower when she approaches them, cooing in a friendly tone.  Old memories die hard even in dogs, perhaps. As Cruella, Close is PETA's worst nightmare come to life, a fur-obsessed maniac with a demonic cackle. She loves fur _ coats, pajamas, sheets ... even a live skunk, which serves as her handbag. Throw in the talon-like fingernails and black-and-white costuming that extends even to her hair, and no one is likely to mistake her for Mary Poppins.  ``My own 8-year-old daughter, Annie, was very scared when she saw me dressed up,'' Close says. ``She kept saying, `Mom, Cruella makes me mad. Can't you be Anita?'''  But Close wanted to be the Mean Queen. In fact, reading John Hughes' initial script, she found the character too bland.  ``I didn't think Cruella was evil enough,'' Close says. ``So we went back to the original cartoon and lifted a lot of lines, because she was so deliciously bad.  ``She would say, `Bash those pups in the head! Do you have any chloroform?''' The actress laughs. ``That was right from the cartoon.''  When trying to find the character, Close says, ``I decided that she was the devil. Her food is black. She likes to be hot, which is why she likes fur. Her sheets are ermine _ the hotter the better, which is what hell is like.''  It was hell for the actress, too.  ``I was in deep pain most of the time,'' she says. ``Cruella's shoes were 4-1/2-inch heels,'' she explains, and the costume was heavy and stiflingly hot _ and too intricate to be removed or even loosened between takes. Then there were the stunts, including an immersion, fur coat and all, in a vat of molasses.  All in all, Close says, the shoot was ``a certain form of torture.''  The role is only the latest evolution in a career which started with sweetness-and-light roles in ``The World According to Garp'' (1982), ``The Natural'' (1983) and ``The Big Chill'' (1984), only to veer into villainy with ``Fatal Attraction,'' ``Dangerous Liaisons'' (1988) and, most recently, a smash Broadway run as the demonic Norma Desmond in ``Sunset Boulevard'' (1995).  ``Cruella,'' Close says, ``is like the cherry on the cake of evil.''  She even takes her bad rep home with her. Mounted in Close's kitchen is the huge knife she wielded in ``Fatal Attraction.''  ``It's only the cardboard knife,'' she hastens to add. ``In the close-ups, when I'm near Michael Douglas' face, they wouldn't allow me to have a real knife.  ``People always come in and say, `Is this what I think it is?'''  The actress laughs. ``I go, `Yeah!' From the start, they know not to mess with me.''  Despite her legendary status _ back in 1987, the National Enquirer tagged her, ``The Most Hated Woman in America'' _ Close isn't the grand dame that one might expect.  ``I expected her to be more of the diva, but she surprised me,'' Richardson says. ``She's very quiet. Frankly, at the end of this shoot I still wasn't sure what Glenn Close was really like.''  Close guards her privacy ... well, closely. She rarely speaks about growing up on a 500-acre Connecticut spread, or her years spent at a boarding school in Switzerland while her father practiced medicine in Zaire.  She won't even discuss her five-year singing stint with the ever-so-cheerful touring company, Up With People.  ``I don't like talking about it,'' she says simply.  Instead, she focuses herself on her work.  ``I always thought acting was a terrific way of expressing myself,'' she says. ``You see, I was painfully shy as a child. But strangely enough, a stage is where I can get out of myself.''  Two Tony Awards, three Emmy nominations and five Oscar nominations into her career, the actress lives quietly in Connecticut with her daughter Annie. Close is currently engaged to Steve Beers, after previous marriages to musician Cabot Wade and venture capitalist James Marlas. Annie's father is producer John Starcke.  Close met Beers while she was performing in ``Sunset Boulevard,'' on which he worked as a production carpenter.  ``I hadn't had a man in my life for three years,'' she recalls with a blush. ``I didn't have anyone to go to (the customary) opening-night (party) with, which is pretty pathetic.  ``I heard Steve was a great guy, so I got up the courage to say, `Can I ask you something?' He said, `Sure' _ and then some big crisis happened on the stage.''  By the time Beers returned from that crisis, Close was in full Norma get-up, and feeling not at all attractive.  ``It was this white Kabuki makeup,'' she recalls. ``He came up and said, `Is now a good time for your question?'  ``My heart sunk. But I still said, `I was wondering, um, if, ah, you would consider going out to dinner sometime.'  ``He paused and looked at me and said, `In a heartbeat,''' she says. ``It was the greatest.''  Of course, Close has heard the talk about the movie star dating a carpenter, but she disregards it.  ``It's not about someone's job. It's about their aura,'' she says.  If her career arc has taken her from goodie-goodies to villains, the next steps will take her to the White House, as she plays first ladies in two upcoming films.  In Tim Burton's ``Mars Attacks,'' her president/husband is Jack Nicholson, while in 1997's ``Air Force One'' she will play opposite Harrison Ford.  ``Something happens on Air Force One and as the First Lady I might have to declare myself president,'' Close says. ``I might be the first woman in charge.''  In her own life, however, Close is clearly already in charge, and her family is her first priority.  ``It's harder and harder for me to leave home,'' she says. ``The memory of childhood is something that's totally in my mind. It will be in my daughter's mind forever, and I want to be a big part of it.''  And incidentally, that house in Connecticut does in fact include two cats, three mice, a tank full of fish, a pony and a horse. No rabbits, but there are three dogs.  So she isn't really Cruella DeVil. Does she even wear fur?  ``I do have a coat that has a fur lining,'' she admits. ``Once I had a fur coat, but I didn't feel comfortable in it. You see, I really do love animals.''  If only those puppies would believe her. c.1996 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Lynn Redgrave and Geoffrey Rush in a scene from ``Shine.'' By IAN SPELLING (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  What do you call a movie star who doesn't make movies?  Call her offbeat. Call her different. Call her Lynn Redgrave.  She's been a star since she lit up ``Georgy Girl'' (1966), validating the heritage of a name which she shares with two other movie stars, the late Sir Michael Redgrave, her father, and her sister, Vanessa Redgrave.  Since then, however, she's been seen more on stage than on screen. But it's clear that she's missed the movies from the excitement with which she raves about her new film, ``Shine.''  ``I am excited,'' she says with gusto. ``This is a small film that everyone seems to know about, seems to want to see and experience.  ``The only other time a film's reception came so out of the blue was 30 years ago, when I did `Georgy Girl' (1966). Lots of exciting things have happened for me on the stage, but this is an absolute rarity in terms of my films.''  Actually, Redgrave doing a film at all is an absolute rarity. ``Shine,'' opening around the country throughout December, is her first in six years.  ``That was not for a lack of wanting, but a lack of being offered anything,'' she says with a laugh that drips sarcasm. ``It was a situation aided and abetted by my longstanding disagreement with Universal Pictures.  ``What major studio wants to hire somebody who's quite loudly and publicly decrying studio behavior?''  The actress' battle with Universal dated from 1981, when she was fired from the TV series ``House Calls.'' The studio blamed it on financial conflicts, while Redgrave said it was because she had insisted on breast-feeding her baby on the set.  Fortunately for Redgrave, ``Shine'' is an independent film and director Scott Hicks, wasn't familiar with Redgrave's studio battles. The Australian director's interest was sparked by his seeing her one-woman show, ``Shakespeare for My Father,'' on tour in Houston.  In one scene, Redgrave wore an Australian cattleman's hat and coat _ and, she relates, something clicked in Hicks.  ``My play is about my search for my relationship with my dad,'' she says, ``and in a sense `Shine' is about a man's relationship with his father.  ``There were all these coincidences and parallels that made Scott think of me for this small but wonderful role in `Shine.'''  Covering a three-decade period from the 1950s to the 1980s, ``Shine'' is set in Australia and tells the real-life story of David Helfgott, a respected classical pianist. Helfgott grew up with a demanding father (Armin Mueller-Stahl) who instilled in his son an appreciation of music _ and then smothered him in it and his overbearing love and jealousy.  By his early 20s, Helfgott cracked and withdrew into his own private world. A decade later, the pianist emerged from a mental institution to win self-assurance, love and public recognition of his prodigious talents.  Redgrave, 53, plays Gillian, the vibrant Australian astrologer who impulsively marries Helfgott (Geoffrey Rush). Gillian's every moment of screen time energizes ``Shine,'' but Redgrave explains that the character didn't come easily.  She had conversed by telephone with the real Gillian, but met her only late in the shooting process. Until then, she struggled to conceive of the character in acting terms.  ``David and the other characters leaped off the page, but because there was so little of Gillian, it was hard at first to make it work,'' she recalls. ``I'd played real characters before. I saw pictures and videos of Gillian, read articles about her and David, but I was having a tough time of it.  ``I wanted to look and sound like the real Gillian, to replicate her distinctive style. Scott saw what was happening and told me to create my own Gillian and not a carbon copy.  ``I found that frustrating at first,'' she adds, ``because he had an actress whose stock-in-trade is submerging herself in a role and converting herself into someone else. He said, `Give me the essence of Gillian.'''  When Redgrave saw the finished film, she finally understood Hicks' point.  ``The movie is about David, and the audience is in his mind,'' she says. ``The essence Scott kept talking about had to come in at the movie's end and convince the audience that Gillian, whom they know nothing about, would say yes to David when he proposed.  ``It was nerve-wracking because, with a small-but-important part, you have to get it right or you can throw the whole thing off-kilter. I got where I had to be when I realized Gillian didn't need this relationship and wasn't coming from a place of need.  ``She had a wonderful life, yet fell in love with this man. She says `Yes' to him with her eyes wide open, knowing full well that to let him down in any way in the future would be almost criminal.  ``It was a wonderful process for me to discover this character.''  Exploring a character is nothing new to the London-born daughter of stage legend Michael Redgrave. She has followed in his footsteps through many stage, film and television roles. But she has endured a hit-and-miss career, compared to her father or even to her controversial sister Vanessa.  Some observers blame Redgrave's career slowdown, at least in part, on residual resentment toward Vanessa, whose pro-Palestinian pronouncements have infuriated many in the industry.  Redgrave agrees, to a point.  ``They think there was one offspring of Michael and Rachel who was sometimes called Lynn and sometimes called Vanessa,'' she says. ``I suppose it's human nature to lump together siblings, even middle-aged siblings who have their own, very different lives and opinions.''  Redgrave turned her Hollywood isolation into her greatest success in the early 1990s. Finding herself spending a lot of time at home in Los Angeles with her family, which includes husband John Clark and their three children, she decided to create a vehicle for herself.  The result was the autobiographical play, ``Shakespeare for My Father.'' It ran for nearly a year on Broadway, and Redgrave has toured with it throughout America and across the globe. She is now performing it in London.  The play was a chance for the actress to work out some of her own longstanding family issues, particularly those involving her famous but often remote father. Every time she takes to the stage in ``Shakespeare,'' Redgrave says, she realizes that, for all the pressure and expectations of being a Redgrave, it's a privilege to come from such a long line of thespians.  ``If you say Redgrave to people who know their theater, it almost spells `Theater,''' she says. ``That's an incredible thing to be a part of.  ``I never set out for the show to be a cathartic experience, but it has been. I only set out to make myself a job, and I never realized how much of it would write itself.  ``It's had an exhilarating effect on me.''  ``Shakespeare'' is due to run in London through mid-December, after which Redgrave will return home. She hopes the already-glowing critical reception for ``Shine'' will help her to more film roles.  ``That would be nice,'' the actress says. ``That would be very nice.  ``You know, my career has been far broader than I ever imagined it would be. I always wanted to play the great roles, not just supporting roles, and I didn't want to be just the funny clown.  ``I've managed that to a large extent,'' she says. ``One can't do everything, or do exactly what they want all the time, but I've played a lot of the great roles I wanted to play.  ``And I go on having a very diverse, satisfying career.'' c.1996 Ian Spelling  (Ian Spelling is a New York-based free-lance writer.)

Includes a 100-word sidebar By SUSAN GOODMAN From Redbook c.1996 Susan Goodman World rights except in Latin America and Singapore (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  Your brain may be your most important sexual organ, but there's no getting around the fact that lovemaking gets better when the rest of your body is in shape. This isn't about looking like a centerfold; it's about intensifying your arousal and pleasure.  Recent studies show that working out can increase your libido, and specific exercises can strengthen and tone those muscles that seem to exist only during sex.  Here are seven steps you can take to get (and stay) sexually fit:  1. Pump it up.  Your heart, that is. A regular aerobic activity, such as cycling, swimming, jogging or stepping on a StairMaster can do wonders for your sex life. These exercises improve cardiovascular endurance, which translates into more staying power in the bedroom.  Aerobic exercise also improves circulation.  ``If you're fit, when you make love blood will flow to the most active muscles _ the arms, legs and genitals _ without compromising other systems,'' explains Rudy Dressendorfer, visiting professor of physical education and sports studies at the University of Alberta.  As a result, your brain still gets plenty of blood, which allows for better distribution of sexual hormones. Increased blood supply also enhances vaginal lubrication.  Aerobic activity may also help put you in the mood for sex. Dr. Linda De Villers, a sex therapist in Santa Monica, Calif., studied more than 8,000 women 18 to 45 years old and found that after beginning a regular exercise program, 40 percent reported increased arousal and 31 percent had sex more often.  The reason: Working out can cause the body to release testosterone, a hormone that increases the sex drive of both men and women, and mood-elevating endorphins. Exercise also increases activity in the left side of the brain, which produces a euphoric effect.  ``This lasts about two hours,'' De Villers says.  2. Strengthen your thighs.  Have you ever tried a new sexual position, only to find that while you are enthusiastic, your thighs are screaming, ``How long do you expect us to keep this up?'' If so, you know how vital it is to have strong muscles.  Aerobic exercises and weight lifting can strengthen these muscles, and yoga can keep them flexible. Lunges help too: Stand between two chairs, clasping your hands firmly on the top of each chair back for support. Lunge back with one leg, then stand up and repeat with the other leg. Start with one set of eight, building up to three sets of 12.  3. Give power to the pelvis  Not only can pelvic strength, like strength in your thighs, allow you to stay with a position longer, but a healthy set of muscles with good circulation is more responsive to pleasure.  The psoas muscle, which rocks the pelvis forward and back and side to side, can be strengthened with yoga.  Kosha Pati, a yoga teacher at Sky Dancing Institute in Mill Valley, Calif., recommends this exercise: Stand with your knees slightly bent. Inhale while gently rocking the pelvis back. Exhale and return to the original position, letting the movement become a smooth, undulating motion. Your weight should remain evenly balanced on your feet.  The abdominal muscles are also crucial to great sex. They help you stay in partially sitting positions without arm support and help keep the lower back strong.  Modified leg lifts help. So do stomach crunches: Lie on your back, knees bent, feet flat on floor and hip width apart. Lifting your head, neck and shoulders, with chin tucked on chest, slowly curl toward your navel. Hold for several seconds, then lower slowly. Repeat, working up to 20 repetitions.  4. Do your Kegels.  If you've had a baby, you've no doubt been told to do Kegel exercises, which strengthen the pubococcygeus (PC) muscles that form the pelvic floor between the legs. Toning these muscles, which contract during orgasm, helps many women climax more easily; yet many of us skip this exercise or do it wrong.  The correct way: Tighten your muscles as if to stop the flow of urine, and hold for three seconds. Relax for three seconds, then repeat, building up your repetitions to 30.  According to Dr. Cynthia Mervis Watson, co-author of ``Love Potions: A Doctor's Guide to Aphrodisia'' (Putnam, 1993), the exercise should be done with legs slightly apart rather than with thighs clamped together. You will find that you are drawing upward with your pelvis. If you find the exercise tiring, it may be that you're also tensing your buttocks and abdomen; try to isolate only your PC muscles.  5. Stretch Yourself.  It's not enough to be strong. You also want to be limber because, let's face it, leg cramps aren't sexy.  Flexibility helps you stay in positions that feel good and move into new ones you've never tried before.  ``Flexibility definitely enhances creative sexual expression,'' says Joanne Rowley, a registered nurse, yoga teacher and psychotherapist in Boston. ``Ease of movement lets you be more spontaneous with your partner.''  The stretches taught in yoga classes create a good base for flexibility.  ``Imagine the positions you want to get in for lovemaking and do them as stretches,'' suggests Joni Yecalsik, a yoga teacher in New York City.  ``Hold the pose, breathing deeply and stretching just a little more with each exhale.''  6. Learn to Relax  There are times in lovemaking when you want your fit, limber muscles to simply go slack and submit to ecstasy. Relaxation is a skill you can learn _ and one worth developing.  ``Relaxation helps you enjoy being touched and lets you be more physically and emotionally responsive,'' says Dr. Judy Seifer, a West Virginia sex therapist and president of the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors and Therapists.  For strength and stamina you can't beat aerobic exercise. For relaxation, the mind plays a key role.  ``During conventional orgasms, muscles get so charged and tense they need release, and the experience is over,'' Pati says. Yoga can allow you to be relaxed in high states of arousal, which allows you to prolong pleasure.  Pati recommends this simple exercise: Stand and shake out your body for 10 minutes, part by part, to let out tension.  ``Give yourself up to this `shivering,''' he says. ``Make sure to breathe deeply; feel free to make sounds. These movements help get energy flowing throughout the entire body.''  7. Go for It.  Sex, like any physical activity, is a use-it-or-lose-it proposition.  ``To maintain sexual health, you've got to keep the pilot light burning,'' says Dr. Theresa Crenshaw, author of ``The Alchemy of Love and Lust'' (Putnam, 1996). ``That means sexual thoughts followed by sexual activity _ with or without orgasm, with or without a partner _ anywhere from every other day to once a week. Continuity is important; otherwise your hormone levels change and your mood right along with them.''  Kids, career and grocery shopping may crowd your schedule, but lovemaking should be penciled in to your calendar with an indelible marker. Some women do this by hiding the remote control as soon as their kids are asleep; others set their clocks for 6 a.m., so they can start the day smiling.  After all, the whole point of sexual fitness is to reap the erotic rewards. -0- SIDEBAR: AN ORGASM A DAY ...  Just as physical fitness is g your sex life, sex is a terrific tonic for your health. Lovemaking can:  _ Relieve pain. Studies show sex can combat headaches and temporarily ease PMS.  _ Fight heart disease. Regular lovemaking increases a woman's estrogen level, which helps combat atherosclerosis, maintains bone density and keeps the skin and vaginal tissues supple and lubricated.  _ Boost immunity. Sex can increase the number of antibodies in your bloodstream and reduce unhealthy stress.  _ Burn calories. Okay, so it's not the world's best workout, but it sure is the most entertaining way to burn 100 to 250 calories an hour.

By WILLIAM STEPHEN CROSS c.1996 William Stephen Cross (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  It's 12:30 a.m. on a Friday, an hour when most normal adults are winding down with Letterman or finishing off a nightcap before heading home. I'm asking myself what a 45-year-old family man with a postgraduate degree is doing on the ice with 30 other men and women dressed up in plastic armor and carrying wooden, laminate and aluminum sticks?  Why, waiting for the referee to drop the puck. It hits the ice and it's skate 'til you drop _ two hours of fast-paced rushes, stick-handling and the occasional goal.  Not the fastest one on the ice, I try parking myself beside our opponent's net. Sure enough, a loose puck slides along the ice to my feet, and without pausing to think about it, I shovel it in. Suddenly I no longer feel the late hour or my sore muscles, I've scored my first goal!  I'm not alone in my jubilation. Adult ice hockey has quietly become the fastest growing sport in North America and Europe, especially in the over-35 age group. NUMBERS ON ICE  The loose, informal organization of most teams and leagues means no one has precise figures, but various estimates put the number of adults in hockey leagues at 250,000 and growing by 15 percent each year. These figures are probably far higher if pick-up games, club hockey and other casual contests could be tracked.  Fans of the professional game, who once thought it was too late for them to play because they never played as kids, have discovered that nothing is more electrifying than watching that little piece of vulcanized rubber stretch the twine at the back of the net.  Operators of skating arenas report that the recent boom in construction of ice rinks simply can't keep pace with the demand at the adult and child level. Teams often happen when a group of friends get together and rent some ice time, or get assembled at arenas into ``house leagues'' with seasons and play-offs.  There's even an international league, Hockey North America (HNA) with over 10,000 members of both genders in over 25 cities. HNA also has a sister league in Holland called Ice Hockey Europe, and the sport is flourishing in Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland and even northern Italy.  Adult hockey players come from all walks of life. A stockbroker, who identifies himself as ``Andrew'' (lest his boss discover he's spending a long lunch hour playing hockey), admitted to keeping a beeper wrapped in a towel on the bench.  ``I have sell orders on file at the office from all my clients,'' he says, ``so I can protect them in case the market goes into a tailspin while I'm on the ice.''  While it's true that far more men than women play, many teams have at least one female player. And while women are not normally considered physically aggressive, this reporter was dumped quite rudely in front of the net during a game by a female forward. As the referee skated up ice with the play, she deftly pulled my skates out from under me. GETTING STARTED  Anyone interested in playing for the first time will progress faster if they can already skate, but it's certainly not a requirement.  Hockey North America, for example, has a beginner course designed for people who have never gotten any closer to a game than their TV set. It starts with the fundamentals, then moves on to a 10-game season complete with playoffs.  After that, better players and teams can choose from three levels of play. House leagues often accept all comers, rarely making any effort to assign players based on ability.  Season costs average around $400, but vary by location, usually according to the price for ice-rink rental. Regions with fewer rinks tend to be higher than those with more venues.  Playing hockey calls for short bursts of intense activity, followed by periods spent on the bench. Those starting out should get into shape first. In-line skating or bicycling (both the stationary and the outdoor variety) help improve conditioning in the critical leg muscles and heart. It's also a good idea to have a complete check-up with your family physician before entering into any strenuous exercise regimen. REALITY CHECK  While professional hockey has a decided image problem because of fighting, most adult leagues discourage or even ban fisticuffs outright, as well as body checking, the process of separating the puck from the player by ramming him into the side boards.  This doesn't mean there isn't contact, especially among beginner players still mastering the art of stopping. But players who lose their tempers get tossed out of games, and persistent offenders usually get banned.  Perhaps in emulation of their National Hockey League heroes, some players occasionally end up in shoving matches or exchanges of verbal unpleasantries. When the puck's up for grabs around the goal, pileups are common, causing outbursts of temper and frustration. But most players will agree that having to explain a black eye from a hockey fight to a spouse or boss is a rarity.  Like many other players, my own shiny new hockey career began after watching how much fun my 7-year-old son had on the ice. I signed up for an adult instruction course at a local rink, then played pickup games until I felt I was ready. After that, a phone call to a league and an exchange of money got me assigned to the Gamblers.  My initial excitement at ``making the team'' was tempered a bit, though, when I found out they'd gone 0-32 over the past three seasons. But in the dressing room at our first game, all the players were friendly and enthusiastic _ a mood that slipped noticeably after the team absorbed an 11-1 thrashing.  The Gamblers' record of flawless imperfection continued through the next five games. But my goal was never winning a championship, it was to play the game I've always loved watching.  Whatever happens now, I've won a victory of sorts, a victory over aging, my inhibitions and self-doubts. Can Wayne Gretzky claim that? SIDEBAR: THE PUCK STOPS HERE  Getting started:  Almost every rink now has adult ice hockey programs; check the yellow pages for the nearest ice skating rink. The largest single league is Hockey North America. For information, call 800-4-HOCKEY.  Cost: A 20-game season (90 minutes per game) with double elimination playoffs costs around $400, depending on your location (ice time costs vary by region).  What you need: Most programs require (in addition to hockey skates) a regulation helmet, gloves, elbow and shoulder pads, pants and shin guards. Men will want to include an athletic supporter with a cup.  Depending on the brand and quality of the equipment, expect to spend at least $400 to $500 for a complete set; this figure does not include skates ($100-$350) or sticks ($18 for an inexpensive wooden one up to $100 for a graphite model with replaceable blade).  Some stores now feature used equipment, and many rinks have bulletin boards offering equipment for sale. Goalie equipment is much more expensive (pads can run as much as $1,500 new), and is best purchased used.  Visors or full face shields are highly recommended. Don't skimp on your equipment _ even with no checking allowed, collisions and spills demand solid protection.

Once-a-day supplements such as vitamins C and E and beta-carotene aren't the only things flying off the shelves these days. Health-minded shoppers are filling their baskets with more esoteric _ but no less potent _ over-the-counter mind, body and even sex-life rechargers such as melatonin and glutathione.  What's more, many are finding doctors who will write prescriptions for still more powerful _ and controversial _ elixirs.  How come? Quite simply, if you don't replenish these hormones, proteins, antioxidants and other vital substances that start to dwindle as early as age 30, you lose them.  The good news: Your body's crucial chemicals can be restored _ often with simple and safe tactics such as exercise, diet and dietary supplements. Hard-core longevity seekers can ask their doctors about hormone replacement or prescription drugs.  What follows is a guide to today's hot rejuvenation supplements.  A word of caution: Don't start any restorative therapy program without first discussing it with your doctor. Acetylcholine: The Memory Pill  As acetylcholine (ACh) runs low, mental function may take a hit, especially memory. Choline or lecithin supplements can help boost ACh levels.  In a recent study at Florida International University, people over 50 who took 13.5 grams of lecithin a day for five weeks went from 35 memory lapses a week to 19. Cardiolipin: The Brain Booster  Cardiolipin protects mitochondria _ the tiny ``energy plants'' for every cell in the body. Many experts think mitochondrial slowdown underlies every aspect of aging _ so cardiolipin may be a key to aging itself.  A cardiolipin replenisher may be on the way: Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR), now being tested by Sigma Tau, Inc., for treating Alzheimer's disease, boosts cardiolipin in old rats.  ALCAR is available in Europe, where it's widely prescribed not only for Alzheimer's but to slow normal brain aging. DHEA: All-Purpose Youth Tonic  Dubbed the ``mother of all hormones'' (its offspring include the sex hormones estrogen and androgens), DHEA may also buffer the effects of stress hormones and prevent age-related diseases.  ``DHEA levels are a fairly significant predictor of longevity,'' says Stanford University biologist Robert Sapolsky  Low DHEA has been linked to a number of diseases, including breast cancer, obesity, high cholesterol, hypertension and heart disease. Even under normal circumstances, DHEA levels decline by as much as 75 percent between early adulthood and old age.  In animals, DHEA replacement works wonders, fighting obesity, protecting against diabetes, sharpening memory and warding off infectious diseases. But in humans DHEA supplementation is controversial. Though it's long been used in Europe as an anti-obesity and anti-aging drug, some scientists warn high doses may lead to liver damage and excessive testosterone levels.  On the plus side, when Dr. Samuel S.C. Yen and his colleagues at the University of California School of Medicine in La Jolla gave 50 milligrams of DHEA daily for six months to 13 men and 17 women ages 40 to 70, they reported ``a remarkable increase'' in physical and psychological well-being, deeper sleep and an improved ability to handle stress.  DHEA is very potent and should not be taken without consulting your doctor. Dopamine: Smart Medicine  It's long been known that Parkinson's disease patients have extra-low levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Now studies suggest low dopamine may be part of normal aging, especially in men, and may play a role in memory loss.  Prescription dopamine boosters such as levo-dopa, bromocriptine and selegeline (Deprenyl) are used to treat Parkinson's. Can they also help the healthy?  A 1992 study by Dr. Richard A. Depue and his colleagues at the University of Minnesota Medical School showed that eight 20- to 35-year-old women who took 2.5 milligram doses of bromocriptine scored an average of 44 percent higher on spatial memory tests than women who took only a placebo. Estrogen: The Sexy Mood Lifter  The ``female hormone'' helps regulate reproduction functions in both sexes and is essential for growth and bone development. It may also be involved in mood (low levels are linked to PMS and postnatal depression), memory and even strength, balance and coordination.  The debate over estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) is fierce. On the plus side, estrogen can lower cardiac risk by boosting ``good'' HDL cholesterol and lowering ``bad'' LDL. Estrogen replacement also helps maintain bone mass and lowers fracture risk in women with osteoporosis. It fights menopause symptoms such as ``hot flashes.''  The downside is ERT may raise breast cancer risk. But studies have been conflicting on this. Glutathione: Nature's Health Insurance  Not as hyped as vitamins C and E and beta-carotene, glutathione is a heavyweight antioxidant. It's also a major natural detoxifier, neutralizing environmental poisons and carcinogens.  Some experts hold that glutathione levels decline as we age. People with age-related diseases such as heart disease, arthritis and Type II diabetes have lower levels of glutathione than healthy people.  According to one study, ``elderly people with high blood glutathione levels are physically, psychologically and sociologically healthier.''  Glutathione is sold in health-food stores, but you can also get it in foods such as fresh, unprocessed pork; veal; chicken and even ground beef. Fresh whole fruit and vegetables (not juices) are also high in glutathione, especially citrus fruits, melons and raw carrots. GH: The Hardbody Hormone  The potent human growth hormone (GH) is one of the most controversial anti-agers. In children and adolescents, the hormone is essential for growth and physical development. In adults it affects how lean or flabby we are, and may boost the immune system.  GH declines start in young adulthood and accelerate with age. Some adults _ especially ones with more sedentary lifestyles _ may produce no GH at all. GH enthusiasts link its decline to the shrinking muscles and loss of strength that often accompany aging.  In early studies, GH seemed to be an awesome anti-aging supplement _ older people who took it lost fat, gained muscle and had improved skin tone.  But recent trials raise doubts: The benefits of GH seem modest and brief, with such side effects as water retention and insulin resistance.  On the other hand, a 1991 study at the University of Innsbruck Medical School in Austria reported that GH had simulated immune system cells that fight off bacterial infections.  You can boost GH levels naturally with vigorous exercise such as weight training. As a drug, GH is approved by the FDA only for the treatment of unusually short children. Take this drug only after consulting a doctor. Melatonin: Miracle Body Mender  Rapidly emerging as a major anti-ager, melatonin is a powerful antioxidant and a regulator of the body's clock, causing sleepiness in response to darkness. It also primes the immune system to fight infectious diseases and perhaps even cancer.  Some scientists say that as we age, free radicals cripple melatonin-making cells in the pineal gland. People over 65 have only one-fourth the melatonin levels of 25 year olds. The results: declining immune function, sleep disturbances and possibly increased vulnerability to cancer.  Melatonin supplements are sold in health-food stores. Myofibrillar Proteins: Prime Muscle Builders  Without this family of proteins, we'd be immobile. They underlie the muscle connections that drive all movement.  Dr. Stephen Welle of the University of Rochester found that production of myofibrillar protein in men over 62 was up to 44 percent slower than in men ages 21 to 31. This may explain the loss of muscle size and strength associated with aging.  The key to boosting muscle proteins is exercise, specifically weight training. Testosterone: The Sex-Drive Stimulant  The ``male hormone'' (a misnomer: Women produce it too) is crucial to growth, sexual maturation and perhaps maintenance of sex drive in later years.  Experts think that testosterone declines in one-third of men over 55 _ perhaps contributing to the loss of strength, sagging sexual desire and depression.  In the last five years studies have shown that in men over 54, testosterone replacement can boost lean body mass, strength and sex drive.  Although once testosterone was believed to hasten heart disease, more research shows it actually increases HDL, reducing heart risk. Thymosins: Immunity Boosters  Helping regulate and stimulate the immune system, these hormones also spur the production of neurotransmitters and sex hormones.  The thymus gland, which makes thymosins, shrinks from walnut- size in youth to pea-size in mature adulthood. By old age the gland has virtually disappeared, producing no thymosins.  Thymosins are routinely prescribed in Europe to treat cancer and diabetes. In the United States, alpha-thymosin is FDA-approved for the treatment of hepatitis B.  But you may not have to take thymosins to restore their activity: At least one study has shown that supplements of 400 milligrams of zinc sulfate per day can produce the same results.

Includes a 200-word sidebar By STACEY COLINO From Child magazine c.1996 Stacey Colino (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  Each year in the United States an estimated 16 million children require treatment at emergency rooms, and of the 600,000 that are hospitalized, an astounding 23,000 die because of injuries.  But the majority of these injuries could be prevented, according to pediatric health-care providers.  Here are some lifesaving lessons from ER doctors and emergency medical service (EMS) workers to help you prepare for unexpected emergencies.  Lesson 1: Don't put off taking CPR.  Learning to perform pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation can save your child's life if he stops breathing. Courses are offered (usually with basic first aid techniques) at local hospitals and Red Cross centers, and through the American Heart Association.  Lesson 2: Always put your child in a safety seat or a seat belt.  Car crashes are the No. 1 cause of death and disability among children.  Car seats and seat belts could have prevented many of those injuries. Yet often parents who strap themselves in make the mistake of holding a child in their laps, believing that if there is an accident, they'll be able to hold onto the child.  ``That's impossible even at low speeds of 20 or 30 miles per hour,'' says Dr. John P. Santamaria, attending physician at the Pediatric Emergency Center at St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa, Fla.  For small infants or low-birthweight babies, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in Chicago recommends strapping infants in an infant car seat that faces the rear of the car. A convertible seat that faces forward should be used for children who weigh more than 20 pounds or are a year old.  A booster seat that properly positions the seat belt is best for kids who have outgrown convertible seats. Once a child is tall enough to wear a shoulder strap and a lap belt comfortably he's safest in the backseat.  Lesson 3: Remove small objects from a young child's environment.  Take a close look at your child's surroundings from her point of view (by getting down on your hands and knees) to remove any hazards.  If your child swallows an object, observe her symptoms before acting. If she's not breathing because the object is obstructing her airway and she's over a year old, use the Heimlich maneuver and call 911, Santamaria advises.  But if she's under 1, coughing and choking slightly but getting air in, don't touch her _ instead, call an ambulance. Patting her on the back, doing the Heimlich maneuver or upsetting her can create a total obstruction of the airway, so it's better to have an emergency medical technician come to your home to treat her.  If your child swallows an object and seems to be none the worse for it, call your pediatrician or local ER for advice. Some objects, such as button batteries, can pose a problem because of their potential to leak, so they need to be removed. Other items may safely make it through your child's digestive tract without intervention.  Lesson 4: Poison-proof your home.  Approximately 32,000 kids under the age of 15 were hospitalized because of poisoning in 1991.  As far as prevention goes, here are the basics:  _ Put child-proof locks on cabinets;  _ use child-proof containers for medications, vitamins and alcohol;  _ keep household chemicals locked up. Always be on the lookout for household hazards, such as peeling paint, that your child could eat. And never put medicines or chemicals in food containers.  If your child ingests a toxin, call your local poison control center before doing anything else. It's smart to keep ipecac syrup in your medicine cabinet, but in some instances, making a child vomit may do more harm than good, so you need to find out what to do first.  There isn't any one telltale sign of poisoning: Symptoms vary with the substance but can include uncommon clumsiness, profuse sweating, paleness, choking, a racing or slowing heartbeat or seizures.  Lesson 5: Supervise children when they're in danger of falling.  Falls account for more than a third of kids' injuries seen in emergency departments. According to Dr. Jean Ogborn, director of the Pediatric Emergency Medical Fellowship Program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore.  Playgrounds are fraught with danger. Choose an area with a surface that has six to 12 inches of soft material, such as rubber matting, sand or mulch, for gentle landings. And check the equipment for excess wear and tear or rust _ which could cause a swing to break apart, for instance.  Lesson 6: Keep your child flat after a serious fall.  If your child falls and ends up with a head injury and appears dazed or unconscious or is bleeding profusely, or if she falls a great distance, such as out of a second-story window, keep her in a flat position and call 911 immediately. Then return to your child.  If she stops breathing or if you're not sure if she's breathing, remove any obvious obstructions from in front of her face, nose or mouth, but don't go fishing into the mouth.  Position her on her back with her head and neck in a straight line and check for breathing by feeling in front of the nose. Then try a rescue breath or two by pinching her nose and breathing into her mouth to see if you can get her chest to rise, Ogburn says.  Lesson 7: Monitor your child after a moderate fall.  With less traumatic falls or head injuries, make sure that your child can comfortably move her arms and legs, and that her pupils aren't dilated (larger than normal). Also watch out for behavioral changes, such as disorientation or persistent crying.  ``It's a fallacy that a child should not be allowed to go to sleep,'' says Dr. Alfred Sacchetti, research director of the department of emergency medicine at Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center in Camden, N.J. But it is important to wake her up every hour or two to see how she's acting.  Over the next few hours, also keep an eye out for these problems: If she vomits more than twice or has a significant headache, call an ambulance or go to the emergency room.  Lesson 9: Insist that your child wear protective gear for sports  More than 2.5 million kids a year visit ERs because of sports injuries. And we're not just talking about football and baseball. The in-line skating craze has spawned an epidemic of wrist, forearm, elbow, knee and ankle injuries. Bike accidents can cause serious head injuries, as well as lacerations and broken bones.  Protective gear is the key to preventing these injuries. And the onus is on parents to make sure the proper pads, guardsand helmets are worn every time your child plays a sport.  Lesson 10: Go to the ER if a laceration is large or deep.  Cuts that are deep and gaping wide open, bleeding profusely for more than 10 minutes or located on a joint, hand or the face need to be treated quickly in order to stop the bleeding, to prevent infection and to speed healing.  Lesson 11: If a burn appears severe, call 911.  An estimated 350,000 kids under the age of 19 are treated for burn injuries in ERs each year.  With third degree burns (the most serious), blisters often form right away and the skin may appear white, charred or hard. Third-degree burns may not be painful because they often damage nerve endings.  With a second-degree burn, the skin is likely to blister but remain pink according to Dr. Bob Schafermeyer, associate chairman for the department of emergency medicine at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, N.C. And if the skin turns red _ like a sunburn _ and your child feels considerable pain, that's probably a first-degree burn.  Any burn that covers the equivalent of three of your child's palms needs medical attention.  How to treat first-degree burns: If something hot has spilled on your child, strip her clothes off immediately. Run the burn under cold water for 10 to 15 minutes or until the pain subsides.  For small burns, apply a topical antibiotic cream, such as Neosporin or Bacitracin, after 15 to 20 minutes. Never put butter on a burn _ this will only hold the heat in. And resist the urge to kiss it, to reduce the risk of infection.  If the burn blisters, have it checked by a doctor.  Lesson 13: Protect kids from large and small bodies of water.  ``Among babies and toddlers, the most common drownings are in bathtubs and buckets of water,'' explains Dr. Richard Cantor, chairman of pediatric emergency medicine for the American College of Emergency Physicians in Washington, D.C. ``A toddler can drown in four inches of water.''  If a toddler reaches into a bucket of water, he could fall in and be unable to right himself.  To prevent such tragedies, never leave a child unattended in a bathtub or on a toilet. Tubs should be drained after use, and toilet covers should be closed and locked until your child is over 5.  To stay safe at the swimming pool, make sure there's at least a 5-foot-high fence with a self-latching lock around the area, and never leave kids unsupervised.  Pre-ER treatment: If, after being submerged in water, your child is breathing hard, has a change in color or is coughing, call 911. If your child is not breathing or if her heart stops, call 911 and initiate CPR. -0- SIDEBAR: ARE YOU PREPARED FOR AN EMERGENCY?  When an accident happens, you don't want to rack your brain for phone numbers or other crucial information. Here's how to gauge if you're well prepared:  _ Do you have the local poison control number, the emergency access number (if it's not 911) and your pediatrician's number posted by the phone?  _ Do you know where the nearest emergency room is _ and the fastest route to get there? Which hospital in your area has the best trauma or pediatric center?  _ Is your child's immunization record up to date and in a place where you can quickly grab it?  _ Do you know which medications your child is allergic to?  _ Does your child wear a Medic Alert bracelet to inform caregivers of medical problems such as diabetes, medication allergies or heart problems?  _ Have you been trained in CPR or basic first aid techniques? If not, contact your local chapter of the American Red Cross or the American Heart Association.  _ Do you have a first aid kit at home? It should contain Ace bandages, antibiotic cream.

Includes a color slide of Glenn Close in a scene from ``101 Dalmatians'' By CINDY PEARLMAN World rights except Chicago (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  First it was bunnies, now it's puppies. Is anyone in the animal kingdom safe from Glenn Close?  Actually, the woman who killed a little girl's pet rabbit in ``Fatal Attraction'' (1987) and goes after two kids' cute puppies in ``101 Dalmatians,'' opening Nov. 27, says that she hates that image.  ``I feel absolutely terrible, like I'm some monster,'' Glenn Close says. ``I completely adore dogs!''  The actress looks nothing like her cartoonish Cruella DeVil character in an interview at New York's Rihga Royal Hotel. Dressed in a black Armani pants suit with boyish, close-cropped blonde hair, she is, in fact, quite charming.  Unless you're a puppy, perhaps. As ``Dalmatians'' co-star Joely Richardson reports, the film's many dogs didn't take to Close.  ``The first time Glenn came onto the set, Perdy (the lead female Dalmatian) took one look at her and went running off,'' Richardson says in a separate interview. ``Perdy either smelled her cats or didn't like the bold colors Glenn was wearing. Finally on the fourth take, she stayed put. She realized Glenn wasn't going to hurt her.''  And in the hotel today, a group of the film's dogs, brought in for photo opportunities, cower when she approaches them, cooing in a friendly tone.  Old memories die hard even in dogs, perhaps. As Cruella, Close is PETA's worst nightmare come to life, a fur-obsessed maniac with a demonic cackle. She loves fur _ coats, pajamas, sheets ... even a live skunk, which serves as her handbag. Throw in the talon-like fingernails and black-and-white costuming that extends even to her hair, and no one is likely to mistake her for Mary Poppins.  ``My own 8-year-old daughter, Annie, was very scared when she saw me dressed up,'' Close says. ``She kept saying, `Mom, Cruella makes me mad. Can't you be Anita?'''  But Close wanted to be the Mean Queen. In fact, reading John Hughes' initial script, she found the character too bland.  ``I didn't think Cruella was evil enough,'' Close says. ``So we went back to the original cartoon and lifted a lot of lines, because she was so deliciously bad.  ``She would say, `Bash those pups in the head! Do you have any chloroform?''' The actress laughs. ``That was right from the cartoon.''  When trying to find the character, Close says, ``I decided that she was the devil. Her food is black. She likes to be hot, which is why she likes fur. Her sheets are ermine _ the hotter the better, which is what hell is like.''  It was hell for the actress, too.  ``I was in deep pain most of the time,'' she says. ``Cruella's shoes were 4-1/2-inch heels,'' she explains, and the costume was heavy and stiflingly hot _ and too intricate to be removed or even loosened between takes. Then there were the stunts, including an immersion, fur coat and all, in a vat of molasses.  All in all, Close says, the shoot was ``a certain form of torture.''  The role is only the latest evolution in a career which started with sweetness-and-light roles in ``The World According to Garp'' (1982), ``The Natural'' (1983) and ``The Big Chill'' (1984), only to veer into villainy with ``Fatal Attraction,'' ``Dangerous Liaisons'' (1988) and, most recently, a smash Broadway run as the demonic Norma Desmond in ``Sunset Boulevard'' (1995).  ``Cruella,'' Close says, ``is like the cherry on the cake of evil.''  She even takes her bad rep home with her. Mounted in Close's kitchen is the huge knife she wielded in ``Fatal Attraction.''  ``It's only the cardboard knife,'' she hastens to add. ``In the close-ups, when I'm near Michael Douglas' face, they wouldn't allow me to have a real knife.  ``People always come in and say, `Is this what I think it is?'''  The actress laughs. ``I go, `Yeah!' From the start, they know not to mess with me.''  Despite her legendary status _ back in 1987, the National Enquirer tagged her, ``The Most Hated Woman in America'' _ Close isn't the grand dame that one might expect.  ``I expected her to be more of the diva, but she surprised me,'' Richardson says. ``She's very quiet. Frankly, at the end of this shoot I still wasn't sure what Glenn Close was really like.''  Close guards her privacy ... well, closely. She rarely speaks about growing up on a 500-acre Connecticut spread, or her years spent at a boarding school in Switzerland while her father practiced medicine in Zaire.  She won't even discuss her five-year singing stint with the ever-so-cheerful touring company, Up With People.  ``I don't like talking about it,'' she says simply.  Instead, she focuses herself on her work.  ``I always thought acting was a terrific way of expressing myself,'' she says. ``You see, I was painfully shy as a child. But strangely enough, a stage is where I can get out of myself.''  Two Tony Awards, three Emmy nominations and five Oscar nominations into her career, the actress lives quietly in Connecticut with her daughter Annie. Close is currently engaged to Steve Beers, after previous marriages to musician Cabot Wade and venture capitalist James Marlas. Annie's father is producer John Starcke.  Close met Beers while she was performing in ``Sunset Boulevard,'' on which he worked as a production carpenter.  ``I hadn't had a man in my life for three years,'' she recalls with a blush. ``I didn't have anyone to go to (the customary) opening-night (party) with, which is pretty pathetic.  ``I heard Steve was a great guy, so I got up the courage to say, `Can I ask you something?' He said, `Sure' _ and then some big crisis happened on the stage.''  By the time Beers returned from that crisis, Close was in full Norma get-up, and feeling not at all attractive.  ``It was this white Kabuki makeup,'' she recalls. ``He came up and said, `Is now a good time for your question?'  ``My heart sunk. But I still said, `I was wondering, um, if, ah, you would consider going out to dinner sometime.'  ``He paused and looked at me and said, `In a heartbeat,''' she says. ``It was the greatest.''  Of course, Close has heard the talk about the movie star dating a carpenter, but she disregards it.  ``It's not about someone's job. It's about their aura,'' she says.  If her career arc has taken her from goodie-goodies to villains, the next steps will take her to the White House, as she plays first ladies in two upcoming films.  In Tim Burton's ``Mars Attacks,'' her president/husband is Jack Nicholson, while in 1997's ``Air Force One'' she will play opposite Harrison Ford.  ``Something happens on Air Force One and as the First Lady I might have to declare myself president,'' Close says. ``I might be the first woman in charge.''  In her own life, however, Close is clearly already in charge, and her family is her first priority.  ``It's harder and harder for me to leave home,'' she says. ``The memory of childhood is something that's totally in my mind. It will be in my daughter's mind forever, and I want to be a big part of it.''  And incidentally, that house in Connecticut does in fact include two cats, three mice, a tank full of fish, a pony and a horse. No rabbits, but there are three dogs.  So she isn't really Cruella DeVil. Does she even wear fur?  ``I do have a coat that has a fur lining,'' she admits. ``Once I had a fur coat, but I didn't feel comfortable in it. You see, I really do love animals.''  If only those puppies would believe her. c.1996 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Lynn Redgrave and Geoffrey Rush in a scene from ``Shine.'' By IAN SPELLING (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  What do you call a movie star who doesn't make movies?  Call her offbeat. Call her different. Call her Lynn Redgrave.  She's been a star since she lit up ``Georgy Girl'' (1966), validating the heritage of a name which she shares with two other movie stars, the late Sir Michael Redgrave, her father, and her sister, Vanessa Redgrave.  Since then, however, she's been seen more on stage than on screen. But it's clear that she's missed the movies from the excitement with which she raves about her new film, ``Shine.''  ``I am excited,'' she says with gusto. ``This is a small film that everyone seems to know about, seems to want to see and experience.  ``The only other time a film's reception came so out of the blue was 30 years ago, when I did `Georgy Girl' (1966). Lots of exciting things have happened for me on the stage, but this is an absolute rarity in terms of my films.''  Actually, R doing a film at all is an absolute rarity. ``Shine,'' opening around the country throughout December, is her first in six years.  ``That was not for a lack of wanting, but a lack of being offered anything,'' she says with a laugh that drips sarcasm. ``It was a situation aided and abetted by my longstanding disagreement with Universal Pictures.  ``What major studio wants to hire somebody who's quite loudly and publicly decrying studio behavior?''  The actress' battle with Universal dated from 1981, when she was fired from the TV series ``House Calls.'' The studio blamed it on financial conflicts, while Redgrave said it was because she had insisted on breast-feeding her baby on the set.  Fortunately for Redgrave, ``Shine'' is an independent film and director Scott Hicks, wasn't familiar with Redgrave's studio battles. The Australian director's interest was sparked by his seeing her one-woman show, ``Shakespeare for My Father,'' on tour in Houston.  In one scene, Redgrave wore an Australian cattleman's hat and coat _ and, she relates, something clicked in Hicks.  ``My play is about my search for my relationship with my dad,'' she says, ``and in a sense `Shine' is about a man's relationship with his father.  ``There were all these coincidences and parallels that made Scott think of me for this small but wonderful role in `Shine.'''  Covering a three-decade period from the 1950s to the 1980s, ``Shine'' is set in Australia and tells the real-life story of David Helfgott, a respected classical pianist. Helfgott grew up with a demanding father (Armin Mueller-Stahl) who instilled in his son an appreciation of music _ and then smothered him in it and his overbearing love and jealousy.  By his early 20s, Helfgott cracked and withdrew into his own private world. A decade later, the pianist emerged from a mental institution to win self-assurance, love and public recognition of his prodigious talents.  Redgrave, 53, plays Gillian, the vibrant Australian astrologer who impulsively marries Helfgott (Geoffrey Rush). Gillian's every moment on time energizes ``Shine,'' but Redgrave explains that the character didn't come easily.  She had conversed by telephone with the real Gillian, but met her only late in the shooting process. Until then, she struggled to conceive of the character in acting terms.  ``David and the other characters leaped off the page, but because there was so little of Gillian, it was hard at first to make it work,'' she recalls. ``I'd played real characters before. I saw pictures and videos of Gillian, read articles about her and David, but I was having a tough time of it.  ``I wanted to look and sound like the real Gillian, to replicate her distinctive style. Scott saw what was happening and told me to create my own Gillian and not a carbon copy.  ``I found that frustrating at first,'' she adds, ``because he had an actress whose stock-in-trade is submerging herself in a role and converting herself into someone else. He said, `Give me the essence of Gillian.'''  When Redgrave saw the finished film, she finally understood Hicks' point.  ``The movie is about David, and the audience is in his mind,'' she says. ``The essence Scott kept talking about had to come in at the movie's end and convince the audience that Gillian, whom they know nothing about, would say yes to David when he proposed.  ``It was nerve-wracking because, with a small-but-important part, you have to get it right or you can throw the whole thing off-kilter. I got where I had to be when I realized Gillian didn't need this relationship and wasn't coming from a place of need.  ``She had a wonderful life, yet fell in love with this man. She says `Yes' to him with her eyes wide open, knowing full well that to let him down in any way in the future would be almost criminal.  ``It was a wonderful process for me to discover this character.''  Exploring a character is nothing new to the London-born daughter of stage legend Michael Redgrave. She has followed in his footsteps through many stage, film and television roles. But she has endured a hit-and-miss career, compared to her father or even to her controversial sister Vanessa.  Some observers blame Redgrave's career slowdown, at least in part, on residual resentment toward Vanessa, whose pro-Palestinian pronouncements have infuriated many in the industry.  Redgrave agrees, to a point.  ``They think there was one offspring of Michael and Rachel who was sometimes called Lynn and sometimes called Vanessa,'' she says. ``I suppose it's human nature to lump together siblings, even middle-aged siblings who have their own, very different lives and opinions.''  Redgrave turned her Hollywood isolation into her greatest success in the early 1990s. Finding herself spending a lot of time at home in Los Angeles with her family, which includes husband John Clark and their three children, she decided to create a vehicle for herself.  The result was the autobiographical play, ``Shakespeare for My Father.'' It ran for nearly a year on Broadway, and Redgrave has toured with it throughout America and across the globe. She is now performing it in London.  The play was a chance for the actress to work out some of her own longstanding family issues, particularly those involving her famous but often remote father. Every time she takes to the stage in ``Shakespeare,'' Redgrave says, she realizes that, for all the pressure and expectations of being a Redgrave, it's a privilege to come from such a long line of thespians.  ``If you say Redgrave to people who know their theater, it almost spells `Theater,''' she says. ``That's an incredible thing to be a part of.  ``I never set out for the show to be a cathartic experience, but it has been. I only set out to make myself a job, and I never realized how much of it would write itself.  ``It's had an exhilarating effect on me.''  ``Shakespeare'' is due to run in London through mid-December, after which Redgrave will return home. She hopes the already-glowing critical reception for ``Shine'' will help her to more film roles.  ``That would be nice,'' the actress says. ``That would be very nice.  ``You know, my career has been far broader than I ever imagined it would be. I always wanted to play the great roles, not just supporting roles, and I didn't want to be just the funny clown.  ``I've managed that to a large extent,'' she says. ``One can't do everything, or do exactly what they want all the time, but I've played a lot of the great roles I wanted to play.  ``And I go on having a very diverse, satisfying career.'' c.1996 Ian Spelling  (Ian Spelling is a New York-based free-lance writer.)

Includes a 100-word sidebar By SUSAN GOODMAN From Redbook c.1996 Susan Goodman World rights except in Latin America and Singapore (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  Your brain may be your most important sexual organ, but there's no getting around the fact that lovemaking gets better when the rest of your body is in shape. This isn't about looking like a centerfold; it's about intensifying your arousal and pleasure.  Recent studies show that working out can increase your libido, and specific exercises can strengthen and tone those muscles that seem to exist only during sex.  Here are seven steps you can take to get (and stay) sexually fit:  1. Pump it up.  Your heart, that is. A regular aerobic activity, such as cycling, swimming, jogging or stepping on a StairMaster can do wonders for your sex life. These exercises improvecardiovascular endurance, which translates into more staying power in the bedroom.  Aerobic exercise also improves circulation.  ``If you're fit, when you make love blood will flow to the most active muscles _ the arms, legs and genitals _ without compromising other systems,'' explains Rudy Dressendorfer, visiting professor of physical education and sports studies at the University of Alberta.  As a result, your brain still gets plenty of blood, which allows for better distribution of sexual hormones. Increased blood supply also enhances vaginal lubrication.  Aerobic activity may also help put you in the mood for sex. Dr. Linda De Villers, a sex therapist in Santa Monica, Calif., studied more than 8,000 women 18 to 45 years old and found that after beginning a regular exercise program, 40 percent reported increased arousal and 31 percent had sex more often.  The reason: Working out can cause the body to release testosterone, a hormone that increases the sex drive of both men and women, and mood-elevating endorphins. Exercise also increases activity in the left side of the brain, which produces a euphoric effect.  ``This lasts about two hours,'' De Villers says.  2. Strengthen your thighs.  Have you ever tried a new sexual position, only to find that while you are enthusiastic, your thighs are screaming, ``How long do you expect us to keep this up?'' If so, you know how vital it is to have strong muscles.  Aerobic exercises and weight lifting can strengthen these muscles, and yoga can keep them flexible. Lunges help too: Stand between two chairs, clasping your hands firmly on the top of each chair back for support. Lunge back with one leg, then stand up and repeat with the other leg. Start with one set of eight, building up to three sets of 12.  3. Give power to the pelvis  Not only can pelvic strength, like strength in your thighs, allow you to stay with a position longer, but a healthy set of muscles with good circulation is more responsive to pleasure.  The psoas muscle, which rocks the pelvis forward and back and side to side, can be strengthened with yoga.  Kosha Pati, a yoga teacher at Sky Dancing Institute in Mill Valley, Calif., recommends this exercise: Stand with your knees slightly bent. Inhale while gently rocking the pelvis back. Exhale and return to the original position, letting the movement become a smooth, undulating motion. Your weight should remain evenly balanced on your feet.  The abdominal muscles are also crucial to great sex. They help you stay in partially sitting positions without arm support and help keep the lower back strong.  Modified leg lifts help. So do stomach crunches: Lie on your back, knees bent, feet flat on floor and hip width apart. Lifting your head, neck and shoulders, with chin tucked on chest, slowly curl toward your navel. Hold for several seconds, then lower slowly. Repeat, working up to 20 repetitions.  4. Do your Kegels.  If you've had a baby, you've no doubt been told to do Kegel exercises, which strengthen the pubococcygeus (PC) muscles that form the pelvic floor between the legs. Toning these muscles, which contract during orgasm, helps many women climax more easily; yet many of us skip this exercise or do it wrong.  The correct way: Tighten your muscles as if to stop the flow of urine, and hold for three seconds. Relax for three seconds, then repeat, building up your repetitions to 30.  According to Dr. Cynthia Mervis Watson, co-author of ``Love Potions: A Doctor's Guide to Aphrodisia'' (Putnam, 1993), the exercise should be done with legs slightly apart rather than with thighs clamped together. You will find that you are drawing upward with your pelvis. If you find the exercise tiring, it may be that you're also tensing your buttocks and abdomen; try to isolate only your PC muscles.  5. Stretch Yourself.  It's not enough to be strong. You also want to be limber because, let's face it, leg cramps aren't sexy.  Flexibility helps you stay in positions that feel good and move into new ones you've never tried before.  ``Flexibility definitely enhances creative sexual expression,'' says Joanne Rowley, a registered nurse, yoga teacher and psychotherapist in Boston. ``Ease of movement lets you be more spontaneous with your partner.''  The stretches taught in yoga classes create a good base for flexibility.  ``Imagine the positions you want to get in for lovemaking and do them as stretches,'' suggests Joni Yecalsik, a yoga teacher in New York City.  ``Hold the pose, breathing deeply and stretching just a little more with each exhale.''  6. Learn to Relax  There are times in lovemaking when you want your fit, limber muscles to simply go slack and submit to ecstasy. Relaxation is a skill you can learn _ and one worth developing.  ``Relaxation helps you enjoy being touched and lets you be more physically and emotionally responsive,'' says Dr. Judy Seifer, a West Virginia sex therapist and president of the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors and Therapists.  For strength and stamina you can't beat aerobic exercise. For relaxation, the mind plays a key role.  ``During conventional orgasms, muscles get so charged and tense they need release, and the experience is over,'' Pati says. Yoga can allow you to be relaxed in high states of arousal, which allows you to prolong pleasure.  Pati recommends this simple exercise: Stand and shake out your body for 10 minutes, part by part, to let out tension.  ``Give yourself up to this `shivering,''' he says. ``Make sure to breathe deeply; feel free to make sounds. These movements help get energy flowing throughout the entire body.''  7. Go for It.  Sex, like any physical activity, is a use-it-or-lose-it proposition.  ``To maintain sexual health, you've got to keep the pilot light burning,'' says Dr. Theresa Crenshaw, author of ``The Alchemy of Love and Lust'' (Putnam, 1996). ``That means sexual thoughts followed by sexual activity _ with or without orgasm, with or without a partner _ anywhere from every other day to once a week. Continuity is important; otherwise your hormone levels change and your mood right along with them.''  Kids, career and grocery shopping may crowd your schedule, but lovemaking should be penciled in to your calendar with an indelible marker. Some women do this by hiding the remote control as soon as their kids are asleep; others set their clocks for 6 a.m., so they can start the day smiling.  After all, the whole point of sexual fitness is to reap the erotic rewards. -0- SIDEBAR: AN ORGASM A DAY ...  Just as physical fitness is good for your sex life, sex is a terrific tonic for your health. Lovemaking can:  _ Relieve pain. Studi sex can combat headaches and temporarily ease PMS.  _ Fight heart disease. Regular lovemaking increases a woman's estrogen level, which helps combat atherosclerosis, maintains bone density and keeps the skin and vaginal tissues supple and lubricated.  _ Boost immunity. Sex can increase the number of antibodies in your bloodstream and reduce unhealthy stress.  _ Burn calories. Okay, so it's not the world's best workout, but it sure is the most entertaining way to burn 100 to 250 calories an hour.

By WILLIAM STEPHEN CROSS c.1996 William Stephen Cross (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  It's 12:30 a.m. on a Friday, an hour when most normal adults are winding down with Letterman or finishing off a nightcap before heading home. I'm asking myself what a 45-year-old family man with a postgraduate degree is doing on the ice with 30 other men and women dressed up in plastic armor and carrying wooden, laminate and aluminum sticks?  Why, waiting for the referee to drop the puck. It hits the ice and it's skate 'til you drop _ two hours of fast-paced rushes, stick-handling and the occasional goal.  Not the fastest one on the ice, I try parking myself beside our opponent's net. Sure enough, a loose puck slides along the ice to my feet, and without pausing to think about it, I shovel it in. Suddenly I no longer feel the late hour or my sore muscles, I've scored my first goal!  I'm not alone in my jubilation. Adult ice hockey has quietly become the fastest growing sport in North America and Europe, especially in the over-35 age group. NUMBERS ON ICE  The loose, informal organization of most teams and leagues means no one has precise figures, but various estimates put the number of adults in hockey leagues at 250,000 and growing by 15 percent each year. These figures are probably far higher if pick-up games, club hockey and other casual contests could be tracked.  Fans of the professional game, who once thought it was too late for them to play because they never played as kids, have discovered that nothing is more electrifying than watching that little piece of vulcanized rubber stretch the twine at the back of the net.  Operators of skating arenas report that the recent boom in construction of ice rinks simply can't keep pace with the demand at the adult and child level. Teams often happen when a group of friends get together and rent some ice time, or get assembled at arenas into ``house leagues'' with seasons and play-offs.  There's even an international league, Hockey North America (HNA) with over 10,000 members of both genders in over 25 cities. HNA also has a sister league in Holland called Ice Hockey Europe, and the sport is flourishing in Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland and even northern Italy.  Adult hockey players come from all walks of life. A stockbroker, who identifies himself as ``Andrew'' (lest his boss discover he's spending a long lunch hour playing hockey), admitted to keeping a beeper wrapped in a towel on the bench.  ``I have sell orders on file at the office from all my clients,'' he says, ``so I can protect them in case the market goes into a tailspin while I'm on the ice.''  While it's true that far more men than women play, many teams have at least one female player. And while women are not normally considered physically aggressive, this reporter was dumped quite rudely in front of the net during a game by a female forward. As the referee skated up ice with the play, she deftly pulled my skates out from under me. GETTING STARTED  Anyone interested in playing for the first time will progress faster if they can already skate, but it's certainly not a requirement.  Hockey North America, for example, has a beginner course designed for people who have never gotten any closer to a game than their TV set. It starts with the fundamentals, then moves on to a 10-game season complete with playoffs.  After that, better players and teams can choose from three levels of play. House leagues often accept all comers, rarely making any effort to assign players based on ability.  Season costs average around $400, but vary by location, usually according to the price for ice-rink rental. Regions with fewer rinks tend to be higher than those with more venues.  Playing hockey calls for short bursts of intense activity, followed by periods spent on the bench. Those starting out should get into shape first. In-line skating or bicycling (both the stationary and the outdoor variety) help improve conditioning in the critical leg muscles and heart. It's also a good idea to have a complete check-up with your family physician before entering into any strenuous exercise regimen. REALITY CHECK  While professional hockey has a decided image problem because of fighting, most adult leagues discourage or even ban fisticuffs outright, as well as body checking, the process of separating the puck from the player by ramming him into the side boards.  This doesn't mean there isn't contact, especially among beginner players still mastering the art of stopping. But players who lose their tempers get tossed out of games, and persistent offenders usually get banned.  Perhaps in emulation of their National Hockey League heroes, some players occasionally end up in shoving matches or exchanges of verbal unpleasantries. When the puck's up for grabs around the goal, pileups are common, causing outbursts of temper and frustration. But most players will agree that having to explain a black eye from a hockey fight to a spouse or boss is a rarity.  Like many other players, my own shiny new hockey career began after watching how much fun my 7-year-old son had on the ice. I signed up for an adult instruction course at a local rink, then played pickup games until I felt I was ready. After that, a phone call to a league and an exchange of money got me assigned to the Gamblers.  My initial excitement at ``making the team'' was tempered a bit, though, when I found out they'd gone 0-32 over the past three seasons. But in the dressing room at our first game, all the players were friendly and enthusiastic _ a mood that slipped noticeably after the team absorbed an 11-1 thrashing.  The Gamblers' record of flawless imperfection continued through the next five games. But my goal was never winning a championship, it was to play the game I've always loved watching.  Whatever happens now, I've won a victory of sorts, a victory over aging, my inhibitions and self-doubts. Can Wayne Gretzky claim that? SIDEBAR: THE PUCK STOPS HERE  Getting started:  Almost every rink now has adult ice hockey programs; check the yellow pages for the nearest ice skating rink. The largest single league is Hockey North America. For information, call 800-4-HOCKEY.  Cost: A 20-game season (90 minutes per game) with double elimination playoffs costs around $400, depending on your location (ice time costs vary by region).  What you need: Most programs require (in addition to hockey skates) a regulation helmet, gloves, elbow and shoulder pads, pants and shin guards. Men will want to include an athletic supporter with a cup.  Depending on the brand and quality of the equipment, expect to spend at least $400 to $500 for a complete set; this figure does not include skates ($100-$350) or sticks ($18 for an inexpensive wooden one up to $100 for a graphite model with replaceable blade).  Some stores now feature used equipment, and many rinks have bulletin boards offering equipment for sale. Goalie equipment is much more expensive (pads can run as much as $1,500 new), and is best purchased used.  Visors or full face shields are highly recommended. Don't skimp on your equipment _ even with no checking allowed, collisions and spills demand solid protection.

Times News Service  TIMOR BISHOP ACCEPTS NOBEL PEACE PRIZE  OSLO, Norway (NYT) _ Amid reports that he had been threatened by the Indonesian government, Carlos Felipe Ximenes Belo, a Catholic bishop from the occupied territory of East Timor, steered clear of confrontation Tuesday as he accepted the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize.  By contrast the co-winner of the prize, a militant resistance leader who lives in exile in Australia, let loose a cannonade of criticism against Indonesia and put forward a plan for East Timorese independence.  The exile leader, Jose Ramos-Horta, said Indonesian authorities had warned the bishop that `if he was too free-talking or if he was seen too often with me he would suffer the consequences.`  IRAQ PUMPS OIL FOR EXPORT AGAIN  CAIRO, Egypt (NYT) _ Iraq began Tuesday to pump oil abroad for the first time in six years as President Saddam Hussein reopened a 616-mile pipeline that will deliver Iraqi crude to terminals on the Turkish coast.  At a ceremony in the northern oil city of Kirkuk, Hussein proclaimed that Iraq had returned ``to the international market,'' the official Iraqi News Agency reported.  But experts said the first oil to emerge from the pipeline would be suitable only for asphalt. They said it could be weeks before the limited quantity of oil that Iraq will be permitted to sell under a strict United Nations plan reaches the world stage.  GERMANS, CZECHS SET TO APOLOGIZE FOR WARTIME ACTIONS  BONN, Germany (NYT) _ More than half a century after the end of World War II, Germany will apologize for Hitler's invasion of the former Czechoslovakia, and Prague will express regrets for the postwar expulsion of millions of Sudeten Germans, according to the draft of a joint declaration to be endorsed this month.  German officials said Tuesday that Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and his Czech counterpart, Josef Zieleniec, would meet in Prague on Dec. 20 to initial the long-negotiated document intended to end a corrosive dispute between the two countries.  The draft document, leaked to reporters in Prague, commits Germany to apologizing for Nazi ``policies of violence'' while the Czech side will express regret that the postwar expulsion of 2.5 million Sudeten Germans caused suffering and injustice to innocent people.  SOUTH AFRICA PANEL GRANTS AMNESTY TO WHITE OFFICER  JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (NYT) _ In a move that signals that the most heinous crimes of apartheid will be forgiven rather than punished, South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission on Tuesday granted amnesty to a white police officer who was already serving a life sentence for his role in the brutal slaying of 11 people.  The police officer, Brian Mitchell, master-minded a 1988 attack that had come to be known as the Trust Feed massacre after the rural community where it took place. The night-time raid was aimed at political activists linked to President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress. But the wrong hut was identified, and the attackers burst in on a group of women and children attending a wake.  For months, South Africans have waited to see how the Commission would handle a high profile case involving what seemed like wanton viciousness by representatives of the old white government. Now they have their answer.  PANEL OKS JEWISH HOUSING IN ARAB EAST JERUSALEM  JERUSALEM (NYT) _ An Israeli planning commission approved construction of the first housing development for Jews in an Arab neighborhood in East Jerusalem on Tuesday, drawing Palestinian protests and warnings of renewed conflict over this bitterly contested city.  The plan to build 132 housing units in the Ras el-Amud neighborhood must be signed by Interior Minister Eliahu Suissa or another authorized minister before work can begin. But Suissa publicly endorsed the scheme Tuesday, saying it would be coupled with approval of more Arab housing in the area.  The plan to house Jews in Ras el-Amud, delayed under the previous Labor party government because of its political sensitivity, has raised concerns that it might dangerously escalate tension between Israelis and Palestinians.  NATO TAKES STEP TO INCLUDE FORMER EAST BLOC NATIONS  BRUSSELS, Belgium (NYT) _ NATO took the first formal step Tuesday to expand its alliance to include formerly Communist nations of Eastern Europe and then moved quickly to ease Russia's apprehensions by offering to negotiate a special charter with Russia and to increase military cooperation and contacts.  The foreign ministers of NATO's 16 member states, meeting at the alliance's headquarters near here, also sought to reassure Russia by pledging that the alliance had ``no intention, no plan and no reason'' to move nuclear weapons in the territory of any new members.  Russia's foreign minister, Yevgeny Primakov, arrived Tuesday evening for talks with his counterparts in NATO, but made no public statements after meeting separately with NATO's secretary general, Javier Solana, and Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Primakov is to appear before the entire NATO membership and other Eastern European nations on Wednesday morning, where officials expect he will address the issue.  CLINTON CHIDES SENATE FOR NOT RATIFYING WOMEN'S RIGHTS TREATY  WASHINGTON (NYT) _ Surrounded by half a dozen women's rights advocates from around the world, President Clinton Tuesday sought to blunt criticism of his administration's record on human rights by chiding the Republican-controlled Senate for failing to ratify a 15-year-old United Nations treaty guaranteeing women's rights.  ``As you know, many, many, many other nations have done this,'' Clinton said at a small ceremony at the White House marking International Human Rights Day, with his wife, Hillary. ``In our country, where we have worked so hard against domestic violence, where we have worked so hard to empower women, it is, to say the least, an embarrassment that the United States has not done this, and there is no excuse for this situation to continue.''  BRITAIN WITHDRAWS FROM U.N. INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION  VIENNA (NYT) _ Pressure for reform within the United Nations has taken a somewhat strange twist, with a decision by the British to withdraw from the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, even while acknowledging that the organization deserves high marks for the reforms that it has instituted.  The British ambassador to the United Nations organizations here, Christopher Hulse, said Tuesday that the withdrawal ``was more directed at New York'' than at the organization. But the organization, which has already been targeted by the Clinton administration, may ultimately be the fatal victim, its immediate future hanging on a decision by the German government, which is expected on Wednesday.  ``We are worried about the lack of coordination in the U.N. system, and wastefulness,'' Hulse said. ``That is the message that we want to be firmly established with the new secretary general.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19961210.0471 type=story > <HEADLINE> ROBERTSON STEPHENS'S ROHAL LIKES MSFT, INTC: BLOOMBERG FORUM </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> New York, Dec. 10 (Bloomberg) (BC-ROBERTSON-STEPHENS-FORUM-BLOOM) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"

At a time when there are so many uncertainties, one thing is immutable: President Bush and his family will have a Thanksgiving dinner that hardly differs from the past. Very traditional, with a few Texas touches and one new grace note from the White House pastry chef, Roland Mesnier. What isn't certain, or at least isn't being revealed, is where it will be. Camp David? The White House? The family ranch in Texas? However much the Bushes try to make this a Thanksgiving like all the others, it is, of course, so very different. For them, as for most Americans, this holiday will have more than the usual poignancy and significance. by Marian Burros.  With recipes.

Baker talks about his role as chief executive of New York's Channel 13/WNET.  FORD-SCHEELE (Detroit) _ Two weeks ago, a broad management shakeup swept Jacques A. Nasser out as Fords chief executive and set off a broad reshuffling of the company's top ranks. Most of the attention has been focused on William Clay Ford, Jr., the 44-year-old chairman, and great-grandson of Henry Ford, who took over as CEO. But it is Sir Nicholas V. Scheele who Ford has tapped to be the architect of Ford Motor's attempt to revive itself. By Danny Hakim.  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.)  BUSINESS-TRAVEL (Undated) _ Usually, those televisions hanging overhead in airport passenger-waiting areas drive me to distraction with their announcers constantly braying about some company's stock price or some windstorm in the Caribbean. There are times, though, when there is sufficient reason even for an admitted TV-hating crank like me to turn anxiously to the tube in an airport. By Joe Sharkey.  (ART ADV: Photo NYT19 is being sent to NYT photo clients.)  SPECIALISTS-AD-COLUMN (New York) _ Several agencies are becoming known as specialists in a new kind of advertising, producing a variety of work seeking to reflect the changed national reality after Sept. 11.

By Frank Litsky.  ENTERTAINMENT (Moved in ``e'' category)  TERROR-ART (Undated) _ How do artists respond to momentous acts of violence? Some are stunned into silence, others rush forward to express their feelings with a poem or a painting. But many allow for a time of reflection until they can begin to grasp the meaning and approach it within a creative context. In the mix of responses, though, there appear to be marked similarities of theme and emotion that transcend time, cultures and particular disasters. These past works of art and literature point toward the likely shape of cultural offerings inspired by the terrorism of Sept. 11, say several experts who have studied what one of them calls ``the art of aftermath.'' By Mel Gussow.  BOSTON-SYMPHONY-TERROR (Undated) _ The controversy over the Boston Symphony's decision to cancel its planned performances of three choruses from the John Adams opera ``The Death of Klinghoffer.'' The opera is about the 1985 hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro and the brutal murder of a wheelchair-bound passenger by Palestinian terrorists, but also more broadly about the historical tensions in the Middle East. By Allan Kozinn.  CANADA-LIBERATURE (Undated) _ In recent years Canadian literary critics have been asking why so many Canadian fiction writers confine themselves to provincial, even small-town themes. The answer may lie in the rewards. Last week Canada's biggest literary prize went to ``Clara Callan,'' a slow-moving, low-key novel couched mostly in the form of letters between two sisters from small-town Ontario traveling sharply divergent paths to maturity. By Barbara Crossette.  BABEL-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``The Complete Works of Isaac Babel,'' edited by Babel's daughter, Nathalie, and marvelously translated by Peter Constantine, is a cause for a kind of melancholy celebration _ a celebration of literary genius framed by 20th century tragedy. Babel, an Odessa Jew who was executed in 1940 at the age of forty-six, is probably not among the very greatest writers of the 20th century, but he comes close. His stories and sketches, his journalism and diaries, even his screenplays have an electrifying cumulative impact. Reviewed by Richard Bernstein.  TV-BERNIE-REVIEW (Undated) _ On Fox, ``The Bernie Mac Show.'' Reviewed by Neil Genzlinger.  DINING (Moved in `d' category)  THANKSGIVING-BUSH (Undated) _ A conversation with Laura Bush. At a time when there are so many uncertainties, one thing is immutable: President Bush and his family will have a Thanksgiving dinner that hardly differs from the past. Very traditional, with a few Texas touches and one new grace note from the White House pastry chef, Roland Mesnier. What isn't certain, or at least isn't being revealed, is where it will be. Camp David? The White House? The family ranch in Texas? However much the Bushes try to make this a Thanksgiving like all the others, it is, of course, so very different. For them, as for most Americans, this holiday will have more than the usual poignancy and significance. by Marian Burros.  With recipes.  THANKSGIVING-CORN (Undated) _ The dried corn that John Cope's Food Products has been processing and selling for 101 years has always seemed a perfect thing to eat on Thanksgiving. More than anything except the turkey, it's a link to our forefathers, something we all seem to crave. By R.W. Apple Jr.  With recipe.

"101259"	"he"	"is"	" Now, thanks to his superhuman heroism in the wake of the terrorist attacks, he is, as tonight's ``Biography'' puts it, ``America's Mayor.'' In a reflective, personable and surprisingly humble interview with Harry Smith, Giuliani relives moments from that tragic day -- he says when he first heard that the tower had come down, people were referring to the radio tower atop the skyscraper, so unthinkable were the unfolding events -- and deflects praise for calm determination that day: ``That's the way our people were.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"101498"	"he"	"is"	" Indeed, he is, as he made clear from the opening jab to the final right of his brief business meeting with Rahman. By the end of the first round, that jab already had ripped open Rahman's left cheek, and by midway through the fourth, it would set him up for the final punch of Rahman's seven-month reign as world champion. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"

"101659"	"she"	"is"	" According to the FAA, women who ask for a female guard to search them are supposed to get one. ``If a woman requests that she be screened by a woman, she is,'' said Paul Takemoto, a spokesman. ``There is always a male and female present'' among the guards at checkpoints, he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"103374"	"he"	"is"	" But if the Jets fail to reach the playoffs again this season, they are in danger of wasting Martin's best years. Although Martin has never led the league in rushing, he is, at 28, getting to the point where he will soon be considered old for a running back. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"103674"	"it"	"is"	" But while this popularization of the spiritual can be written off as the co-opting and secularizing of a belief system, it is, at its heart, a search for meaning. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"103964"	"she"	"is"	" But Cook has more left than most singers have ever had. She's learned a few tricks. Among other things, she knows when not to trespass on another performer's repertory.

ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS  (Coded `e')  ON THE COVER  MUSIC-ALICIA-KEYS (New York) _ Alicia Keys, who turns 21 on Feb. 1, has been nominated for Grammys in six categories, including best new artist and song of the year for ``Fallin'.'' In an interview, she discusses her life, her songs and her plans. By Jon Pareles. (2,000 words)  With photo.  Also see MUSIC-PUBLISHER-GERSON  THEATER  THEATER-POWELL (New York) _ Decades after Dawn Powell was buried anonymously in New York City's potter's field, she is, as Gore Vidal predicted, ``on the verge of ceasing to be a cult and becoming a major religion.'' Dozens of writers and performers will participate in ``Permanent Visitor: A Festival Celebrating Dawn Powell in New York'' through March 9. The event includes performances of five plays, a play about her, stage adaptations of her short stories and performers reading from her diaries and novels _ not the touching ones about Ohio, where she was born in 1897, but the witty ones about New York, where she lived for almost half a century. She died in 1965 with virtually all her 15 novels out of print. By Jonathan Mandell. (1,700 words)  With photo.  THEATER-OLDIES (New York) _ George M. Cohan wrote the line ``give my regards to old Broadway.'' If he were writing it today, the emphasis would be on the ``old.'' This year's Broadway season includes one-woman shows by Beatrice Arthur, 78, Elaine Stritch, 76, and Barbara Cook, 74; new plays by Edward Albee, 73 and Neil Simon, 74; a star turn by Uta Hagen, 82, in a new play; a revival of ``Into the Woods'' by Stephen Sondheim, 71; and two revivals of plays by Arthur Miller, 86. ``We're going through a geriatric phase now,'' said Rocco Landesman, the president of Jujamcyn Theaters. By Mervyn Rothstein. (2,000 words)  With photo.  FILM  FILM-MORETTI (New York) _ Nanni Moretti writes, directs, produces and stars in his movies, using his own preoccupations and opinions as the starting point for his deadpan humor. Moretti's reputation as a satirist explains the surprise that greeted his latest film, ``La Stanza del Figlio'' (``The Son's Room'') when it came out in Europe last year. The film was praised for its austere emotional power both in Italy and in France, where it won the Palme d'Or, at the Cannes International Film Festival. The movie is Italy's submission for this year's foreign film dd Oscar. ``The Son's Room,'' which opens in New York on Feb. 1, is about a close and loving family hit by an unexpected tragedy. (2000 words)  With photo.  TELEVISION  TV-SMALLVILLE (Undated) _ ``Smallville'' is one of a handful of new shows this season to have attained breakout status. While the show isn't quite as glossy as ABC's ``Alias'' and hasn't revolutionized the look of television drama the way Fox's ``24'' has, ``Smallville'' peddles its own brand of American corn, which, when served with a pinch of teenage angst, a hint of paranormality and a fresh take on superman, one of the most durable icons in pop culture history, makes an immensely satisfying meal. By Hal Hinson (2,000 words)  With photo.  TV-BLUE-PLANET (Undated) _ Since the advent of Discovery and its spin-offs, television has become rife with nature and it is much harder to recreate the sense of wonder viewers must have felt when Jacques Cousteau began filming underwater in the 1950s. ``Blue Planet'' contains echoes of those days. The first four hourlong installments of the ``Blue Planet'' will be shown Jan. 27 and Jan. 28 on Discovery. By Julie Salamon. (1,200 words)  MUSIC  APPRECIATION-PEGGY-LEE (Undated) _ Peggy Lee taught Terry Teachout about sex. He was 12 at the time and working his way through his father's record collection that included Peggy Lee's recording of ``Fever.'' ``I got the message, and then some,'' writes Teachout. ``What the lady on the record had in mind was pretty much what I had in mind 24 hours a day, except that her point of view was more informed.'' Thirty-four years later Teachout says he now knows that ``Fever'' was the least of her. ``She was exquisite _ there is no other word for her,'' he says. By Terry Teachout. (480 words)  (See photos NYT2, NYT3 and NYT4 sent on Tuesday with the Peggy Lee obituary.)  MUSIC-DALBAVIE (Paris) _ Marc Andre Dalbavie's new ``Color,'' to be performed by Christoph Eschenbach and the Orchestre de Paris on Jan. 30 at Carnegie Hall, is a little different for him: it's a departure into normality, with the full ensemble on stage, not scattered around a concert hall. By Paul Griffiths. (1,600 words).  MUSIC-PUBLISHER-GERSON (Los Angeles) _ Unlike record producers who help make and market albums or managers who can mold an artist's image, music publishers rarely share in the credit for an artist's success. That is true, in part, because many do little beyond collecting a fee for publishing a song. But the best music publishers not only aggressively promote their artists' work but also work closely with artists' managers to nurture talent. That's the kind of publisher Jody Gerson has been for Alicia Keys. By Laura M. Holson. (1,000 words)  ART  EXHIBIT-WOMEN-CHINA-PAINTERS (New York) _ Women ruled the worlds of china painting beginning in the 1870s, when they organized in groups to do china painting. Their influence increased in the 1880s as they founded factories, which employed mostly female artists. By then, women with increased leisure time began painting china at home, responding to advertisements urging them to buy their own blanks, brushes, paints and kilns. By the 1890s, china painting was a do-it-yourself craze that women across America joined for pleasure or profit. Now the role of women in this movement is recognized with ``Women China Decorators in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,'' on view through April 14. By Rita Reif. (1,100 words)  With photo.  DANCE  DANCE-JONES (New York) _ As he nears 50, Bill T. Jones has shed a degree of his political vehemence and is searching for beauty and for a new home for the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Co. The quest for beauty has produced three new works to be performed at Alice Tully Hall beginning on Jan. 31. The search for a home is for more than a building; it is to ensure the future of his choreography and his company. By Wendy Perron. (1,800 words)  BESTSELLERS, CHILDREN'S-BESTSELLERS and PAPERBACKS moved on Monday, Jan. 21.  TRAVEL  (Coded `t')  PRACTICAL-TRAVELER (Undated) _ Companies specializing in travel for singles say they add a lot of value. Matching roommates helps travelers cut costs by avoiding charges for single rooms and the absence of couples and families keeps singles from feeling like a fifth wheel. By Hope Reeves. (1,200 words)  TRAVEL-SECURITY-AGENCY (Undated) _ In the next few weeks, travelers will begin noticing that the emblems on security screeners' uniforms will change to the Transportation Security Administration. Behind the scenes, changes will be even bigger as the agency adds 31,000 employees and converts 25 airports per week. By Matthew L. Wald (1,900 words)  CUBA-CRUISES (Undated) _ Much of the U.S. travel industry has long been eyeing Cuba as a destination, and no segment more covetously than cruise lines. Sept. 11 has made Cuba even more inviting as cruise lines added more Caribbean itineraries. Projections show show that if the ban on travel by Americans to Cuba were lifted, 750,000 American cruise passengers a year would visit Cuba in the first few years and the numbers would grow to 1.8 million in a decade, more if ferry service could be established. By Edwin McDowell. (850 words)  TRAVEL-MEXICO-QUERETARO (Undated) _ Queretaro's plazas and chapels were settings for the rise and fall of colonial power in Mexico. From here Franciscan missionaries launched campaigns in the early 16th century to force Indians into slavery and Christianity. Ignacio Perez, Mexico's Paul Revere, rode out from this city in 1810 to warn the organizers of the War of Independence of a plot to kill them. The last Mexican emperor, Archduke Maximilian, was executed here in 1867 and in 1917 in the Teatro de la Republica, Mexico's Constitution was drafted. ``If you want to walk in history,'' one guide said, ``then this is a city that has worked hard to preserve it.'' By Ginger Thompson. (1,500 words)  SHORT STORIES  TRAVEL-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Answers to questions about getting married on a cruise from Venice to Rome, tours associated with J.S. Bach, comment cards in hotels. By Pamela Noel (1,100 words)  TRAVEL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Four Items: England declares it is free of foot and mouth disease; New Orleans adds extra police for Mardi Gras; La Scala is closed until 2004; United and Northwest Airlines share E-tickets, and Legoland California cuts hours. By Frances Frank Marcus, Marina Harss and Marjorie Connelly. (900 words)  TRAVEL-NY-RITZ-CARLTON (New York) _ On Sept. 11, the luxury Ritz-Carlton chain was less than a month from opening a hotel in Battery Park City, five blocks south of the World Trade Center. The opening was delayed until Jan. 29. About two-thirds of the 298-rooms, face the water, and each of these has a telescope to take in the sights, most notably the Statue of Liberty. By Ray Cormier.

"106120"	"it"	"is"	" For Calvin Trillin, finding a parking space on New York City streets is not just a subject of immediate urgency, it is, he said, ``the only thing that matters.'' In an attempt to prove his point, he has written a novel, ``Tepper Isn't Going Out,'' which chronicles the life and parking times of a New Yorker named Murray Tepper. Were it not for the apparently arcane subject and the book's brevity (213 pages, a length that is, however, Tolstoyan in Trillin's oeuvre of 21 slim volumes), a reader might be tempted to call it his magnum opus. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"

Gregory, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, was asked at a news conference on Saturday, after a week of meetings with top church officials here, whether the Vatican had placed the issue completely in the hands of U.S. bishops, he said yes. ``At this point, it is,'' Gregory said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"112644"	"it"	"is"	" Gregory insisted at a news conference on Saturday that the pope would leave the American church to address its crisis as it saw fit.

"114411"	"it"	"is"	" Spying Lin from a distance, Ing'er is taken with him because he pours himself so intently into his roles. He even takes the name of the character he plays: Lin Chung isn't his real name but that of the heroic figure in the opera ``Lin Chung Flees by Night,'' in which he sings lines like ``I feel my heart is on fire.''

"121437"	"it"	"is"	" If that quotation sounds repetitious, it is, and so is much else. ``Stravinsky Inside Out,'' Joseph's companion volume published last year by Yale University Press, includes essays on a lively variety of topics, including ``Apollo'' in America and Stravinsky in Hollywood, and if memory serves, it moves at a brisk pace. This book, in contrast, often lumbers and does not entirely justify its length. Not only repetitive but also confusing in its backing and forthing, it could have benefited from a firmer editorial hand. Entire paragraphs amount to little more than throat-clearing: stating the obvious, reprising what has just been said or suggesting what will soon become apparent. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"

"123935"	"it"	"is"	" The fourth act of ``The Seagull'' embraces tragedy. For most of the characters, it is, as they say, ``the same old story'' _ with the definite exception of the play's heroes, Konstantin and Nina. Each has learned from the harshness of worldly experience. In this, as in other plays and stories, the injured party in turn damages others, what Kataev refers to as the ``same roundabout of hopeless admissions and cruel rejections.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"

"136768"	"it"	"is"	" Besides being the only old-fashioned touch in an otherwise cutting-edge sort of room, it is, Vinoly says, a gift from his wife, Diana, an interior designer with whom he collaborates on hipper-than-thou hangouts like Bungalow 8 and Lot 61.

"138234"	"it"	"is"	" As we have discussed in earlier musings (the goddess is having flashbacks to an earlier repartee with my beloved readers on the specific criteria of bechamel), chefs are not always the most literal bunch. In fact, shockingly enough, they have frequently been known to take liberties with semantics. Thus a thick, flavorful emulsion becomes _ however inappropriately _ an aioli, when in fact it does not match the ``technical'' requirements of the said dish. While lemon grass can be added to`flvor an aioli, without garlic, it is, as Ms. Appleget so succinctly put it, simply a great emulsion. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200308.gz"
"138365"	"he"	"is"	" Levinson has been here before. Although he is a rookie novelist, he is, of course, an acclaimed film director and producer with a substantial Baltimore oeuvre. ``Sixty-Six closely resembles the 1982 gem ``Diner,'' which Levinson wrote and directed, and which followed a group of Baltimore guys coming to terms with adulthood over coffee and french fries with gravy on the cusp of the 1960s. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200310.gz"

Juries are rightly hostile toward people who even linger on the periphery of schemes to sell missile launchers that could be used to shoot down U.S. aircraft.

HONDA ODYSSEY A few laps at the Pocono International Raceway convinced me this is the finest van out there. Add the fact that it comes with electronic stability control, side, and side curtain airbags, and a hi-tech front crumple zone as standard safety equipment, and I'm sold. ($25,000 to $38,000) TOYOTA TACOMA X-RUNNER Looks like it was designed in Southern California by some low-ridin' cruiser club. It bulges where it should, burbles when it should, has plenty of power at 245 ponies, and comes to you right off the assembly line at just under $24,000. MERCEDES-BENZ SLK350 Finally, after a long while, a real sports car from Mercedes. It's quick, stiff, and fun to drive with 268 horsepower and a six-speed manual transmission. And this roadster has a nose taken right from the $452,000 McLaren. ($46,000-$52,000) CADILLAC CTS-V I love the way Cadillac is climbing back onto the high rungs of automotive elegance and performance. And nothing displays this better than the razor-edged, 400-horsepower CTS-V. A headline writer at this newspaper appropriately topped that review: Ready to Run with Germany's Big Dogs. (About $50,000) BMW 645Ci Has there ever been a list of favorites that did not include a BMW? The 6 Series grabs a spot on mine.

This adaptation is about two women of different generations at philosophical odds over careerism. Meryl Streep plays the older woman, Miranda Priestly, and Anne Hathaway plays Andy. And while the picture isn't brilliant, it is, at its most entertaining, a kicky, surprisingly astute throwback to bygone Hollywood social comedies. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
