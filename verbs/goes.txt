, he writes,	 NO PLACE TO HIDE, by Robert O'Harrow Jr. (Free Press, $15.) O'Harrow, a reporter for The Washington Post, pulls back the curtain on the troubling merger of two powerful forces -- law enforcement record-keeping and commercial market research -- capable of encroaching on the personal freedom of American citizens. The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, he writes, reignited and reshaped a smoldering debate over the proper use of government power to peer into the lives of ordinary people. The book surveys the techniques of commercial data gatherers and sellers and explores many consumers' willingness to trade privacy for convenience.

, she writes,	 Grandin is autistic, which has made her life difficult, and yet she believes it has given her a special understanding of animals. New in paperback is her engaging discussion of why she says animals saved me when she was a girl, of the many things she has learned about them and of her long-held belief that animals and autistic people are visual thinkers. The result, she writes, is that autistic people can think the way animals think. Autism is a kind of way station on the road from animals to humans, which puts autistic people like me in a perfect position to translate 'animal talk' into English, she writes. I can tell people why their animals are doing the things they do. Her book is anecdotal, provocative and appealingly chatty, whether she's talking about dogs, horses, cattle, pigs or cats. One book critic called it hilarious, fascinating, and just plain weird. And Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, author of The Hidden Life of Dogs and a devoted observer of animals, noted that Grandin has a Ph.D., but the autism has probably served her better. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060306.0002 type=story > <HEADLINE> AT&amp;T-BELLSOUTH-1STLD-WRITETHRU-ART-1000&amp;ADD-NYT </HEADLINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz

, he said,	 He helped hunt down Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, dodged bombs in Beirut and took part in the dramatic rescue attempt of American hostages in Iran. So maybe it's not all that shocking that Eric Haney's landed in the middle of the show business jungle, showing the natives a thing or two. Every pot of crawfish functions in its own certain way, Haney, 53, drawled here recently in a deep voice that betrayed its Floyd County roots. It's like when I would go live with native Arab speakers. It was different in a prince's palace in Riyadh than when I lived in a tent with Bedouin tribesmen in north Africa. You learn that culture so you can function in that culture. Forget just functioning. Haney's clearly thriving, having written a well-received book (2002's Inside Delta Force: The Story of America's Elite Counterterrorist Unit) about his experiences as a founding member of the covert Army unit of near mythical status. The book made him a go-to guy for cable news channels and brought him an out-of-the-blue phone call from Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright David Mamet (Glengarry Glen Ross), who'd stood in a bookstore and read it cover to cover. Tonight, it takes Haney from Marietta, Ga. to Tinseltown with the premiere of The Unit (9 p.m. CBS), a provocative series about a covert team of U.S. special forces and their families that has Haney's fingerprints all over it. Officially, Haney, a native of Lindale, Ga., is the show's producer and technical adviser. But to hear The Unit's pedigreed cast and crew tell it, the retired command sergeant major means much more than that. I think to a certain degree I channel Eric, said Dennis Haysbert, who's gone from playing one cool customer -- President David Palmer on 24 -- to another in team leader Jonas Blane, the Unit character inspired by Haney. I actually feel very uneasy if he's not on the set. Mamet was so taken by Haney's combination of inside knowledge and innate storytelling ability, he looked right past his own lack of TV experience in creating The Unit. I'm fascinated, as many of us are, by closed societies, Mamet confided. And I want to find out more what it's like in this one. That's why it's fascinating to work with Eric. You can't get more inside than that. At its best, The Unit feels like a classy cross between Mission: Impossible and The Stepford Wives, with a little bit of Desperate Housewives sprinkled in. Plus, enough rhythmically sharp, direct-hit Mametspeak to make things captivating, but not cutesy. No sooner does Bob Brown (Felicity's Scott Foley) join the unit tonight when he and Blane are off to rescue a hijacked plane. Their ensuing dialogue plays like an Army-issue tone-poem: How you holdin'? Blane calls out. Fine as kind, Brown responds. Blane: You don't mind learning on the fly, do you? Brown: No, Top, I do not. Meanwhile, back on the base, Brown's wife, Kim (Audrey Marie Anderson), is trying to assert her independence, but the Unit wives won't have it. You do not tell your mother, your best friend, your priest, what your husband does, steel magnolia Molly Blane (Alliance Theatre artist-in-residence Regina Taylor), warns Kim inside the house she's already acquired for the Browns. When Kim protests that Army regs allow them to live off-base, Molly cuts her off with a chilly smile. You aren't in the Army, Molly says. You're in the Unit. Maintaining covert status is critical to Unit members' survival. That ex-Delta Forcer Haney's now talking, in effect, seems ironic until you hear what got him started on his writing career. Watching the first Gulf War on TV, Haney (now using what he calls some of my David Mamet language) became disgusted with the [expletive] betrayal. It looked like a [darned] video game. Few people seemed to understand there were human beings on the other end being hit by U.S. bombs, he said, or what it's like being a covert operative. When you do this, it takes big pieces out of you, and you don't know it, said Haney, who considers The Unit to be a show about humanity, more so than just the military. Sooner or later, you do face the emotional cost. We were determined we were going to demonstrate that. CBS has ordered 13 episodes of The Unit (Haney co-wrote two) and given it a better-than-it-might-sound time slot opposite Fox's hit House. While House will benefit from lead-in American Idol's ratings, CBS has its own stealth weapon in NCIS at 8 p.m. The series about Navy crime investigators averages 15.3 million viewers (up 10 percent from last season) and is the 14th-ranked network show overall -- despite being up against Idol. Its loyal military drama fan base should like The Unit, although Haney last week professed little interest in scheduling, ratings, audience demos or the like. Heck, the promos are all over CBS, Haney said by phone from the Sherman Oaks, Calif., apartment where he's been happily bivouac-ing for months with his wife, freelance writer Dianna Edwards. Whatever happens happens. That may just be the cagey old special ops guy not wanting to show his hand too much, too soon. A chuckling Edwards said her husband had told them he would referee a dogfight to promote the show. And Mamet said Haney's not exactly lost in the showbiz jungle. When the time came to pitch The Unit to CBS executives, Mr. Mametspeak said very little himself. I gave Eric the floor, Mamet recalled with a big grin. He's one of the greatest storytellers who ever lived. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz

The new combatants: Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD, a new generation of high-definition entertainment software that aims to succeed the DVD. And unless a minor miracle happens, one of the formats may inherit Betamax's dubious crown of failure. Buyer beware -- and stay clear of the shrapnel. At some point, something will win, said Joni Blecher, home theater analyst with JupiterResearch. When you have two standards, there's always going to be a problem. One of the positives is consumers will have more say than they even know. This month, the first crop of these bleeding-edge discs and players -- both on HD DVD -- will be unleashed on a market that's growing hungry for hi-def programming. Blu-ray Disc software and hardware arrive at the end of May. Products will be available everywhere from Best Buy to BrandsMart for early adopters who want to maximize the potential of their HDTVs. For most home theater fans, the dust might settle before they need to make a decision. Meanwhile, trash talk between the two camps rivals a professional wrestling bout, with each side criticizing the other. It's really a shame, said Frank Sadowski, who manages global vendor programs for Amazon.com's electronics store. Everyone in the retail community has been begging them to come together on a format. We're not serving the customer by a format war. Amazon.com, he said, will support both sides, but Sadowski also said he can't imagine both formats thriving long term. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, they giveth,	 Tuesday, fortunately, they giveth, with ABC's Sons &amp; Daughters. This is a sweetly unassuming comedy that takes the loopy family dysfunction of Arrested Development and keeps it real with sincere moments and a semi-improvised style. It's not a punch-line-driven laugh riot so much as an unfolding of character neuroses reminiscent of Woody Allen's family material. And the show's star, Fred Goss, is also Allenesque, with stammering insecurities and phobias that are as endearing as they are irksome. The little-known Goss, who also created this series, starred on a short-lived Bravo sitcom called Significant Others. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, he implied,	 The group's current president, Edmund Daukoru of Nigeria, who was in Washington last week to meet with Bush administration officials, also expressed some concerns about the level of commercial inventory held in the United States. Too much oil in stock, he implied, could push prices down. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, they say,	 That view strikes many oil traders as at odds with market reality. If anything, they say, the greater risk is that prices will rise even further because of domestic turmoil in Daukoru's backyard and elsewhere. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
