"925"	"I"	"felt"	" ``At the time (of last year's Class A assignment), I felt, `I'm going to have to put a year or two in,''' Lorraine said of his minor-league career. ``I didn't know how fast I could move if I did well.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199407.gz"
"1127"	"he"	"felt"	" A watercolor by Akseli Gallen-Kallela combines a visionary portrait of the composer with a landscape inspired by the tone poem ``En Saga.'' A blank space had been left for Sibelius to write in a relevant musical quotation, but he declined to do so. No painting, he felt, can precisely represent musical content. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199407.gz"
"4339"	"we"	"felt"	" But Mrs. Brown said: ``The other crayons, we felt, added enough to the lead level that they should be withdrawn, and the companies agreed to withdraw them. I think their knowing we can get good press encourages them to go along with us, but we're not legislating by press release.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199409.gz"
"4450"	"we"	"felt"	" The answer, said Lynn Giordano, creative director at the agency, was ``to paint a picture of the reader,'' adding: ``And the best way, we felt, was to paint that picture through the eyes of all the men in her life. It could be a brother, a best friend, a father, a son, a lover, a friend.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199409.gz"
"4495"	"they"	"felt"	" As speaker, Rayburn went out of his way to help Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He led the battle to fend off threats to the president's foreign policy initiatives. When an economic recession struck in 1958, Rayburn and Senate Democratic Leader Lyndon Johnson organized a legislative rescue effort for the economy. Solutions, they felt, were better than scapegoats. A healthy economy was better than a campaign issue. Trust in our American government was better than a cheap slogan to throw at the opposition. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199409.gz"
"4886"	"I"	"felt"	" ``I think around the league my reputation has improved,'' Churla said. ``Just last year in the playoffs was a big step. A lot of players who play that role won't play much in the playoffs because they know the fighting and intimidation factor isn't really there. But I was able to play and, I felt, contribute to the team. And I think that's where you're measured, in the playoffs when everything counts.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199409.gz"
"7221"	"I"	"felt"	" ``The idea of paying maintenance really turns me off,'' she said. ``In addition to purchasing real estate and paying the mortgage, I felt, why should I have to pay these other expenses?'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199410.gz"
"7275"	"she"	"felt"	" At 16, while a student at the Horace Mann School in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, she decided to write a book about teen-agers. She was tired of the so-called experts, usually in their 40s, who, she felt, didn't have a clue and weren't even asking the right questions. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199410.gz"
"8594"	"I"	"felt"	" Opulence was still present. In a nod toward those angels who are gathering to help us over the hump into the 21st century, there was a dazzling array of pastel satins, the most dazzling of which, I felt, were Ralph Lauren's oyster-shell whites. He made them into sort of late-30s tennis dresses worn with blue or pink vest-sweaters, and women of all colorings looked glorious in them. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"
"9909"	"they"	"felt"	" ``This is the third time I tried to make the team,'' said White, who was activated in the eighth game. ``I think this game showed them.

"12093"	"they"	"felt"	" Many young people supported the war and died fighting for their country. And a great many older Americans opposed the war. It was not, they felt, a vital national security issue. But in general, America's youth came close to answering the bumper sticker question ``What if they called a war and no one came?'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"
"13736"	"I"	"felt"	" ``It's the kind of theme I'm always interested in, and when this script (by Michael De Luca, president and CEO of the film's distributor, New Line Cinema) came along, I felt, `Hmm, this is one way of looking at it that I haven't seen.''' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199502.gz"
"14257"	"he"	"felt"	" Despite unbelievable money, he felt, with reason, that ``the players don't have as much fun as we did.'' On induction to the Tennis Hall of Fame at Newport in 1975, he looked around the Casino, one of his old circuit haunts, and grinned, ``Ah, if this shrubbery could talk. We'd all be in trouble.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199502.gz"
"14334"	"he"	"felt"	" Although he dragged the steel mills back to profitability, USX's orientation toward its Marathon Oil business, he felt, blocked further advancement. Moved up to a nonoperating job of chairman of the steel and diversified group, he retired at age 64 in May 1991. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199502.gz"
"15007"	"I"	"felt"	" ``It even got to the point that we started going to the 6:30 a.m. practices a couple of times a week,'' Yeomans said. ``But I enjoyed it, and, I felt, it was keeping me in shape for the golf season.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199502.gz"
"15869"	"he"	"felt"	" Stierheim also complained that CNN made the gang killing of a Miami samaritan last year the lead story of its worldwide news service when, he felt, it was hardly the most important piece of news going on in the world that day. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"
"16367"	"he"	"felt"	" There are a number of useful points to be taken from his long and harrowing account of how he became dependent on sleeping pills and alcohol, and then agonizingly withdrew. Several involve his polite dispute with the techniques used by Alcoholics Anonymous, which, he felt, inflicted on him a mild form of brainwashing, and may have misdiagnosed him in insisting that ``one disease fits all.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"
"20396"	"he"	"felt"	" He wants to know more about a 16-year career with the Cubs, in which Smiling Stan averaged .301, played in four World Series and, he felt, was unfairly left out of the Baseball Hall of Fame. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"20443"	"they"	"felt"	" Prior to that game, the Magic coaching staff warned the officials to watch Montross, who, they felt, was tangling too much with Shaq. The two teams had played the night before in Hartford. Montross didn't change a thing in Orlando, O'Neal got agitated and threw a choke-punch at the rookie and found himself ejected. (The Magic then went on to pummel the Celtics, but the fans still remember the ejection). </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"20692"	"he"	"felt"	" Despite his success, Harvey lived in despair, cut off, he felt, from any source of spiritual strength. In 1977 he put his Oxford life behind him and returned to Mother India. There, a year later, when he was 26, he met a 17-year-old woman, Kamala Reddy. Her followers call her Mother Meera (``miraculous''); they believe she is an avatar, a temporal incarnation of the eternal Divine. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"

"21079"	"he"	"felt"	" The Celtics had one gate attraction during Auerbach's first six years as coach, and that was Bob Cousy. Despite Cousy's heroics, the Celtics were a close-but-no-cigar team that lacked a rebounder to trigger the fast-break style that Auerbach espoused and at which Cousy excellecoach and mentor, Bill Reinhart, had tipped him off to this very different type of player. Russell lacked a scorer's touch, but he had exceptional spring and timing. His game consisted of rebounding and defense. He blocked shots in a manner heretofore unseen. Auerbach was intrigued. Here, he felt, was our savior. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"22420"	"I"	"felt"	" Conquering the summit, I felt, would reveal the deeper meaning of the famous eruption after the passage of 15 springtimes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"25897"	"he"	"felt"	" Conrades thought he recognized the key to growing through the Internet, the burgeoning amalgam of computer networks. The answer, he felt, was not to go after the so-called ``network surfers,'' users who pay as little as $15 a month to be connected. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"31647"	"she"	"felt"	" Although not so well known to the public as the sex researchers William Masters and Virginia Johnson, Dr. Kaplan was a leader in her field. She also had her differences with the Masters-Johnson team, questioning their advocacy and use of two therapists working together because, she felt, one therapist of either sex would suffice. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"32957"	"I"	"felt"	" ``(People read that) I grew up in the inner city but (stories are not) saying my mom lives in Sherman Oaks. There was a comment made by one of the Pac-10 investigators and I felt it was a real negative comment toward me,'' Johnson said. ``It has something to do, I felt, with me being an inner-city kid. They expect for you not to have $1,500 in your bank account.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"33405"	"it"	"felt"	" Clemson, which started seven freshmen on offense in a 17-0 loss to FSU last season, came into Saturday's game with 17 returning starters, including 10 on offense. A victory, it felt, wouldn't be that far-fetched. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"33597"	"he"	"felt"	" That sense of responsibility is what fueled his disappointment and the adrenal rush that kept him pacing all night. His team, he had believed, was ready to play the Dolphins. It had practiced well on Wednesday and again on Thursday. It was so ready, he felt, that he allowed the players to work out without pads on Friday in hopes they would ``feel good for the game.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"34088"	"they"	"felt"	" They are upset because one of her victims was a cop. In the New Orleans Police Department there is a strong belief that cop killers should be dealt with summarily. Ms. Frank, in the view of some officers, should have been lynched. Allowing her to see a courtroom was, they felt, a sign of weakness. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"

"34227"	"I"	"felt"	" The second-best scenario, I felt, would have been for Sanders to go to any other club besides the Cowboys or the 49ers and allow the two best teams in the league to slug it out for the NFC championship. I had no doubt about the outcome of such a match. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"34338"	"we"	"felt"	" That's what happened recently when I questioned the existence of North Dakota because I'd never been there, my boss had never been there, and I'd never met anyone who was from North Dakota. It was, we felt, only a vague and unproved rumor. Good for a few chuckles, yes? </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"34747"	"he"	"felt"	" He is lean, thanks to skiing and other heavy-duty recreations, and sometimes mean. In a reporter's presence he bawled out a senior securities analyst who, he felt, had improperly monopolized the services of a junior analyst. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"35867"	"I"	"felt"	" ``I had the weight of all of Washington on me, I felt,'' Johnson declared. ``But I thrive on that type of competition. I hope it's apparent by now.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"36276"	"he"	"felt"	" ``Then, one man sort of hesitated, and his hand went up,'' she said. ``I asked what happened, and he revealed he had been stopped routinely by the police because, he felt, of his race. He was African-American, in his 30s.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"37259"	"they"	"felt"	" But that was not enough to satisfy many Democrats in Congress who have been complaining for months about how the president seemed to be divorcing himself from them. Many were particularly angry earlier this year when Clinton proposed his own tax cuts and Medicare savings, stealing from the lawmakers, they felt, the best issues they had on which to counter the Republican offensive. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"39640"	"he"	"felt"	" He next became president of Adelphi University in New York. He resigned in 1971 in a disagreement with the trustees who, he felt, failed to give him enough authority to match his responsibilities. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"
"41104"	"he"	"felt"	" This was the situation: The score was tied, 24-24, with 55 seconds left in the final quarter. The Giants had fourth down and 4 yards to go for a first down. They were on the Bears' 32-yard line. They were going against a slight wind. Reeves decided, with good reason, not to go for a field goal _ under the atmospheric conditions, he felt, it was too long a shot for the kicker, Brad Daluiso. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"
"42489"	"I"	"felt"	" That whittled it down to 29, all of whom, I felt, could warrant a Hall of Fame case of some merit.

"42877"	"she"	"felt"	" Something was lacking, she felt, but it wasn't because of her past work helping design elaborate displays with animated creatures and fancy backdrops for the likes of Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord &AMP; Taylor. It was her faith, not her artist's eye, that nagged her. Christ, she thought, was missing from Christmas. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
"43699"	"she"	"felt"	" The book is full of what now seems ``period'' detail, painstakingly reconstructed by Powell. ``What I want to do in this book is to make it as rich and fruity as an attic trunk of the late America before the war,'' she wrote in her diary. She felt nothing but scorn for writers who, she felt, didn't work hard enough (such as the rival who wrote ``without ever keeping a notebook. She believes evidently in her omnipotence and genius _ sit down at typewriter and make up''). It is rich in character, incident and observation, and the characters talk the way people do. ``The onion being the cousin of the lily didn't make it any posy,'' Aunt Lois notes, ``or smell any the better.'' Grandpa, retrieved from the Old Soldiers' Home, declares, ``No, my memory ain't going one bit. It's just that there's a lot of things I never knew right in the first place, that's all.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
"44069"	"we"	"felt"	" ``I'm a little surprised they didn't make a lot of adjustments with their (defensive scheme) from when we played them last time (two weeks ago),'' Thomas said. ``When we saw what defense they were in, we felt, `Hey, this could be a good day for running the football.'

"44074"	"I"	"felt"	" ``My daddy didn't understand the call,'' Danny said, ``but as a kid, I felt, `You have to go for it.' I respect Coach Osborne's decision. It was a gutsy call.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
"44574"	"he"	"felt"	" The problem with Huck's detractors, he felt, was that they have too little appreciation of the uses of irony. Because he himself did a lot of tongue-in-cheek writing, he was well aware of the propensity of too many readers to take things literally without grasping their more subtle meanings. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"
"44575"	"he"	"felt"	" In his view, Twain's monumental achievement in ``Huckleberry Finn'' was in having delivered a ringing denunciation of the cruelty and absurdity of slavery through satire. The sheer absurdity of Huck's guilt feelings about abetting the escape of a slave, he felt, was a master stroke of characterization and polemic. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"
"44576"	"he"	"felt"	" In making her case for the inclusion of female writers in that pantheon, she makes a comparative analysis of ``Huck'' and Harriet Beecher Stowe's ``Uncle Tom's Cabin.'' That comparison failed, he felt, because it was like comparing an artillery piece and a scalpel. ``Cabin,'' he believed, must remain on everyone's reading list because of its enormous historical significance _ its catalytic propaganda effect in mobilizing the anti-slavery forces in the 19th century. It was not, in his view, great literature. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"
"45686"	"she"	"felt"	" When she retired from skating after skipping the 1994 nationals, Mayer was still young, healthy and not jaded. Which is why, she felt, it was a perfect time to quit. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"
"45760"	"I"	"felt"	" ``The whole thing, I felt, was an utter disaster,'' she says. The daughter of the playwright Arthur Miller and the photographer Inge Morath, Ms. Miller, 32, a New Yorker, had majored in painting at Yale before deciding, while in Germany on an arts fellowship, that she wanted to be a film maker. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"

While letting out her full-throttle wails, the 34-year-old Canadian singer fuses Patsy Cline's earthy torchiness with Peggy Lee's smoky intensity and Liza Minnelli's belting fervor.

"140910"	"they"	"felt"	" There was a moment, in the late 1990s, when Roy and Sophia Pachecano looked around their East Ninth Street apartment and said, There's no way we're going to bring kids up in this shoebox! So they did what many couples planning a family do -- they looked for a house. Only they didn't head to the suburbs, where, they felt, the commute would be miserable. Instead, they kept their sights on Manhattan. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"140921"	"I"	"felt"	" The four-wheel independent suspension gave a steady sedanlike ride, I felt, unlike the firm jiggle of many truck-based SUVs. Others who have driven the Equinox were less pleased with the general softness of the suspension, finding the body lean and tendency to understeer (a reluctance to turn when pressed hard) disconcerting on twisting roads. That may not be a major issue around the neighborhood, but it could cause a gasp when a sudden steering maneuver is needed. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"144104"	"we"	"felt"	" Such a meeting, we felt, would be read by our customers and prospects as taking a step to sell the company, and chill licensing negotiations, he said. That would erode shareholder value and the bargaining position we had. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"145626"	"I"	"felt"	" I guess you could call it an interview, Manuel, speaking uncertainly, said by telephone. I would assume it was more of a personal meeting, I felt, versus an interview. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"149365"	"they"	"felt"	" As the issue continues to generate discussion on campuses and in the media, they felt, as scientists and university presidents, that it would be helpful to take a more forward-looking approach and focus on why it is important to encourage women to pursue careers in math, science, and engineering, he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"
"150102"	"I"	"felt"	" Before they met with the doctor, Steve's sister-in-law brought in seven friends from her prayer group. In that prayer group, I felt, for the first time, a sense of peace, a sense that God is with you, Kingsfield recalled. I was prepared for whatever the doctor would say. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"150133"	"he"	"felt"	" The Timberwolves are still struggling. They lost at home last Wednesday to the woeful Warriors and they had to rally from a 10-point hole in the fourth quarter at home Friday to outlast the mighty Bucks. They are missing the valuable Sam Cassell (hamstring) and the improved Eddie Griffin (left hand injury). McHale is emphasizing defense, effort, and more of a commitment from the players, who, he felt, had gotten too comfortable playing for Saunders. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"150445"	"I"	"felt"	" And we fought like we were in a passionate relationship. One night I asked him to bring me chocolate ice cream. He brought me toffee-flavored instead. It was, I felt, the end of the world. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"151432"	"he"	"felt"	" He disagreed strongly with many other Orthodox leaders who, he felt, insisted on treating the Greek Orthodox in America as a church in diaspora that should still take its lead from across the Atlantic. We are not transients, he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"154271"	"he"	"felt"	" Still, he was a relative newcomer and eager to prove he had lasting power. If he failed in New York, he felt, his ascent would be finished. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"156042"	"they"	"felt"	" Religiously, the young men came at Islam like converts -- questioning everything, accepting nothing. If they were going to practice, they wanted to do it in what they considered the right way. If they wanted to go to heaven, they felt, they had to find the purest form. They wanted evidence for whatever they did in the Quran. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"156361"	"they"	"felt"	" Seven weeks and 45 games into the season, the Houston Astros had 15 victories and 30 losses. They had been the National League wild card last year and had won their opening series against Atlanta, and no way, they felt, had they become a 15-30 team. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"156605"	"I"	"felt"	" Even half asleep, I'd turn on my receiver and when I'd pick up his signals, I felt, oh, OK, there's my leopard. But one morning, his signal read as if he was lying inactive somewhere in the forest and I really got worried. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"157248"	"he"	"felt"	" Yet this was not enough, he felt, to make the work his own. We didn't want to make it 'modern' or do something with puppets, he said. So we took an 'Our Town'-narrator approach. This meant introducing Offenbach as a character -- one who interacts with the cast, grumbles about his inept interpreters and at one point ascends the podium to wrestle with Villaume for control of the orchestra. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"159246"	"I"	"felt"	" The only thing missing from the eclectic mix, I felt, was a cigar from a humidor. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20051026.0143 type=story > <HEADLINE> SENATE TO QUESTION MIERS ABOUT ROLE IN CONTENTIOUS WHITE HOUSE DECISIONS </HEADLINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
"160444"	"she"	"felt"	" The next morning, Michelle went back to Gibbs High, where she had graduated just three months earlier. She wanted to see her teachers and theater friends who were still there. This was where she had learned to act and dance and sing. If not for this school, she felt, she never would have made it to Broadway. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"162250"	"they"	"felt"	" Now, with the advent of the second Bush administration, Reich, Abrams and their colleagues were back in power. The Clinton era, they felt, had been a bad one for United States interests in Latin America. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"162737"	"he"	"felt"	" Ameed Zakaria, a lifelong Fatah member who dresses in the uniform of Palestinian secular nationalists - leather jacket, jeans, no beard - broke from the party to manage the campaign of a Hamas-backed independent candidate. He wanted Hamas to win a solid opposition bloc; the competition, he felt, would shock Fatah into reforming corruption, while the burdens of office would make Hamas more pragmatic. But he confided before the election that he hoped they would win no more than 30 percent. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"

"166666"	"I"	"felt"	" It was my tournament, I felt, either Rod's or mine, and we let someone back in, he said. I let it slip. But I hung in there, and that's probably why I kind of looked up. I couldn't believe it. </P> 	nyt_eng_200605.gz
, he cruised,	 Lowe (2-3) muddled through a 30-pitch first inning, giving up a double to Orlando Cabrera, walking two batters and allowing a double steal. But after he escaped unscathed, he cruised, allowing just two hits the rest of the way. </P> 	nyt_eng_200605.gz
, I can't,	 But Bruce is a unique kind of perimeter defender.

, he said,	 Leduff said Erica Bell's body was found in a parked car at the Ardenwood Park Apartments, a few miles from the church. Bell was discovered nearby, he said, crying and holding the infant. </P> 	nyt_eng_200605.gz
, I wondered,	 Ever since I started my comeback in January, I wondered, 'Can I do it? Can I win a title,' Hingis said, beaming. Now I know I can, and [it feels] like the first one I won. That was 10 years ago in Germany as a 15-year-old at Filderstadt. Tonight I can have a glass of wine because I won't have to play tomorrow, she said. The pressure's off until Paris [the French Open]. But in some ways, this one is tougher - six matches in seven days. </P> 	nyt_eng_200605.gz
, I said,	 When I met him, I said, 'So what do you want?' says Fannin. He didn't hesitate. He said, 'Hall of Fame.' I said, 'Really? You're hitting .220 something and making more errors than the rest of the team. You've got the guts to tell me that? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"170469"	"I"	"felt"	" A: At first I laughed, because I didn't think he knew who I was. Then I got angry as his remarks, I felt, became more personal. My friends were livid. I was moved when Sean came to my defense. As a celebrity I know I'm fair game for a lot of things that I don't like, but Rock crossed the line when he made his point and got his laugh then seemingly wouldn't stop. It's very unfortunate that I had five or six films come out at the same time. However I had no control over that. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"171806"	"she"	"felt"	" His wife, Annemarie, also looked up, and the elegant young man on the left of the tank in a European city rising in revolutionary ire against the Soviet empire caught her eye. She knew him, she felt, with a certain intimacy. Charlie, she said, grabbing her husband and pointing at the photograph, that's you! </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172295"	"he"	"felt"	" Ho first tried to bring his anti-consumerist ideas into focus through stand-up comedy. It was then that he changed his name from Dan Drilon to Dan Ho, because Ho, he felt, just sounded funnier. He hoped to have a radio program, but that didn't happen, so in 2003 he started a witty, sporadically published magazine called Rescue, which he funded himself. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172966"	"I"	"felt"	" I just felt like that from that weekend on, I felt, 'Go be a musician,' he said. You don't have to be this genre or that genre or anything but a musician. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"174013"	"she"	"felt"	" She arrived at many of her designs -- abstract, improvisational and filled with deep personal significance -- after private prayer. Tompkins believed herself to be merely an instrument, Leon said. It was God, she felt, who designed the quilts and guided her hand. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
"174593"	"I"	"felt"	" He had his faults, of course: Charles could be moody, easily wounded and infuriatingly quiet, especially during an argument. And at times, I felt, he put the military ahead of family. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
