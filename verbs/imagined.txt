"27253"	"I"	"imagined"	" How I envied classmates with siblings. They, I imagined, must eat mashed potatoes every week, not only at Thanksgiving. Poor deprived child, I still remember Tuesday mealtimes of floating pats of fine Scandinavian butter on boiled potatoes, ruing my mother's lack of imagination. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"

"52639"	"I"	"imagined"	" The caption sharpened the feeling of nostalgia I felt when I studied the faces and activities of the various family members gathered in the Merritts' modest living room. This scene, I imagined, followed the evening meal in the Merritts' equally modest dining room. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"
"94088"	"I"	"imagined"	" Venice, I imagined, must be a pretty cruel place if you are a new artist trying to make an impression against the backdrop of so much dead glory. Then again, Canaletto and Bellotto arrived after Titian and Tintoretto, so who knows? The city, its spell partly due to the assuring impression that it never changes, in fact has changed many times. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"

"100027"	"we"	"imagined"	" On a warm fall day, we came into town just before noon over the  Interstate 295 bridge and right away saw that Portland is no cute little  cove like Boothbay or Kennebunkport. It really is a port. In the Fore  River, the freighter Asphalt Commander was just casting off (having  delivered, we imagined, thousands of blacktop driveways), attended by  the tugboats Captain Sweet and Fournier Boys. We parked easily on  Commercial Street and ate our bag lunch on the state pier, near the  Casco Bay ferry terminal, as lobster boats went to and fro and several  gulls kept our peanut-butter sandwiches always in sight. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"120000"	"she"	"imagined"	" Patricia A. Cody kept busy. During the day, she was a senior vice president and managing director at Marsh &AMP; McLennan. At night, she was a college student again, studying for a teaching degree at Fordham. Someday in the future, she imagined, she would settle into a new career as an English teacher. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"124802"	"they"	"imagined"	" PAKISTAN-911 (Srisaral, Pakistan) _ Even the harshest critics of America admit they cherished some hopes when their country joined the U.S. alliance against terror. American dollars, they imagined, could ease Pakistan's poverty. American clout, they thought, would goad President Pervez Musharraf toward democracy. Now, the same complaints echo: American dollars don't reach ordinary Pakistanis, and Musharraf, who came to power in a coup but speaks about democracy, shows signs of monopolizing power like a dictator.

"131153"	"he"	"imagined"	" I asked Ekeus, a diplomat who has great faith in inspections, what kind of noncompliance might justify a military strike in his mind. He recalled two episodes of outright defiance from his UNSCOM days, one where inspectors were surrounded and held prisoner in a parking lot, another where an Agriculture Ministry building was blocked for weeks. This time, he imagined, such antics would be widely accepted as enough to trigger military action. By waiting for such an event, Bush gets a casus belli the American public and our allies can more readily accept. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"143770"	"I"	"imagined"	" I wanted to go somewhere on a train. I had ideas about what that meant -- romantic ideas, vague and old-fashioned. I would be Lily Bart, I imagined, that glamorous (though ill-fated) heroine of The House of Mirth, chatting up a handsome man on the way to a wealthy friend's summer place. We'd sip tea as the train swayed and clacked along the track, as the countryside unfolded outside the window. We would call to the porter for sugar and lemon, then talk of. ... </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"156937"	"he"	"imagined"	" The orchestra, he imagined, would demonstrate that music is a unifying force. And it would symbolize the potential for peace among groups that are engaged in intractable conflicts over land and sovereignty: Russians and Chechens, Georgians and Abkhazians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis, to name a few. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"158372"	"I"	"imagined"	" There were cows with him, but like the cows we'd seen the previous night, these seemed unaware of the impending orgy. And like last night's bull, this one strolled about, checking to see if any cows were ready. Then it wagged its huge head, slammed and rubbed its antlers into the dirt, and bugled so hard that its abdomen shook, and, I imagined, the lesser bull we'd seen went running for his life. The bugle ended in a series of grunts. Jeff and I crept closer to take pictures, trying not to snap twigs. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
