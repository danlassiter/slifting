"9560"	"she"	"implies"	" Hers, she implies, is not. Inching down the precariously steep and narrow lane in San Rafael, one of the more crowded towns in Marin County, it is almost impossible not to pass right by her house on the downslope of the hill. From the road it looks modest, and disappointingly normal. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"
"33828"	"it"	"implies"	" The first feature directed by James Keach, ``The Stars Fell on Henrietta'' was produced by Clint Eastwood and David Valdes, and it follows other Eastwood-produced films in laying out a raw, stripped-down vision of American enterprise as guided by frontier mentality. If you took away the suits and business-school polish from today's young entrepreneurs, it implies, what you would see would be a lot like the film's scruffy semi-outlaws on the scent of a big kill. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"36728"	"he"	"implies"	" He writes scornfully of ``enraged'' professionals, such as Jill Nelson or Derrick Bell, and of the black middle class, which, he implies, helped to create the urban crisis by abandoning their wretched brothers and sisters and moving to the suburbs. His special venom, though, is reserved for the leaders of civil rights organizations (he calls them ``the race merchants''), whom he accuses _ adducing no evidence _ of wanting to keep the black poor in misery so as to preserve their own privileges. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"61054"	"he"	"implies"	" His approach to the Arabs is rather that of an old-time colonialist: they respond well, he implies, to a firm hand, and will swiftly adapt to Israeli rulers who are no softies. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"

"86902"	"it"	"implies"	" In Chinese, a language rich in colorful and elaborate insults, one of the nastiest things you can call someone is ``neither East nor West.'' The object of the insult, it implies, is a real nothing: not only less than human but lacking even the stature of a thing, since a material object has to exist somewhere in space. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"

"90222"	"he"	"implies"	" The fault, he implies, is not because of any of the above causes, but because America is in the grip of an energy crisis. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"

"113493"	"she"	"implies"	" O'Donnell labels her behavior ``codependent compulsion'' that springs from ``sheer disgusting narcissicism.'' That's not a phrase that crops up in many celebrity memoirs (although it should), and it's a large part of what makes Rosie Rosie. She knows her persona, the character named Rosie she plays in public, is bigger than life, while her true self, whom she calls Ro, is a child's garden of neuroses. What's endearing for an hour a day on TV, she implies, might be pretty trying to live with 24/7. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"166789"	"it"	"implies"	" At first La Moustache seems to be a darkly witty commentary on what we notice or don't notice about one another; we're so lulled by the predictable and the commonplace, it implies, that we fail to recognize change. Then it widens into a reflection on marriage and the notion that two people, no matter how intimately connected, inhabit separate worlds. An illusion of oneness requires each partner to overlook or deny the other's unknowable qualities. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"171860"	"she"	"implies"	" Malkin's video, titled First They Came, had resided on YouTube for some time, and is essentially a crude slideshow paean to people -- authors, politicians, filmmakers -- who had been made targets, she implies, by intolerant Islamic fascists. (A Windows Media file version of the video can be downloaded at snipurl.com/malkin). </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
