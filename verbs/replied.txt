They could be seen removing a tent, a motorcycle wheel, a wooden crate and some tools. The agents had pulled several trucks across the front of the property to block it from television cameras. The dozen agents left at 6:20 p.m. after searching for less than an hour. They appeared not to have taken anything, loading new cartons that had never been opened. Fortier said he had opened the padlocked shed for them. Asked if he had given his consent to the search, he replied, ``Of course, I have nothing to hide.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"

Times News Service  DOES DAVE NEED ANOTHER TOOTH?  A young associate account manager at D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles in New York has had a ``brush with greatness'' _ figuratively and literally.  Molly Glover, 24, who joined the agency a year and a half ago and works on the Crest toothpaste account, appeared on ``Late Show With David Letterman'' on Monday night. Her visit was part of a stunt stemming from an oversized toothbrush and tooth that decorate the window of her office, which is visible to members of the Letterman staff from their midtown Manhattan studio.  Letterman called Ms. Glover, asking her to bring the props to the studio, where he used them to comic effect, squeezing gobs of Crest on the toothbrush and sending Ms. Glover onto the street to be doused by a hose.  ``It was a surprise for me,'' Ms. Glover said on Tuesday. ``I was more excited than nervous.'' Asked if she would like to become one of the show's many running gags, she replied, ``I would like for him to call me again, but I have no idea if he will.'' She may well return; Letterman kept the tooth, and she taped a sign to her window yesterday reading: ``Dave, Where's my tooth? Molly.''  Jay Schwartz, a spokesman for the Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. in Cincinnati, which makes Crest, said: ``Being in the toothpaste and toothbrush business, we love to see people smile and laugh. We thought it was funny, silly and great exposure for Crest.''

"26406"	"he"	"replied"	" The record here indicates that the Vernonia schools are no exception. The great irony of this case is that most (though not all) of the evidence the District introduced to justify its suspicionless drug-testing program consisted of first- or second-hand stories of particular, identifiable students acting in ways that plainly gave rise to reasonable suspicion of in-school drug use and thus that would have justified a drugrelated search under our T. L. O. decision. See id., at 340-342 (warrant and probable cause not required for school searches; reasonable suspicion sufficient). Small groups of students, for example, were observed by a teacher ``passing joints back and forth'' across the street at a restaurant before school and during school hours. Tr. 67 (Apr. 29, 1992). Another group was caught skipping school and using drugs at one of the students' houses. See id., at 93-94. Several students actually admitted their drug use to school officials (some of them being caught with marijuana pipes). See id., at 24. One student presented himself to his teacher as ``clearly obviously inebriated'' and had to be sent home. Id., at 68. Still another was observed dancing and singing at the top of his voice in the back of the classroom; when the teacher asked what was going on, he replied, ``Well, I'm just high on life.'' Id., at 89-90. To take a final example, on a certain road trip, the school wrestling coach smelled marijuana smoke in a hotel room occupied by four wrestlers, see id., at 110-112, an observation that (after some questioning) would probably have given him reasonable suspicion to test one or all of them. Cf. 4 LaFave s10.11(b), at 169 (``(I)n most instances the evidence of wrongdoing prompting teachers or principals to conduct searches is sufficiently detailed and specific to meet the traditional probable cause test''). </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

BILL'S WORLD  By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star  Uncle Sam may run out of money soon. Yes, but the money he'll run out of is what he borrowed because he was out of money.  The U.N. birthday party was called the largest gathering of world leaders in history. By contrast, the recent Clinton-Yeltsin meeting was a gathering of the largest world leaders.  When Boris Yeltsin told the White House press corps, ``You're a disaster,'' the other day, Bill Clinton laughed so hard he cried. But notice he didn't assign FEMA to the case.  People in Quebec, who long have talked of splitting from Canada, vote Monday on it. The separatists' motto: ``If at first you don't secede. . .''  At a separatist rally in Quebec City the other night, people chanted, ``We want a country.'' Aren't pieces of the old Soviet Union, say, for sale?  ``There are no death squads in Cuba,'' Fidel Castro told New Yorkers the other day. Apparently this is what passes for good news there.  No doubt you will always remember exactly where you were and what you were doing when you heard that Pete Wilson had endorsed Bob Dole.  Thanksgiving turkeys this year will cost a bit more than they did last year, officials say. We report this so you may keep abreast.  Strong export demand for U.S. turkeys is keeping prices up, reports say. Is this a global _ or gobble _ economy?  The rocket that blew up just after launch from a NASA facility the other day was worth $20 million, it's reported. Which works out now to about a dollar a piece.  CITY STREETS  SCENE: A theater district boite.  Time: Late Saturday night, during the weekend of the United Nations celebration.  Dramatis personae: Three young male theater types, very likely dancers, discussing rumor and fact.  Fellow one: I heard Yeltsin was at ``Sunset'' tonight.  Fellow two: The Foreign Minister of Egypt and the King of Latvia were at ``Victor/Victoria.''  Fellow three, quietly: I saw my periodontist and his wife in Shubert Alley.  David Snyder, a native New Yorker who has been living in Baltimore, paid a recent return visit. In the lobby of the Empire State Building, a tourist asked him for directions to Madison Avenue. ``That way,'' Snyder said, pointing west. No sooner had the words left his mouth than he realized he had misguided her, but she was swallowed up in the tumult of 34th Street.  Several hours later, as Snyder strolled through Central Park, a vaguely familiar face stared at him steadily, and a voice said icily: ``Thanks a lot!''  You can't hide in New York.  Crowds lined up along West 42d Street waiting for Pope John Paul II to return from Giants Stadium through the Lincoln Tunnel. As the papal entourage came slowly into view, a buzz of excitement took hold and people began to wave and shout. As the Popemobile passed them, people smiled. The Pope seemed to be smiling, too, and it could have been because a group of diners from Chez Josephine fervently waved their oversize dinner napkins in his direction.  And then, he was gone and everyone stood in silence.  When the diners returned to their meal at Chez Jo, one of them approached Jean-Claude Baker, the proprietor.  ``We're not Catholic,'' she said, ``but we were so moved by the Pope that'' _a pause here _ ``well, may we keep our napkins?''  From Barbara Ball Buff:  I've always known that New York is a city of specialists. Just how special I didn't realize until the other afternoon.  I went to the Upper East Side market across the street from where I live, intending to give a bag of empty bottles and cans to the neighborhood collectors. This time none of them were there and the bottle-recycling machines were out of order. I wound up carrying the bags back across the street; there, I encountered a regular walking along with a large bag bulging with empty bottles. Holding open my bag of a dozen or so plastic bottles, I asked him, ``Would you like these?'''  Without pausing and with only a quick glance into the bag, he replied, ``I don't do that kind.''  After recently viewing the new Jurassic-size refurbishment of the dinosaur exhibition hall at the American Museum of Natural History, Dr. William G.

BILL'S WORLD  By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star  Uncle Sam may run out of money soon. Yes, but the money he'll run out of is what he borrowed because he was out of money.  The U.N. birthday party was called the largest gathering of world leaders in history. By contrast, the recent Clinton-Yeltsin meeting was a gathering of the largest world leaders.  When Boris Yeltsin told the White House press corps, ``You're a disaster,'' the other day, Bill Clinton laughed so hard he cried. But notice he didn't assign FEMA to the case.  People in Quebec, who long have talked of splitting from Canada, vote Monday on it. The separatists' motto: ``If at first you don't secede. . .''  At a separatist rally in Quebec City the other night, people chanted, ``We want a country.'' Aren't pieces of the old Soviet Union, say, for sale?  ``There are no death squads in Cuba,'' Fidel Castro told New Yorkers the other day. Apparently this is what passes for good news there.  No doubt you will always remember exactly where you were and what you were doing when you heard that Pete Wilson had endorsed Bob Dole.  Thanksgiving turkeys this year will cost a bit more than they did last year, officials say. We report this so you may keep abreast.  Strong export demand for U.S. turkeys is keeping prices up, reports say. Is this a global _ or gobble _ economy?  The rocket that blew up just after launch from a NASA facility the other day was worth $20 million, it's reported. Which works out now to about a dollar a piece.  CITY STREETS  SCENE: A theater district boite.  Time: Late Saturday night, during the weekend of the United Nations celebration.  Dramatis personae: Three young male theater types, very likely dancers, discussing rumor and fact.  Fellow one: I heard Yeltsin was at ``Sunset'' tonight.  Fellow two: The Foreign Minister of Egypt and the King of Latvia were at ``Victor/Victoria.''  Fellow three, quietly: I saw my periodontist and his wife in Shubert Alley.  David Snyder, a native New Yorker who has been living in Baltimore, paid a recent return visit. In the lobby of the Empire State Building, a tourist asked him for directions to Madison Avenue. ``That way,'' Snyder said, pointing west. No sooner had the words left his mouth than he realized he had misguided her, but she was swallowed up in the tumult of 34th Street.  Several hours later, as Snyder strolled through Central Park, a vaguely familiar face stared at him steadily, and a voice said icily: ``Thanks a lot!''  You can't hide in New York.  Crowds lined up along West 42d Street waiting for Pope John Paul II to return from Giants Stadium through the Lincoln Tunnel. As the papal entourage came slowly into view, a buzz of excitement took hold and people began to wave and shout. As the Popemobile passed them, people smiled. The Pope seemed to be smiling, too, and it could have been because a group of diners from Chez Josephine fervently waved their oversize dinner napkins in his direction.  And then, he was gone and everyone stood in silence.  When the diners returned to their meal at Chez Jo, one of them approached Jean-Claude Baker, the proprietor.  ``We're not Catholic,'' she said, ``but we were so moved by the Pope that'' _a pause here _ ``well, may we keep our napkins?''  From Barbara Ball Buff:  I've always known that New York is a city of specialists. Just how special I didn't realize until the other afternoon.

HOOTIE AND THE BLOWFISH TAKE A VIEW ON CONTRACT LAW? YES BROWSING FOR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES AMONG THE NEW BOOK RELEASES (ll)  c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  NEW YORK _ It was a packed house Wednesday as 350 students at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University turned up for a class that has an enrollment of 22.  The draw was the panel of guest lecturers, which included Hootie and the Blowfish, the wildly popular rock group.  The four band members had been invited by MichaelReinert, a music industry executive who teaches a class in contract drafting and negotiation in the music industry.  Although the atmosphere during the discussion on the fine points of entertainment contracts was not quite that of the band's sold-out concerts, there was a casual air to the session.  ``Cracked Rear View,'' the band's multiplatinum album, was playing on the sound system as students arrived, and Reinert, a vice president of Polygram Holdings, presented each band member with a T-shirt bearing his name with the title ``Professor.''  But for most of the hour-and-a-half class, Hootie and the Blowfish _ Darius Rucker, Dean Felber, Mark Bryan and Jim (Soni)Sonefeld _ were serious indeed, explaining the business and legal arrangements they had forged since assembling as a band at the University of South Carolina in 1986.  ``The music is why we do it,'' said Rucker, the lead singer and a guitarist. ``But we knew that if we were going to make it, everyone on the business side needed to be taken care of.''  Their attorney, Richard Gusler of Raleigh, N.C., who was also on the panel, said he had initially resisted representing the group. ``They called two times, and I refused to see them because I didn't have time,'' he said. ``Plus, I'd gotten really frustrated with musicians in the past.''  In time he relented. ``The first thing they wanted to talk about was business structure,'' he said. ``They asked really very astute questions concerning business.''  c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  The book circuit seems to produce much speculation these days about presidential politics, perhaps as a result of Colin Powell's recent flirtation with a candidacy on his book tour.  At a lecture Wednesday night in Arlington, Va., LawrenceGrossman, a former president of NBC News and PBS, remarked that during his recent book tour he had harbored some yearning for a vice-presidential nomination. He is the author of ``The Electronic Republic: Reshaping Democracy in the Information Age'' (Viking) and was addressing the Freedom Forum, a foundation devoted to first amendment issues.  ``But unlike Colin Powell, I couldn't get the slightest ground swell,'' he said. Then he added with a broad smile: ``I was really disappointed when he announced today that he's not running, because I think we would have made a great ticket. He's from the Bronx, I'm from Brooklyn. He's black, I'm white. He's Episcopalian and I'm Jewish.''  However, Ben Bradlee, the former executive editor of The Washington Post, who has also been on the road promoting his autobiography, ``A Good Life: Newspapering and Other Adventures'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), was less sanguine about a presidential quest.  At a National Press Club luncheon Tuesday in Washington, Bradlee was asked how many books he would have to sell before considering a run for the presidency.  Without hesitation, he replied, ``There are not enough trees in the forest.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19951109.0521 type=story > <HEADLINE> JAPANESE STOCKS MIXED; BRIGHT SONY EARNINGS OFFSET DOLLAR WOES </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> Tokyo, Nov. 10 (Bloomberg) (BC-JAPAN-STOCKS-BLOOM) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"

"59470"	"he"	"replied"	" Parcells may be in for a surprise. Following the college draft, he announced summer camp would be opening July 14 with the veterans' mandatory mini-camp. When asked if the veterans would get a break before the regular summer workouts, he replied, ``Yeah, about half a day.'' Well, a new agreement with the Players' Association will prevent Parcells from carrying out his plan. Under the new rules, no team can hold even a voluntary mini-camp within 10 days of the official start of training camp. ``It's a mandatory 10-day vacation,'' says NFLPA head Gene Upshaw ... The Patriots' front office is not the only one having power struggles. When the Eagles brought in Dick Daniels in February to head up their football operations, a battle began with college scouting director John Wooten,an ally of head coach Ray Rhodes. Daniels took over the draft, usurped much of Wooten's authority and caused a rift on draft day. He has since fired two area scouts, and word is Wooten is in trouble as well but Rhodes is battling to save him ... Bill Walsh has been heard but not seen since his return to the 49ers in January, and that's the way he intends to keep it. Walsh works in a spartan office on the second floor of the 49ers' complex in Santa Clara, Calif., seldom speaking with anyone but the offensive coaches with whom he meets weekly to discuss the evolution of the West Coast offense. Walsh, who helped perfect that offense, is retooling the 49ers' version for head coach George Seifert and offensive coordinator Marc Trestman as a consultant ... Dallas running back Emmitt Smith is not the only player returning to finish his college degree, although he drew the lion's share of publicity when he graduated from the University of Florida last week, six years after he left Gainesville for the NFL. Among the 400 athletes who have returned to school through the Pro Degree Completion Program of the National Consortium for Academics and Sport is Kansas City linebacker Derrick Thomas,who has been working on a bachelor's degree in criminal justice at Missouri-Kansas City. He is one of seven Chiefs working on their degrees, but Thomas is doing it differently than most: He attends classes in the offseason and during the season. The seven-time Pro Bowler attends practices and meetings, has dinner, then takes an evening class before often returning to Arrowhead Stadium around 10 p.m. to pick up additional film from his coaches ... Baltimore Ravens owner Art Modell has been true to at least a portion of his word. Although he abandoned Cleveland, he said he would leave the Browns' history behind. He has. Two truckloads of the team's memorabilia were moved to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, where they will be stored until Cleveland gets an expansion franchise no later than 1999 ... Raiders owner Al Davis has always believed in No. 1 picks. He has rehabilitated many a failed one in the past, and this year the Raiders have four of the top 11 picks from the 1991 draft, none of whom was originally taken by Oakland. They are Russell Maryland (No. 1),cornerback Bruce Pickens (No. 3) and offensive linemen Charles McRae and Pat Harlow. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"

Times News Service  LEO BURNETT PROMOTES EXECUTIVES  Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago has expanded top management by promoting several executives as a leading creative executive leaves.  James M. Jenness, 50, group president for the Americas, was promoted to the new post of vice chairman and chief operating officer, reporting to William T. Lynch, president and chief executive. When Lynch, 53, was asked whether that made Jenness his heir apparent, he replied, laughing, ``I'm going to be around for a long time.''  Michael B. Conrad, 52, group president and deputy chief creative officer, was also promoted to vice chairman and will share the title of chief creative officer with Richard B. Fizdale, chairman. Fizdale, 56, said he intended to retire at the end of 1997. Conrad also assumes duties as chief creative officer for Burnett's American operations, succeeding Robert H. Welke, 49, who had been executive vice president and chief creative officer of Leo Burnett U.S.A.  The Chicago Tribune reported Friday that Welke was leaving for a senior creative post at Euro RSCG Tatham in Chicago. Mary Baglivo, chief client officer at Euro RSCG Tatham, which is owned by Havas Advertising, said her agency was talking with Welke.  Cheryl R. Berman, 43, executive vice president and group creative director, was promoted to the new post of deputy chief creative officer at Burnett U.S.A., reporting to Conrad. And Linda S. Wolf, 48, executive vice president, client service director and director for business development worldwide, was named president of Burnett U.S.A. and regional managing director for North America, assuming duties from Jenness.  UNIVERSAL STUDIOS NAMES AGENCY  The Universal Studios Recreation Group division of MCA Inc. in Universal City, Calif., has named two units of Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding to handle theme park advertising, an assignment that had been divided for four years between Seiniger Kaufman Advertising in Beverly Hills, Calif., which handled creative duties, and the DDB Needham Los Angeles unit of the Omnicom Group, which handled media. Billings were estimated at more than $20 million.  Jim Yeager, a spokesman for the recreation group, said Foote, Cone in Los Angeles would handle creative and media for the theme park in Universal City and FCB/Leber Katz Partners in New York would handle those tasks for the Orlando, Fla., park. MCA is controlled by Seagram Co. Foote, Cone is owned by True North Communications.  The assignments came after a six-month review that included Seiniger Kaufman, part of the Seiniger Advertising Group, which teamed up with D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles, a unit of the MacManus Group; the New York and Torrance, Calif., offices of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi Advertising Worldwide, a unit of Cordiant PLC; the Los Angeles and New York offices of TBWA Chiat/Day, owned by Omnicom, and the Atlanta and San Francisco offices of J.

Well, Professor, I replied, here's something that trumps your laws. Despite its radical content, it has yet to be enjoined by the Justice Department. It's the First Amendment, which says Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of the press. That includes all the statute books you can carry. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"

They board small and dangerously overcrowded boats hoping to cross the Straits of Gibraltar to the Spanish mainland and gain a foothold in Europe. The Spanish government, prompted by its partners in a Europe of dissolving internal borders, has been doing all it can to seal its southern frontier, but the tide of migrants from African countries is rising at an astounding pace.

SOYBEANS-TRANSPORT (Itacoatiara, Brazil) _ The blazing midday sun dances off the long line of bright gold barges preparing to disgorge their cargo, Asia-bound soybeans, at this tiny but up-to-date Amazon River port.

In the race to get soybeans to the global marketplace, the United States, the longtime champ, is faltering. As they watch competitors like Brazil, Argentina and China invest heavily to reduce shipping time and costs, American farmers say that the river that once helped make United States agriculture the low-price leader is now costing them about $100 million a year in delays. Against objections from environmentalists and some economists, a farmers' group is clamoring for taxpayers to foot at least part of the bill of more than $1 billion to lengthen and upgrade the locks before it is too late.

(NYT27) NEW YORK -- Aug. 11, 2002 -- ECOMMERCE-COLUMN -- A Blockbuster video rental store on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Patrons are being urged to sign up for monthly DVD subscription service with unlimited rentals. Blockbuster's subscription service is in the early stages, although company executives said last week that the effort was proceeding nicely. The service, called DVD Freedom Pass, allows store customers to rent an unlimited number of titles each month for between $20 and $25 a month, depending on the city. Customers may have up to three titles out at any time, and are not assessed late fees. (George M.

China began encouraging cremation decades ago when it became clear that the country could not continue burying people in the shrinking available land of its expanding cities. Today, about 8 million Chinese die each year and the number is creeping higher as the population ages. (R.S.

At top, in foreground, the Lincoln Harbor Yacht Club in Weehawken, N.J., was a coveted place to dock boats. But the ferries' large wakes have sent some boaters elsewhere. Hewing to tight schedules, ferries speed across the water and throw wakes that snap lines, break up docks, throw people across their boats and generally wreak havoc on anyone trying to enjoy a quiet cruise, boaters and marina owners say.

The class is one of a handful in the area teaching parents and infants as young as 6 months old to use rudimentary elements of sign language, though the infants can hear just fine. Experts differ on whether having children learn signs before they can speak is beneficial.

The program pleased Brixton's smokers, and even the police. But it left many residents feeling that their neighborhood had turned into an open-air drug bazaar, where teenagers brazenly smoke on the street and dealers set up shop next to fruit sellers in the market. Although the plan is an acknowledgment that drugs like heroin and cocaine are far more harmful than marijuana, the mixed reviews here raise a host of questions about loosening marijuana laws. The Rev. Chris Andre-Watson, of Brixton Baptist Church, says the experiment has left many ``zombied out.''

NEW YORK _  Dear Diary:  An entrepreneur was hawking a NordicTrack at Broadway and 82nd Street recently. With arms swinging and legs striding, he was demonstrating the machine while shouting its merits.  More surprising, he was offering the usually expensive exercise machine for only $25, delivered! He had many funny lines to attract onlookers. Two people engaged in a bidding war, with the winner claiming it for $40. Not a bad return for the intrepid peddler, considering I had seen that very contraption in the trash a block west earlier in the day.  _ TREY BARLOW  Dear Diary:  My downtown No. 1 train was jampacked. There wasn't even enough room to look down to see whose umbrella was flooding my pumps. At 79th Street the only things moving were the doors. Same for 72nd Street. At 66th, the doors opened to a man desperate to get on the train.  ``Doesn't anyone want to get off here?'' he asked. ``We've got Lincoln Center.'' No takers. ``The Metropolitan Opera.'' Still no takers. ``And the Chagall murals are beautiful,'' he continued. ``Even the station is very nice, no? Well then, inhale everyone. A little more. A lot more.''  And then he got on.  _ MEREDITH HALPERN  Dear Diary:  My nephew, Grice Whitely, and his wife, Erin, had, at one point, four children under the age of 5. They are both quite religious and protective of their children and had forbidden them to watch television except for PBS programs like ``Sesame Street'' and National Geographic specials.  At a family gathering, the children were asked to thank God for all their blessings. The first three children in turn went through litanies thanking God for Mommy, Daddy, Grandma, Grandpa, brothers and sisters. When it was 4-year-old Tyler's turn, he started slowly, trying hard to come up with something original. He thanked God for an uncle and an aunt and then, concluding on a triumphant note, said, ``and thank God for viewers like you.''  _ BUDD HOPKINS  GROWING UP IN NEW YORK  Growing up any place out of New York meant nothing to me  because my Daddy stuck a cigar in his mouth,  viewed the streets of our city and said,  Da woild ends in Hoboken,  like he spoke gospel and we believed him.  We didn't envy the kids on farms or some babbling brook  as we rowed the boat on the lake in Central Park or  ambled in museum halls on a Sunday afternoon.  The Grand Canyon didn't impress me.  I had the shelter of Wall Street that yielded treasures of Chinatown,  reading the translated signs, convinced I could speak Chinese,  if I wanted, or even Italian, munching pizza in Little Italy.  I was a beatnik in the Village, a jazz authority on 52nd Street,  an art critic, a fashion queen, a bargain hunter at Klein's,  a poet on the Square.  I was a New Yorker and the world was mine.  _ CAROL GREENBERG  Agnes Davidson still remembers that when she turned 65 some 20 years ago, she went to City Hall for a reduced-fare transit card. Armed with her pre-present-day MetroCard, she boarded a bus near her home in Greenwich Village expecting that because her hair was not yet gray, the driver would show some surprise.  ``This calls for a celebration, she told him lightheartedly. ``It's the first time I've used it.'' The driver replied matter-of-factly, ``Did you lose the last one?''  Dear Diary:  I had just come out of the Chase Manhattan bank branch next to Yankee Stadium and put the $250 I had withdrawn in the side pocket of my leather jacket. As I sprinted toward my place of employment, I heard people calling, ``Miss, Miss, you dropped your money.'' I came to a halt, turned around and saw my money literally blowing in the wind.  I ran back and started grabbing it out of the air while people around me handed me bills. Moments later I had all my money, scrunched up in my hand. What a relief! A man asked if I got it all and when I said I had, he replied, ``Great.'' Everyone else around was smiling, looking almost as pleased as I was.  _ CHRISTINA FRAGOLA  Dear Diary:  I had just started a walk on the Brooklyn Heights Promenade on a recent warm night when I noticed out of the corner of my eye a guy on a bike weaving left to right behind me, as if on an obstacle course. He rolled by very closely and just as he crossed in front of me, he leaned over and gave me a quick kiss on the cheek. I smiled for the rest of the walk.  _ DIANE TAYLOR  Dear Diary:  On a walk along the Upper West Side, my husband and I witnessed an exchange between a delivery man on a bicycle and an older couple walking together. While riding on the sidewalk, the delivery man yelled to the couple, ``Watch out!''  The startled couple, hearing the warning, turned and said, ``No, you watch out _ you're supposed to be on the road, not the sidewalk!''  The delivery man had barely managed to stop before the light turned red. When it changed to green, he started to make his getaway. With only seconds remaining to express his frustration, the older man raised his left hand and quickly spanked the delivery man's behind. The delivery man, perhaps reflecting on his unusual punishment, proceeded at a much slower pace.  _ DIANE DEMPSEY  WELL-READ  I am going to die someday without having ever tasted  McDonald's Big Mac, 7-Eleven Slurpee, Ben &amp; Jerry's Rocky Road  although I know these words, answer the daily crossword puzzle with them.  I am going to be buried someday without having ever worn  Badgley Mischka beaded chiffon, Bill Blass tweed, Oscar de la Renta silks  although I discern one label from the next in fashion runway photographs.  I am going to be eulogized someday without ever having lived in  Beverly Hills Beaux Arts, Greenwich, Conn., colonial,  Palm Beach tropical hacienda, although I identify one from the other  just from reading home publications.  Information is a wonderful thing.  _ SUSAN ROSENBAUM </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020811.0163 type=story > <HEADLINE> THE GREAT AND HORRIBLE SAINT OF THE GOBI LIVES ON IN A MONGOLIAN </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> SAINSHAND, Mongolia  (BC-MONGOLIA-MUSEUM-1STLD) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"

NEW YORK _  Dear Diary:  Noticing the colorful flowers planted along the Park Avenue divider the other day, I recalled an incident that occurred a number of years ago.  Sophia Loren, then a recent Academy Award winner for ``Two Women,'' her husband, the producer Carlo Ponti, and several others had apparently just come from the Waldorf-Astoria hotel.  I was hurrying uptown on the east side of the avenue. Their party crossed at the intersection and I was not far behind.  All of them had crossed the street except Loren, who had stopped a moment to admire the plantings. That's how I found myself standing next to the world-famous movie star.  ``Ms. Loren,'' I said, ``I hope you won't mind, but from now on I intend to tell all my friends that I was once stranded on an island with you.''  Whipping off her dark glasses and treating me to a smile that could have lighted all of Rome for a month, she replied, ``All right,'' and then, jabbing the glasses in my direction she added, ``Just don't tell Carlo.''  _ HARVARD HOLLENBERG  Dear Diary:  While walking home from dinner one night, a friend and I came upon a small park on Greenwich Avenue. There were lights and cameramen and two people in police uniforms _ obviously actors.  The park was closed for the evening because of the filming. In front of us were two homeless men, both with large, overflowing shopping bags in their hands.  As they approached the park and noticed the ``Closed'' sign, one said to the other, ``You know, they're supposed to give us 24 hours' notice.''  _ KATHY SCHLATTER  Dear Diary:  Whenever I'm in New York, I keep my eyes open for celebrities.  Recently I was in a restaurant and noticed a husky, very athletic-looking man seated at the table behind me. A short time later, two people came over and took his picture. Since this was the day of the New York celebration marking the opening of the National Football League season, I was certain he was some well-known football player, though I didn't know which one. As I was leaving the restaurant, I asked the waiter if he knew who the VIP was.  ``Oh yes,'' he said. ``He's the bus driver for a group of tourists eating here.''  To the tourists who had seen New York traffic, he was indeed a celebrity.  _ BERNARD M. MECHLOWITZ  Dear Diary:  On the path to the exit of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, I noticed a little girl ahead of me, walking with her parents. Her mother seemed to be helping her stay upright. As I moved alongside the family, I saw that the child wasn't sick or handicapped, just very tired after a day at the Harvest Fair. The girl, about 5, was too big to carry easily, and her parents were trying to assure her that their car wasn't far away, even as she seemed about to drop from exhaustion.  I turned to the little girl and said, ``You look like you need an imaginary pony.'' Immediately, a look of understanding crossed her face; she smiled broadly, and to her parents' astonishment, she stood upright and began to trot. As her parents began to laugh with relief, I asked the little girl what she would like to name her pony. She thought for a moment and answered, ``Sally.'' I told her I thought that was a very good pony name.  As we reached the exit, the girl's father asked me if I worked in the field of child psychology. ``No,'' I answered. ``But when my children were young, we often took long walks, and I found that it was often helpful to bring along imaginary ponies for the way back.''  As our paths diverged, I noticed that the little girl had galloped about 30 feet ahead of her parents, happily astride Sally.  _ LYN S. HILL  Dear Diary:  I've seen a young woman sleeping on a bare, stained mattress in my East Village neighborhood for the past month or so. It's on my usual route home from the gym, so I've had a chance to see her open-air accommodations many times. Sometimes food wrapped in napkins and open bottles of water and juice have sat next to the mattress when she was not home.  I assumed that at least some of these were donated by charitable New Yorkers. Recently I saw the mattress transformed into a bed, complete with pillow. It was made more carefully than my own, with a pristine bottom sheet and crisp green pillow case. Whether this was her doing or a generous display of compassion and hospitality, I couldn't be sure. What was most striking was the tiny brown teddy bear resting in the center of the pillow.  _ CAROL FORGET  Dear Diary:  My aunt was recently at her local supermarket deli department in Glen Cove on Long Island to order her usual turkey breast. She overheard the woman next to her ordering a special brand of turkey breast. Curious, she asked the woman if she thought that brand was really so much better.  ``I wouldn't know,'' the woman replied. ``I've never tried it. I buy it for my dog.''  _ AMY ZELENETZ KORNFELD  Dear Diary:  A few years ago, my teenage son and I were returning to Connecticut after dropping off my wife at Kennedy Airport. I suggested we go through the city and said I'd treat him to his favorite dessert at Planet Hollywood. I wasn't sure exactly where it was, so when a cab stopped next to me at a red light, I lowered my window and asked for directions.  The cabby smiled, held out his hand and said, ``Three dollars.''  ``Three dollars,'' I said. ``Is that any way to make a visitor feel welcome?''  Whereupon the rear window of the cab rolled down, and a nicely dressed woman leaned out and yelled, ``Turn right here and take a left on 57th. It'll be on your left.''  I thanked her, smiled at the cabdriver and turned to my son. ``That,'' I said, ``was a New York moment.''  _ GARY MICHAELS  Dear Diary:  On my way home from doing some shopping, I noticed a huge crane in front of a brownstone on my block. Curious, I watched to see what they were doing. A man who was obviously in charge must have thought I was concerned about the crane falling. With a charming smile, he said:  ``You needn't cast your gaze on high.  I will see that you get safely by.''

"127699"	"he"	"replied"	" When the art critic Robert Hughes was asked why it was necessary to look at art in person when one can retrieve images from a data bank, he replied, ``Paintings are things in the physical world, made out of colored mud smeared on a piece of cloth or a piece of board, with a stick with hairs on the end.'' They have a particular relationship to your body, he went on, none of which is conveyed on a computer screen. Jackie Curtis, the drag queen and Andy Warhol superstar, expressed a similar sentiment in a movie when she instructed Candy Darling to ``come down off the trapeze and into the sawdust.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"127917"	"he"	"replied"	" About a month ago, a man walked into the Casting Office, a bar on Cahuenga Boulevard, and lighted up. ``You're not from here, are you?'' the bartender, Jennifer Boyd, recalled asking the man. No, he replied, he was visiting from New York, and was astounded to learn that he had to put his cigarette out. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"128688"	"he"	"replied"	" When his career teacher asked him what he wanted to do, he replied, ``Blow up a building'' _ but only because he had recently seen one being imploded on the news, Lamb said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"128720"	"he"	"replied"	" No, he replied, saying his past remarks had been taken out of context. In this case, LaPierre said, not speaking out while the killer is still on the loose is just being responsible. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"

"130664"	"I"	"replied"	" ``I didn't know that he was such a big deal,'' the young publicist confessed. Oh, yeah, I replied, this is the guy who paved the way for today's multi millionaire class of professional golfers.

"130886"	"he"	"replied"	" A few years back, when Jack Galvin, former supreme allied commander of NATO, brought some high-ranking Russian military men to Wakefield, I asked one why he and his fellow officers so disdained Gorbachev, noting that he had initiated the reforms that brought them freedom. Yes, he replied, but we were once a great power, and now we are not. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"132008"	"he"	"replied"	" But the Yale-educated Epstein also is smart, and showed in his press conference Monday that he's clever, too. When someone suggested skepticism abounded about his qualifications, he replied, ``Do people think I'm too old for the job?'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"132308"	"I"	"replied"	" After thinking about it for a bit, I replied, ``Fifty percent. Maybe 60 percent.'' My reasons for admitting that biography would be considered a failure on the standard grading curve is that people are so skilled at avoiding their own motives and needs, it's presumptuous to imagine that anybody, no matter how many years might be invested in the project, can be pinned down like a butterfly in a display case. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"

"132424"	"he"	"replied"	" ``We want people to know that all that has been said about this place by the Americans is a lie,'' Abbas said. Asked why the Central Intelligence Agency would want to foster the impression that Al Furat was planning to get back into the nuclear weapons business, he replied, ``Because they are very intelligent and they want to fake a story.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"

"132925"	"she"	"replied"	" When a tour patron asked how she'd acquired so much knowledge about geology and whether she had a degree in it, she replied, ``I finished the ninth grade and got a library card.

"133395"	"he"	"replied"	" Author, syndicated columnist and television pundit George Will was slightly more congenial. But when asked for his Christmas letter advice, he replied, ``That's like trying to improve on a train wreck.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"

"133906"	"she"	"replied"	" The first interviewee should be obvious to longtime readers of this space: Rihab Taha, ``Dr. Germs,'' the British-trained biologist who has been running Saddam's anthrax and botulism laboratories for nearly 20 years.

"134266"	"he"	"replied"	" ``It's time for a change,'' Chafee, a moderate, told a radio station in his home state. Asked if he would like to see Lott leave, he replied, ``Yes I would.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"

"135826"	"he"	"replied"	" Gotti was born Irving Lorenzo, but changed his name in homage to John Gotti, the Gambino crime family boss, now dead. One of the favorite stories about Irv Gotti concerns his interview for a job with Def Jam. Asked where he wanted to be in five years, he replied, ``I want to become you, and then destroy you and everyone like you, because you can't know hip-hop better than me.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136028"	"he"	"replied"	" ``There was nothing that I could do. I mean management knew about it. You'd go to them and you'd talk to them and they would say, `We'll look at it.'''

"136029"	"he"	"replied"	" At the plant in Elmira, N.Y., an accountant whose job was being cut was made safety director.

Asked in a sworn deposition to describe his duties, he replied, ``There is nothing written as to what my duties are.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"

"136626"	"he"	"replied"	" Francis O'Reilly, Harris' lawyer, said ``it appears to be a random thing,'' but he would not discuss the case further. When asked why the men had released Lampert, he replied, ``the speculation is they got scared.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"137045"	"he"	"replied"	" Not long ago, I asked the chief financial officer of one such company _ which split its shares repeatedly on the way up _ when it was going to declare a reverse split. Not, he replied, until he saw signs of an upturn in the company's business. He reasoned that if his company did a one-for-10 reverse split without such fundamental good news, the stock would imle`iately decline because it would no longer look so cheap on a price basis. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200302.gz"
"137206"	"they"	"replied"	" ``He turned 5? I don't even know these kids,'' said Bill Dooris, who has been in the Navy for 19 years, looking at a wallet-size picture of his brother's two sons. Pat Dooris, also taken aback by the realization, admitted to his brother that when he told his boys he was going to visit their Uncle Bill, they replied, ``Uncle who?'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200303.gz"
"137212"	"she"	"replied"	" ``Seven times they asked her, and she denied it,'' Smart said. Finally, one of the officers held a poster bearing Elizabeth's photograph next to her face. Asked one more time whether she was Elizabeth, she replied, ``Thou sayest,'' as tears welled in her eyes. The words were Jesus' reply when asked by Pilate if he was king of the Jews. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200303.gz"
"137261"	"he"	"replied"	" A few minutes later, when she pulled into the store's parking lot, she heard an ominous grinding from beneath the car. Two tie rod ends _ the connecting points on the steering linkage that control the direction of the wheels _ had snapped and were dragging on the ground. When she asked the mechanic who rescued her if the car was sound enough to drive home, he replied, ``Not unless you want to die.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200303.gz"
"137477"	"he"	"replied"	" When asked if homosexual people should not have sex, he replied, ``We have laws in states, like the one at the Supreme Court right now ... and they were there for a purpose.''

"137676"	"she"	"replied"	" When the columnist Lloyd Grove of the Washington Post asked Newkirk if she might try to persuade Arafat not to blow up people as well as animals, she replied, ``It's not my business to inject myself into human wars.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200305.gz"
"137824"	"he"	"replied"	" Asked if he had any involvement in the Yale bombing, he replied, ``None whatsoever.'' He said the gunpowder was for his guns, the pipes and drill bits for home repair. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200306.gz"
"137881"	"he"	"replied"	" In subsequent years, he indicated more than once that he would again like to be governor, but the state had changed in ways that he had not, and his political fortunes fell. Despite cancer and a bad heart, he continued to aspire to high office, but when he ran for governor in 1990, he finished last in the Democratic primary. Ever the optimist, when he was asked how he was doing, he replied, ``Ain't no one doing better unless they'rg qnunger.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200306.gz"

Despite cancer and a bad heart, he continued to aspire to high office, but when he ran for governor in 1990, he finished last in the Democratic primary.

"137910"	"he"	"replied"	" Asked if the shooters themselves were not to blame, he replied, ``This is also because of the lack of law.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200306.gz"
"138222"	"he"	"replied"	" Asked if there had been concern that Downing Street was trying to ``beef up'' the document, he replied, ``None at all.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200308.gz"
"138441"	"he"	"replied"	" Bashir said he was glad to have received the training. But when asked about human rights, he replied, ``This is a difficulty. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200310.gz"
"139008"	"he"	"replied"	" ``Did they give more than they would have because of my role? Yes,'' said Tilton, 65, who is known to friends as ``Tony.''

"139302"	"he"	"replied"	" Glaus' agent, Mike Nicotera, said he would not comment on his client's approach toward free agency, but Glaus does not sound eager to test the market this fall. When asked if he would be amenable to signing an extension during the season, he replied, ``Absolutely.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200402.gz"
"139439"	"they"	"replied"	" In the early '70s, Brando biographer-to-be Patricia Bosworth was assigned to write about the National Theatre of the Deaf.

"139815"	"he"	"replied"	" Even more-old-fashioned games like Family Feud expect little more of contestants than that they match the lowest common denominator. When a young man on a recent episode of Feud was asked to name something that women love to do and men hate, he replied, Read. He was deemed correct: at least three people in the audience survey gave the same answer. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"

"140155"	"he"	"replied"	" Asked if the Nuggets could win the new Northwest Division, he replied, Why wouldn't we? Why sell yourself short? I'm not guaranteeing it, if that's what you want me to do.

"142226"	"he"	"replied"	" The decision to support the American-led war against Iraq was one of the most difficult decisions in my life, he said. But I am sure it was the right decision. Asked if he has any regrets over it, he replied, Next question, please. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"142296"	"he"	"replied"	" We have been arresting officials who have been involved in this scam left, right and center, Mashokwe said. Asked how many officials were involved, he replied, It could run into hundreds. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"

"142610"	"he"	"replied"	" When McNeill was asked at the time whether either prisoner had suffered injuries in custody, something described on both death certificates, he replied, presently, I have no indication of that. In a later interview, he said the men had suffered injuries before their arrival at Bagram. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"142803"	"he"	"replied"	" That vote, he replied, was correct because we needed to hold Saddam Hussein accountable for weapons. That's what America believed. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"142888"	"he"	"replied"	" Asked if he felt victimized, he replied, Absolutely, but you know, for God's sake, people make mistakes. I just hope they have made a big mistake. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"143560"	"he"	"replied"	" Asked about his chances, he replied, No way, Jose, adding, It goes by regions, languages. Garcia Marquez is a man of my age -- he has it, so that is it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"143620"	"he"	"replied"	" Toward the end of his Mercury mission, the automatic system that was supposed to control his descent failed, and he had to take control manually. When Cooper, then an Air Force major, was asked by flight controllers if he was in position for firing his retrorockets, he replied, right on the old bazoo. He was hailed for making a bull's-eye landing, 7,000 yards from a waiting aircraft carrier. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"143865"	"he"	"replied"	" Asked whether he felt he had completed all or most of the work he set out to achieve, he replied, the job will never be done. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"144356"	"he"	"replied"	" Most problematic word: Mistake. Asked to name three mistakes he had made, Bush declined to specify a single one. Kerry, just seconds after declaring that the president made a mistake in invading Iraq, was reminded of his famous line about Vietnam and asked if Americans in Iraq are now dying for a mistake. Without hesitation, he replied, No. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"144529"	"they"	"replied"	" Elbaz said that when he asked women what they wanted in their wardrobes, they replied, More jackets. Apparently other designers heard the same thing.

"145687"	"she"	"replied"	" It looked like it was doing something; it was focused on something, Ward says. Whenever it saw me, it probably took on the facial expression I had on because I was dumbfounded. It just watched me as I drove by. Asked if it might have been a bear, she replied, No chance at all. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"145892"	"he"	"replied"	" Rice exhibited as little interest in Scowcroft's opinion as George W. Bush did in his father's.

"146073"	"he"	"replied"	" When someone suggested to Smith that his performance might be legendary here, he replied, If it was, I'm grateful and thankful. He opened the scoring with a 68-yard pass play to Anthony Gonzalez on the first drive of the game. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"146736"	"he"	"replied"	" Asked to look back at his show, he replied, I want readers to know that the business we're in calls for snap judgments, and we often make grievously premature evaluations. What I tried over the years was to be less ideological and more empathic. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"147110"	"he"	"replied"	" Investigators said Walsh denied knowing of or playing a role in the arson, but when asked what would happen if a police dog detected accelerants in his car, he replied, Then I guess you got me. Investigators said that a dog sniffed evidence of accelerants in two Chevrolets owned by Walsh, a dark blue Lumina and a purple Cavalier, and that he could not explain the finding. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"

"147500"	"he"	"replied"	" The governor is already speaking in grandiose slogans that bridge to a national stage, with local facts and figures slipping from instant recall. Education, for example, is the civil rights issue of the century, he said during his recent sit-down at the Globe. He noted that as a nation, 53 percent of education spending is allocated to teaching costs. I don't know the number in Massachusetts, said the governor. Asked a question about spending in the Boston schools, he replied, I don't know the Boston district. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"147514"	"he"	"replied"	" There was one little problem. From the very outset, reputable scholars smelled something fishy about Prospero and his scarith, and when Curzio published his findings in a lavishly illustrated book they went on the attack. Etruscans, according to writers like Pliny and Livy, wrote on bolts of linen, not paper. Curzio was unfazed. The scarith, he replied, showed that the linen books referred to by the ancients were in fact paper made from linen rags. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"147992"	"he"	"replied"	" The guys give me hell for not taking pictures while I was fighting this guy, said one e-mail message, titled just another dull night at work, with a photograph attached of a bound and naked detainee howling with pain, his legs bleeding. To an e-mail message from home about a Take Your Children to Work Day event, he replied, how about send a bastard to hell day? attaching a photograph of a detainee's head bloodied beyond recognition. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"148137"	"I"	"replied"	" Catching a ball at my knees, I replied, Philosophy is the business of providing arguments, and since Jesus did not offer arguments for his positions, he was not a philosopher. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"148246"	"he"	"replied"	" As you can imagine, that airplane has a place in my heart. In the early 1960s, while talking to a Northwest executive about another matter, I mentioned my fondness for his old four-prop Stratocruiser. Everybody loved it, he replied, but even when it took off full, the airline lost money on it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"148468"	"he"	"replied"	" When President Bush was asked last week by The Washington Post why Osama bin Laden had eluded capture, he replied, Because he's hiding.

Even without overturning Roe, however, the new court could change the legal landscape for abortion around the country.

On Wednesday, barring weather delays or a mechanical problem, NASA's long wait will end, and the space shuttle Discovery will roar toward orbit once again. The launching comes two and a half years after the loss of the shuttle Columbia and its crew of seven astronauts. Since then, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has struggled on the one hand to reduce risks like that of the falling debris that doomed the Columbia, and on the other to accept the risks it cannot eliminate.

Bray, some say, is the forefather of a waste-management situation that has spiraled out of control. Ireland's Celtic Tiger economy generated a vast increase in garbage over the last decade. This unpleasantly tangible side effect met with Ireland's inadequate capacity, expensive landfill fees and lax oversight to create a roaring black market in garbage collection. Construction companies and even homeowners paid unscrupulous truckers to cart away rubble and trash.

In recent years Pink and Iggy Pop have sought her out for collaborations, and Peaches seems to have drawn inspiration from both for her slicker, muscular new sound. Language, she argues, is not a problem - or at least it shouldn't be when Snoop Dogg is rapping to the masses about the same body parts, with far less humor and a lot more brutality.

Retired people here keep chickens like other retirees take up woodworking. It's household food, and income, and something to do. Asking Indonesians to give up their chickens is like asking Americans to give up their dogs and cats.

With a change in leadership and a move to the U.S. Custom House in Lower Manhattan in the early 1990s, a new institutional identity was defined. The museum was recast as a broad-spectrum cultural center, designed by Indians for Indians. The concept of art was de-emphasized; objects were presented as spiritually and socially functional, valued more for what they did and the stories they told than for how they looked. Many critics had complaints about the inaugural installations. I did. I was looking for an art museum, and what I found was something different. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz

For the latest photos and graphics from The New York Times, go to www.nytimages.com.  INTERNATIONAL (i code)  MIDEAST (Jerusalem) -- A ledeall. Israel called up a few thousand reservists on Friday, in possible preparation for a more extensive ground operation in southern Lebanon, as its warplanes continued to hit targets there and to drop leaflets warning residents of villages to leave their homes and head northward. Over the last two days, there has been an increase in ground clashes as Israeli troops have moved about a mile or so inside Lebanon to demolish Hezbollah outposts and fortifications. They have encountered fierce resistance. Four Israeli soldiers were killed in battles with Hezbollah guerrillas north of Avivim on Thursday, the Israeli army said. All day Friday, the 10th day of the conflict, Israeli jets continued to drop bombs, hitting Beirut's Shiite districts, the eastern Bekaa Valley and southern Lebanon and striking the Mdeirej bridge on the main Beirut-Damascus highway four more times; it had already been bombed twice. Other deelopments. By Greg Myre and Jad Mouawad.  With photos.  An early lede has moved.  MIDEAST-DIPLO (Washington) -- U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said she would travel to the Middle East on Sunday but dismissed growing pressure for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon. She said she would visit Israel and the Palestinian territories and join Arab officials at an international conference on Lebanon in Rome. Rice told a news conference she hoped her trip would create conditions for a lasting Middle East peace but the diplomatic work would be difficult. (Summary from wires) By Helene Cooper.  MIDEAST-DAMASCUS (Damascus, Syria) -- From the Damascus airport, fleeing people feel they are without a country. By Sabrina Tavernise.  MIDEAST-ARABS (Damascus, Syria) -- Looking at Friday prayers across the region. Despite the official anti-Hezbollah line, various sermons in Egypt, Saudi, Jordan, etc. called for the victory of Hezbollah and Muslims in general. By Neil MacFarquhar.  MIDEAST-CYPRUS (Larnaca, Cyprus) -- Thousands of expatriates arrive from Lebanon with tales to tell. By Renwick McLean.  IRAQ (Baghdad, Iraq) -- Developments, including a report that only 28 people were killed across the country on Friday, a decline from the daily averages. By Paul von Zielbauer.  With  IRAQ-ABUSE (Baghdad, Iraq) -- The scene in the military courtroom in Iraq where Article 32 hearings are being held for Americans accused of crimes against Iraqi civilians. By Paul von Zielbauer.  SOMALIA (Kinshasa, Congo) -- Developments as Ethiopia, defending the interim Somalia government, and Islamists face off over who will rule Somalia. By Jeffrey Gettleman.  PAKISTAN-MEDIA (Islamabad, Pakistan) -- Pakistan, which has liberalized its attitude toward the media, is pressing news organizations not to use gruesome images. By Salman Masood.  RUSSIA-FRAUD (Moscow) -- A former Russian nuclear energy minister who is wanted in the United States on federal conspiracy and money laundering charges was released from prison on bail Friday by Russia's Supreme Court. The former minister, Yevgeny O. Adamov, has been the subject of a long legal tug-of-war between Russia and the United States, which accused him of diverting about $9 million in American aid for nuclear security to shell companies and personal accounts. His release ended for the moment an extended period of incarceration in two countries, but did not appear to end his legal difficulties in Russia, where he has been charged with abuse of office and fraud. The United States also said that its charges against him are still pending. By C.J. Chivers.  INDIA-TERROR (New Delhi, India) -- The police in Mumbai, India's financial capital, announced on Friday the arrests of three men they said were being questioned in connection with last week's serial bombings, but offered no details about the nature of their involvement. Since the July 11 bombings on Mumbai's commuter train line, the police have questioned hundreds of people but today was the first time arrests were made. By Hari Kumar.  CLASSIFIED-BLOGS (Washington) -- A classified intelligence network allows government employees with security clearances to exchange information and observations via their own blogs. Now one employee has been fired, for using her blog to suggest that interrogation techniques used by the CIA against high-value terror suspects amounted to torture. A look into the world of classified blogs, which may be a contradiction in terms. By Mark Mazzetti.  LEAVITT-TAXES (Washington) -- The secretary of health and human services, Mike Leavitt, and some of his family have claimed millions of dollars in tax deductions through a charitable foundation they created that has paid out little in actual charity. Instead, it appears that much of the foundation's money has been invested or diverted to the family's business interests and real estate holdings. By Robert Pear.  NATIONAL GENERAL (a code)  NEW-ORLEANS-POWER (New Orleans) -- To the list of daily aggravations in the new New Orleans, add one that augments the heat, spoils the food, and drains the cash register: power outages. The wind blows and a neighborhood's power goes out. Or it rains and the power goes out somewhere else. Thunder crashes distantly and out goes the power. Ten months after Hurricane Katrina, the city still does not have a reliable electrical system. Hundreds of millions in repairs are still needed on an electrical system devastated by flooding, the local utility is in bankruptcy, and less than half its pre-storm customers have returned. Of those that have, many have endured hot and sleepless nights with no air conditioning. So much for the injury; now comes the insult. Entergy, the power company here, wants to increase its rates 25 percent to help pay for part of what it says is a $718 million shortfall. By Adam Nossiter.  MA-GAYS-MARRIAGE (Boston) -- The lesbian couple who were the lead plaintiffs in the lawsuit that made gay marriage legal have decided to separate. By Katie Zezima.  FINANCIAL (f code)  SEC-MACK (Undated) -- John J. Mack, who now runs Morgan Stanley, testifies before the Securities and Exchange Commission in the investigation into Pequot Capital Management, a prominent hedge fund suspected of insider-trading violations. An SEC investigator, Gary J. Aguirre, told Congress last month that SEC officials gave in to political pressure and stopped his investigation after he tried to take Mack's testimony. By Gretchen Morgenson.  HIDDEN-FEES (Undated) -- When Xavier Gabaix and David Laibson open a hotel room minibar, they see among the tiny liquor bottles and European chocolates a perpetual battle between companies charging hidden fees and the sophisticated consumer trying to avoid them. The two economics professors have looked at how companies hide fees and costs. They found that sophisticated consumers have somehow learned how to game the system by having enough naïve consumers around to subsidize them. The smartest strategy, they say, is for the sophisticated consumer to choose the service with the most hidden charges and highest add-on prices, but then avoid paying those added costs. The weekly Money feature by Damon Darlin.  NOCERA-COLUMN (Undated) -- How a company called BKF Asset Management was decimated by some hedge funds that took control of it in the name of shareholder activism. Mug of John A. Levin, who owned the firm prior to BKF. The weekly column by Joe Nocera.  CHINA-BANK (Beijing) -- China's central bank on Friday tightened lending restrictions on banks for the second time in about a month, as it tries to slow excessive credit and investment growth. By John Lague.  DELL-OUTLOOK (Undated) -- Dell Inc. warned that second-quarter earnings and revenue would fall substantially short of forecasts, blaming what it called aggressive pricing in a slowing market. The warning is latest sign that the PC market, and the tech market as a whole is struggling. By Laurie J. Flynn.  ENRON-BANKERS (Houston) -- Three British bankers facing Enron-related fraud charges must reside in the United States pending trial, a judge ruled. U.S. Magistrate Stephen Smith sided with federal prosecutors in granting a bond that blocks the trio from returning to England and possibly launching another lengthy extradition battle after losing a string of appeals over more than two years. By Kate Murphy.  KOTICK-VIDEO-GAMES (Undated) -- Every four or five years, the video game industry hits a mammoth cyclical downturn as consumers wait for new gaming consoles. Robert Kotick, the chairman and chief executive of Activision since 1991, has experienced four cycles, including the current one. His company, the second-largest public company that publishes video games, has, like its peers, been hammered in the stock market. By weekly Q&amp;A interview, by Matt Richtel.  U.S.-DEBT (Undated) -- Only two years after foreign central banks had become virtually the only net buyer of U.S. Treasury securities -- and thus the financier for U.S. budget deficits -- these banks have turned into net sellers of securities. The Treasury reported this week that foreign central banks were net sellers of Treasuries in May, as they had been in March. But other foreigners -- whose investments presumably reflect a search for profit rather than the central bank's desire to prop up the dollar -- bought a record billion of such securities.

Language, she argues, is not a problem - or at least it shouldn't be when Snoop Dogg is rapping to the masses about the same body parts, with far less humor and a lot more brutality.

Two hours later, the cutter puts down his scissors and reveals his deceptively ornate creation: a snowflake. My friend had perfectly captured the sense of craftsmanship that can be so captivating, so wondrous, and so infuriating about an M. Night film.

CULTURE AND ENTERTAINMENT (e code) LONDON-THEATER (London) -- Ben Brantley offers a Critic's Notebook on new plays in London. MUSEUMS-REINSTALL (Paris) -- Pity the curator in the age of the blockbuster. While art museums are usually rated by the quality of their permanent collections, it is all too often their temporary shows that stir excitement and draw crowds. Not infrequently, a work of art that is barely noticed while on permanent display is suddenly lionized in a short-term exhibition. One answer is to make the permanent collection seem, well, sexier. And to this end, some leading museums of modern and contemporary art are testing a fresh approach: If collections are frequently rearranged, either by bringing works out of storage or by changing the focus of installations, they can acquire something of the buzz of temporary shows.shows.  MUSEUM-ADMISSIONS (Undated) -- A Critic's Notebook by Roberta Smith: In a recent panel discussion, Glenn D. Lowry, director of the Museum of Modern Art, remarked that it is almost a moral duty that museums should be free. Another panelist, Philippe de Montebello, director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, emphatically differed. Noting that people pay huge amounts to money to attend rock concerts and sports events, he asked, What is it about art that it shouldn't be paid for? That excellent question is front and center in New York, now the Met has announced a rise in its suggested admission fee from $15 to $20.  TV-PBS-CENSOR (Undated) -- Elizabeth Jensen writes about a new PBS policy that requires producers to pixelate the mouths of those who use language that is deemed unacceptable, thus making it impossible for viewers to read lips of those using bleeped-out language.  MINA-NOVEL (New York) -- Scottish detective fiction, or Tartan Noir as it's called, with its brooding sensibility, brutal humor and fixation on the nature of guilt and punishment, has more in common with the Russian novel than it does with traditional detective writing. And Denise Mina, author of The Dead Hour, published this month by Little, Brown &amp; Co., is one of a crop of contemporary Scottish writers, like Ian Rankin, Val McDermid, Louise Welsh and Christopher Brookmyre, who have made detective fiction Scotland's best-known literary form. A profile by Dinitia Smith.  TV-CHAPPELLE (Undated) -- A Web site claiming that Dave Chappelle was persuaded to walk away from his Comedy Central show by a group of prominent, wealthy African Americans known as The Dark Crusaders is revealed as a hoax.

CYC-TOUR-DE-FRANCE (Macon, France) -- In cycling, the time trial is known as the race of truth, where each rider goes by himself as fast as he can, with only the clock as an opponent. On Saturday, all eyes will be on the clock as Floyd Landis and the other contenders in the Tour de France battle it out in a 35.3-mile sprint that winds through the French wine country from Le Creusot to Montceau-les-Mines. Landis spent much of the last week of the Tour de France predicting that the three-week race would come down to the final time trial. Because the final stage, a 95-mile ride that finishes with eight laps on the Champs-Elysees in Paris, is largely ceremonial until the final circuits, the rider in first place after the time trial is likely to win the Tour de France. Landis has also been saying that if that is the case, he likes his chances. By Edward Wyatt.  GLF-ANDERSON-COLUMN (Hoylake, England) -- Sports of The Times column on the British Open. By Dave Anderson.  GLF-BRITISH-OPEN (Hoylake, England) -- Tiger Woods surged into the lead of the British Open at Royal Liverpool Golf Club on Friday, firing a 7-under-par 65 to hold a one-shot cushion over Ernie Els midway through the tournament. Chris DiMarco stood three shots behind Woods on a warm day on the Wirral Peninsula. Woods holed out for an eagle, his second in as many days, with a 4-iron from the middle of the 14th fairway that bounced three times before smacking the flagstick and disappearing into the hole for a 2. By Damon Hack.  DUKE-LACROSSE (Durham, N.C.) -- Duke University has hired John Danowski from Hofstra to coach its embattled men's lacrosse team, the new coach said Friday. Danowski, whose son Matt is a Duke senior and All-America attackman for the Blue Devils, told The Associated Press that he will replace Mike Pressler, who resigned soon after a woman told police she was raped by three men at a March team party where she was hired to perform as a stripper. A grand jury has indicted three lacrosse players on charges of rape, kidnapping and sexual offense. Defense attorneys have strongly proclaimed the players' innocence. (Summary from wires) By Pete Thamel.  BKO-USA-COACH (Las Vegas) -- Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski has flirted with NBA jobs before, but he always decided to stick with the coach-dominated world of college basketball. But now, USA Basketball has asked Krzyzewski to tackle one of the most difficult pro jobs, turning a bunch of NBA millionaires into a team that can master the international game and win an Olympic gold medal. Krzyzewski begins this job at a USA Basketball training camp in Las Vegas to prepare for next month's world championships in Japan, but his goal is to return the American team to gold medal contender status in 2008 after its embarrassing third-place finish in 2004. By Lynn Zinser.  FBC-AUBURN (Undated) -- Developments in the wake of charges that some members of Auburn's football team were able to sign up for directed study courses where they received high marks but were required to do little work. By Pete Thamel.  BOX-GATTI-BALDOMIR (Hoboken, N.J.) -- Arturo Gatti's penchant for brutal fights has made him a valuable commodity, one of the most popular and resilient boxers of the past decade. One untimely defeat can often derail a boxer's career, but Gatti remains a star despite seven losses, constantly coming back like a boomerang in shorts. Gatti has made 19 appearances on HBO, many of them bloody battles that featured knockdowns, punishment, and furious action that looked more like a bar room brawl than a prize fight. All 12,380 seats have been sold at Atlantic City's Boardwalk Hall for Saturday night's 12-round title fight between Gatti (40-7) and WBC welterweight champion Carlos Baldomir (42-9-6). By Clifton Brown.  RUN-ULTRAMARATHON (Undated) -- Scott Jurek, 32, the pre-eminent American ultramarathoner, will be back in Death Valley on Monday to defend his title in the Badwater Ultramarathon, a race that covers 135 miles over 13,000 vertical feet from Death Valley, Calif., to the base of Mount Whitney.
