OFFSHORE-DRILLING (Washington) _ Sparking instant opposition from President Clinton, a House panel voted Tuesday to lift the 14-year-old moratorium on oil and gas drilling off much of the nation's coastlines. The 7-6 vote has little immediate practical effect, since the provision would have to clear a half-dozen or more additional hurdles before becoming law, and the Interior Department said even then it could be years before drilling is permitted. But with Republicans exercising their majority muscle to reshape government, the action resurrected a controversial debate that pits supporters of the nation's energy industry against environmentalists.

PEACEKEEPERS THREATENED BY BOSNIAN FORCES  SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (HLW) _ After weeks of intense confrontations with separatist Bosnian Serbs, U.N. peacekeepers on Tuesday were threatened by forces of the Muslim-led Bosnian government, which is zealously trying to keep secret the details of its military offensive.  The Bosnian army came close to direct confrontation with Canadian U.N. troops on Tuesday, placing mines outside their camp in the central Bosnian town of Visoko and threatening to shell them if anybody attempted to leave. The mines were removed after almost three hours, U.N. officials said, but more than 600 Canadian soldiers remained confined in the camp by a Bosnian army that has closed off almost the entire area of their current offensive around Sarajevo to U.N. troops.  ``The tone of the Bosnian army has become steadily more threatening and they have now threatened to destroy the camp if anyone tries to leave,'' said Lt. Col. Gary Coward, a U.N. spokesman. ``We are attempting to resolve the situation as quickly as possibile.'' The Bosnian army is intensely sensitive to the possibility that military secrets relating to its current offensive could be revealed by U.N. peacekeepers and it has explained its decision to block the Canadian troops on these grounds. There has been intense fighting near Visoko, where more than 15,000 Bosnian troops massed last week. A main focus of the Bosnian attack appears to be a push south from Visoko toward Ilijas.  IRAN FINDS OIL BUYERS TO REPLACE AMERICAN COMPANIES  VIENNA, Austria (NYT) _ A month after the United States ordered American companies to stop commercial dealings with Iran, Tehran has found other buyers for the 500,000 barrels of oil previously shipped to American clients, oil officials in Vienna say. Officials of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and oil industry executives said that since President Clinton issued his executive order on March 15, independent oil traders and small oil companies have moved in to replace American buyers. Until the order, American companies were permitted to purchase oil in Iran for resale to other countries. The executives also said that large multinational oil companies were actively pursuing major projects to expand Iran's oil industry.  OPEC oil ministers, gathered in Vienna for their semiannual meeting, and industry executives agreed with an assessment by Iran's oil minister. The minister, Gholamreza Agazadeh, said that, on the whole, the American embargo would not deprive Iran of its anticipated $3 billion to $4 billion in yearly revenues and might have failed in another principal objective, to influence Western industrialized nations to curtail economic cooperation with Iran.  Two giant multinational oil companies, Royal Dutch Shell, owned jointly by British and Dutch interests, and the French-based Total, are competing for a billion-dollar project abandoned by the American oil company Conoco Inc. to develop Iranian offshore oil and natural gas fields, according to the Middle East Economic Survey, an oil business newsletter. The development was independently confirmed by several oil industry executives in Vienna.  GROUP CAPT. PETER TOWNSEND, 80, WORLD WAR II FIGHTER PILOT  LONDON (NYT) _ Group Capt. Peter Townsend, the war hero forced 40 years ago by the Royal Family and the British government to end his love affair with Princess Margaret, sister of Queen Elizabeth II, died in Paris on Monday night, the British Embassy said. He was 80, and had been ill for some time. Peter Wooldridge Townsend was born in England in 1914, the son of a lieutenant colonel, and distinguished himself as a pilot in the Royal Air Force before he was 30. He shot down 11 enemy planes and won the Distinguished Service Order and two Distinguished Flying Crosses for gallantry.  He sold his war medals for $35,200 and set up a fund for children who have suffered in war. After the war, he worked in a variety of jobs in the households of Princess Margaret's father, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II.  In 1959, Townsend married Marie Luce Jamagne, a Belgian woman said to bear a strong resemblance to Princess Margaret. The next year, Princess Margaret married the society photographer Anthony Armstrong-Jones, later Lord Snowdon, with whom she had two children. Princess Margaret's marriage to Snowdon ended in divorce. In later years, Townsend had a varied career as a wine buyer, a U.N. adviser, and the author of six books. He lived for many years in St. Leger-en-Yvelines, outside Paris, and is survived by his wife and four children.  VATICAN TO OPPOSE DOCUMENT ON WOMEN AT U.N. CONFERENCE  ROME (NYT) _ A year after its bruising battle over the abortion issue at the U.N. population conference in Cairo, the Roman Catholic Church is gearing up again, this time to defend motherhood at the U.N. conference on women. Without identifying its foes by name, the Vatican clearly considers itself at odds with a strain of Western feminism that it asserts has imposed its views on the draft document prepared for the conference, to be held in September in Beijing.  ``In this document, the Holy See sees pressure of an ideological nature, which seems to want to impose on women of the entire world a particular social philosophy, belonging to certain sectors within Western countries,'' said Joaquin Navarro-Valls, the Vatican's chief spokesman, at a news conference on Tuesday.  The Vatican announced Tuesday that its 20-member delegation at Beijing would be headed by a woman, as yet unnamed, who would marshal the forces of the church to defend the notion that women are equal to, but different from, men. In particular, the Vatican objects to the short shrift given by the document to mothers and maternity _ mentioned only 10 times in the conference's 120-page draft document, compared with some 100 references to sex and sexuality, and 300 references to gender.  MEXICAN JUDGE FOUND DEAD  MEXICO CITY (NYT) _ A Mexico City judge who had called President Ernesto Zedillo's promises of judicial reform into question by complaining publicly that he was pressured to order the illegal arrests of leftist union leaders was found dead here on Tuesday. City officials said they were still trying to determine whether the judge, Abraham Polo Uscanga, had been slain or had committed suicide. His body was discovered on Tuesday morning in an office used by his son, but Polo's wife said his life had been threatened and she had reported him missing on Monday afternoon.  Either way, the 58-year-old justice apparently became the third mysterious victim in a political struggle that began when the city government moved to break the union that had controlled much of the city's bus service for the past two decades.  Late Sunday night, a young government prosecutor charged with building a case against a dozen leaders of the union who have been jailed on corruption charges was shot to death by unidentified gunmen as he drove into the carport of his home. Two months earlier, Mexico City's transportation secretary, the official who planned the operation to break the union's hold on municipal bus service, died of two gunshot wounds to the chest in what the authorities ruled a suicide. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950620.0394 type=story > <HEADLINE> Reviving an Art Deco Gem, With an Emphasis on the Food </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-NATION'S-TABLE-2TAKES-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
