"145561"	"they"	"fornicate"	" The joy of a Mee play -- properly staged -- lies primarily in its characters' philosophizing and the often manic and melodramatic tableaux that spring up throughout a performance. Mee folks tend to fling themselves into whatever passion the occasion calls for. They dash, they fornicate, they kiss, they smear dirt. In A Perfect Wedding, the chase into the woods -- amid a swirl of Donna Marquet's beige-ish curtains -- is a frenzied dash, a kind of dance all by itself. Its parallel in the second act is an Indian wedding dance choreographed, with equal lack of abandon, by Christine Kellogg. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
