NATIONAL  (Coded a)  ONLINE-SCHOOLS (Branson, Colo.) -- With no grocery store or gas station and a population of 77, this desert village seems an unlikely home for a fast growing public school that has enrolled students from all across Colorado. But Branson's school district has 65 students attending its lone brick and mortar school and an additional 1,000 students enrolled in its online affiliate. With the state paying school districts $5,600 per pupil, Branson Online has been a bonanza. Founded in 2001, it has received $15 million so far. The district has used the money to hire everyone in town who wants a job, including the mayor, who teaches 15 students via e-mail. It has broadcast radio commercials statewide to recruit new students and built a new headquarters here. But if the school has been financially successful, its academic record is mixed, and the authorities have put the school on academic probation. Branson Online is one of at least 100 Internet-based public schools that local educators have founded nationwide in recent years, often in partnership with private companies, and many online schools share Branson's strengths and weaknesses, experts said.

CLINTON-FUNDRAISING (Washington) -- In August 2000, Bill and Hillary Clinton attended a Hollywood fund-raiser billed as a tribute to a president ready to leave the White House after eight years and a first lady seeking to establish herself as a force of her own in American politics and government. The guest list reflected the glitter of the occasion: Cher, Diana Ross, Patti Labelle. But perhaps the most memorable person on that list was a well-connected figure with a criminal past who helped organize the event. He is Peter Paul, a man who pleaded guilty to, among other things, cocaine possession and trying to defraud Fidel Castro's government out of millions of dollars in 1979. Paul said he spent nearly $2 million of his own on the fund-raiser as a way to curry favor with the Clintons. But associates of the Clintons say the couple did not know of his checkered past at the time, and now that event has come back to haunt them. By Ian Urbina and Raymond Hernandez.  With a graphic.  BALTIMORE-MURDERS (Baltimore, Md.) -- Outside a Chinese takeout on the East Side here, a cluster of heart-shaped balloons, a street memorial to the dead, tells a depressingly familiar story. Last Wednesday, a 28-year-old man was shot to death as he left the restaurant just before dawn. The block was known for drug dealing, the victim was a convicted drug dealer and the killing was almost certainly drug related, the police said. He committed crimes there, he was killed there, said Matt Jablow, a spokesman for the Police Department. So it goes in the toughest precincts across this city. After falling from a record 353 in 1993, homicides in Baltimore have ticked up since 2002, hitting 278 last year. Last month, the city posted its bloodiest January since 1973, with 32 killings. Once again, Baltimore is flirting with the title of deadliest big city in the nation, recording a homicide rate three times greater than Los Angeles, five times greater than New York. Even as the murder rate has crept back up, officials say, the overall crime rate has steadily fallen. Can a city be safer, yet deadlier, at the same time? City officials say it can. Turf wars have made Baltimore more violent for drug dealers, they assert, but it is freer from crime for the law-abiding majority than it has been in decades. By James Dao.  With photos, NYT24-25.  NY-CHRISTO (New York) -- In 1991 David Yust clocked 22 hours staring at a forest of yellow umbrellas in a valley north of Los Angeles. He spent 13 days in Berlin in 1995 marveling at the aluminum-surfaced fabric that draped the Reichstag, once rising at 2 a.m. for a reverential photo session of the sun rising over the enfolded neo-Renaissance landmark. And next week he plans to photograph a saffron-cloaked Central Park at dawn. Yust, 65, is part of a far-flung group of followers of the artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude, whose latest public art project, The Gates, is scheduled to open along 23 miles of the park's pedestrian walkways on Saturday. These loyal fans plot distant vacations, organize group trips and sometimes abandon jobs to bear witness to the artists' installations. By Jennifer Steinhauer.  With photos.

FINANCIAL  (Coded f)  DELAYED-RETIREMENT (Littleton, Colo.) -- As companies across the country withdraw retiree medical and dental benefits while others switch to less generous retirement plans, many aging workers who had expected to ease comfortably out of the labor force in their 50s and early 60s are discovering that they do not have the financial resources to support themselves in retirement. As a result, a lot more of them are returning to work. Since the mid-1990s, older people have become the fastest-growing portion of the work force. Until recently most economists believed that older people were being lured back into the labor force mostly because of opportunities growing out of the vibrant economy of the 1990s. But they now say that many such Americans are being drawn to work out of necessity rather than choice. As the nation gears up for a fundamental debate over the future of Social Security, these circumstances hint at potential changes in the federal program that supports more than 40 million elderly Americans.

SAIL-MACARTHUR (London) -- After a circumnavigation of the globe lasting 71 days, 14 hours, 18 minutes and 33 seconds, Ellen MacArthur, a 28-year-old Englishwoman, cruised in triumph into Falmouth harbor Tuesday to claim a new record for sailing nonstop and solo around the world. She was welcomed with cheers, royal honors, a flotilla of small boats, fire-barge fountains, live television broadcasts, hoopla, exuberance and, in the British tradition of pooh-poohing success, more than the merest hint of disgruntlement. MacArthur crossed the imaginary finish line between France and England late Tuesday night after a closely followed voyage aboard her 75-foot trimaran B&amp;Q during which she braved storms, 65-mph winds and almost hit a whale.
