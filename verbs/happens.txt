"59220"	"it"	"happens"	" Clearly, some guys are no-hit types. It's no accident that among them, Feller, Koufax and Ryan claim 14 no-hitters (13 no-nos because Feller's third had a little one-run smudge), since men who throw in the mid- to high 90s and also have killer curves can be virtually unhittable on days when both pitches are going exactly where they're supposed to. Some guys weren't, or aren't, no-hit candidates. Bill Lee was a good example, but Bill Lee also threw one of my all-time favorite games when he once beat the Twins by throwing 78 pitches and never reaching a single three-ball count. So what if it was 5-2 and he gave up six hits? Losing skipper Gene Mauch called it a ``stylish game,'' and that said it all. The Bill Lees of the world need those ground balls hit right at people if they're ever going to throw a no-hitter, and every once in a while, it happens, somewhere. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"

"99931"	"it"	"happens"	" Many mutual funds end their fiscal years in October, and the managers of those funds sell off many of their losing bets at the end of October and begin a rash of fresh buying in November.

Arthur and Ford initially land on such a ship, operated by the Vogons, an unpleasant race that constitute the bulk of the galaxy's bureaucracy and come equipped with expansive girths and lumpy porcine faces with smushed-in snouts. Beautifully constructed by the Jim Henson Creature Shop with an attention to expressive detail that recalls the political caricatures of Honore Daumier, the Vogons function as the villains in this tale, though it is a measure of Adams' dry, gentle humor that the creatures' most devastating weapon is their exceptionally bad poetry. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
