Brown Inc. of Bohemia, N.Y., the largest independent test laboratory in the nation, said, ``If you don't meet 2.5 milliohm spec it does not, I repeat, it does not, mean that you won't meet the overall spec'' for EMI safety. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199407.gz"

"15732"	"I"	"repeat"	" Bliley has promised to change the FDA this year in Congress. ``It breaks my heart when I think of American citizens having to go to Switzerland or Mexico to get the drugs or devices they need to stay alive because the Washington bureaucracy won't approve them,'' he said in a speech on Feb. 1. ``And I promise you, this session in the Commerce Committee, there will, I repeat, there will be reforms in the way the Food and Drug Adminstration does business.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199502.gz"

"26873"	"I"	"repeat"	" ``I think we can say that the Budyonnovsk tragedy is the starting point for a new political era,'' Chernomyrdin said. ``We have yet to realize this, but there is one thing I'm absolutely sure of. The Russian state, almost for the first time in its history, I repeat, almost for the first time, put the life of its citizens above any political expediency.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"28911"	"I"	"repeat"	" Today, I repeat, America is in the midst of a needless, manmade depression. It is the business of the warlords and their masters of international high finance to maintain this depression with its want in the midst of plenty, its poverty and its useless, needless idleness. It is their business to keep the minds of our own people concentrated upon these evils until such time as the floodgates of billions of dollars for shells and gas and battleships and instruments of destruction are opened wide. Then will come the long talked of prosperity that has been just around the corner, ever since the last world war. Then the factories will reopen; then the silk shirt era will return. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"36349"	"I"	"repeat"	" A. The price of $487 to install a chimney liner is not exorbitant; in fact it is a pretty good buy. I don't know what a liner that costs $34 is made of, but a quality stainless steel or aluminum liner would cost far more than that. And, installing it could be tricky, particularly if the chimney curves in any way. The liner must be sealed where it comes out of the top of the chimney and where it comes out of the chimney at the bottom. It is really not a do-it-yourself job. You'll have to bite the bullet and come up with the $487 and, I repeat, that sum is not out of line. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"

"44445"	"I"	"repeat"	" ``I would say: Only become an architect if you are totally passionate about it. Who wants to go to work at low pay in mediocre offices?

"62924"	"I"	"repeat"	" With this explanation of how the Court has succeeded in making its analysis seem orthodox and indeed, if intimations are to be believed, even overly generous to VMI I now proceed to describe how the analysis should have been conducted. The question to be answered, I repeat, is whether the exclusion of women from VMI is ``substantially related to an important governmental objective.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199606.gz"

The answer is in the book. The reason I decide to redo the book, and, I repeat, not `Manhunter,' was that the `Red Dragon' character, his reasons for becoming a killer and his love story with Reba was left completely out of `Manhunter.' And that is what in my opinion, with actors like Ralph Fiennes as Red Dragon and Emily Watson as Reba, makes `Red Dragon' unique as a thriller.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"

"137971"	"we"	"repeat"	" A reporter approached Jamie Kennedy, star of the WB's ambush comedy series ``The Jamie Kennedy Experiment,'' at the network's press-tour party and asked him a question about the hidden-camera show genre. Kennedy bolted for refuge in his personal publicist, who informed said reporter that the performer was there ``to have fun'' and !ital!not to interact with the press. At, we repeat, an event staged for the benefit of the press. Seems Kennedy only likes approaching strangers uninvited and giving them a hard time when he's the one doing it. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20030716.0030 type=other > <HEADLINE> KEY RATES </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 07-16-03 17:47:00EDT (BC-KEYRATES-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Here are the key rates for Thursday, July 17, from The New York Times.  -----------------Wednesday------Tuesday----Year Ago  PRIME RATE --------- 4.00 ------ 4.00 ------ 4.75  DISCOUNT RATE ------- 2.00 ------ 2.00 ------ N.A.

"147469"	"I"	"repeat"	" That is definitely not the case with what XM is calling the world's first XM2go receiver (the 2go part, of course, refers to its portability; you do not, I repeat, do not receive free food from McDonald's if you prchase this). The pretzel of wires alone is intimidating, but wait till you see the antennas, the battery, the remote control, the various accessory kits -- for home, auto and body -- and, somewhere in there, the actual receiver; if you give this gear to a small child, there's a very strong possibility that said child will disappear like a bowling ball chucked into quicksand. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"

"160402"	"I"	"repeat"	" As a follow-up to my response to the problem with the serpentine belt on the 2000 GMC Safari, I received a helpful note from Ralph Hoffman. In part, he writes Running only one bearing on an overhung shaft means the bearing wears unduly, and the (idler) pulley cocks due to the sloppy bearing. Pulleys should always have two, I repeat, two bearings, if they are to stay running true. I suspect the mechanic who replaced the belt didn't tug a little on the tensioner pulley, didn't notice it was wiggly, and simply replaced the belt. Excellent suggestion, Ralph, thank you. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"163566"	"I"	"repeat"	" The 18th-century Swiss theologian Johann Casper Lavater wrote of Fuseli: Specters, demons and madmen's phantoms, exterminating angels; murders and acts of violence -- such are his favorite subjects; and yet, I repeat, no one loves with more tenderness. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"164794"	"I"	"repeat"	" Ahhhh ... exhale. Belly-baring shirts are way out. This year, the shirts are hip-length -- even long enough to come over the top of your low-rise jeans. The key to pulling these off is that whatever's underneath cannot, I repeat, cannot be too tight or you risk rollover. Keep the shirt loose -- but not baggy. Since the shirts hit at the hip, they run the risk of accentuating your widest point. Two possible solutions: Wear a shrug, or cropped cardigan, to draw the eye up, or wear a wide belt over the T-shirt at the waist. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164928"	"I"	"repeat"	" Yet Castillo told El Universal last year that even though Chavez was trying to divide church hierarchy through selective favors, he has failed in his attempt, because all of the bishops, I repeat, all of them, are united in the same thinking. In the way we express ourselves there may be diversity, but together we are all in agreement. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
