(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a 150-word sidebar By PATRICIA VOLK c.1994 Family Circle magazine (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Psssst! Come closer. I've got to tell you something. You know that friend of yours who starts sentences with ``You have to swear you won't tell Brenda I told you this because she made me swear not to tell anyone ...'' Well, guess what? If she's telling Brenda's secrets, she's telling yours too.  I once had a friend named Estelle who was a Freudian analyst. Since she spent all day listening to secrets, I assumed she'd be able to keep mine. Then she told one to someone else and I was stung. I asked her about it.  ``I assume anything you tell me isn't a secret or you wouldn't be telling it to me,'' she shrugged. ``I am bound to honor only the confidences of the couch.''  ``Even if I tell you it's a secret?'' I said.  ``If it's a secret, you wouldn't be telling it to me.''  The word secret means different things to different people. Webster's defines a secret as something ``kept from public knowledge or the knowledge of certain persons.'' But to Estelle, a secret was something you couldn't tell a soul. If you told one person, it was no longer a secret.  Whatever definition you use, no one values your secret as much as you do. If you could track the path of Your Big Secret (YBS), it would probably go like this:  You tell YBS to Doreen, asking her please not to tell anyone. Doreen tells YBS only to Fran and Joan, who vaguely know you. Fran and Joan tell YBS to tons of their friends, who don't even know it's a secret. YBS is now PD (Public Domain). WHY FRIENDS BLAB  Some people spill the beans to create a bond, a friendship through secrets. They gain intimacy with one person by trading the secrets of another. It's hard to believe people still do that, but they're out there.  They blab away, convinced that telling somebody's very personal secret empowers and enhances them. They were the honored recipient of The Big News.  Don't they know? All they're really doing is broadcasting ``NOT TO BE TRUSTED! NOT TO BE TRUSTED!'' All they're saying is ``I'm unreliable.''  Another reason people tell secrets is to normalize their lives: When my friend Ellen's marriage fell apart, she told me all the poop about every other marriage she knew that had fallen apart.  Some people have trouble keeping a secret because they don't understand why it's a secret. If you ask Amanda not to tell anyone that your 2-1/2-year-old isn't potty-trained, she might think, ``Big deal. My kids weren't dry till they turned 3!'' Then when Amanda's talking potty-training with someone else, she may not think twice about mentioning Your Big One.  Of course, some secrets are more important than others. Being told about your surprise party in advance isn't nearly as excruciating as having it get around that you were stood up at the altar by your first love.  But if a friend can't keep a small secret, chances are he or she can't keep a big one.  Does that mean the friendship is circling the drain?  Not necessarily. I simply stop relating anything I don't want to get around. If you care about a friendship, why burden it with a secret that might sink it?  Not every friend has to be a great secret keeper. But just because someone can't keep a secret doesn't mean she or he can't be trusted in other areas. I'd be happy letting one of the biggest blabbers I know balance my checkbook. SOMEONE TO TRUST  Where do we get the impulse to reveal a secret if sharing one is so high-risk?  We tell secrets to explore what's troubling us and sometimes to get helpful feedback and maybe even test the reaction to our secret.  It's a relief not to be the only person who experienced something. It can make us feel less alone.  You really need only one person you can trust, someone who considers it a true privilege to hear what's on your mind, a human vault.  Sharing a secret with someone like this can bring the two of you closer together and deepen your relationship. When a friend turns into a trusted adviser, that person takes on a new and splendid worthiness.  For me, that person is my husband. I can tell him anything. I can take it when he leaves his banana peel on the sofa. I can take it when he groans, ``What time is this thing over?'' before we go out. I can even take it when, after 17 years in the same apartment, he asks, ``Where do you keep the can opener?'' But if I couldn't tell him my most private thoughts, it would inflict a mortal wound on our marriage.  Happily, a funny thing happens to secrets. Time defuses them.  A friend of mine meets regularly with a group of 10 women. Every month, over Chinese food, they pick a different topic to discuss. One night they decided to reveal old family secrets they were never supposed to tell:  ``Uncle Joe lost his second mortgage payment at Belmont and had to go to a loan shark.''  ``Aunt Eva got divorced from Uncle George, then married him again.''  As they went around the table, these women laughed at what had once seemed so unspeakable. That's what happens if you're lucky. DEFLECTING SECRETS  An unspoken rule of hearing a secret is that it's the secret teller's prerogative to bring it up again, not yours.  Most people don't like being reminded that they told you their husband was seen having dinner with an old girlfriend _ especially when the marriage is back on track again.  If you confide in me that the police caught your prepubescent son spray-painting stop signs, I won't remind you of it nine years later when he graduates Columbia cum laude.  Some secrets are interesting. Some you can even learn from. But I don't like secrets about people I care about. If you've got something terrible to tell me about my sister, thanks, but no thanks. Luckily, there are good ways to cut secrets off at the pass.  It's becoming fashionable now not to listen to secrets. Try this tactic.  ``Can you keep a secret?''  ``Actually, no.''  When a friend of mine had surgery and wrote about it, another friend who'd had the same procedure wanted to meet her. Should I tell the friend who'd written about it that the woman who was calling her had a mastectomy too?  ``There's something I want to tell you, but I'm not sure I should,'' I said to woman No. 1.  ``Then don't,'' she said.  As much as I love my friends, I seldom tell them anything I don't want blasted to the universe. I learned this at my mother's knee.  ``I haven't told anyone anything I wouldn't want repeated since I was 16,'' my mother, a therapist in Boca Raton, Fla., recently told me.  ``What happened then?''  ``Some girl I told a secret to told it. I was shocked. When somebody told me a secret, I thought it was something holy, a trust. I never met anybody besides your grandmother and Aunt Gertie who felt that way.''  ``Ma! What about me?''  ``Maybe you.''  So before I wrote this, I checked with my mother.  ``Mind if I tell the world how you feel about secrets, Ma?''  Pssst! Come closer. Wanna know what she said? ``Be my guest.'' -0- SIDEBAR: 5 WAYS TO AVOID HEARING SECRETS  When someone tries to tell you something you'd rather not hear, do you feel trapped? Here are five easy, painless ways to steer clear of unwanted secrets.  She/He: Swear on your life you won't tell anyone?  You: No, but I'll swear on your life.  She/He: Can you keep a secret?  You: Not since I left the priesthood.  She/He: Wait till I tell you about Ellen.  You: Mind if I wait forever?  She/He: Did you hear what people are saying about Barbara?  You: You mean that she's so nice that only a jerk would say something bad about her?  She/He: I never told this to anybody before.  You: Why break your record?

Stories are moving in the category shown at the end of each budget item.  Lifestyle, Entertainment  VANDROSS _ undated _ With all of its elegant arrangements and easy-to-remember melodies, it is still hard to detect a pulse in Luther Vandross' latest collection of purported romantic intimacies. (e)  K.T.OSLIN _ undated _ Even when she was all over country charts in the late 1980s, K.T. Oslin was never typically Nashville. (e)  NETWATCH _ undated _ The reds, golds and oranges of autumn are slowly beginning to appear atop the highest Southeastern mountains _ and on the Web. (l)  GLASS _ undated _ Master comedic style follows Ron Glass from `Barney Miller' to `Mr. Rhodes'. (e)  TEEN-VEGETARIANS-2takes _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Meet the ``Meathead.'' Blazing energy and opinions, Jason Anfinsen is the 19-year-old disc jockey at WPBZ-FM 103.1 radio who talks openly about his loves: tofu, soy and Airwalk shoes. ``It's a soy world,'' he said, laughing. He follows a strict vegetarian diet that carries over into his clean, but hip, lifestyle. (l)  STATEFAIR-$ADV05-2takes _ DALLAS _ ``Wow.'' Molly said it, but I was thinking it, as my 5-year-old daughter and I exited Interstate 30 a couple miles east of downtown Dallas and got our first glimpse of the Texas Star Ferris wheel. Though both of us are accustomed to big buildings in big cities, nothing prepared us for this big wheel looming over the horizon, majestic in its regal rotation. Two hundred and twelve feet high, or approximately 20 stories, with 44 caged gondolas carrying more than 260 riders, the Texas Star is the tallest Ferris wheel in the Western Hemisphere. (l)  National  YOUNGBLOOD-OBIT _ undated _ Rufus W. Youngblood Jr. of Savannah, Ga., was a hero on one of the most tragic days in American history, Nov. 22, 1963. He was riding in a motorcade in Dallas with Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, Lady Bird Johnson and Sen. Ralph Yarbrough (D-Texas). Two cars ahead, bullets suddenly struck President John F. Kennedy and Texas Gov. John Connally. (a)  STOCKMAN _ HOUSTON _ A billboard off the highway here reads, ``God Bless You! Congressman Stockman,'' and depending on whom you talk to, freshman Republican Rep. Steve Stockman could use the help. (p)  BREAST-CANCER _ undated _ A cancer screening program for poor, uninsured women will expand to every state, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said Thursday. (a)  ATHEIST _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The estranged son of atheist Madalyn O'Hair has asked Austin police to investigate the disappearance of his mother, half-brother and daughter. (a)  PRODUCE-LABELS _ undated _ The Florida Department of Agriculture has cited more than 265 supermarkets and other retail outlets since January for violating a state law that requires retailers to label foreign-grown produce so consumers will know where it was grown. Florida is the only state in the nation that has this country of origin labeling law. (a)  Business  HI-TECH-HOLSENDOLPH _ ATLANTA _ Call it credibility, trust, maybe just plain identity. Whatever it is, small technology companies seek it, and even the big guys like AT&AMP;T, BellSouth and U S West's MediaOne crave it. The small tech firm wants to be identified with Microsoft. BellSouth and MediaOne each want what the other has. BellSouth wants to be embraced as a dispenser of cable television and home  entertainment. MediaOne wants to be a reliable, trusted telephone company. PART OF SPECIAL PACKAGE ON GEORGIA'S HIGH-TECH COMPANIES  HI-TECH-WIRELESS _ ATLANTA _ They're planning for the air war. The battle for Atlanta's mobile ears _ the people who use phones from cars, on the street, at the ballpark, waiting for seats at the bar _ soon will accelerate from a one-on-one to a five-way free-for-all. At the moment, the players going head to head are BellSouth Mobility and AirTouch, each claiming a slight lead in the market.

"75791"	"he"	"asks"	" Brooklyn's '55 championship ``was very, very big,'' said Zimmer. Yet of the Cubs' division title in '89, he asks, ``How could I have more fun than that?'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"
"76135"	"he"	"asks"	" Nike plans to debut a Jason Kidd apparel line in December. In two weeks, a new television commercial will hit the airwaves promoting his Air Zoom 5 shoe. In it, Kidd is billed as the NBA's triple threat. Shown grabbing a missed shot, Kidd asks, ``Did you know I could rebound?'' Dishing out an assist, he asks, ``Did you know I could pass?'' Shown shooting a jumper that clangs off the rim, the career 38-percent shooter asks, ``Did I tell you about my rebounding?'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"
"76564"	"he"	"asks"	" Washington Post columnist William Raspberry recently asked if someone would explain to him why Simpson's wrongful death trial now under way does not constitute double jeopardy. He wrote that he understands all the business about this being a civil trial, not a criminal trial, and that Simpson cannot lose his freedom or his life in this trial. But Raspberry notes that Simpson is being tried on essentially the same charge that he was found not guilty of committing in a criminal court. Why, he asks, does that not constitute double jeopardy? </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"
"78058"	"she"	"asks"	" Take Company Commander Jacqui Maupin, a seemingly perfect model of the kind of young career officer being produced by the modern Army. At age 28, she is in charge of all military police on this Army base of 20,000 soldiers. Where else, she asks, could a woman of her age have a job with so much responsibility? </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"
"79362"	"he"	"asks"	" That is what he sees when he looks at it, and what he has seen since he was a child carried along by his mother to civil rights demonstrations. If a flag is supposed to be a proud symbol of the people who live under it, he asks, then how can the Confederate flag possibly be such a symbol for black people. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"
"80480"	"he"	"asks"	" In this, he has been politely citing as a most obvious factor the tax-cutting mania so popular with American candidates and voters alike. He is asking community leaders what they intend to do, beyond freezing property taxes, to see that their children can read paragraphs or poems. How well, he asks, will they be able to use their imagination, which, in this poet's outlook and his years of work, is the very taproot of community? </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"
"80972"	"he"	"asks"	" Take Michael Mandel's book, ``The High-Risk Society: Peril &AMP; Promise in the New Economy'' (Times Business, $25). If everybody is so much better off, he asks, why are we so unhappy? Mandel blames it on job insecurity, retirement problems and rapid technological change, components of a ``high-risk society.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"
"84150"	"he"	"asks"	" Russia's advantage, its partisans say, is political. It has made a commitment to capitalism and to democracy. An efficient market system requires both. In particular, Russell argues, a market system requires freedom of information and ideas. How can you expect honest corporate accounting, he asks, in a system where everyone is trained _ and required _ to keep his mouth shut? </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"84529"	"she"	"asks"	" ``Nothing is so much to be shunned as sex relations,'' said St. Augustine, and American psychotherapy has lately taken up his cry, at least in regard to therapists' relations with their patients. Rightly so, says Susan Baur in her new book, ``The Intimate Hour: Love and Sex in Psychotherapy.'' But, she asks, if everyone opposes it, even to the point of making it a crime, ``Why do sexual intimacies continue among persons who say they are against them?'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

"86006"	"he"	"asks"	" Why, he asks, use military helicopters? Why fly 150 miles out to sea? ``Could it be the government was trying to hide evidence of alien tampering? Could the government be retrieving whales that bumped into a UFO?'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"87079"	"he"	"asks"	" Between those laws of God and man, the 50-year-old, deeply religious Moore presides over the fate of those who come before him. He routinely begins jury selection with a prayer led by local preachers, and believes that the basic morality of man's laws are founded on God's laws. How, he asks, can he discard or ignore his faith while he does his job? </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"87597"	"he"	"asks"	" ``Whatever they say about rap, I'm going to counter it,'' he said. The violence, sexual crudity and posturing of rap offend him. Why flog this, he asks, to people who are already suffering? ``Louis Armstrong, who I'm sure knew the foulest language known to man, would never stand in front of an audience and say those things.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"89013"	"he"	"asks"	" His movie tastes are highly eclectic. As a lover of westerns, he is unbounded in his admiration for John Ford and Howard Hawks, and has no intention of challenging them by making a western. As a city boy, he asks, where would he find himself in the picture? </P> "	"nyt_eng_199703.gz"
"90523"	"he"	"asks"	" Amos raps on the table, and when everybody stops talking, he asks, ``Yeah, but I wanna' know how I can be sure.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"

"92822"	"he"	"asks"	" But Dr. Stephen O'Brien, an AIDS researcher at the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, Md., noted that while the virus might be in memory T-cells and macrophages and other body cells, that did not prove that these cells were the source of the virus that sprang back whenever a patient stopped taking AIDS drugs. And so, he asks, ``Where are the engines, where are the factories that are making the virus?'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"92823"	"he"	"asks"	" ``Suppose you consider the human body as the world, the whole ecosystem,'' O'Brien said. ``The AIDS virus comes into all these tissues. The immune system kills it in some tissues, but not in others.'' And as it moves from tissue to tissue, it divides and mutates, creating a path that may be traced back to its origins. Might it be possible, he asks, to reconstruct the virus' evolutionary history _ and find the HIV factory _ within the body by examining the genes of viruses from different tissues? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"95445"	"she"	"asks"	" But Capito, a freshman Republican from West Virginia whose father was once the state's governor, also remembers how she prevailed over a far better financed Democrat in a heavily Democratic state. If the Republican Party had not had the money to run advertisements on her behalf, she asks, could she have ever have succeeded? A day before a pivotal House debate on the campaign finance law, she cannot say how she will vote. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"

"95598"	"she"	"asks"	" How to play: One player is the sculptor. She goes from player to player, taking each by the hand and spinning them on the lawn or mat surface. As the sculptor spins, she asks, ``Coffee, tea or milk?'' If the spinee says ``coffee,'' that means she wants to be spun at the maximum speed. Tea is medium speed and milk is the slowest. Then the sculptor flings the spinee loose and they have to freeze into some weird statue position. After spinning and ``sculpting'' all the players, the sculptor goes from statue to statue, trying to make them laugh without touching them or yelling in their ears. The last one to hold their position _ and hold out on laughing _ is the winner. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"
"96728"	"he"	"asks"	" ``This case poses the issue of whether foreign governments can use U.S. courts to restrict speech,'' Vanderet said. Could a Cuban court, he asks, silence U.S. radio stations spouting anti-Castro slogans? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"

"97161"	"he"	"asks"	" The company's founder, David Yang, is one of the most successful Internet technology entrepreneurs in Russia, and he runs the show in Moscow. Yang, 32, a Chinese-Armenian who started a software concern, Abbyy, in 1989 and graduated from the Moscow Physical Technical Institute in 1992, says the business plan makes perfect sense. Where else but Russia, he asks, can you start a company, hire 80 programmers and designers and produce a prototype for a communication device in less than a year for under $150,000? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"
"98900"	"he"	"asks"	" Chaille's wry commentary about the election process is interspersed with the interviews, which can be both tough and comic. Meeting Jeb Bush, the governor of Florida, he asks, ``Are you jealous of your brother?'' Christie Whitman, then governor of New Jersey, is asked why there aren't more women in the top levels of government. Other candidates are asked to explain the differences between Republicans and Democrats. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"101475"	"he"	"asks"	" The lecturer, as lecturers are wont to do, poses a rhetorical question. Is it possible, he asks, indicating himself, that ``this thing walking back and forth in front of you, talking to you,'' is in fact simply ``a great glob'' of atoms? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"101477"	"he"	"asks"	" In the prepared text, he asks, ``Will we be courageous, unflinching and timely in our actions to develop effective tools to deal with the threat as it exists today? Or will we merely defer to slow-moving multilateral mechanisms that are oblivious to what is happening in the real world?'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"101750"	"he"	"asks"	" That makes Smith suspicious. If the site has no intention of ever using it, he asks, ``Why save the e-mail addresses from a party that's over? Why not just discard them?'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"101752"	"he"	"asks"	" That makes Smith suspicious. If the site has no intention of ever using it, he asks, ``Why save the e-mail addresses from a party that's over? Why not just discard them?'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"

"107706"	"she"	"asks"	" Still, there's too much here that panders to Lewinsky's image-reconstruction project. When a middle-aged man says he's disgusted at being part of this HBO-orchestrated spin, she asks, ``Why did you come here tonight, sir?'' Then a young woman stands and tells her, ``I support you 100 percent and, like, I don't think anyone should judge you.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"110413"	"he"	"asks"	" Sempangi dismisses any talk of shady dealing. He says accounting for all the spending is sometimes as messy as the work itself. Do donors want to know, he asks, that new mattresses had to be discarded because boys had wet them repeatedly? Or that blankets were there one day and gone the next, sometimes sold by the very children he was trying to help? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"110667"	"he"	"asks"	" How, he asks, can downtown be reborn without including the DAC, which lost 11 members in the World Trade Center disaster, two of them stalwarts of his daily basketball dust-ups? Sure, the Heisman ceremony, displaced for the first time in 67 years, went off without a hitch uptown at the Marriott Marquis in December, but it didn't have the same soul. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"115487"	"she"	"asks"	" Every time one 5-year-old girl hears a sad song on the radio, she asks, ``Is that about the World Trade Center?'' Some of Calla's classmates have taken to carrying good luck charms to school, hoping they will ward off the world's evil. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"116287"	"he"	"asks"	" He saves his criticism for so-called independent distributors that won't take chances on adventurous material. What's the point of having indie houses, he asks, when they'll only release the same kinds of movies the studios make? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"117428"	"he"	"asks"	" Hearne native Kent Brunette, who lives in Washington, D.C., orders four or five cases every four to five months. One of Brunette's closest friends visits often from Los Angeles. As soon as Chris Kelley steps inside Brunette's apartment, he asks, ``Can I have a can of Wolf Brand Chili?'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"121427"	"he"	"asks"	" Nickell can just as convincingly give reasons that cereologists are deluding themselves. He tells his side slowly and carefully, as if he's explaining common sense to a 2-year-old. Isn't it convenient, he asks, that the number of crop-circle sightings increases in correlation to media coverage? As for the stamps of approval from scientific journals, the research would be more credible if it were tested against a circle that doesn't have the mark of human intervention, Nickell says. ``Just going out and finding something when you don't have anything to compare it to is not proof of anything.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"122344"	"he"	"asks"	" With such contributors as Christopher Buckley and Merrill Markoe you'd expect this book to be funny. Instead, it's spotty. We didn't laugh out loud until Page 37, when Bob Smith describes trying to remove the plastic wrap from a new CD with his fingernails, his car keys and finally by stabbing it with a steak knife (our standards are not high when we're in the mood to laugh). This is a collection of short rants by 101 ``humorists'' on things that drive them crazy. Some are boringly predictable: cellphones, SUVs, telemarketers, flaccid handshakes. Others show ingenuity but no follow-through -- we laughed more when we saw in the table of contents that Buckley had written about leaf blowers than we did when we read his essay. Others are funny because they're strange. Jay Ruttenberg dislikes olives. Louis Bayard abhors amateur children's choirs. Calvin Trillin hates young millionaires. How old, he asks, should a trophy wife be if the fabulously wealthy businessman is only 27? We laughed out loud over that one, too. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"

"126478"	"he"	"asks"	" Ben throws himself into his commercial real-estate business, taking Joe along as an obliging hostage. Before Elaine's death, the plan was for Joe to go into business with Ben. Now, Joe just can't bring himself to say no. (It's a far-reaching problem.) As for Ben, he asks, ``Are we just going to curl up and die? We had a plan, why not stick with it?'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"133167"	"he"	"asks"	" Why, he asks, did the church, immediately after the war, create the fiction that the wartime Pope Pius XII had consistently condemned the Nazi persecution of the Jews, when, in historical fact, he said little or nothing when that persecution was taking place? Why did the church aid and abet ``the mass murderers of Jews'' as they attempted to escape Allied justice (a reference to the role of high churchmen in helping ex-Nazis escape to South America)? Why, when Hitler died in the ashes of Berlin in 1945, did the German Cardinal Adolf Bertram order that ``a solemn requiem mass be held in commemoration of the Fuehrer''? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"133229"	"he"	"asks"	" Should it be the goal of the government to give families everything they might have had if their loved one had not died, he asks, or should it instead be the goal to try to help, to provide enough money to get them on their feet again? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"

"142223"	"it"	"asks"	" Like Barbershop, it isn't a movie about sticking it to the Man but a cultural discussion, mainly among African-Americans. Which is preferable, it asks, being a basketball star or a doctor? It mocks an African-American race conspiracy theorist, and it has no use for the thug lifestyle. It forms a nostalgic link with The Jeffersons and its cousin Good Times by designating an authoritative matriarchal figure as the movie's moral center and staunch advocate of family values. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"142357"	"she"	"asks"	" Though she proposes a list of changes at the book's end, in hopes of improving the way drug companies operate, her most-repeated suggestion is one of her most persuasive. Why, she asks, should new drugs be tested against placebos, and sometimes tested in such high doses that their effectiveness is guaranteed? Why shouldn't they be tested in equivalent doses against drugs that already exist -- and already work? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"144621"	"he"	"asks"	" NOVEL-LUEDKE (Undated) -- Robert Luedke says he spent most of his first 40 ears wandering in a spiritual desert, looking at the story of Jesus and Christianity as, essentially, a nice myth, nice harmless stories. Why, he asks, should young people have to do the same thing? And why can't they learn about Christianity and still be entertained? No reason at all, says Luedke -- and that's why he spent most of the past two years writing and illustrating Eye Witness: A Fictional Tale of Absolute Truth, which blends science, spiitual awakening, modern Middle East violence and Jesus' trial and crucifiction into a graphic novel.

"145859"	"he"	"asks"	" Moyers isn't just ahead of the curve when it comes to journalism; he creates his own distinctive arc. Consider Consuming Images, a documentary in which he examined the social and psychological impact of mass-market culture in America. Does it matter to us, he asks, that the word citizen is giving way to the word consumer in our society? What happens when the culture of buy-and-sell intrudes into democracy? Do we really want to elect a president the way we shop at the grocery -- choosing between two brands of canned corn? Or do we long for something more. . . . </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"146743"	"she"	"asks"	" The film begins, rather prophetically, with the image of people waving goodbye. Parked on a Portuguese dock, they are waving to passengers on board an unnamed ship, including Rosa Maria and her daughter. The history lesson begins as the ship pulls away, with Maria Joana asking the first in a series of questions befitting a precocious child and a philosophy student. Looking across at their homeland, she asks, What is a myth? After the ship pulls away from Marseille, where a plaque proudly declares the port city the cradle of civilization, she asks, What is a legend? And, sometime later, as they stand in the shadow of the Acropolis, Maria Joana wonders, What did people do here? Her mother replies, They worshipped their gods. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"147412"	"he"	"asks"	" To most of the world, a New York City detective is a cynical, sarcastic flatfoot with alimony headaches and a smart mouth -- Crazy don't mean stupid. My ex-wife's living proof. He survives on a strict diet of street-cart coffee and hot dogs and pretzels with mustard. When he gets to the crime scene, he asks, Whatta we got? and when he claps the handcuffs on his suspects or says something clever, two deep metallic sounds ring out: DOYNG-DOYNG! </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"148153"	"he"	"asks"	" Retention generally is not helpful to a kid's progress, he says. Why, he asks, would repeating the same material with the same teacher lead to a different outcome? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"149118"	"she"	"asks"	" Three people were needed to write Boogeyman, a number that makes sense only if one person typed while the other two couriered pages to the studio. One of them did come up with a useful exchange, however. When Tim tells a little girl he finds hidden in his tool shed that counting to five alleviates fears, she asks, What happens when you get to six? That's simple. You hurl candy at the screen and pray no one responsible for this movie gets to make another one. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"
"149850"	"he"	"asks"	" Rudin points out that the country's thriving film industry produces talented directors almost by the week, but says the theatrical environment has simply shrunk to a level that cannot sustain major careers for more than a handful of artists. Noting that there are just 30 or so new productions on Broadway a year, in contrast to several times that many in decades past, he asks, Why would there be a raft of great American directors to choose from today? What would they be directing? It's a terrible shame that we haven't grown a generation who can do this, but the opportunities aren't there anymore. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20050223.0324 type=story > <HEADLINE> A THEATER SEASON OF MEN BEHAVING BADLY </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> NEW YORK </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"

"150332"	"she"	"asks"	" One of the 14 networks that make up Discovery Communications, Animal Planet reaches just under 87 million households in the nation, and since 1998 its annual prime-time rating has increased by 25 percent. If its entertainment and educational programming are sometimes fungible, that's by design. When deciding what projects to develop, Smith says, she asks, first and foremost, is this a great show idea, and is it going to stand out in the marketplace? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"151163"	"she"	"asks"	" Madeleine admires his work, which he pompously suggests reveals the real you that the world doesn't see. Impressed, she asks, Do you really think there is such a me? And of course, they're at it within seconds, and within days, Bickleigh is plotting his wife's murder. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"

"156595"	"he"	"asks"	" Take the Rude Pundit's fantasy of what John Kerry should have said in the presidential debate when Bush accused him of being a liberal. Papa hijacks the Republican language of warrior-strength and makes it grotesque. How do we liberals show we're strong, he asks, and answers firmly: We have to rape Republicans. We have to show them this is what liberals are. Savvy candidates like Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton will benefit, he adds: Then Hillary can say: 'I am not a liberal. Liberals are people who rape Republicans. I have never raped a Republican.' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"156929"	"he"	"asks"	" That is the second problem with Kicked Out: it's unconvincing. On Day 1, when Smith sees storage boxes on his parents' lawn, he asks, What is that out front? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"

"159313"	"he"	"asks"	" James Marcinkowski, a former CIA operations officer, testified before Congress that this unprecedented act would have far-reaching consequences for covert operations around the world. How, he asks, are covert officers supposed to gain the confidence of informants when their own government cannot even guarantee the personal protection of the home team? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
"159739"	"she"	"asks"	" Not good enough. Heaven moves in closer, squats as only kids can and adults are sure they never could, and begins her third degree. With a sideways tip of her head that makes us eyeball to eyeball, she asks, Are you going to take a nap on top of that rug? Vinnie has a rug at kindergarten and sometimes he goes to sleep on it. Vinnie is Heaven's five-year-old brother. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"

"160162"	"she"	"asks"	" But for shoppers such as Evink, for whom understanding is a critical first step to any big purchase, shopping for a new TV is a frustrating pursuit. She has been to six stores, including Best Buy, Circuit City and Ultimate Electronics, and she remains confused about certain key questions. Why, she asks, do LCD sets tend to cost more than plasma TVs of the same size? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"161305"	"he"	"asks"	" Patrons fend for themselves while Mom cooks. A regular named Toshio Fukishimo pulls his bottle off the shelf and shares it with three friends. When a new customer walks in the door, he asks, Toriaezu biru? -- beer for the time being? This is a Kagoshima ritual, Fukishimo explained, to temper the palate for shochu. He fills the mug himself from a tap at the bar. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"

"164808"	"it"	"asks"	" The gospel reads as a sucker punch to the belly of intelligent-design proponents. If there truly is an intelligence behind our universe, it asks, how do we know it's not composed of spaghetti and meatballs? It's a debate, Henderson told Wired magazine, that scientists ignore at their own peril. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"166699"	"it"	"asks"	" Moretti's movie, an expression of outrage, is equally a study in frustration. (It is also, rather remarkably given its charged subject, a gentle and bittersweet comedy.) How, it asks, can you use film to expose a leader about whom everyone seems to know the worst, and whose opponents sometimes seem to lack any program other than loathing him? Berlusconi's career may be, in its details, a uniquely Italian phenomenon, but the implications of The Caiman might nonetheless resonate elsewhere. There is a way of going around politics, of going against judges, courts, and other institutions, that can certainly be found in other countries, Moretti said. He provided no examples. Perhaps he didn't need to. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"

"169217"	"it"	"asks"	" Though most of the cast appears to be on its ninth repeat of 12th grade, Step Up is a likable product that's refreshingly free of vulgarity. What it's really about, of course, is class. Like Save the Last Dance and its predecessors, the movie fashions social equality from big musical numbers. If ballet and hip-hop can coexist, it asks, why can't we all be friends? -- JEANNETTE CATSOULIS </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169276"	"he"	"asks"	" What about the personal computer, advances in medicine, nanotechnology, string theory, the Internet? None get satisfactory treatment here. Bartels, in an interview, pointed out that contemporary science had moved to extremes of scale: the very big and very small, the very fast and very slow. How, he asks, are they to be demonstrated with Exploratorium-style apparatus? And what about contemporary audiences' taste for spectacle? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"174401"	"he"	"asks"	" But Tony Ruscetta of Rehoboth, whose policy with Commerce Insurance renews Jan. 1, said he would prefer to get the rate cut sooner rather than later. What happens, he asks, if the Legislature next year scraps the existing rate-setting system and lets insurers set their own rates? He said a driver would also lose out if he moves or dies before his policy renews in 2008 - or later years if rates keep going down. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
