"15008"	"they"	"watched"	" But try as they might, few Long Islanders -- particularly those from the Garden City area, where many of the victims of the Long Island Rail Road shooting live -- could bring themselves to turn off their sets when Colin Ferguson took center stage.

"110273"	"we"	"watched"	" Waiting our turn for the promised demonstration, we watched, noses pressed to the glass, while dozens of people -- young, old, thin, fat, athletic, uncoordinated -- slipped and slid on the ice under instruction from experts. By the time we headed out ourselves, we had each studied intently, certain we would be able to manage the correct bended position necessary to send the stone flying across the ice. Frankly, I thought to myself with some superiority, it didn't look any different from bowling. How hard could this really be? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"114210"	"they"	"watched"	" We tucked in among the rocky outcroppings along Ram Island's west side. The rocks gathered swirling pools of current perfect for bobbing.

"159314"	"he"	"watched"	" The thing about Chris we have to remember is there's been no forcing him before his time, quarterbacks coach Paul Hackett said. When he was drafted here he sat, he watched, he looked and now he feels really confident. Well, he should. The preparation, the foundation we talk about at the quarterback position has clearly been laid here. A lot of guys don't get that opportunity. The third year is about time you say, Hey, I believe I can do it.'  </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, I guess,	 For somebody who says it doesn't bother him, evidently it has. Indirectly, I guess, something's gotten to him, Johnson said of Stewart's reaction. That's his deal and he's spending some time thinking about it. Last week, the reason we went out to follow him in practice was out of respect for him. He had the best car and we wanted to see how we stood up next to him. And we passed him. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he said,	 Stewart banged fenders with Johnson's No. 48 Chevrolet on the cool-down lap of the Daytona 500 in February, angry, he said, because Johnson had pinched him down into Scott Riggs late in the race. Stewart led 107 of 203 laps but was denied a first Daytona win. Johnson defended his spot vigorously to finish fifth. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz

, he said,	 In October 2002, consultant Joe Johnson reviewed the CDF contract and recommended the county fire district severs ties with CDF. He argued that CDF's rising wages, hours and benefits were out of the fire protection district's control and by dropping CDF and creating its own fire department the district could save about $1 million a year. The county could negotiate directly with a local fire department, he said, instead of paying the wages and overtime negotiated between the state and CDF union. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, she adds,	 God gave me a second chance at life, and I passed it on, she said of her largess toward her assailant. Which should not, she adds, be mistaken for absolution. Now that Cushing has had his day in criminal court -- the four other teenagers in the car received probation for their part in the mayhem, which included buying the turkey with a stolen credit card and leaving the scene without calling 911 or notifying the police -- she and her lawyer are planning to file a civil case in state Supreme Court. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he insisted,	 The next morning he wouldn't let it go. Over Cheerios and cocoa, our son described the man in his nightmare, who sounded remarkably like Mr. Schwab. The man, he insisted, had stood at the foot of his bed, with outreached hands, ready to grab him. Could the vet be right, did our son and dog actually see dead people? And what could we have done to unleash this un-Casper-like assault? Maybe our ghost just didn't like change. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz

, he said,	 Schlesinger said that while insulation qualifies for a credit, a set-back thermostat does not. So buying a thermostat, he said, is worth doing now rather than later. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20051029.0203 type=story > <HEADLINE> FBC-OKLAHOMA-TEX </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> LINCOLN, Neb. </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he said,	 The very first blow was to my face, Paige said, recalling his scuffle with Rikers Island officers while, he said, his hands were cuffed behind his back. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he said,	 He was restrained and his hands were cuffed behind his back, Davis said. But, he said, while riot squad officers dragged him down a hallway, one guard punched him in the face. One guard gave him a parting kick in the temple, Davis said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he added,	 If properly presented and reinforced with training, they do work, said William C. Collins, a lawyer who is an editor of The Correctional Law Reporter, a newsletter. They allow an agency to give their staff a sense of what is appropriate under some circumstances, and what isn't. Blows to the head, he added, pretty much aren't on the list. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he said,	 Long before charges of Quran abuse at Guantanamo Bay were news, Charles Paige, one of the inmates in a lawsuit against New York City over practices in its jails, clashed with guards on Rikers Island after, he said, they mishandled his Islamic books. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he said,	 On Dec. 4, guards ordered a general search in the cellblock. No stranger to incarceration, Paige knew no talking was permitted during the search. But the officer who came to search his cell, he said, stepped on his prayer rug. I informed her she was standing on my rug, Paige, a slight man who weighs less than 130 pounds, recounted in an interview. He said the officer ordered him to be silent. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he said,	 A ward captain told the officer to step off the rug, Paige said. She did, but she began rummaging through his things, and he protested again. Other officers took him out of his cell for an hour until the search was over. When he returned, he said, My cell was tossed. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he said,	 I felt violated, Paige said. He marched out of his cell and started banging on the window of the guard booth. Officers used pepper spray on him, he said, then dragged him, handcuffed and gasping from the spray, to a hallway. One officer punched him in the face while another held him from behind, Paige said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he continued,	 This proposition, he continued, is applicable to other media. If we can figure out a way to improve the quality of ads on television with ads that have real value for end-users, we should do it, he said. While he is watching television, for example, Why do I see women's clothing ads? he said. Why don't I see just men's clothing ads? </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he argues,	 Schmidt addresses those complaints by saying that advertisers are missing the point of Google's new model. It should not matter what Google does with their ads, he argues, as long as the received value, which advertisers can measure, is higher than the price they pay. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, they argued,	 Indeed, such ads shine a spotlight on the compromise that Brin and Page made when they overcame their initial objections to advertising on their service. Text ads, they argued, were not the normal fluff of Madison Avenue, but actual information that was useful to searchers. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he said,	 Pretty close, he said, adding that the car was intended to be genteel, bordering on feminine, while the Ford Fusion was to convey a tough and masculine image. In fact, Mays said, the Milan sends a signal that Mercury is heading in a feminine direction. A brand has to have a gender, he said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, they said,	 It would take the race, of course, the Classic in which Saint Liam, with Jerry Bailey aboard, took Flower Alley to the finish, and came out ahead. It was his last race, according to his owners William and Suzanne Warren, since Saint Liam will be heading to the breeding sheds. His racing career is officially over. Unless Afleet Alex wants to run. Then, they said, that might delay retirement for a few more months. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, you never,	 Football is a very, very special game. When you retire from playing football, you never, ever, ever, ever get to strap the pads back on again. Unlike Michael Jordan, who can retire and unretire, he can go to a gym anywhere in the world and get a game. Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa can go and hit batting practice before a game. There are no old-man leagues, and there are no pickup games at the park for football. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
