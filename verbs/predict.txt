Bush had spoken out on the issue, lobbied senators before the vote and encouraged conservative groups to mobilize grass-roots support.  To the extent that it would further his goal of increasing turnout among Christian conservative voters in November, getting behind the amendment, even if it was not adopted, was good politics for Bush.  But the signals coming from the White House over this fight were not completely consistent. For much of this year, Bush seemed content to avoid the issue. When he did bring it up, he always sought to avoid alienating moderate swing voters who might view the amendment as intolerant.  Even some of the staunchest conservatives, including Lynne Cheney, the wife of the vice president and the mother of an openly gay daughter, expressed qualms about altering the Constitution and taking the decision about how to deal with the issue out of the hands of the states.  Some political analysts said gay marriage is the new abortion, an issue that so energizes social conservatives that Republicans will naturally gravitate toward it, out of conviction as well as a recognition of the opportunity for partisan gain. But for a White House that needs to appeal to the center as well as to its conservative base if Bush is to be re-elected, fighting but not winning may have been the ideal outcome.  -- RICHARD W. STEVENSON  ONCE UPON A TIME  Two prominent lawyer-politicians named John, one from Massachusetts and the other from the Carolinas, seek their party's backing for president in a crowded field. The Southerner proves unexpectedly popular in other parts of the country, but when he fails to sweep the board in his own region, he drops out and runs for vice president instead.  Sound familiar? The year is 1824.  There are more parallels between the country's first John-John combination -- John Quincy Adams and John C. Calhoun -- and this year's Kerry-Edwards ticket. Both Calhoun and Edwards were born in small South Carolina towns and built reputations as persuasive orators; both Kerry and Adams accompanied their diplomat fathers to Europe as children, and struck their contemporaries as cool and cerebral.  Beyond such coincidences, though, the presidential race of 1824 bears little resemblance to today's. To start, the two Johns were not a party's ticket, selected to win over the public. In fact, there was only one national party, the Democratic-Republicans, and all four major presidential candidates were members, three of them sitting Cabinet secretaries. Candidates were nominated state by state -- by the legislatures or by caucuses of congressmen -- not nationally. The vice president was elected separately; after dropping out of the presidential race, Calhoun ran for vice president almost unopposed.  Of the 122 people who have ever received an electoral vote for vice president, 14 have been named John, more than any other -- 15 if you count Jack Kemp. Four have won, most recently John Garner in 1932 and 1936. Three Johns have been president -- the two Adamses and Kennedy -- but there have also been three Williams, and Jameses outnumber them both.  The track record for namesakes, though, augurs less well for this year's pair of Johns. National parties have run only two other same-name tickets, in 1864 (Georges) and 1916 (Charleses). Both challenged incumbents in years when war policy was a chief issue, and both went down to defeat.  Since before Bush became president, the group, the nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization, has taken some tough, very personal shots at him. And Bush has made it clear that he takes those blows, well, personally.  The bitterness reached new heights when Bush turned down the group's offer to address its 95th annual convention held in Philadelphia last week, a standing invitation to sitting presidents that Bush has rejected every year since he was elected.  The White House offered a rote explanation for the snub, scheduling constraints, but made no effort to hide the deeper reason. You've heard the rhetoric and the names they've called me, Bush told reporters.  For Republicans, the bad blood dates back to the 2000 election, when the NAACP's political wing ran television advertisements in Texas suggesting that Bush, then governor, had been insensitive to the murder of a black man by a group of whites. Republicans note that Bush spoke to the group's convention that year, yet they still pilloried him.  More recently, Julian Bond, the NAACP chairman, accused the Republican Party of appealing to the dark underside of American culture and of drawing their most rabid supporters from the Taliban wing of American politics.  Given such nastiness, Bush had every right to avoid the convention, said Armstrong Williams, a conservative black columnist. He contends NAACP leaders have abandoned the group's historic nonpartisanship and become a wing of the Democratic Party, in part to attract money from wealthy Democratic donors. He looks very presidential by not going, Williams said.  NAACP leaders counter that their harsh attacks on the president simply reflect black anger toward his policies on Iraq, the economy and civil rights, particularly the 2000 election. The Bush people confuse criticism with partisanship, Bond said.  He may have a point: Bush won only about 8 percent of the black vote in 2000, and some polls showing him doing worse than that now.  -- JAMES DAO  70, THE NEW MAGIC NUMBER  New national guidelines for cholesterol lowering, published last week, recommended levels that seemed stunningly low.  For people at high risk, the new guidelines said, it is best to try to get LDL cholesterol, which is linked to heart disease, as low as 70 milligrams per deciliter of blood. That means taking statins, the cholesterol lowering drugs, at high doses.  Even then, some people will not be able to reach an LDL of 70. But heart disease experts say that it looks like the lower the level, the better. Some predict that when drug companies develop the medications to do it, high-risk people will be aiming for levels as low as 50. And within a few years, they predict, many people with an average risk of heart disease will start taking statins when they reach middle age, akin to taking aspirin to prevent heart attacks today.  In fact, statins may become as readily available as aspirin. Merck, wants to sell one of its statins, Mevacor, over the counter and hopes to make its case in a public meeting at the Food and Drug Administration within the next 12 months. And, in England, Merck's statin, Zocor, will go on sale over the counter in August.  -- GINA KOLATA  STATE SCANDAL  With stunning allegations about fund-raisers using code words to conceal their schemes and prostitutes to silence their enemies, New Jersey has suddenly replaced Connecticut as home of the nation's most sensational political scandal.  The charges came during the past two weeks in two separate indictments. One alleges that a fund-raiser solicited donations by promising government favors to a man embroiled in a land dispute; the other accuses Charles Kushner, a major Democratic fund-raiser, of trying to embarrass witnesses in a campaign finance investigation by secretly hiring prostitutes to videotape sexual encounters with them.  Both fund-raisers had ties to Gov. James E. McGreevey. Some Republicans hope that he might meet the same fate as John Rowland, who resigned as Connecticut governor amid charges that he accepted gifts from vendors in exchange for state contracts.  But there are profound differences: Unlike Rowland, McGreevey has not been accused of any wrongdoing. Democrats insist that the case will ultimately be revealed to be a politically motivated smear campaign by U.S. Attorney Christopher J. Christie, who is himself a potential Republican candidate for governor in 2005.  -- DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI  ADVANTAGE: HBO  There was little cry of outrage from the offices of broadcast network executives last week, when HBO racked up 124 Emmy nominations, dwarfing the totals of the broadcast networks.  Most of those executives have come to accept that HBO is playing a fundamentally different game. The sole strategy for HBO executives is to put on shows that are good. The networks want to put on shows that work for their target demographic.  So far, for example, HBO has resisted the impulse to put on Sopranos: Miami or Sex and the City S.S.U (for Special Shoes Unit.)  The networks, meanwhile, have resorted to three editions of C.S.I. and four of Law &amp; Order. And many other time slots are now filled with reality shows instead of potentially award-winning comedies or dramas. No Emmy category yet exists for Best Actor in a Reality Series.  Several years ago, network executives did campaign to try to force the Emmy academy to consider HBO with some sort of asterisk, contending that HBO enjoyed advantages in both language and content. The suggestion went nowhere.  More recently network executives have simply conceded that HBO is in a different business: the recognition business. The networks are, of course, in the ratings business.  The Sopranos, which took in 20 Emmy nominations last week, was originally offered to every broadcast network. They all passed.  The commission investigating the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks is expected to release its final report this week, the culmination of a 19-month investigation that has largely rewritten the history of the attacks and made clear just how badly the nation's intelligence and law enforcement agencies failed.  The bipartisan report, which is expected to call for a new Cabinet-level officer to oversee the nation's intelligence community, will be the latest addition to a library of studies that have found that the government's estimated $40 billion annual intelligence budget is poorly spent, with disastrous results for national security.  -- PHILIP SHENON  ECONOMY  When Alan Greenspan makes his semiannual report to Congress on monetary policy Tuesday, he will be talking about an economy very different from the one he described in his previous report on Capitol Hill.  In February, employment was at a virtual standstill, annual inflation was around 2 percent and almost everybody expected the Fed's benchmark interest rate to stay stuck at 1 percent all year. Six months later, inflation is above 3 percent, job growth has gathered steam and the Fed rate is already at 1.25 percent.  The new scenario represents a vindication of sorts for the Fed's strategy of maintaining interest rates at historic lows well into the economic recovery. Wall Street economists had criticized Greenspan in recent months for falling behind the curve of inflation. Yet despite a brief spike earlier in the year driven by the rise in the price of oil, inflation moderated in June, and there are few signs of a rebound. At the same time, the economic expansion, while slowing, is still on track.  -- EDUARDO PORTER </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20040717.0059 type=story > <HEADLINE> TWO BOMBINGS OF IRAQIS LEAVE AT LEAST 6 DEAD </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> BAGHDAD, Iraq </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
