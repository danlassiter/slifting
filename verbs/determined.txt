"12515"	"we"	"determined"	" This case is our second encounter with the ADA's preemption clause. In 1992, in Morales, we confronted detailed Travel Industry Enforcement Guidelines, composed by the National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG). The NAAG guidelines purported to govern, inter alia, the content and format of airline fare advertising. See Morales, 504 U. S., at ------- (slip op., at 15-42) (appendix to Court's opinion setting out NAAG guidelines on air travel industry advertising and marketing practices). Several States had endeavored to enforce the NAAG guidelines, under the States' general consumer protection laws, to stop allegedly deceptive airline advertisements. The States' initiative, we determined, ```relat(ed) to (airline) rates, routes, or services,''' id., at --- (slip op., at 8) (quoting 49 U. S. C. App. s1305(a)(1)); consequently, we held, the fare advertising provisions of the NAAG guidelines were preempted by the ADA. Id., at --- (slip op., at 14). </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"
