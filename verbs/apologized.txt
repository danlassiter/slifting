I run from corner to corner, arm extended as far as it will go, and jumping out of the way of cabs in progress.  Needless to say, this leaves me frustrated and stressed five mornings a week.  On this particular day, with luck and perseverance, I found a cab.  Before I could tell the driver my destination, he said in a stern, accented tone: ``I will only take you to 388 Greenwich Street by way of the FDR Drive.''  How did he know where I was going? And why the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive?  His response: ``I had you twice already and do not want to be told how to drive my cab. We either go my way or the highway!''  Being a frazzled, desperate Upper East Sider, I apologized, and agreed.  This being New York _ he will now be meeting me at my corner every morning! __ Joanne Marco  Paul Jay Edelson was returning from a recent trip to Mexico where he had bought a wooden burro saddle, and was met by curious looks in customs at Kennedy Airport.  After explaining the nature of his strange-looking contrivance, he heard the inevitable question: ``Are there burros in New York?''  To which he gave the inevitable answer: ``Five. Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx. .''  Should New York be the place  Where the world's athletes are sent,  Expect that crossing town  Will become an Olympic event. _ Leon Freilich  On a packed New Jersey Transit train, a passenger passed out. Unable to get to a conductor, a fellow passenger used her cell phone to call 911. Shortly thereafter an announcement was heard over the public address system: ``Will the passenger who passed out please stand up and identify himself to the conductor?'' _ Robert Starkoff  My son was visiting from Texas and wanted to see ``Aida'' at the Metropolitan Opera. Knowing the popularity of the opera, I assumed, and rightly so, that there would be very few seats left at the price we were willing to pay, so I sought out a subscriber who could not go and who was selling his tickets outside in the plaza, a common sight.  I spotted one and started to negotiate for the sale when a man I recognized also approached and started to bid. I said to the potential seller that if he sold to the man the ticket would be resold, because the man was a scalper.  Upon which the man replied: ``I am not scalper. I buy for less than the printed price but never exceed that printed price when I resell. I am an arbitrageur!''  The original seller was not convinced, and I bought the tickets. A grand performance, I may add. _ Al Greenberg  Witnessed by Murray E. Bovarnick during intermission recently at the Metropolitan Opera:  She: ``I never knew you liked opera.''  He: ``Oh, I do. I've been an opera fan for years and years.''  She: ``Do you keep up with the singers and performances and the conductors, and what's going on?''  He (modestly): ``Well, I try to.''  She: ``Well, tell me: Is Pavarotti finished?''  He (promptly): ``No, he's Italian.''  I had been out of touch with an old high school chum for more than 40 years and had recently learned that she lives and teaches high school in Manhattan. After a flurry of e-mail messages, we agreed to meet for lunch in the city on a school holiday. I decided to take the ferry from New Jersey as it would land within walking distance of her home.  As I got off the ferry, I scanned those waiting on the pier for Florence's face, for her wavy hair with the red highlights, for her beautiful, unlined complexion. I recognized no one. No one recognized me.  Deciding she had been delayed, I killed time by buying a return ticket. Returning to the landing area, I noticed I was alone on the dock except for one other person, an older woman looking out over the Hudson.  Then I remembered what I had seen in the mirror that morning. Would anyone recognize me as the slim girl I was 40 years ago? As this stranger was the only other person on the pier, I decided to give it a try.  ``Florence?'' I inquired.  She responded tentatively with my name. At least that had not changed. _ Cynthia Hellerman  Often a stay-over in Manhattan, I do not deviate from my habit of early morning walks. Recently I stopped in front of a grocery store where a young clerk was stacking tomatoes on the street stand. What caught my eye was that he was moving the tomatoes from one box to two piles, one 10 cents a pound more than the other.  Confronted about this, he said over his shoulder, ``The better ones are selected by me.'' When I protested that they came from the same box, he retorted, still over his shoulder: ``So do diamonds, they come from the same field. Different prices.''  With that, I bought two bags of tomatoes, one from each pile. And I must admit, the higher-priced ones tasted better that night. _ Mark Neider  On a recent trip to Florence, Italy, while viewing the back of Michelangelo's sculpture of David, my friend Sandy Tenzer commented on his ``nice tush.''  Our Italian art guide asked what a tush was. We told him that it was a Yiddish word for ``backside.'' He was thrilled to add a new word to his vocabulary, but wanted to be certain that tush was acceptable for him to use with other clients.  We assured him that it was, but our husbands and we could not agree on whether anyone outside the New York area would know its meaning.  Another David admirer overheard our conversation and chimed in, ``I'm from the Midwest, and even I know what a tush is.'' That sealed it for our guide. _ Sandy Furst    </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20021216.0012 type=story > <HEADLINE> IRANIAN REFORMER OPENS DOOR FOR TALKS WITH U.S. </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> TEHRAN, Iran  (BC-IRAN-U.S.-1STLD-WRITE) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"

O'Connor's shadow loomed over the hearings, largely because of her disproportionate influence on the court.
