By DENISE and ALAN FIELDS c.1995 Child magazine (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Today's parents take pride in their ability to find great deals without sacrificing quality. These days, pinching pennies is unavoidable: The estimated cost of a child's first three years of life is a whopping $10,000. And that doesn't include hospital bills or college savings ... Ouch.  But whether you're trying to keep up on clothes for your growing child, furnish a nursery or plan a vacation, here are 35 tips to make it a little easier. -0-  _ 1. CRIB NOTES. Forget the double-drop-side crib. Purchase a single, and place it against a wall. You'll save $50 to $100. Also, choose foam mattresses over coil ones _ not only are they 50 percent cheaper, they're much lighter and make changing sheets easier.  _ 2. BEST BED BETS. Skip the $200-to-$400 kid beds that come with side rails or in fancy shapes such as a race car or doll house. Instead, buy a simple twin mattress for $75 to $125, place it on the floor and surround it with bright pillows and stuffed animals. When your toddler is ready for a bed, consider getting the frame and box spring secondhand.  _ 3. BACK TO BASICS. All a baby needs is a few sets of sheets, bumper pads and a couple of good blankets. Buy these pieces individually for less than half the cost of fancy bedding sets that include dust ruffles, diaper stackers and frivolous pillows.  _ 4. DON'T THINK SMALL. If you shop at a children's-furniture store, you pay as much as twice the amount for the same dressers and bookshelves you can buy at an unfinished-furniture store.  If you want cute decorative features _ animal-shaped drawer pulls, for example _ buy them at a housewares or hardware store and simply screw them in yourself.  _ 5. FILL 'ER UP. Use diaper-wipe and liquid-soap refills to avoid continually paying for packaging.  _ 6. SPORTS-GEAR REPLAYS. Many kids' consignment shops sell ``gently used'' sporting goods at 50 percent or more off the retail price. Some areas even have secondhand sporting-goods stores. For a list of shops in your area, send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the National Association of Thrift Shops, 20331 Mack Ave., Grosse Pointe Woods, Mich. 48236.  _ 7. RECYCLED CYCLES. Look for bike stores that sell reconditioned bikes, and you could save up to 45 percent. But remember to try before you buy.  _ 8. CLASSIC TOYS. It doesn't have to be expensive to be fun. A $4 foam football, a $5 set of stacking cups or a $7 red kickball are kid-pleasers that deliver years of enjoyment.  _ 9. SAVVY SPLURGES. Hit garage sales for extravagances such as fancy doll carriages and train sets. Keep an eye out for bookshelves, kids' clothes and costumes. Caution: Check carefully for loose or missing parts and sharp edges.  _ 10. DON'T FORGET THE LIBRARY. Many public libraries have yearly book sales where you can find fantastic bargains _ hardcover books for as little as a quarter.  _ 11. CDs FOR A SONG. For kids' cassettes, CDs and videotapes, head for used-music shops. They carry Disney, Raffi and other kid favorites at half off the cover price.  Music clubs are sometimes worth the money, but consider the number of items you'll be required to purchase _ and don't forget shipping fees.  _ 12. FREE ADVENTURES. Place your name on mailing lists for local children's museums and nature centers. Many have free, but little-publicized, hikes, craft programs, story hours and other activities.  _ 13. ARTFUL SHOPPING. For large quantities of crayons, markers, stencils, colored paper and stick-on stars at rock-bottom prices, try office-supply superstores such as Office Depot, Office Max and Staples.  _ 14. GO GROUP. For skiing, figure skating, music and other lessons, start your child out with a group session. Only if your kid shows initial interest should you invest in private lessons.  _ 15. CHOOSE COTTON. Think twice before you opt for low-priced polyester playclothes. Although all-cotton clothes cost as much as 20 percent more, they usually hold up through more washings. It pays to invest.  _ 16. BABY SHOWER. Toys `R' Us and some local kid stores offer computerized gift registries where you can log requests for all kinds of baby goods. That way, you don't have to spend money on essentials.  _ 17. DOUBLE DISCOUNT. Parents of twins, speak up! Many stores offer unpublicized discounts to families with multiples. Typically, you buy one item and get a 5 percent to 10 percent discount on the second. A local multiples support group _ ask your hospital or pediatrician for contacts _ can tip you off to willing retailers. Another helpful source: The National Organization of Mothers of Twins at (800) 243-2276.  _ 18. KNOW YOUR SALES. Toys `R' Us has big baby sales in March and April. Most department stores have major baby sales in January.  _ 19. SKIMP WITH SHRIMP. Shrimp cocktails, buffalo wings, quesadillas or similar appetizers are just right for kid-size appetites. These foods are usually less expensive than an adult entree and sometimes cheaper than children's-menu selections.  _ 20. BUY BULK. At wholesale clubs such as Price Club or Sam's, you'll find cases of baby food; gallon drums of peanut butter and grape juice; jumbo boxes of cereal and rice cakes; and huge packages of toilet tissue, all for prices 20 percent to 35 percent below the retail.  _ 21. GROWN-UP GROCERIES. Skip prepackaged kids' meals, such as fish sticks and frozen entrees, which cost up to 20 percent more than non-kiddie versions.  _ 22. KEEP ON CLIPPING. You'll find dozens of coupons for baby food in local newspaper supplements, coupons which can save you big bucks every month.  _ 23. FLY LOW. Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays are the cheapest days to travel by plane.  _ 24. DIAL DIRECT. Forget toll-free hotel-reservation lines. Instead, call directly and haggle for the best price. Don't forget to use discounts for which you are eligible, such as those offered by the American Automobile Association.  _ 25. DOUBLE VISION. When developing vacation photos, always order double prints the first time around. In the end, you'll save 50 percent or more on those extra prints you just have to send to Grandma.  _ 26. MOM'S DAY OFF. Many churches and synagogues offer free baby-sitting services one day a week. Other churches and religious community centers have affordable full-time day-care facilities at rates that are 15 percent to 20 percent lower than the market price.  _ 27. JOIN A BABY-SITTING CO-OP. Seek out a neighborhood or homeowners' association child-care co-op where moms take turns volunteering their services. Or get together with other mothers and start your own service. For every hour of baby-sitting you do, someone you know will baby-sit an hour in return.  _ 28. SHARE SITTERS. Split the cost of child care with another mom and have a baby sitter watch both your children.  _ 29. SMALL DEDUCTIBLES. Several major insurance companies now offer a free car seat to parents who attend a parenting seminar. Check with your insurance company.  _ 30. INSTANT KID-PROOFING. Instead of using a $5 choke tester to gauge whether an object is too small for a baby to handle, drop objects through a toilet-paper tube to test them. Anything that makes it through isn't safe for your child.

By MARY CROWLEY c.1995 McCall's magazine (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  The illness starts with a headache and a high fever. Within days, the blood vessels, intestines and tissue underlying the skin begin to deteriorate. Blood seeps from every orifice. No treatment can stop the disease's insidious course.  These horrific symptoms are the result of infection with ebola _ a virus that raged through a city in Zaire earlier this year, killing 232 of its 296 victims.  With uncanny timing, this tragically real epidemic coincided with the fictitious one featured in ``Outbreak'' (1995), the man-vs.-microbe movie starring Dustin Hoffman.  As terrible as it is, there's little reason to fear ebola on Main Street, U.S.A. Unlike such viruses as influenza, which can spread through droplets in the air, ebola is transmitted only through contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person, says Stephen Morse, an assistant professor of virology at Rockefeller University in New York City.  Even the speed with which it kills _ within a matter of days _ is a blessing of sorts: Victims have very little time to pass on the disease to others. Such a virus would be unlikely to gain a foothold in this country, where hospitals have enough funds for workers to use sterile syringes and to take extra precautions when handling body fluids.  ``In the unlikely event that an isolated case of ebola were to enter the United States, our hospitals would be equipped to care for the patient and still contain the spread of infection,'' says Brian Mahy, director of the Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.  Though the threat of catching ebola is remote, virologists and infectious-disease experts worry that other virulent microbes may indeed be hurtling this way.  For one thing, urbanization is allowing new viruses to emerge. Germs that normally reside in isolated obscurity in such places as the rain forest can become global threats when humans invade their habitat, coming into direct contact with them. And jet travel can disperse newly infected people throughout the world.  Furthermore, familiar infections such as flu can develop new and stronger strains or become more widespread. ``The world of microbes is an unruly one,'' Morse says. ``You always have to be looking over your shoulder.''  Unlike ebola, other serious viruses do pose a threat to Americans right now. Here are some viral dangers you may not be aware of, along with the best strategies for staying healthy. -0- HANTAVIRUS  _ CASES: 113 reported in America; 59 deaths.  The first U.S. strain of hantavirus was identified in the Southwest in 1993. It causes a serious respiratory infection, killing nearly half its victims.  It does not spread from human to human. Rather, it is transmitted by rats and mice, though experts aren't sure how. It may be emitted into the air from their droppings, urine or saliva, and then inhaled into the lungs, where it does its damage. Carrier rodents have now been found in 21 states.  _ HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF: Fortunately, hantavirus is not easy to contract. Only 1 percent to 2 percent of heavily exposed persons such as rodent catchers get infections.  Still, avoiding rodents is the best defense, Mahy says. Mice and rats in the home should be exterminated, and anyone cleaning an area where rodent droppings are present should wear rubber gloves and a face mask. Infested areas should be bleached before and after cleaning. VIRAL HEPATITIS  _ CASES: Nearly 500,000 in America cases each year; 16,500 deaths.  Three types of viral hepatitis _ a form of liver disease _ pose a threat to Americans. What's more, two of these viruses can cause chronic hepatitis _ which, in some people, eventually leads to cirrhosis _ scarring of the liver _ or even to liver cancer.  Hepatitis A, the mildest form, causes a flulike illness and jaundice _ yellowish skin. Transmitted through contaminated food and water, it can strike people who travel to parts of the world where sanitation is poor. Most individuals who live in those areas develop immunity early in life.  Hepatitis B is transmitted through contact with infected bodily fluids. Experts estimate that 5 percent to 10 percent of those who contract the virus go on to develop chronic liver disease.  Hepatitis C, which was identified in 1989, poses the greatest hepatitis threat in this country. It currently affects about 3.5 million Americans, including singer Naomi Judd.  People who come in contact with infected blood, such as laboratory technicians and other health-care workers, are known to be at risk. In about 40 percent of all cases, it's not clear how people catch hepatitis C. The risk of transmitting the virus sexually is unknown at this time, according to the American Liver Foundation.  Most people have no symptoms when they get hepatitis C _ it's usually found during routine blood work. However, more than 70 percent of infected people will develop chronic illness, which can lead to serious liver disease later in life.  _ HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF: Vaccination can prevent hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Practicing safe sex can help you avoid hepatitis B and hepatitis C, according to Mahy. INFLUENZA  _ CASES: About 37 million in America each year; about 20,000 deaths.  Flu is a leading cause of death, especially among the elderly or frail. But even the young and healthy weren't spared in the 1918 pandemic, which took the lives of more than 20 million worldwide. Two other pandemics, in 1957 and 1958, felled 70,000 and 34,000 Americans, respectively.  The CDC tracks flu strains in order to have a protective vaccine ready each year. Nevertheless, researchers believe a new deadly strain could appear at any time, leaving people without an effective vaccine. The CDC is currently developing a plan that would aim for the rapid identification and isolation of flu cases in the event of such a pandemic.  _ HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF: Flu vaccination is strongly recommended for those most at risk of flu or serious complications such as pneumonia: those over 65, sufferers from chronic lung diseases or immunity-weakening conditions such as AIDS or cancer, and health-care or day-care workers.  Remember, though, even if you are not among those most at risk, the vaccine may be beneficial. Anyone can request it from a physician. In addition, some employers make it available to their employees. Frequent hand-washing may also limit exposure to this airborne virus. RABIES  _ CASES: An unprecedented 30,000 Americans had to be vaccinated last year because of possible exposure; untreated, rabies is virtually always fatal.  Rabies, which affects the nervous system, is most commonly passed to humans through the bite of an infected animal.  ``We're having the worst animal epidemic of rabies in history,'' Mahy says. Record numbers of rabid raccoons in the Northeast, skunks in the Midwest and coyotes in Texas are adding to the problem, which is only likely to worsen.  _ HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF: The best defense is to stay away from wild animals, especially those acting peculiar or uncharacteristically friendly, and to make sure your pet's vaccinations are current. If you're bitten by a suspect animal, seek immediate medical attention.

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color close-up slide of Quincy Jones. By DIVINA INFUSINO Distributed by New York Times Special Features  Follow a twisting path. Turn. Then twist again.  Hit a dead end. Back up. Find the right course on the map. Then slowly trudge up the winding, narrow Bel Air, Calif., road until it leads to a mansion with a panoramic view of the city.  The way to Quincy Jones' home serves as a metaphor for his life.  The boy who started out on Chicago's tough South Side went on to work in almost every form of music and with many of the biggest entertainment names of the 20th century, including Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson and Steven Spielberg.  Over the years the successful producer, arranger and composer has been lauded as a musical visionary and derided as a musical sellout. He has fought societal obstacles, rebounded from physical breakdowns, ended three marriages and wrestled internal demons.  All the ups and downs, exhilarating thrills and harsh truths have led him to the place where he is now: on top of the entertainment world.  In March, Jones took home a special Oscar, the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, becoming the first musician to receive the honor. Although he had been recognized previously by numerous international organizations, the Hersholt was probably the most public honor he's received, with Oprah Winfrey according him a lengthy introduction on the Academy Awards broadcast.  It would have been the perfect moment for Jones, 62, to bow into retirement, the applause still ringing in his ears.  But that idea is inconceivable to Jones. When the subject is broached, Jones, who has been sitting calmly in the lower-level billiards room of his home, begins to shift uncomfortably in his chair.  ``I'm not into retirement,'' he says. ``I've seen what happens. I've seen guys just sit around, mumbling, trying to act rich. They don't do anything and their minds begin to atrophy.  ``I want to go out like Picasso. On the day he passed, he painted, drank a bottle of wine, had dinner with his friends and probably made love with his wife. That's how I want to leave, in a flame, still burning.''  And so, at a time when a slower pace might appeal to others, Jones has more irons in the fire than ever.  On Nov. 7 he will release ``Q's Jook Joint,'' the follow-up to his 1989 multiple Grammy Award-winning album ``Back on the Block.''  ``Jook Joint'' features Bono, Ray Charles, Phil Collins, Gloria Estefan, Queen Latifah, Stevie Wonder and many other artists performing a retrospective of songs that Jones has written, arranged or produced during his career.  Music is not the only area in which he is active. With one successful television series to their credit _ ``The Fresh Prince of Bel Air'' _ Jones and his multimedia company QDE recently launched ``In the House,'' starring rapper LL Cool J, as well as a comedy show based on Mad magazine.  If all goes well, Whitney Houston will star in the first film by Jones' company, a remake of ``A Star Is Born.''  Meanwhile, Jones' record label Qwest is preparing for a release by singer Tevin Campbell. And Vibe, the music magazine he founded in 1992, is still going strong.  Jones is very much a driven man _ although no one would guess so on this sunny Saturday afternoon.  Dressed in wide-legged black pants and a Mandarin-style silk shirt, he enters the room like a man of leisure, his publicist at his side.  An aide descends the stairs and quietly places a bowl of fruit and vegetables on the bar, along with some chips. Another attendant serves mineral water and soda. A third awaits guests at the door.  Yet one look around reveals that Jones has earned such luxuries.  Decorating the room like heavy-metal wallpaper are 40 platinum albums for Michael Jackson's ``Thriller,'' which Jones produced and which became the biggest-selling album of all time. There are others for his work on Jackson's ``Bad'' and ``Off the Wall.''  And then there is the display of Grammys.  ``I may have won 26 Grammys, but I lost 50,'' Jones says with a laugh, which means he has been nominated a record 76 times.  Behind the bar hangs a gallery of photographic memories: Jones with director Steven Spielberg, producer George Lucas, author Alice Walker and Michael Jackson on the set of ``The Color Purple'' (1985), which Jones scored and executive produced; Jones and Sidney Poitier in an embrace; and Jones and Cary Grant shaking hands.  There's also a shot of Jones with Marvin Gaye, which prompts Jones to sigh.  ``Whenever anyone asks me who I wished I produced, I always say Whitney Houston and Marvin Gaye,'' he says. ``Marvin and I talked about working together for 17 years. We thought we had all the time in the world,'' Jones says, alluding to the singer's untimely death more than a decade ago.  Jones had his own brush with death, also at an untimely age: 42. He suffered two brain aneurysms and doctors gave him a one in 100 chance for recovery.  ``That will get your attention,'' Jones says.  The illness marked a major turning point in his life. Up until then, Jones had been riding the fast track.  Born in Chicago and reared in Seattle from the age of 10, Jones exhibited musical talent early. He played trumpet, sang gospel, formed a band with his friend Ray Charles and was invited to join Lionel Hampton's band while still a teen-ager.  Instead, Jones attended Boston's Berklee College of Music on scholarship and later worked with jazz greats such as Hampton, Duke Ellington and Count Basie.  By the early '60s, however, Jones had made a foray into pop music. While working as the first African-American vice-president for a major label, Mercury Records, he discovered Lesley Gore and produced her hit ``It's My Party.''  His former jazz compatriots criticized him for sacrificing artistic integrity for success. Although his work with different kinds of music did swell his bank account, Jones says his desire to experiment was motivated by curiosity and a respect for all forms of music as human communication.  ``The corners of music overlap a lot,'' he explains. ``It's the spirit, not the style, that prevails. The overall spirit of someone really believing in what they're doing.''  But when Jones fell ill, something inside shifted.  ``Everything expanded. I started to think on a bigger level,'' he says. ``I've always felt connected to the streets. I've always had a social consciousness.  ``When you come from the South Side of Chicago, it doesn't matter how successful you become. You can't help but have concern for people in trouble.  ``But I realized I couldn't make all those stops to high schools and colleges, giving lectures and workshops. That's why I got interested in technology, so I can have as large a reach as possible.''  Underlying much of Jones' efforts has been the idea of entertainment _ especially music _ as an agent for social change.  ``The element of melody is one of the most powerful forces in the universe. It's something that comes straight from God,'' he effuses, spreading his arms wide.  ``Music is part of the air we breathe. Try to imagine a month without a note of music from anywhere.''  Though Jones has been successful, his single-minded focus on his career took an early toll on his personal life.  ``I am a much better father now that I was years ago,'' says Jones, who has children ranging in age from 2 to 42.  ``I used to feel that as long as my kids were fed, dressed and in school, I was doing my job as a father. It's only now that I realize how much guidance and reassurance children need.''  What about his much-publicized relationships with women? Has he gotten better at balancing work and romance?  ``No, probably not,'' he says, seeming uncomfortable for a moment. ``You try to get a balance on it. But that other thing takes over. If it really came down to it and a significant other said to me, `Well, it's me or that,' `that' would win.''  Jones pauses for a moment, as if surprised by his own admission.  ``It's a strong statement, I know. But it's the truth. I would chose the creativity, the thing I like to do. It got me through all the problems I had when I was young. It leveled off the difficulties I've faced.  ``I could always go into that world. It's where I have run for refuge.''  Fortunately, the essence of that world has not changed substantially over the years.  ``It's stronger than ever,'' Jones says. ``I want to approach everything I do without preconceptions, without a formula.  ``I want to do everything as if it's the first time I've ever done it, as if it will be the last time as well.'' c.1995 Divina Infusino  (Divina Infusino is a California-based free-lance writer.) ------------------------------------------------- (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448, or by fax her at 816-822-1444.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Vanessa Williams in a scene from ``Nothing Lasts Forever.'' By IAN SPELLING Distributed by New York Times Special Features  It's been a long time _ perhaps even as far back as the heyday of Liza Minnelli _ since a female entertainer has been as much of a multimedia threat as Vanessa Williams.  In the past five years the singer-actress has hit the top of the pop music charts with ``Save the Best for Last,'' tackled Broadway to great acclaim in ``Kiss of the Spider Woman'' and appeared in a few highly rated television movies, including ``Stompin' at the Savoy'' (1992).  Now, in addition to a slew of fresh music and TV efforts, Williams, 32, is poised to make her mark in motion pictures. After testing the waters with the little-seen affairs ``Another You'' (1991) and ``Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man'' (1991), she will share the screen with Arnold Schwarzenegger in ``Eraser,'' which is in production.  On this October day Williams is on the phone from the Los Angeles hotel that is her home during the ``Eraser'' shoot. The main topic of discussion, however, is not the feature film but her latest TV project: the four-hour miniseries ``Nothing Lasts Forever.'' Based on Sidney Sheldon's novel of the same name, ``Nothing'' will air Nov. 5 and Nov. 7 on CBS.  The soap opera-ish miniseries stars Williams, Brooke Shields and Gail O'Grady as a trio of roommates and friends who work as resident doctors at Embarcadero Hospital in San Francisco.  ``A lot of things are changed from the book, but my character's essence is pretty much the same,'' says Williams, who plays Kat.  ``Kat has worked her way up into the medical community on her own, but she has problems dealing with a past in which she was abused. It all comes out when she begins to treat a young boy who has been abused by his father. She takes that as her call into battle.''  Kat's dark personal history, in addition to influencing her efforts to help the boy, has an impact on her relationships with men _ particularly Dr. Ken Mallory (Chris Noth), who is out to win her reluctant heart.  The key to making Kat affecting, Williams says, was to modulate the bitch factor.  ``Her nickname is Ice, so she's a tough cookie. It's very easy to play her as completely bitchy, but I wanted to make people feel for her when she reveals that she was abused as a child and that that's why she always feels so vulnerable.  ``That was my biggest task, making her strong while making her past a reality so you don't think she's just evil and mean. I don't want to give too much away, but there's an arc and she goes through a very cathartic experience.''  Working on the miniseries was a nice change of pace for Williams, who had just completed her stint as Broadway's ``Spider Woman'' when filming began.  Though she got along well with all her co-stars, she says she developed a special affinity for Shields, who has spent virtually her entire life in the glare of the media spotlight.  ``I was very impressed with Brooke,'' Williams says. ``To be that down to earth after being a celebrity for so long is amazing, because it would be so easy for her to be a different kind of person than she is.  ``She's very normal and sweet. (Seeing) that was such a refreshing experience.''  Williams also seems to be enjoying the production of ``Eraser,'' in which she plays Lee Cullen, a woman who inadvertently learns too much about some illegal arms trading. Enter Schwarzenegger as John Kruger, aka the Eraser, a federal marshal extraordinaire who eradicates the identities of people in the witness protection system and protects them.  The film _ which is being shot on location in Manhattan and Washington, D.C., as well as Los Angeles _ boasts a $100 million budget, making it the biggest endeavor of Williams' career.  ``At least in a monetary sense,'' she says, laughing. ``It's big, really big. James Caan, James Coburn and Robert Pastorelli are in it with me and Arnold.  ``My role is great because there are a couple of nice acting pieces. It's not just looking good, running, being chased and acting like this damsel in distress.''  While Williams has kept busy on the musical front _ singing ``Colors of the Wind'' on the ``Pocahontas'' movie soundtrack, ``Girl from Ipanema'' on a tribute album to Brazilian composer Antonio Carlos Jobim and ``Under the Same Sun'' for an album celebrating the United Nations' 50th anniversary _ she has not had time to record any of her own material during the past year.  That will soon change, as Williams plans to lay down an album's worth of tracks at a Los Angeles recording studio during breaks in her ``Eraser'' shooting schedule.  ``I won't know what kind of sound I'm going for until I choose the writers I'll work with. I think I want to do more of a mid- to up-tempo album, since `Sweetest Days' was a little more mellow,'' she says, referring to her last album, released in 1994.  ``Hopefully, whatever I do will be out by next July.''  As if Williams doesn't already have enough crammed onto her plate, she also stars in ``Bye Bye Birdie,'' a TV version of the popular stage musical that will air on ABC in December.  ``That was a ball because I got to do my Broadway thing again, but for television, so more people can see it,'' she says of the production, which co-stars Jason Alexander and was choreographed by Ann Reinking.  In 1983 the world seemed ready to sweep Williams under the rug after the great Miss America scandal. She was forced to relinquish her crown after it was revealed that she had posed nude for a photographer. Since then Williams has come a remarkably long way. She attributes her success to perseverance and talent.  ``You can't get anywhere if you have nothing to say and no substance,'' she says. ``That and not giving up, always pursuing my dream, had a lot to do with why I'm where I'm at now.  ``I've prepared to be in this situation my whole life. I always danced, sang, acted and worked hard, and I think my being lent itself to succeeding in the entertainment industry.''  Of all her accomplishments, Williams regards her nine-month stint on Broadway as the Spider Woman _ a role originated by Chita Rivera _ as the highlight of her career. Starring in a show on the Great White Way was the realization of a dream that Williams has pursued since she was a child growing up in Millwood, N.Y.  ``To actually headline on Broadway, have the box office rise so dramatically and get rave reviews from The (New York) Times for your very first show ... That was just a dream come true,'' she says.  Yet as determined as she is to further her career, Williams insists that family comes first. Thus every spare minute is spent with her husband (and manager) Ramon Hervey and their children Melanie, Jillian and Devin.  Juggling her personal and professional obligations isn't easy, she says.  ``I try to bring my family along with me as much as I can and I try to be at home as much as I can.  ``You just make it all work. I wish I had the formula, but there is no formula. It's really all just scheduling.''  Looking down the road, Williams sees greater challenges.  ``I'd love to continue to do great feature films, and originating a Broadway role is my next big goal,'' she says. ``Replacing someone in a show that's already been done is OK, but I want to be the first and to create a role for myself.  ``That'll hopefully come true. So I'd just love to keep doing different things and on a bigger scale.'' c.1995 Ian Spelling  (Ian Spelling is a New York-based free-lance writer.) ------------------------------------------------- (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448, or by fax her at 816-822-1444.)

"62399"	"she"	"painted"	" Thus, Smith's reemergence is a little more cause for excitement than, say, the return of George Michael. Michael was a self-proclaimed indentured servant to a former record company, a martyr. Smith was an exile by choice. Seemingly having had her say, she was raising her children with her husband Fred (Sonic) Smith, ex of the MC5, in a Detroit suburb. She wasn't completely on the mommy track. She wrote, she painted, she learned (rudimentary) guitar from her husband. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199606.gz"

He designed his home and had it built using old ironwood pilings pulled from the Sydney Harbor site where the famous opera house was being built. He sculptured massive pieces resembling the heads on Easter Island. He boasted that he had a collection of the world's dullest books. (I contributed one of my favorites, The Speeches of Enver Hoxha.) He often said he had no time to lose. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
