The NWFL plays full-contact football, and I wasn't sure if we would be knocking into each other that afternoon or just working out. But I cut my long fingernails, just in case, in the interests of safety and common sense. I couldn't bring myself to take out my signature oversized hoop earrings, though. If they got ripped out, I rationalized, it would be my own, vain fault and I would suck it up. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
