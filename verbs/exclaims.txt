"23941"	"she"	"exclaims"	" The big advantage they enjoy is being able to scrap most of Waller's writing. If it were merely overripe, Waller's prose would be bad enough. What makes you reach for an airsickness bag when you read it is the fact that there's hardly room for a love story between the photographer and the farm wife. The real love match is the one between Waller and his protagonist, Robert Kincaid, reverentially referred to by his first and last name. Francesca Johnson, the Italian war bride who's as much a misfit in the Iowa farm town where her husband grew up as Kincaid is in the world, is mostly referred to as just Francesca. Presumably because she's telling the story of the brief, intense affair, we get a lot of rhapsodizing about Kincaid. He's a leopard, a comet, a shaman, godlike. At one point, she exclaims, ``You're so powerful, it's frightening.'' All that's lacking to crown the nonstop celebration of his wonderfulness is the awed Francesca dropping to her knees, exclaiming that she's not worthy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

"41958"	"he"	"exclaims"	" All activity in the Ishmaelite household is now directed toward the physical needs of the holy family. Naturally, Berlioz has a musical set piece for the occasion. The crisis past, the kindly householder assures his guests that ``the children of Ishmael are brothers of those of Israel.'' Then, learning the baby's name, he exclaims, in one of the work's sweetest moments: ``Jesus! What a charming name!'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"

"117573"	"he"	"exclaims"	" That sets up plenty of chances for Rock to riff as an undercover brother who bristles under authority. Rock has a few good lines. (Watching video of his polished twin brother, he exclaims, ``I feel like Michael Jackson looking at old album covers.'') But mostly ``Bad Company'' confirms what has been obvious for a long time -- Rock can't act, much less carry a movie this weak. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"128761"	"he"	"exclaims"	" ``You slipped ratsbane into it, didn't you? I know your dark fat heart.'' That is the way Professor Yang sounds when he is merely offered a glass of orangeade, and the rest of his ranting is similarly animated. ``Let me tell you, I shall never knuckle under to you,'' he declares, in one of the one-sided little dramas witnessed by Jian. At another point, he sings a children's song that has lodged itself in his memory: ``The Proletarian Cultural Revolution/ Is good, is good, is good, is good!'' Mysteriously angered by one visitor, he exclaims, ``I shall raise this nine-section whip and thrash your fat hips, pack, pack, pack.'' In another moment of defiance, he insists, ``Nobody can destroy my soul!'' But he is most disturbing when he smiles a fawning smile of compliance toward the same demons he also fights. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"166586"	"he"	"exclaims"	" And I turned my attention once again to my advance tape of 10.5: Apocalypse, the sequel miniseries to one of the faultiest TV miniseries ever, 10.5. The two-parter, which begins Sunday night at 9 on Channel 7, isn't just about an earthquake. For this NBC sweeps event, we get a 24-like ride through tectonic crises, volcanoes, a tsunami, and the possibility of an ocean asserting itself between the East and West coasts. We get millions dying painfully and actors throwing themselves to lesser fates, such as Beau Bridges, who returns as the woefully inappropriate president. Reconnecting amid the cataclysm with quake expert Samantha Hill, played by NYPD Blue alum Kim Delaney, he exclaims, It's been one helluva ride! </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
