"1420"	"he"	"proposed"	" If p16 mutations give tumor cells the ability to grow in culture, he proposed, it would not be surprising if a majority of cultured cancer cells turned out to have those mutations. But that may not have anything to do with the cause of cancer, he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199407.gz"
"10912"	"he"	"proposed"	" However, he went on, Paramount had monitored attendance at the theater and concluded that ``should we seek an immediate injunction against continued performances, we would provide more publicity of greater magnitude than that which your client would be able to achieve on its own merits.'' Instead, he proposed, if the theater and the authors would guarantee that the show would never be performed again, anywhere, Paramount would be willing to forgo legal action. Mr. Slotnick did not return phone messages left at his office. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"

"18601"	"she"	"proposed"	" A better method, she proposed, is to suck the air into a drum that captures the pollen on strips on an hourly basis. ``Only then will we know when in the day the pollen counts are lowest and exactly how they are affected by changes in the weather,'' she said. Dr. Geraci-Ciardullo also pointed out that rooftop pollen collection might not say much about what people at street level were inhaling. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"24927"	"he"	"proposed"	" To make room in cash registers for the new dollar, he proposed, ``we should abolish the penny. My own view as a consumer, not an economist, is it would be a great improvement. Most people I know have drawers full of unused pennies.'' </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950612.0627 type=story > <HEADLINE> ONLINE ADS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-TVADS-TV ADS VS.

"38844"	"he"	"proposed"	" Herrman not only disposed, he proposed, adding ``Brenda Starr.'' ``I felt we needed to put a woman in there,'' he said, referring not just to Brenda but to her creator, Dale Messick.

"46012"	"they"	"proposed"	" But these stargazers were far more clever than that. Perhaps, they proposed, some kind of unseen cosmic glue is holding the Milky Way together. If 90 percent of the galaxy consists of this invisible stuff, then Newton's laws would again reign supreme. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"

"64829"	"he"	"proposed"	" Many elaborations on the theme followed. Turcotte of Cornell proposed in 1993 that the crust of Venus had grown increasingly thick over the eons, trapping heat inside the planet. Molten lava accumulated until it flooded out in a planetary crisis. Afterwards, the crust thickened again. The process, he proposed, was perhaps cyclical, with Venus experiencing several such crises in its history and perhaps getting ready for another. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"

"76313"	"I"	"proposed"	" The Mullens' art had to look accessible, yet not plebeian. As Howard said, ``If you were cool, you would know it was good.'' The ideal mix, I proposed, was an eclectic but coherent group of American painting and sculpture from the 1860s to the mid-1940s. That range sounded fine, as long as the characters ``would have to be rich to collect it.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"

"79875"	"he"	"proposed"	" Shorter bouts of learning separated by rest, he proposed, allow time for the available activator to recycle from the previous learning trial and respond again _ a molecular argument for steady studying. ``We can now give you a biological reason why cramming doesn't work,'' Tully said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"

"126910"	"he"	"proposed"	" After the Communist victory in 1949 in the Chinese civil war, Beijing was restored as the nation's capital, and the country's pre-eminent architectural expert, Liang Sicheng, was asked to develop a city plan. He recommended that central Beijing, inside the old wall, be kept as a low-rise administrative and cultural center. The wall and its historic gates, he proposed, should be renovated and transformed into an elegant, narrow park. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"

"136562"	"they"	"proposed"	" In the next decade, other scientists began finding small molecules that, they proposed, might be the culprits in damaging nerve cells. The molecules seemed to be clumps of amyloid protein, Mucke said, and a new picture was emerging. These small amyloid clumps, he said, ``do not just exist in these garbage piles, the plaques, but they also float around like cruise missiles.'' When they do, they might injure synapses. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"137694"	"he"	"proposed"	" The gentle pressure of starlight, he proposed, wafts these ``seeds,'' or spores, through the heavens, and if they happen to alight on a habitable planet, they will colonize it.

"149485"	"he"	"proposed"	" But he was no postmodernist. Late in his life Goedel said of mathematics: It is given to us in its entirety and does not change, unlike the Milky Way. That part of it of which we have a perfect view seems beautiful, suggesting harmony. That beauty, he proposed, would be mirrored by the world itself. These are not exactly the views of an acolyte devoted to Relativity, Incompleteness and Uncertainty. And Einstein was his fellow dissenter. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20050213.0056 type=story > <HEADLINE> TOSSING OUT A CHIEF EXECUTIVE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> PALO ALTO, Calif. </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"
