"36"	"you"	"remember"	" Despite being German, which made him immediately suspect with the locals (Germany, you remember, once dropped a few bombs on Wimbledon, among other places), Becker and Centre Court were made for each other.

"8744"	"I"	"remember"	" ``Phyllis and I took turns as keepers of the sacred lamp, smuggling it in and out of our houses like it was the Holy Grail.

"30187"	"you"	"remember"	" I. Call the Boston Celtics p.r. guy and find out how that big libel suit the Celts promised to file against the Wall Street Journal is coming along. The WSJ, you remember, published numerous unflattering allegations about Reggie Lewis' purported cocaine abuse back inMarch. With great panache, the C's vowed to sue, an notion, which, put charitably, would be a monstrous waste of shareholders' money. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"

"100393"	"we"	"remember"	" As Europeans and Americans alike remember war heroes on Armistice and Veterans Day, we remember, too, the distance the United States and its allies have traveled across the last half century. From the ravages of World War II rose the NATO alliance, binding 12 nations (now 19) together to win the Cold War, defeat the Soviet Union, bring peace to the Balkans and today to help face down the terrorist threat to us all. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"

Karl would make these breakfast menus and type them up, and pass them out the night before. Around election time, I remember, he had a dish on there called the W.

"104912"	"I"	"remember"	" ``I think they captured so well how children are drawn to what is mysterious and scary, the way they concoct stories to test and frighten themselves,'' said Spacek, 52, who spent her own childhood in a small East Texas town called Quitman. ``I'm sure I saw this for the first time in a movie theater, probably the Gem Theater in Quitman, where they had a separate entrance for the blacks, who had to sit upstairs in the balcony. And downstairs in the courthouse, I remember, they had separate bathrooms for `colored women' and `white ladies.' I wandered into the `colored' bathroom once, just because I wanted to see what it was like in there, you know, and there was this big black woman who looked at me and said, `What are you doing in here?'

On MTV, when we've done ``The 100 Greatest Pop Songs,'' they're really hard to put together, for that reason. Back in the 1940s, there were very few avenues for music. Everyone was listening to the same songs.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"145527"	"they"	"remember"	" He is not concerned about his legacy. The unlikely career limb, the titles, the comebacks -- the legacy is safe. Most agree. But Sugar, who includes Holyfield in his book, The 100 Greatest Boxers of All-Time, said: Most tend to look at boxers during their peak, not at the end. But he will hurt the memory some people have. As great as Roberto Duran was, they remember, 'No Mas.' Some will remember Holyfield as an old boxer who hung on too long and not the great fighter he once was. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"

The Redeemer and I were the only riders --; I didn't know, then, of the years he'd spent flat-boating, and was amazed at his skill with the steering-oar and pole. As we drifted, seemingly without effort, just in sight of Louisiana, he pointed out banks and chutes and snags to me with a confidence born of a lifetime on he river. He took particular pleasure, I remember, in identifying the stars. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"173330"	"you"	"remember"	" Rumsfeld, you remember, was absolutely certain that Iraq could be transformed with less than half the troops that a generation of senior generals had thought necessary. He was wrong, but it was the Army's top general who lost his job. Similar travesties played out over postwar planning and over reconstruction contracts. At some point, people must have stopped telling Rumsfeld what was really going on, fearing his wrath or retaliation. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
