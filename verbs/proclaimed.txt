The N.Y. Times News Service night supervisor is Lynn Hoogenboom; phone: (888) 346-9867; e-mail: lyhoognytimes.com.  INTERNATIONAL  (Will move in i news file.)  UKRAINE-VOTE (Kiev, Moscow) -- More than a month after a disputed presidential election paralyzed the country and strained international relations, Ukraine is preparing for a new vote on Sunday that has raised hopes that a final, amicable end to its deeply divisive political crisis is near. Those hopes may be premature. Prime Minister Viktor F. Yanukovich, the candidate declared the winner of an election ultimately overturned by Ukraine's Supreme Court, has warned that the results of Sunday's vote would be illegitimate and vowed to challenge them in court. Demonstrations and legal challenges could prolong the dispute still further -- despite a widely held belief here and abroad that victory by his opponent, Viktor A. Yushchenko, is all but inevitable. By Steven Lee Myers.  IRAQ-MOSUL (Mosul, Iraq) -- On Tuesday, Sgt. Michael S. Posner was standing in the middle of a crowded dining hall at Forward Operating Base Marez, holding a cheeseburger and fries on a lunch tray and looking for his friends, when a huge force blew him off his feet. On Friday, Posner, a 34-year-old from Farmingville, N.Y., was one of hundreds of service members who went to the base's movie theater to honor two of the 14 U.S. soldiers killed in the attack. Posner clumped forward on crutches, his leg broken. Outside, he turned his back. His shoulders heaved as he sobbed. This is his story of what happened Tuesday, when 22 people died in the worst single attack on U.S. forces since Iraq formally regained sovereignty in the summer. By Christine Hauser.  IRAQ-CHRISTIANS (Baghdad, Iraq) -- At 4:30 pm on the day before Christmas, as the rescheduled midnight mass at St. Joseph's Cathedral was about to begin, the cavernous sanctuary seemed to fill with a peaceful hush. Then a loudspeaker emitted a harsh shriek of feedback. The scattering of worshippers jumped, wide-eyed, almost in unison. Then, just as uniformly, they glanced at each other with nervous smiles. Besieged by bombs, mortars and gunfire over the last year, Baghdad's Christians, who by some estimates make up 10 percent of the city's population, have ample reason to be edgy. This Christmas, even more than last year's, their celebrations are subdued and severely curtailed. Many Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and other Christian churches, beset by anonymous threats, are holding no large services at all. By Erik Eckholm.  HONDURAS-ATTACKS (Mexico City) -- Honduras blamed youth gangs on Friday for a gun attack on a public bus that killed 28 people returning from work or Christmas shopping in the latest violent outrage to hit the poor Central American nation. Six children were among the victims when half a dozen assailants armed with AK-47 and M-16 assault rifles stopped the bus in a gritty neighborhood of the northern city of San Pedro Sula on Thursday night. The killers then opened fire. President Ricardo Maduro accused the mara street gangs -- groups of youths often with tattooed faces that have been in open warfare with his government since a crackdown last year. The maras are related to Hispanic gangs in Los Angeles. (Summary from wires.) By Ginger Thompson.  NATIONAL GENERAL  (Will move in a news file.)  FARM-BOOM (Gurley, Neb.) -- The roadside sign welcoming people into this state reads: Nebraska, The Good Life. And for farmers closing out their books at the end of a year when they earned more money than any time in the history of American farming, it certainly looks like happy days. But at a time when big harvests and record farm income should mean that champagne corks are popping across the prairie, the prosperity has brought with it the kind of nervousness seen in headlines like the one that ran in the Omaha World Herald earlier this month: Income boom has farmers on edge. For despite the fact that farm income has doubled over the last two years, federal farm subsidies have also gone up nearly 40 percent over the same period -- projected to hit $15.7 billion this year, and $130 billion over the last nine years. And that bounty is drawing fire from people who say that at this moment of farm prosperity the nation's subsidy system has never made less sense. By Timothy Egan.  MIDWEST-STORM (Chicago) -- Hundreds of people remain stranded on Christmas Eve on snow-covered I-64 from Illinois to Indiana. The authorities continue to try to get them moving. Updates on weather related deaths and forecasts. By Stephen Kinzer.

FOREIGN  With story BC-UKRAINE-VOTE-NYT  Looking ahead to Ukraine's election on Saturday, assessing the upheaval and looking at prospects for election, particularly as regards to whether it will be honest. One thing is clear: It will be nasty.  In a single generation, China's ascetic, egalitarian society has acquired the trappings and the tensions of America in the age of the robber barons. A rough-and-tumble form of capitalism is eclipsing the remnants of socialism. Those who have made the transition live side-by-side with those who have not, separated by serrated fences and the Communist Party.  Mick Jagger was there that night in 1996, watching the cheering boys with dreadlocks and the girls in polo shirts embroidered with the enigmatic logo that Tommy Hilfiger came up with a decade before, back when he was nobody. But the dreadlocked kids have largely deserted him for urban looks they called more authentic. The company's stock has plummeted. As if all that weren't bad enough, the company said in September a federal grand jury was investigating whether it had evaded taxes by inflating the commissions that its American unit paid to a foreign subsidiary for services like quality control and product development as far back as 1990.  James J. Murren, the president and chief financial officer of MGM Mirage, the $4 billion hotel and gambling behemoth, was holding forth in his office here at the Bellagio, surrounded by antique slot machines and talking about his latest bet as a high-roller might recount the story of winning a big hand. The future growth of his company, he proclaimed, has little to do with gaming. So instead of developing a new mega-hotel and casino, he is spending about $3 billion of the house's money on a major real-estate play to transform 66 acres on the Las Vegas Strip into a mini-Manhattan.  Workers considering early retirement should crunch the numbers first, financial planners say, to make sure that they will have enough income -- typically about 70 to 80 percent of their preretirement earnings. They should also consider how they are going to cover their health care. Some buyout offers that are geared toward encouraging early retirement will offer medical insurance until Medicare kicks in at age 65, and might also sweeten employee pensions.  Susanne Morton enjoys watching movies, but she gave up renting DVDs from her local video store because she could never get them back on time and ended up paying late fees of as much as $15 a month. But in May, Morton signed up with Netflix, the online DVD service. For a flat fee of $22 a month, she was able to rent up to three movies at a time, with no monthly limit, and have those films mailed to her, postage paid. And the best part: no late fees. Morton is one of a growing number of consumers who, irked at forking over hefty late fees, are signing up for mail-order services.

Those hopes may be premature.  In a single generation, China's ascetic, egalitarian society has acquired the trappings and the tensions of America in the age of the robber barons. A rough-and-tumble form of capitalism is eclipsing the remnants of socialism. Those who have made the transition live side-by-side with those who have not, separated by serrated fences and the Communist Party.  It started as a minor dispute between farm worker and farm owner. The 68-year-old owner, Hilde Wiese, discovered a gosling crushed between two crates in the flower garden. She scolded the gardener for her carelessness. The worker, resentful, shouted at the owner's son, Andreas. None of them could have guessed how their argument would play out. Fourteen months later, the Namibian government is expropriating the farm where the Wiese family has lived for four generations. The president has publicly declared Andreas Wiese a criminal. The farm workers' union, which mobilized hundreds of protestors outside the Wieses' gate, has warned that a similar fate awaits other farmers who mistreat their workers.  The federal government has begun telling patients if their local hospital is doing what it should. For now, the effort involves three common and deadly diseases of the elderly -- heart attacks, heart failure, and pneumonia -- and asks about lifesaving treatments that everyone agrees should be given but that hospitals and doctors often forget to give. But other diseases, other treatments, and surgery are next. Within a few years, individual doctors will be rated as well.  Mick Jagger was there that night in 1996, watching the cheering boys with dreadlocks and the girls in polo shirts embroidered with the enigmatic logo that Tommy Hilfiger came up with a decade before, back when he was nobody.
