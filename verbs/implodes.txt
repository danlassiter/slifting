"162194"	"it"	"implodes"	" The remake of Fun With Dick and Jane, which came out just before Christmas and stars Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni, also tells the story of a rising young executive who unexpectedly loses his job and turns to robbery to sustain his lifestyle. But in the remake, corporate mendacity is front and center. Jim Carrey's Dick Harper works for a company that has the sleek but meaningless name of Globodyne and a business model so convoluted that even he, a communications pro, can't explain it. One day, in the blink of an eye, it implodes, to the shock of not just Harper but all the company's thousands of employees, who lose their pensions along with their jobs. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
