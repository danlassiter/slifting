COMMENTARY (moved in 'k' category code)  THE UN'S ANTI-RACISM CONFERENCE  UN-RACISM-CONFERENCE-ECONOMIST _ Durban, in South Africa, is a charming city, but delegates attending the U.N. World Conference Against Racism there this week are too angry to enjoy its beaches or curry houses. America is upset that the draft declaration is too hard on Israel. Western governments are annoyed by demands that they should pay reparations for slavery and colonialism, while many Africans and African-Americans are furious that these demands for reparations have been turned aside. Ethnic groups from all around the world have assembled to trumpet their grievances and demand ``remedial measures.''  SHADOWS OVER JAPAN  JAPAN-SHADOW-ECONOMIST _ Another week, another set of impressive-sounding, or painful-sounding, job cuts from one of Japan's finest high-tech exporters. Last week it was Fujitsu, the country's top computer firm, cutting 16,000 jobs. This week it was the turn of Toshiba, a maker of memory chips, laptops and much else, to declare its plan to cut 19,000 jobs. Other cuts have come from NEC, a big telecom and chips firm, and more are rumored to be on the way from Hitachi, one of the country's older conglomerates.  GEORGE BUSH'S BUDGET CHALLENGE  BUSH-BUDGET-ECONOMIST _ Next week, Congress reconvenes after the Labor Day holiday. September will be dominated by the budget for the next fiscal year, which begins on Oct.1. For George Bush, this involves two awkward situations. First, Congress, including the newly Democratic Senate, controls the timing of the various spending bills. And second, the whole numbers business has become rather tricky for Bush now that he stands accused of having wasted Bill Clinton's budget surplus on his tax cut. The Congressional Budget Office says the current year's budget will be balanced only after filching $9 billion from the ``untouchable'' Social Security trust fund.  TIME-SHARING MOVES TO THE STABLES  TIME-SHARE-ECONOMIST _ As a way of marketing property, time-sharing is a familiar idea. Now stable owners across America are adapting the concept to their business. Riders pay a monthly fee, choosing from plans that offer a given number of days a week of riding, or unlimited riding time.  MOBIL PHONES IN CHINA  CHINE-MOBIL-PHONES-ECONOMIST _ Which is the biggest mobile-phone market in the world? The answer, since July, is China. This is a country in which, until a few years ago, the only people who could afford mobile phones were mobsters. Now 121 million Chinese are users. BDA, a Beijing consultancy, forecasts that the number will rise to 370 million by 2005, enough to persuade many investors _ even after telecom shares have dived all over the world _ that China was, and would remain, a magic market. Over the past few weeks, however, much of that magic has vanished. China Mobile, the mainland's dominant operator, with 73 percent of the market, announced half-year results that were superb in every respect bar one: average revenues per user were down by 35 percent. The drop took analysts by surprise and sent China Mobile's shares into a tailspin. Shares in China Unicom, the smaller rival in the country's duopoly, followed.  ALCOHOL IN SWEDEN  ALCOHOL-SWEDEN-ECONOMIST _ Buying a bottle of liquor in Sweden is a notoriously disagreeable experience, thanks to years of practice by Systembolaget, the state-owned monopoly retailer of alcoholic drinks. Now this forbidding institution is undergoing a personality change and trying to reinvent itself as customer-friendly. Out go the clinical glass cases in which drink is displayed; in comes self-service. Since July, most stores have started opening on Saturdays.  A CAUTIOUS COMPETITOR TO CISCO SYSTEMS  CISCO-COMPETITOR-ECONOMIST _ For most of the American business press it is a simple upstart vs. incumbent tale: The nimble Juniper Networks is after Cisco, the juggernaut of networking systems. But ask Scott Kriens, Juniper's chief executive, about that casting and he rolls his eyes as if to say, ``Stop comparing apples with pears.'' In part, Kriens' reaction is a wise business tactic. Many a challenger has trumpeted too loudly, only to be crushed by the incumbent. Juniper is a serious competitive threat to Cisco in the strategic market of high-end routers, the traffic cops of the Internet backbone. But it is also true that the companies are quite different beasts.  SCANDINAVIAN REPUBLICANS ON THE RISE  SCANDINAVIAN-REPUBLICANS-ECONOMIST _ On the face of things, Scandinavians enjoy the paradox of being sturdy monarchists and relentless egalitarians all at once. Judging by the whoops and cheers in Oslo's streets last weekend, when Norway's crown prince married a commoner with a 4-year-old child born out of wedlock with a convicted drug offender, many still feel that way. Republican sentiment in Norway and Sweden, however, is far from dead. In the past week, two of Scandinavia's biggest newspapers have called for their countries' monarchies to go. Only Denmark's popular royals have been largely unscathed.  WORRIES ABOUT HOUSING BUST  HOUSING-BUST-ECONOMIST _ If America's economy avoids sliding from downturn into a full-blown recession, it will be because the consumer continues to spend freely. Some economists had feared that this week's revised gross domestic product figures would show that the economy had shrunk in the second quarter. Instead, consumer spending kept the figure positive _ albeit at just 0.2 percent compared with the previous quarter at an annual rate. Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic activity, has remained strong despite falling share prices and rising unemployment for one main reason: a housing boom. Average house prices rose 8.8 percent in the year to March. New government figures, due this weekend, should still show an upward trend.  GOV. GRAY DAVIS RECOVERS IN CALIFORNIA  GRAY-DAVIS-RECOVERS-ECONOMIST _ Presidents come and go, but campaigning is eternal. With a mere 1,159 days until the next election, it is time to start handicapping the Democrats who want to take on President George W. Bush in 2004. And suddenly Gray Davis, the governor of California, is back, slowly moving up the pack. This might strike anybody who has been out of the country for the past couple of months as ridiculous. Surely not the man who plunged the Golden State into obscurity? Who became the butt of a hundred light-bulb jokes? Who became known as the Prince of Darkness?  FOX'S MOMENT OF TRUTH  FOX-MEXICO-ECONOMIST _ There will be ``no surprises'' in Vicente Fox's first state-of-the-nation address on Sept. 1, say his spin doctors, bar the format: a shorter, more accessible kind of presidential speech, ``so that people don't turn off the television.'' That just about sums up Fox's presidency so far. If you picture the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which ruled for seven decades until Fox took over, as a software operating system, then Mexico is still running, at best, PRI 1.1: a more user-friendly version, perhaps, but not the redesign that is needed.  THE DISPUTE OVER CANADIAN LUMBER  CANADIAN-LUMBER-ECONOMIST _ No other country has more experience of the abrasive U.S. approach to trade disputes than Canada, and no Canadian industry knows more about such matters than its producers of softwood lumber. But familiarity does not ease the pain: Canadian wood producers have begun to shut mills and layoff thousands of workers in response to a decision in early August by America's Commerce Department to impose a 19 percent countervailing duty on timber imports.  PERU'S POST-FUJIMORI PURGE  POST-FUJIMORI-PURGE-ECONOMIST _ With his regime collapsing in scandal, last November Alberto Fujimori, Peru's authoritarian former president, sought asylum in Japan, whose nationality he claims by descent. Under Japanese law, its nationals cannot be extradited, so Fujimori may be safe from judicial pursuit. But Japan may not be protected from embarrassment over its guest. Hitherto, investigations into the abuses of Fujimori's regime have centered on Vladimiro Montesinos, his sleazy intelligence chief, who has been imprisoned since June on some 50 charges. Investigators say they have made little progress in their efforts to link Fujimori to the proceeds of Montesinos' corruption, partly, they say, because they have not received much international co-operation.  CHINA FACES UP TO ITS AIDS PROBLEM  CHINA-AIDS-ECONOMIST _ After failing for months, if not years, to come publicly to grips with a fast-growing problem of HIV and AIDS, Chinese health officials on Aug. 23 pulled their heads out of the sand, at least partially. Talking to reporters in Beijing, the vice minister of health, Yin Dakui, acknowledged that China is ``facing a very serious epidemic'' and admitted that negligence by provincial and local-level officials had contributed to the spread of the disease.  TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC OVERTURES  TAIWAN-ECONOMIC-ECONOMIST _ The Taiwanese have not seen a contraction of their economy since they began compiling records in 1952. Two generations have grown up taking 8 percent annual growth for granted and thinking recession was an ailment of the sclerotic West. So with even the usually optimistic government number-cruncher predicting growth of minus 0.3 percent this year, the mood is close to panic. That may help explain a new readiness to contemplate expanding economic ties with mainland China.  BUSINESS-WEEK-ECONOMIST - A review in brief from the world of business this week.

Other cuts have come from NEC, a big telecom and chips firm, and more are rumored to be on the way from Hitachi, one of the country's older conglomerates.  GEORGE BUSH'S BUDGET CHALLENGE  BUSH-BUDGET-ECONOMIST _ Next week, Congress reconvenes after the Labor Day holiday. September will be dominated by the budget for the next fiscal year, which begins on Oct.1. For George Bush, this involves two awkward situations. First, Congress, including the newly Democratic Senate, controls the timing of the various spending bills. And second, the whole numbers business has become rather tricky for Bush now that he stands accused of having wasted Bill Clinton's budget surplus on his tax cut. The Congressional Budget Office says the current year's budget will be balanced only after filching $9 billion from the ``untouchable'' Social Security trust fund.  TIME-SHARING MOVES TO THE STABLES  TIME-SHARE-ECONOMIST _ As a way of marketing property, time-sharing is a familiar idea. Now stable owners across America are adapting the concept to their business. Riders pay a monthly fee, choosing from plans that offer a given number of days a week of riding, or unlimited riding time.  MOBIL PHONES IN CHINA  CHINE-MOBIL-PHONES-ECONOMIST _ Which is the biggest mobile-phone market in the world? The answer, since July, is China. This is a country in which, until a few years ago, the only people who could afford mobile phones were mobsters. Now 121 million Chinese are users. BDA, a Beijing consultancy, forecasts that the number will rise to 370 million by 2005, enough to persuade many investors _ even after telecom shares have dived all over the world _ that China was, and would remain, a magic market. Over the past few weeks, however, much of that magic has vanished. China Mobile, the mainland's dominant operator, with 73 percent of the market, announced half-year results that were superb in every respect bar one: average revenues per user were down by 35 percent. The drop took analysts by surprise and sent China Mobile's shares into a tailspin. Shares in China Unicom, the smaller rival in the country's duopoly, followed.  ALCOHOL IN SWEDEN  ALCOHOL-SWEDEN-ECONOMIST _ Buying a bottle of liquor in Sweden is a notoriously disagreeable experience, thanks to years of practice by Systembolaget, the state-owned monopoly retailer of alcoholic drinks. Now this forbidding institution is undergoing a personality change and trying to reinvent itself as customer-friendly. Out go the clinical glass cases in which drink is displayed; in comes self-service. Since July, most stores have started opening on Saturdays.  A CAUTIOUS COMPETITOR TO CISCO SYSTEMS  CISCO-COMPETITOR-ECONOMIST _ For most of the American business press it is a simple upstart vs. incumbent tale: The nimble Juniper Networks is after Cisco, the juggernaut of networking systems. But ask Scott Kriens, Juniper's chief executive, about that casting and he rolls his eyes as if to say, ``Stop comparing apples with pears.'' In part, Kriens' reaction is a wise business tactic. Many a challenger has trumpeted too loudly, only to be crushed by the incumbent. Juniper is a serious competitive threat to Cisco in the strategic market of high-end routers, the traffic cops of the Internet backbone. But it is also true that the companies are quite different beasts.  SCANDINAVIAN REPUBLICANS ON THE RISE  SCANDINAVIAN-REPUBLICANS-ECONOMIST _ On the face of things, Scandinavians enjoy the paradox of being sturdy monarchists and relentless egalitarians all at once. Judging by the whoops and cheers in Oslo's streets last weekend, when Norway's crown prince married a commoner with a 4-year-old child born out of wedlock with a convicted drug offender, many still feel that way. Republican sentiment in Norway and Sweden, however, is far from dead. In the past week, two of Scandinavia's biggest newspapers have called for their countries' monarchies to go. Only Denmark's popular royals have been largely unscathed.  WORRIES ABOUT HOUSING BUST  HOUSING-BUST-ECONOMIST _ If America's economy avoids sliding from downturn into a full-blown recession, it will be because the consumer continues to spend freely. Some economists had feared that this week's revised gross domestic product figures would show that the economy had shrunk in the second quarter. Instead, consumer spending kept the figure positive _ albeit at just 0.2 percent compared with the previous quarter at an annual rate. Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic activity, has remained strong despite falling share prices and rising unemployment for one main reason: a housing boom. Average house prices rose 8.8 percent in the year to March. New government figures, due this weekend, should still show an upward trend.  GOV. GRAY DAVIS RECOVERS IN CALIFORNIA  GRAY-DAVIS-RECOVERS-ECONOMIST _ Presidents come and go, but campaigning is eternal. With a mere 1,159 days until the next election, it is time to start handicapping the Democrats who want to take on President George W. Bush in 2004. And suddenly Gray Davis, the governor of California, is back, slowly moving up the pack. This might strike anybody who has been out of the country for the past couple of months as ridiculous. Surely not the man who plunged the Golden State into obscurity? Who became the butt of a hundred light-bulb jokes? Who became known as the Prince of Darkness?  FOX'S MOMENT OF TRUTH  FOX-MEXICO-ECONOMIST _ There will be ``no surprises'' in Vicente Fox's first state-of-the-nation address on Sept. 1, say his spin doctors, bar the format: a shorter, more accessible kind of presidential speech, ``so that people don't turn off the television.'' That just about sums up Fox's presidency so far. If you picture the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which ruled for seven decades until Fox took over, as a software operating system, then Mexico is still running, at best, PRI 1.1: a more user-friendly version, perhaps, but not the redesign that is needed.  THE DISPUTE OVER CANADIAN LUMBER  CANADIAN-LUMBER-ECONOMIST _ No other country has more experience of the abrasive U.S. approach to trade disputes than Canada, and no Canadian industry knows more about such matters than its producers of softwood lumber. But familiarity does not ease the pain: Canadian wood producers have begun to shut mills and layoff thousands of workers in response to a decision in early August by America's Commerce Department to impose a 19 percent countervailing duty on timber imports.  PERU'S POST-FUJIMORI PURGE  POST-FUJIMORI-PURGE-ECONOMIST _ With his regime collapsing in scandal, last November Alberto Fujimori, Peru's authoritarian former president, sought asylum in Japan, whose nationality he claims by descent. Under Japanese law, its nationals cannot be extradited, so Fujimori may be safe from judicial pursuit. But Japan may not be protected from embarrassment over its guest. Hitherto, investigations into the abuses of Fujimori's regime have centered on Vladimiro Montesinos, his sleazy intelligence chief, who has been imprisoned since June on some 50 charges. Investigators say they have made little progress in their efforts to link Fujimori to the proceeds of Montesinos' corruption, partly, they say, because they have not received much international co-operation.  CHINA FACES UP TO ITS AIDS PROBLEM  CHINA-AIDS-ECONOMIST _ After failing for months, if not years, to come publicly to grips with a fast-growing problem of HIV and AIDS, Chinese health officials on Aug. 23 pulled their heads out of the sand, at least partially. Talking to reporters in Beijing, the vice minister of health, Yin Dakui, acknowledged that China is ``facing a very serious epidemic'' and admitted that negligence by provincial and local-level officials had contributed to the spread of the disease.  TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC OVERTURES  TAIWAN-ECONOMIC-ECONOMIST _ The Taiwanese have not seen a contraction of their economy since they began compiling records in 1952. Two generations have grown up taking 8 percent annual growth for granted and thinking recession was an ailment of the sclerotic West. So with even the usually optimistic government number-cruncher predicting growth of minus 0.3 percent this year, the mood is close to panic. That may help explain a new readiness to contemplate expanding economic ties with mainland China.  BUSINESS-WEEK-ECONOMIST - A review in brief from the world of business this week.

, he argues,	 BREATHE IN, BREATHE OUT ...: A new book challenges us to think about a basic life-sustaining activity -- breathing. Take a minute and concentrate on the air going in and out of your lungs and you will feel refreshed, writes Lorin Roche in ``Breath Taking'' (Rodale; $14.95). The benefits of paying attention to our breathing are great, he argues, helping us relax, sleep better, feel energized and conquer stress. Try this one when you're stressed out: As you breathe in, lift your shoulders high, then slowly drop them as you exhale. Do this for one minute, five times a week. (I tried it and I have to admit he might be on the something.) And that's just one of Roche's breathing exercises in the book. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010831.0129 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-SPORTS-NYT-BUDGET) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Attn Sports Editors:  Sports stories from The New York Times News Service for SATURDAY, Sept. 1.

, they say,	 On the other side, many conservatives contend that Social Security's flaws are so fundamental that the government has to destroy the program in order to save it. Nothing less than the introduction of privately owned investment accounts allowing people to save for their own retirement, they say, will solve the problem. They see such accounts as necessary to supplement and ultimately replace the existing pay-as-you-go system, under which working Americans are taxed to pay the Social Security benefits of their parents in retirement. </P> 	nyt_eng_200108.gz
, they say,	 That is exactly the way it looks to an eclectic band of economists who don't fall into either political straitjacket. Social Security does have a fundamental flaw, they say, but it cannot be overcome by privatizing the system. </P> 	nyt_eng_200108.gz
, he says,	 If only it were that easy. Privatization, says Jeffrey A. Miron, an economist at Boston University, is a false promise.

Relying on estimates that the WEFA Group used in more recent studies, Baker concluded that other nations, including those of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, would cut production far more than the 1990 study estimated to offset output from the refuge. That, he said, would nullify much or all of the lower prices generated by the Arctic drilling. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

All weekend, newspapers and television broadcasts talked about how the police in Jerusalem were on high alert for a Palestinian terrorist attack, perhaps on a school building or a school bus. By Clyde Haberman.  PUTIN-BUSH (Moscow) _ Russian President Vladimir Putin said this weekend that he believed that President Bush was a creature of the powerful circle of aides that advise him on national security and foreign policy, and that this circle was still struggling over its priorities, especially those regarding ``strategic stability.'' By Patrick E. Tyler.  NKOREA-TALKS (Undated) _ North Korea on Sunday proposed resuming talks with South Korea. South Korea's unification ministry confirmed that it had monitored a broadcast over Radio Pyongyang in which Rim Tong-ok, vice chairman of the North's committee for peaceful reunification, responsible for dealings with the South, called for ``speedy resumption in talks between South and North Korean government officials.'' The message was greeted with relief by South Korean officials who saw it as rescuing President Kim Dae-jung's ``sunshine policy'' of rapprochement with the North. By Don Kirk.  GERMANY-PHOTO-FLAP (Berlin) _ The German defense minister, Rudolf Scharping, has been considered one of the more straight-laced and petit-bourgeois figures in a German government that features a much-married chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, and foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, the former radical. But after an awkward, self-publicized set of Majorca vacation snaps of Scharping and his countess fiancee, he is now being called ``A defense minister in love,'' and his personal and professional judgment are being called in question. By Steven Erlanger.  CHANNEL-MIGRANTS (London) _ In one of the most audacious attempts by migrants to evade Britain's restrictions on asylum-seekers, security officials intercepted a group of about 100 people apparently attempting a mass dash through the channel tunnel from France on Saturday night, the French police said Sunday. The attempt to use the rail link underneath the English Channel was the third this week and showed the perils the migrants are prepared to face to seek sanctuary. By Alan Cowell.  INDONESIA-CIGARETTE (Kudus, Indonesia) _ The Indonesian clove cigarette is a great deal more than tobacco and cloves. It is a complex, infinitely variable symphony of scent and flavor. Usually about two-thirds tobacco and one-third clove, the Indonesian cigarette also contains one more, often secret, ingredient: its sauce, or ``saus'' in the Indonesian language. By Seth Mydans.

By Lizette Alvarez.  STEMCELL-SHIFT (Washington) _ In the weeks since President Bush decided to permit federal financing for certain studies of human embryonic stem cells, an enormous shift has occurred in the public debate.

CULTURE  (Coded e)  FUGARD-SAFRICA-THEATER (Cape Town, South Africa) _ Athol Fugard's newest play, ``Sorrows &AMP; Rejoicings,'' opened on Aug. 28 for a four-week run at the Baxter Theater here. It is the unwanted inheritance of a young mixed-race woman, who is unsure of what to keep and what to throw away from her past. It is a symbol of a modern South Africa still wrestling with its history, and perhaps of the aging playwright himself. Fugard, 69, is the undisputed giant of South African theater, the defiant white artist who championed the liberation struggle and cheered apartheid's demise in 1994. Yet today, he says he finds himself feeling a bit lonely and a bit unwanted. By Rachel L. Swarns.  BLACK-WRITERS-WORKSHOP (New York) _ The Frederick Douglass Creative Arts Center, one of the oldest, continuously running workshops for minority artists and writers in this city, is celebrating its 30th anniversary.

And the strategy seems to be working. By foregoing national expansion to focus on local service in the same nine states where it has operated the last 17 years, BellSouth has found the local telephone business a haven during the storm that has ravaged so much of the rest of the telecommunications industry. By Simon Romero.  with  NEW-ECONOMY-COLUMN (Undated) _ The House is considering whether to scale back regulations that the Bell companies say makes it difficult to offer broadband Internet access. Meanwhile, the Senate is considering a bill backed by AT&AMP;T to break the Bells into separate companies. Are the bills really meant to help consumers, or are they merely tools to hurt competitors and make up for technical shortcomings? By Seth Schiesel.  ECOMMERCE-COLUMN (Undated) _ As Internet retailing has dwindled mainly to the online extensions of the old-line merchants, ideas about e-profitability have become a bit more nuanced than they used to be.

NETWORTH (COLUMN) _ The dog days of summer ended with a snarl last week.  Since Memorial Day, the Dow Jones industrial average is down 9.6 percent, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 is off 11.3 percent and the Nasdaq composite has fallen 19.8 percent.  By comparison, since 1971, the S&AMP;P 500 has gained 1.8 percent on average between Memorial Day and Labor Day, according to Ned Davis Research.

BY GEORGE RAINE  INSURER _ A federal investigation of an alleged swindle involving the notorious, now-defunct Executive Life Insurance Co. could result in indictments this month or soon afterward against French investors and companies, law-enforcement sources say.  For some policyholders it may be too little, too late, after a decade of pain. But if they are issued, criminal charges stemming from the Los Angeles company's 1991 nosedive might prove helpful to attorneys still trying to avenge in civil courts what has been described by state and federal law-enforcement officials as a gigantic international fraud. BY SCOTT WINOKUR  PAY _ After nearly two years of big losses and then job cuts, executives for Britannica.com decided that their strategy of giving away online encyclopedias was doomed.

CULTURE  (Coded e)  FUGARD-SAFRICA-THEATER (Cape Town, South Africa) _ Athol Fugard's newest play, ``Sorrows &AMP; Rejoicings,'' opened on Aug. 28 for a four-week run at the Baxter Theater here. It is the unwanted inheritance of a young mixed-race woman, who is unsure of what to keep and what to throw away from her past. It is a symbol of a modern South Africa still wrestling with its history, and perhaps of the aging playwright himself. Fugard, 69, is the undisputed giant of South African theater, the defiant white artist who championed the liberation struggle and cheered apartheid's demise in 1994. Yet today, he says he finds himself feeling a bit lonely and a bit unwanted. By Rachel L. Swarns.  BLACK-WRITERS-WORKSHOP (New York) _ The Frederick Douglass Creative Arts Center, one of the oldest, continuously running workshops for minority artists and writers in this city, is celebrating its 30th anniversary. The center is a word-of-mouth kind of place that for three decades has quietly helped start the careers of some of the country's most acclaimed black writers, actors, directors and performers. Famous alumni include Danny Glover, Garrett Morris and Bill Duke. Early in their careers Samuel L. Jackson and S. Epatha Merkerson (who plays Lt. Anita Van Buren on NBC's ``Law and Order'') both performed in plays produced by the center. By Sherri Day.  ARTS-ONLINE (Undated) _ And the Academy Award for best picture goes to ... MTV? It would never happen at the Oscars. But for a prominent Internet prize being given out Monday night, such a scenario is not so far-fetched. The prize in question is the Prix Ars Electronica, awarded annually during the Ars Electronica Festival in Linz, Austria. The electronic-arts festival is a mecca for Internet artists, computer-music composers and others working in the digital realm. By Matthew Mirapaul.

And the strategy seems to be working. By foregoing national expansion to focus on local service in the same nine states where it has operated the last 17 years, BellSouth has found the local telephone business a haven during the storm that has ravaged so much of the rest of the telecommunications industry. By Simon Romero.  with  NEW-ECONOMY-COLUMN (Undated) _ The House is considering whether to scale back regulations that the Bell companies say makes it difficult to offer broadband Internet access. Meanwhile, the Senate is considering a bill backed by AT&AMP;T to break the Bells into separate companies. Are the bills really meant to help consumers, or are they merely tools to hurt competitors and make up for technical shortcomings? By Seth Schiesel.  ECOMMERCE-COLUMN (Undated) _ As Internet retailing has dwindled mainly to the online extensions of the old-line merchants, ideas about e-profitability have become a bit more nuanced than they used to be. According to two recently released reports from Internet consulting firms _ one by Forrester Research, the other by Jupiter Media Metrix _ bricks-and-mortar retailers that judge their Web divisions solely on the basis of profits may be shortchanging themselves.

NBC-CBS-BATTLE (Undated) _ On Wednesday night, CBS and NBC will go head to head for two hours with heavily promoted reality shows.

, he said,	 Part of the problem, Cassar said, is that retailers find it difficult to measure their Web sites' impact on in-store sales. But generally speaking, he said, less than half the investments a company makes in its Web division actually pay off in online sales. The bulk of the benefits accrue to the traditional stores, in the form of more sales, operating efficiencies and better customer service. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, she said,	 Evie Black Dykema, author of the report from Forrester, came to a different conclusion on this point, suggesting that most of a company's online investments do pay off in the form of Web sales. Yet the fact remains, she said, that the offline impact of a Web site is often overlooked. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, she said,	 Still, she said, a growing number of retailers are starting to delve into the fuzzy science known in industry circles as ``ROI analysis.'' ROI stands for return on investment. Among those that are further along than most, Dykema said, are merchants with a catalog pedigree, because ``they've operated their businesses by the numbers for years.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 For instance, Forgan said, the company surveys customers in its stores a few times a year to determine whether they have researched certain Sharper Image products on the Web before buying. And product codes online are different from those in the catalog, he said, so if a customer calls to place an order and uses the Web product number, the Web site is credited with a percentage of that sale. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

, they said,	 The fun began in 1999 when Prix Ars jurors bypassed hundreds of official entries to pick their own nominee: Linux, an alternative to Microsoft's computer operating system. The choice, they said, would start a discussion on whether computer code could be considered as art. Jurors took a similar route last year, ignoring the official submissions and instead honoring Neal Stephenson, a science-fiction author whose vision of cyberspace has inspired software developers. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 The change clarifies what the Prix Ars voters have long understood, said one juror, Bruno Beusch, co-founder of TNC Network, a new-media concern in Paris. The award, he said, ``is not an arts prize, but a prize for the whole spectrum of innovative activities on and with the Internet.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 For example, he said, jurors liked the Warp Records site because it showed how a small music label could use the Net to sell its wares and stay independent. PrayStation, by the New York artist Joshua Davis, was praised not so much for its graphic-design experiments as for its educational and community-building elements. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

Carpenter's reply was not what she hoped to hear. ``Because,'' he said, ``you didn't try hard enough.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 In 1955, he went to Minneapolis to study general surgery with Dr. Owen H. Wangensteen at the University of Minnesota. In his first weeks there he was so short of money, he said, that he had to mow lawns, wash cars and do other odd jobs to buy food. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

, he said,	 It is true that giving illegal immigrants legal status would enhance their ability to seek better working conditions, as proponents contend, Rodriguez said. But, he said, opponents also make a valid point when they say further immigration of unskilled workers will increase competition for low-wage jobs, suppressing pay levels. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 But Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which favors restrictions on immigration, said the United States ought to be working to help return the illegal immigrants to their home countries.

, he said,	 Defining which species belong in an ecosystem is based less on science than on historical, cultural, moral, geographic and theological arguments, said Dr. Mark Sagoff, who studies the issue at the University of Maryland's Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy. Science cannot judge an ecosystem with exotics to be worse, or less natural, than one without them, he said, without also taking into account the effects of those species on their environments. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 ``We can't return to pre-settlement ecosystems,'' said Dr. Alan Holt, the director of conservation programs for the Northwest and Hawaii at the Nature Conservancy, a nonprofit group that acquires and restores land to preserve the diversity of species. For one thing, he said, many exotic species have become so integrated into ecosystems that animals, some endangered, rely on them for food and shelter. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

BOOKS-`HOTHOUSE'  UNDATED: Keetenheuve is a thinker and a dreamer, an unreasonable man in a too reasonable world, ``a dilettante in politics'' and thus singularly ill-suited to be, as he is, a member of the Bundestag, the lower house of the West German parliament.

Not all are printable in this gazette, though it can be revealed that ``steer-job'' is a method of coaxing one's tee shot down a narrow fairway and ``three-jack'' means three putts. The book dishes wondrous dirt on professional golf and golfers and the author's hometown, Fort Worth, Texas. It comments with laudable candor on life, love, sex, golf course architecture and nouvelle cuisine. It even provides self-help hints for those afflicted with ``the Scottish Madness.''

OBROTHER-MUSIC  UNDATED: When local country radio station KTFW/92.1 FM fired up the soundtrack to ``O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' for the first time last year, Mike Crow had no idea he'd still be firing it up today. ``It just came out of nowhere and caught on,'' says Crow, KTFW's station manager and morning show host. ``It was popular from Day One. And we still have it in our rotation. Fads come and go, but this has stuck around.'' To date, the bluegrass-driven soundtrack, which was produced by Fort Worth-reared T-Bone Burnett, has sold more than 2 million copies.

LOST-AND-FOUND  UNDATED: Jerry Bruckheimer has become a rich man by producing movies in which men are men, women are women, stuff blows up and brains aren't challenged. So it's no wonder that CBS' ``The Amazing Race,'' a reality show produced by Bruckheimer, looks like ``Survivor'' with the dull parts removed. No pompous introspection (well, very little). No sanctimonious ``giving back to the land.'' No Jeff Probst ``tallying'' four votes. Just people zooming around the world, bickering and celebrating as they hit checkpoints to find clues, which will lead them to the next exotic place, and on and on until the first team back in New York wins a million bucks.

If you have questions about stories, call 888-346-9867 or 212-556-1927. For questions about photos, call 888-603-1036 or 212-556-4204.  ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Coded `e')  FILM  FILM-WIZARDS _ The release of two fantasy films, ``The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' on Dec. 19 and ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' on Nov. 16 may make this the winter of the wizard. It is only the beginning. The director, Peter Jackson, filmed two more feature in the Hobbit series simultaneously. That meant actors like Elijah Wood, who plays the hobbit, assorted elves (Cate Blanchett, Orlando Bloom, Liv Tyler) and human warriors (Viggo Mortensen, Sean Bean) lived for a year in Middle Earth. By Polly Shulman.  With photo.  FILM-VIETNAM-GREENE (Hanoi, Vietnam) _ The filming of Graham Greene's novel ``The Quiet American'' is the most ambitious film project made in Vietnam since the war ended in 1975. On its surface, it is the story of a love triangle involving a naive American secret agent, a world-weary English journalist and a determined Vietnamese woman. The book, published in 1955, is read today as a prescient warning of the American involvement in Vietnam. As for Michael Caine, who plays the journalist, he says journalists will be pleased. ``I get the girl and I get the story. What more do you want?'' By Seth Mydans.  With photo.  FILM-GOSFORD-ALTMAN (London) _ In ``Gosford Park,'' Robert Altman casts an American eye on the English class system during a weekend shooting party in 1932. The film has no starring roles, but some of the extras include the aristocrats of British drama: Sir Michael Gambon, Sir Derek Jacobi, Dame Eileen Atkins, and Dame Maggie Smith, plus Alan Bates, Kristin Scott Thomas, Emily Watson and Charles Dance. The film opens Dec. 7. By Kristin Hohenadel.  With photo.  FILM-ALI-MANN (New York) _ Michael Mann's ``Ali,'' starring Will Smith, opens Dec. 7. It's about the real Ali, Mann says. ``We show him at his best, defying the U.S. government, refusing to be inducted into the Army and losing three and a half years of his career for it. We also show him at his worst, taunting and insulting his black opponents and cheating on his wife. This isn't an idealized Ali.'' By Allen Barra.  With photo.  FILM-BANYAN-DILLON (Kampot, Cambodia) _ ``Under the Banyan Trees'' is what Matt Dillon calls an ``atmospheric thriller'' set in post-holocaust Cambodia. Robert Turnbull interviews Dillon, the writer, director and actor, in Cambodia where anecdotes of bizarre filming conditions abound. Dillon plays a New York insurance con man who goes to Cambodia in pursuit of a Vietnam veteran who owes him money. He encounters colorful characters (Gerard DePardieu and Stellan Skarsgard) along the road to the film's denouement in a faceoff against James Caan's corrupt expatriate.  With photo.  FILM-HOUSE (Undated) _ A hard-to-love son with blue-streaked hair and a hard-to-love and perpetually unshaven father appear to be lost causes, but in the second-chance narrative, they aren't. Molly Haskell takes a look at this genre pegged to the new film, ``Life as a House,'' starring Kevin Kline, as a once-gifted architect, who kidnaps his estranged son in the hope of enlisting his help in rebuilding a house.  With photo.  FILM-IRIS (Southwold, England) _ What everyone connected to ``Iris'' agreed they didn't want to make was a conventional disease-of-the-week movie. Instead, the aim was to animate the 43-year marriage between Iris Murdoch and John Bayley while honoring the grotesque irony of her succumbing to Alzheimer's disease: that so fearless a communicator and so deft a wielder of language should suffer an illness that blocked her ability to do both. The script shows a couple having to find a language beyond words. Judi Dench plays the older Murdoch and Kate Winslet plays her as a young woman. By Matt Wolf.  With photo.  TELEVISION  TV-BICKFORD-DREYFUSS (Pasadena, Calif.) _ When CBS began talking to Richard Dreyfuss about a television series, the 53-year-old actor told CBS he wanted to play a man of his own age ``who's uncertain about his whole life, who's having a midlife crisis, who's not sure how to deal with women, work, sex, money.'' ``I wanted to play _ me,'' he said. The result is ``The Education of Max Bickford,'' a new Sunday drama series that starts Sept. 23 in the high-profile 8 p.m. time slot following ``60 Minutes.'' By Bernard Weinraub.  MUSIC  OPERA-WAR&AMP;PEACE (New York) _ There are 27 operas based on the works of Leo Tolstoy, but the best known is Sergei Prokofiev's ``War and Peace,'' which is being performed in February at the Metropolitan Opera. It's a tall order, perhaps the tallest for any opera house to mount. Even after winnowing most of the novel away, Prokofiev was left with 71 solo roles, a chorus; 13 scenes, each requiring a set; and a running time of more than four hours. By Richard Taruskin.  MUSIC-MACY-GRAY (New York ) _ Macy Gray, the singer-songwriter whose 1999 debut album, ``On How Life Is,'' has sold three million copies in the United States, is releasing ``The Id'' on Sept. 18. The album got its title, she said, because a friend once described her as ``all id.'' Then, Gray said, ``I remembered my Psychology 101 class. The album is very automatic, spontaneous, a kind of pouring out of whatever.'' By Jon Pareles.  ART  TV-ART21 (New York) _ ``Art21: Art in the 21st Century,'' will be broadcast on PBS on Sept. 21 and 28. By getting rid of narrators, ``Art21'' has changed the genre of art on television. Behind the camera is Susan Sollins, a founder and former executive director of Independent Curators International, who inaudibly and invisibly prodded the artists to tell their stories. By Kay Larson.  With photo.  TRAVEL  (Coded `t')  TRAVEL-COLONIAL-VIETNAM (Undated) _ In search of Vietnam's colonial past, Catherine Texier found grand hotels, a post office designed by Gustave Eiffel, a classroom of girls singing ``Alouette, Gentille Alouette,'' men in berets and restaurants serving croissants and creme caramel.  TRAVEL-VIETNAM-CAFES (Undated) _ Vietnam has a cafe culture to rival Italy's, but it's not about people-watching or food. It's about coffee, because unlike the rest of Asia, Vietnam is a coffee drinking country. By Katherine Zoepf.  With 500-word box and photo.  TRAVEL-VIETNAM-ART-COPIERS (Undated) _ Day and night in open shopfronts in the central shopping district of Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, men and women with paintbrushes are turning out reproduction masterpieces. Van Gogh's sunflowers sell for $50 or $60, Impressionists are easy, say the painters, and therefore cheap. If you want, the enigmatic Mona Lisa can be ordered frowning or giggling. By Seth Mydans.  TRAVEL-WHALE-WATCHING (Undated) _ Whale watching worldwide now accounts for $1 billion in spending each year by more than nine million people who take part in excursions from almost 90 countries, according to a report published in July. By John Cushman Jr.  PRACTICAL-TRAVELER (Undated) _ With a son who loves roller coasters, the more dangerous the better, Susan Gilbert began researching to find out if her fears were justified. She found some news reassuring and some not so reassuring.  TRAVEL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ A Web operation, www.airportparkinglots.com, is offering guaranteed reserved parking at more than 40 airports in the United States and Canada. Plus items on exhibitions in Toronto, Chicago and Lafayette, La.  TRAVEL-CYBER (Undated) _ Travel Medicine experts advise using the Web to prepare for potential medical emergencies before leaving on a trip. By Bob Tedeschi.  TRAVEL-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Answers to questions about child-friendly tours to Japan, the Camino pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela and cruises that allow pets. By Florence Stickney.

, he said,	 Sean Paige, a fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, argued recently in the National Review Online that the federal government was behind what he called the ``shocking return of the shark.'' Attacks rose rapidly, he said, after the government in 1993 began mandating deep cuts in the number of sharks that could be caught for sport or profit. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, she said,	 In recent months, as her talks with Capellas progressed, Fiorina said they even ``looked carefully'' at getting out of the personal computer business altogether. But they rejected that option, she said, because PCs are an important part of the ``bundle'' of computer technology and services that corporate customers want. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, she said,	 The merger with Compaq, Fiorina insisted, is a deal that ``makes sense in good times or bad,'' but she conceded that ``tough times'' brought things to a head. What began nearly a year ago as a conversation with Capellas about sharing technology, she said, gradually escalated into a merger deal. For the last few months, Hewlett-Packard board members were informed of the progress of the talks. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

He was tempted to think of them as rude until he learned that not all Americans talk with people they do not know. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, she says,	 But, she says, she is trying. She more than quadrupled the number of patrol hours, from 4,432 last year to 19,127 this year. To do so, she borrowed gendarmes from Brussels, assigned overtime and created units that focus on serving as an aggressive presence on the streets. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, she said,	 Fiorina said she expects the merger to save $2.5 billion a year in costs, but the company will not cut back on marketing budgets. To explain the product transitions and branding decisions to customers, she said, ``We think we need to spend as much as the two companies have been spending to date.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he wrote,	 In Bellweather, the news magazine for Penn's School of Veterinary  Medicine, Dr. Robert Poppenga, associate professor of pathology, wrote  that such holistic treatments can be dangerous, citing the case of a  7-year-old female German shepherd who died after being treated with  pennyroyal oil, a natural flea repellent. The cause, he wrote, was  pennyroyal oil toxicosis. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, she added,	 If the current rate of decline continues, she added, the day may come when the threat of shark attacks is nonexistent because there will be few sharks to worry about. Sharks account for just 1 percent of all the species fished in the world, but they are slow to reproduce and take up to 14 years to mature. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, I think,	 There, his passion remained fiscal policy, and he was instrumental in pushing through a law requiring automatic budget cuts if deficits were not reduced. ``He was a brilliant tactician,'' said former Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., who co-sponsored that law. ``His strength was his knowledge and his quickness and his ability to see daylight and run for it. His weaknesses are, I think, Phil could be kind of hard on people sometime.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 The 1990s were hard times for Richard Dreyfuss. He was growing older, roles were getting scarcer and the films he did make were often disappointing. And worse, he said, he simply grew tired of acting. ``I felt desolate because I was so indifferent to my work,'' Dreyfuss said. ``I just stopped. I kept thinking, `How is this happening to me?''' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, she added,	 ``He wanted to play a professor, a character more in the muck of it, a man who deals one on one with students,'' Yorkin said. It was also appealing, she added, to present a man who had spent most of his career teaching at a women's college who was surrounded by women in his personal life; the school in the show, Chadwick College, is designed to resemble Smith College in Massachusetts. That Dreyfuss had always fantasized that he would one day turn to teaching history cemented the idea. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 Dreyfuss saw ``Mr. Holland's Opus'' as an oasis in a career that had foundered. In the 1990s, he said, he spent months simply taking walks, visiting bookstores and spending time with family and friends. ``I was in a slump for a long time,'' he said. ``After `Mr. Holland's Opus,' I went back into the slump. I went off the radar. I wasn't pitching anything to studios. The little power battery in me just died. In some ways it was perfectly OK I was, like, gone.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 He sought out television, he said, because of the appeal of playing a man very much like himself _ which would be improbable in a feature film _ and because of obligations to his family. CBS accommodated Dreyfuss when he asked that the series, at least in its opening season, be made in the New York area; one of his three children from his marriage to the writer and producer Jeramie Rain is in her senior year at the Horace Mann School in the Bronx. (He married Janelle Lacey, an accountant, in 1996.) Next year he plans to return to Los Angeles, where he also has a home, and the series, if it is renewed, will be filmed there. But Dreyfuss is a bit weary of Los Angeles. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 Speaking of the 1970s and early 1980s, Dreyfuss said: ``They were active years for me. Throw a rock in any direction and you'd hit one of my addictions.'' The car crash, he said, ended his problem with drinking and drugs. ``I almost got killed,'' he said. ``After that I sobered up.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he snapped,	 Asked again if he would veto bills that required tapping Social Security, he snapped, ``I addressed your question.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he says,	 Since filmmakers have had nearly 50 years in which to tackle ``The Lord of the Rings,'' the timing of this production seems striking. Is Tolkien flying from page to screen on Rowling's robe-tails? Unlikely, as an executive producer, Mark Ordesky, points out: Jackson had been working on of the Rings'' for two years when Rowling's first book was published. Still, he says, the two projects have complemented each other. Heyman, too, sees the films as companions in arms, not opposing forces. ``I hope `The Lord of the Rings' is brilliant,'' he says. ``It can only serve us well if it is.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, you think,	 ``When something like this first happens, you think, OK, now what?''  he said. ``But you have to believe. I don't think anybody ever really  thinks it's not going to work out well. Even if you never come out, you  think it's going to work out well.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, you know,	 ``And that's when I could relax for the first time, you know, in a  couple of days,'' he said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, it seems,	 The answer, it seems, is that we weren't very good at counting. Last month's revision by government statisticians marked down U.S. growth rates in each of the last three years, with the biggest markdown for 2000. At 4.1 percent growth was good, but not as good as we thought it was. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 Kunstler, echoing sentiments from several other industry analysts _ and evidently from investors, who sold the two companies stock Tuesday _ said the proposed merger partners would be better off in the long run if kept separate. ``In terms of creating better value'' for shareholders, he said, ``They were better off not doing this.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 The pair said the merger talks grew out of a brief, and unrelated, discussion several months ago about licensing. But Capellas said the conversation revealed that there were numerous levels on which the companies could work together. After that, he said, in a subsequent conversation, ``we got through the basics in 20 minutes in a phone call.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

Even when users do set their computers to reject cookies, he said, ``what you find is Web sites require them.'' Even some major Web sites, including The New York Times on the Web, do not function properly when cookies are rejected. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 As more people move more of their lives onto the Internet, Westin explained, longstanding boundaries between the groups have shifted. Until the 1990s, he said, those in the unconcerned group made up about 20 percent of the population, and privacy fundamentalists stood at about 25 percent; the pragmatists occupied the middle 55 percent. But a recent poll by Westin showed that the group of unconcerned Americans had shrunk by nearly half, to just 12 percent of the population; the people who shifted, in general, joined the ranks of the pragmatists: not radicalized, but more wary than before. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

The Kimbell is intentionally small _ slightly more than 300  objects, each of impeccable quality.

Search engines, they say, expose their sites to people who are merely interested in finding a picture to copy and paste.

STEVENSON c.2001 New York Times News Service  WASHINGTON _ President Bush said on Friday that ``too many people are losing their jobs,'' and cast the surge in the unemployment rate as reason for Congress to advance his economic agenda by expanding trade agreements and reducing energy costs while holding down government spending.  ``The slowdown is real and it's affecting too many lives, and we're concerned about it,'' Bush said. ``Any American out of work is too many Americans out of work.''  His hastily arranged appearance outside the Oval Office Friday afternoon reflected growing concern among his aides and officials throughout his party that the deteriorating economic and budget outlook could cost both the White House and congressional Republicans in political terms.  With Wall Street tumbling on word that the unemployment jumped last month to 4.9 percent, a full percentage point above where it was on Election Day 10 months ago, Bush spoke to reporters with Vice President Dick Cheney and the leaders of his party in Congress at his side. The country, he said, needs a ``growth plan'' to reverse a downturn that he pointedly noted started before he took office.  But Bush, the son of a president whose loss in 1992 was widely blamed on a failure to address the last recession more aggressively, seemed mostly intent on assuring voters that he is in touch with what the weakened economy means to individuals.  ``I want the American people to know we're deeply concerned about the unemployment rates and we intend to do something about it,'' he said.  But he did not say what he intends to do, beyond pushing for policies he has been pressing all along and waiting for his tax cut to give the economy a kick. As he did in selling his tax cut, Bush used the changing economic situation as further justification for initiatives that he proposed long before the downturn became apparent.  They included seeking authority from Congress to negotiate international trade agreements. Such a step might benefit the economy in the long run by increasing opportunities to sell American goods abroad, but would be very unlikely to come in time to influence the current business cycle.  Bush also renewed his call for Congress to take steps, such as opening up new areas to oil and gas drilling and reducing regulatory restrictions on energy companies, that could reduce energy costs. Energy prices, however, have already fallen in recent months without any major actions by the government, substantially reducing their drag on the economy.  Bush's aides said he was confident that the tax cut he signed into law three months ago, combined with the Federal Reserve's campaign of interest rate cuts, would lead the economy to start rebounding by the end of the year.  (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)  The Treasury Department on Friday sent out the eighth of ten batches of tax rebate checks of up to $300 for individuals and $600 for couples, money that the administration said should help keep consumers spending as the economy goes through a temporary rough patch.  Further cuts in income tax rates will take effect in January. Bush has declined to back a push by Republican leaders in Congress for a quick reduction in the capital gains tax, saying the rebate checks and rate cuts should be enough.  ``The president is confident that the plan that is in place will work,'' said Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman. ``The best advice of the economists, private sector and public sector, even taking into account rising unemployment, has been that the economy is projected to come back late this year and next.''  (END OPTIONAL TRIM)  The president spoke after Democrats stepped up their attacks on the administration's handling of the budget and the economy, saying Bush had squandered the surplus on an excessive tax cut, pushing up interest rates on Wall Street and undermining confidence among consumers.  (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)  ``The unemployment level now is at the highest it has been in four years,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic majority leader. ``We're at 4.9 percent, and that's intolerable. I think it's a reflection, unfortunately, of the Bush budget and the Bush economy.''  Democrats have been working to link the shrinking budget surplus to questions about Bush's economic management, in part by arguing that Bush's tax cut is forcing the government to violate pledges by both parties not to use excess funds generated by Social Security for other government programs.  (END OPTIONAL TRIM)  A few Republicans, including Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, have suggested that using a portion of the retirement system's surplus would be an acceptable way of easing pressure on both the economy and the budget. Bush and most Republican leaders, however, have stuck to their vows not to touch the Social Security money.  (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)  Some Republicans floated a plan Friday under which any further dissipation of the surplus next year that might force the budget to use Social Security money would trigger an automatic, across-the-board spending cut.  The idea was discussed at the White House on Friday by J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the speaker of the House, and Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican minority leader in the Senate.  Republicans said the idea had considerable political appeal, but many practical problems. Among them, they said, is concern that cutting spending in response to a weakening economy would run counter to what traditional economic theory says a government should do when confronted with a recession or the risk of one.  Typically, governments have increased spending during economic slowdowns to give the economy a boost. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010907.0322 type=story > <HEADLINE>     Gordon's greatest competition is himself </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> RICHMOND, Va.

FILM-VIETNAM-GREENE (Hanoi, Vietnam) _ The filming of Graham Greene's novel ``The Quiet American'' is the most ambitious film project made in Vietnam since the war ended in 1975. On its surface, it is the story of a love triangle involving a naive American secret agent, a world-weary English journalist and a determined Vietnamese woman. The book, published in 1955, is read today as a prescient warning of the American involvement in Vietnam. As for Michael Caine, who plays the journalist, he says journalists will be pleased. ``I get the girl and I get the story. What more do you want?'' By Seth Mydans.

FILM-GOSFORD-ALTMAN (London) _ In ``Gosford Park,'' Robert Altman casts an American eye on the English class system during a weekend shooting party in 1932. The film has no starring roles, but some of the extras include the aristocrats of British drama: Sir Michael Gambon, Sir Derek Jacobi, Dame Eileen Atkins, and Dame Maggie Smith, plus Alan Bates, Kristin Scott Thomas, Emily Watson and Charles Dance. The film opens Dec. 7. By Kristin Hohenadel.  With photos NYT17 and NYT18 sent on Sept. 5.  FILM-ALI-MANN (New York) _ Michael Mann's ``Ali,'' starring Will Smith, opens Dec. 7. It's about the real Ali, Mann says. ``We show him at his best, defying the U.S. government, refusing to be inducted into the Army and losing three and a half years of his career for it. We also show him at his worst, taunting and insulting his black opponents and cheating on his wife. This isn't an idealized Ali.'' By Allen Barra.  With photos NYT14 and NYT15 sent on Sept. 5.  FILM-BANYAN-DILLON (Kampot, Cambodia) _ ``Under the Banyan Trees'' is what Matt Dillon calls an ``atmospheric thriller'' set in post-holocaust Cambodia. Robert Turnbull interviews Dillon, the writer, director and actor, in Cambodia where anecdotes of bizarre filming conditions abound. Dillon plays a New York insurance con man who goes to Cambodia in pursuit of a Vietnam veteran who owes him money. He encounters colorful characters (Gerard DePardieu and Stellan Skarsgard) along the road to the film's denouement in a faceoff against James Caan's corrupt expatriate.  With photos NYT12 and NYT13 sent on Sept. 5.  FILM-HOUSE (Undated) _ A hard-to-love son with blue-streaked hair and a hard-to-love and perpetually unshaven father appear to be lost causes, but in the second-chance narrative, they aren't. Molly Haskell takes a look at this genre pegged to the new film, ``Life as a House,'' starring Kevin Kline, as a once-gifted architect, who kidnaps his estranged son in the hope of enlisting his help in rebuilding a house.  With photo NYT16 sent on Sept. 5.  FILM-IRIS (Southwold, England) _ What everyone connected to ``Iris'' agreed they didn't want to make was a conventional disease-of-the-week movie. Instead, the aim was to animate the 43-year marriage between Iris Murdoch and John Bayley while honoring the grotesque irony of her succumbing to Alzheimer's disease: that so fearless a communicator and so deft a wielder of language should suffer an illness that blocked her ability to do both. The script shows a couple having to find a language beyond words. Judi Dench plays the older Murdoch and Kate Winslet plays her as a young woman. The film is not yet scheduled for release. By Matt Wolf.  With photos NYT19 and NYT20 sent on Sept. 5.  TELEVISION  TV-BICKFORD-DREYFUSS (Pasadena, Calif.) _ When CBS began talking to Richard Dreyfuss about a television series, the 53-year-old actor told CBS he wanted to play a man of his own age ``who's uncertain about his whole life, who's having a midlife crisis, who's not sure how to deal with women, work, sex, money.'' ``I wanted to play _ me,'' he said. The result is ``The Education of Max Bickford,'' a new Sunday drama series that starts Sept. 23 in the high-profile 8 p.m. time slot following ``60 Minutes.'' By Bernard Weinraub.  MUSIC  OPERA-WAR&AMP;PEACE (New York) _ There are 27 operas based on the works of Leo Tolstoy, but the best known is Sergei Prokofiev's ``War and Peace,'' which is being performed in February at the Metropolitan Opera. It's a tall order, perhaps the tallest for any opera house to mount. Even after winnowing most of the novel away, Prokofiev was left with 71 solo roles, a chorus; 13 scenes, each requiring a set; and a running time of more than four hours. By Richard Taruskin.  MUSIC-MACY-GRAY (New York ) _ Macy Gray, the singer-songwriter whose 1999 debut album, ``On How Life Is,'' has sold three million copies in the United States, is releasing ``The Id'' on Sept. 18. The album got its title, she said, because a friend once described her as ``all id.'' Then, Gray said, ``I remembered my Psychology 101 class. The album is very automatic, spontaneous, a kind of pouring out of whatever.'' By Jon Pareles.  ART  TV-ART21 (New York) _ ``Art21: Art in the 21st Century,'' will be broadcast on PBS on Sept. 21 and 28. By getting rid of narrators, ``Art21'' has changed the genre of art on television. Behind the camera is Susan Sollins, a founder and former executive director of Independent Curators International, who inaudibly and invisibly prodded the artists to tell their stories.

TRAVEL-VIETNAM-ART-COPIERS (Undated) _ Day and night in open shopfronts in the central shopping district of Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, men and women with paintbrushes are turning out reproduction masterpieces. Van Gogh's sunflowers sell for $50 or $60, Impressionists are easy, say the painters, and therefore cheap. If you want, the enigmatic Mona Lisa can be ordered frowning or giggling. By Seth Mydans.

MONEY AND BUSINESS (Coded `f')  IBM-R&AMP;D (Undated) _ When it comes to research and development, IBM is now the power corporation, not Bell Labs of AT&AMP;T. IBM has the most patents, the best recruiting record for scientists and the biggest budget ($600 million). It also managed to earn $1.7 billion in licensing fees in 2000. One reason that IBM Research is so effective is that the company treats its labs like businesses. By Barnaby J. Feder.  With photo and graphics.

They are either making money or saving money on their investments to safeguard the environment. By Claudia H. Deutsch.  MARKET-WATCH (Undated) _ Enron, the giant energy trading company in Houston, Enron closed on Friday at $31.57, down 62 percent for the year. The slide has destroyed more than $38 billion in shareholder value. The company's problems are partly the result of the collapse in natural gas prices this year and investor fears of a coming glut in electricity. But the deepest wound at Enron is self-inflicted. Insider selling, indecipherable accounting practices and a stream of executive departures have combined to create a growing credibility gap between the company and Wall Street. By Alex Berenson.

Henriques.  With graphic on top books on business.  SOLAR-INTERNET (Undated) _ In the United States, solar energy companies have had decent sales as an environmentally friendly complement to the existing power grid, but the fastest-growing business for solar energy companies is providing electricity in rural areas of the world that have no reliable power source. Not only are these companies getting people in Third World countries to forsake kerosene, they are selling them on the advantages of the Internet. By David Lipschultz.  With photo.  COLUMNS  ECON-COLUMN (Undated) _ Everyone knows about the gross domestic product, which tracks the value of all the goods and services that the nation produces. So far, it is rising just enough to keep the economy out of recession. But net domestic product, which is GDP minus depreciation on capital goods, is shrinking and NDP is a truer measure of living standards. By Louis Uchitelle.  With graphic.  MYMONEY-MYLIFE-COLUMN (Undated) _ Chris Rapalje, a survivor of drastic layoffs at a telecom in Atlanta, wonders whether those who got laid off might not be the real winners. The office today is a pressure cooker. There is zero room for blunders. There are so many people with doctor's appointments Rapalje wonders if people are as sick as the company's $2 stock or are they job hunting?

By Patrick McGeehan.  INVEST-BONDS (Undated) _ Through August, corporate bonds have been on a pace to return more than 14 percent this year. Municipal bonds are on track to return 10 percent, which is an after-tax return over 15 percent for top-bracket investors. While junk bonds, at 9 percent, and Treasury bonds and notes, at 8 percent, still look fabulous when compared with the negative performance of stocks. But as the summer ends, investors might want to consider whether the good news can continue. By Jonathan Fuerbringer.  With graphic.

Options traders must tread a fine line, however. By Dan Colarusso.  SHORTS  JOB-OPENINGS (Undated) _ Job recruiters say that a few industries are still looking to fill positions.

The Ameritor Industry Fund, which held the dubious distinction of performing more poorly than the S&AMP;P 500 for 11 straight years, has been liquidated, according to a July filing with the Securities Exchange Commission.

By Micheline Maynard.  With graphic.  ABOUTCARS-CAMRY (Undated) _ While Detroit has put most of its marketing muscle into high-profit, truck-based vehicles, Japanese manufacturers _ in particular, Toyota _ have been busy covering all bets. Toyota's latest is a new version of the Camry, the best-selling family sedan in America for the last four years. It is bigger, quieter, more powerful, carries a lower sticker price and is Lexus-like in its attention to detail. By Peter Passell.  With photo.  TOYOTA-MEN (Ann Arbor, Mich.) _ Toyota is making an effort to sell more Camrys to men. Why? Men are more emotional when buying cars and in a competitive market emotion may make for easier sales. Their new advertising is pitched to a 49-year-old man who earns $60,000. By Micheline Maynard.  STYLE  (Coded `l')  PET-BEREAVEMENT (New York) _ Not so long ago, grieving for a pet was a hush-hush affair. The death itself happened on the road or in a veterinarian's office. Today not only are there support groups and grief counselors, but there are also memoirs, self-help videos and commemorative Web sites. Not to mention the comfort derived from custom-built coffins, urns, mausoleums built for two _ pet and pet owner _ and National Pet Memorial Day on Sept. 9. By Julie V. Iovine.

FASHION-CAVALLI (Florence, Italy ) _ Some think Roberto Cavalli's feathered evening clothes, rhinestone-encrusted jeans and python pants are vulgar, but for many he has the right touch of flamboyance. Ruth LaFerla interviews him at his farmhouse and describes it as including a helicopter, medieval tower, zebra-striped lounge chairs, 12th-century Madonna and a room that looks like a well-appointed opium den.  With photo NYT6 sent on Sept. 7.  NIGHTOUT-COUPLAND (New York) _ Douglas Coupland, whose novel ``13th Gen'' defined Generation X, has now written ``All Families Are Psychotic.'' Last week, he celebrated the book and ``Spike,'' his sculpture show at the Totem Gallery. The show and the novel are both related to a family crisis: Two years ago his niece was born without a left hand, a birth defect that showed up as a ``spike'' in the incidence of birth defects in his native Vancouver.

On the dress page:  MEXICO-MIGRATION-REVIEW (Mexico City) _ The end of the Cold War opened up new routes to the world's centers of capital, setting off a great migration not seen since the calamitous 1940s. Tens of millions of people cross international borders illegally every year. Some are fleeing poverty, some oppression. Some are simply looking for a job. Since Mexico's border is the most open path to the United States, millions try to cross it. This is the world in which U.S. and Mexican leaders have decided to rewrite their mutual rules of the road for migration. The route across their border was well-traveled long before globalization and its discontents, but it has been made more labyrinthine by new political and economic forces. By Tim Weiner. (Moved in `i' category)  BUSH-DEMS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Talk about shark season. Congress came back into session last week, and the Democrats were circling, sensing blood in the political waters. The Republicans had an air of panic. Only last spring, the Democrats were unable to stop President Bush's $1.35 trillion, 10-year tax cut. But with the economy slowing, the budget surplus shrinking and Bush in danger of having to break his pledge not to dip into the Social Security surplus, Democrats have returned to Washington crowing, `` I told you so.'' By Alison Mitchell. WITH PHOTO NYT2. (Moved in `a' category)  _ Also moved in the `a' category:  FBI-CIA-REVIEW (Washington) _ Robert Mueller has been installed as FBI director with a mandate to reform the bureau. But if the CIA is any guide, a simple change in leadership is merely an uncertain start. In fact, the CIA's lesson may well be that in federal agencies in crisis, creating fundamental change can be nasty, brutish _ and prolonged. The leaders who make the first attempts at reform may not survive the political and bureaucratic heat they inevitably provoke. And the end result can be, not a restoration of the strength and reliability of a crucial institution, but a permanent erosion of that institution's power and influence. By James Risen.  MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST-REVIEW (Washington) _ The Bush administration's retrenchment in the Microsoft antitrust case seems to epitomize its belief that government should not play a decisive role in business affairs, and that market forces should dictate how companies compete. Some antitrust experts and some state officials wonder whether it will be possible to curb a pervasive corporate culture through a consent decree. In any case, it will require years of close and onerous supervision by the judiciary and law enforcement, an outcome the Clinton administration and the states rejected last year in favor of a breakup. By Stephen Labaton. WITH PHOTO NYT 1.  BUSH-SPORTS-REVIEW (Washington) _ President Bush will toss a coin in the White House Rose Garden to open the 2001 National Football League season, an act that will further burnish the president's credentials as the nation's First Fan. Presidents are far more accustomed to throwing the first pitch to open a Major League Baseball season. But Bush, an avid sports fan who was a part-owner of the Texas Rangers, will have the honor of being the first chief executive to launch a professional football season. By Don Van Natta Jr.  BASEBALL-PERSONAL-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the growing tendency of baseball teams to respect players' personal lives more than when they were paid one hundredth as much. Players are routinely given three days off to attend the birth of a child; their predecessors got no such furloughs. Shawn Green of the Los Angeles Dodgers will sit out a key game against the San Francisco Giants on Sept. 26 in observance of Yom Kippur. He is the first prominent baseball player to do so since 1965, when the Dodgers' Sandy Koufax declined to pitch the first game of the World Series. By Alan Schwarz.  RACIST-MEMORABILIA-REVIEW (Undated) _ As predictably as people will scour even the darkest cultural crawl spaces for lucrative pieces of the past, so too, it seems, will industrious sorts seek to manufacture fakes _ and the booming trade in racist memorabilia is not immune. Slave shackles, Sambo imagery and other racist memorabilia have all been reproduced in recent years, collectors say, and eventually sold on the market as authentic period pieces.

SIMPSONS-PHILOSOPHY-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Academia has turned its gaze to ``The Simpsons.'' A new collection of essays called ``The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer,'' dissects the show's many cultural and political messages _ both liminal and subliminal.  BOOKS-SPONSORS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Remember the good old days when commercials stopped once you turned off the television? Now it's not even safe to curl up in an armchair with a good book anymore. By Jenny Lyn Bader.  THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.  _ Also moved in the `i' category:  REFUGEES-EUROPE-REVIEW (London) _ The 1951 U.N. Convention on Refugees was an acknowledgment of a new global commitment to human rights. But since it took effect, the world has changed almost beyond recognition. Modern travel has made movement between countries easier. And with each new war, each new brutal regime, each new flood or drought or earthquake, the number of displaced persons has increased still more. With the floods of people seeking refuge has come a reluctance on the part of other countries to offer it to them. Nowhere is the confusion over how to handle refugees more clearly illustrated than in Europe, where each country has its own ideas about who qualifies as a refugee under the 1951 convention and its own rules for dealing with immigrants. By Sarah Lyall.  NAZI-HUMOR-REVIEW (Undated) _ The 1960s sitcom ``Hogan's Heroes'' is going to be made into a feature film, while on Broadway packed houses are saluting the ``The Producers,'' with its number that has dancers form a twirling swastika. Some Germans, however, are holding their applause, and wondering whether Hitler can really ever be an object of fun. What, some also wonder, does the humor about the Third Reich say about Americans? The answer may help define the limits of laughter as therapy for a painful past. By Alan Cowell.  JAPAN-JOBS-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ This is a moment of great peril for the Japanese economy, but it may be a moment of great opportunity as well. Japan's fabled lifetime employment system died over a decade ago, but many economists say the failure to create fluid new labor markets, where changing jobs mid-career can be a commonplace, has a lot to do with the country's persistent, decade-long crisis. Yet, even as they are cut loose by their companies, many Japanese have managed to maintain great optimism despite the psychic trauma that record unemployment has taken on the Japanese as a whole. And they could prove the key to giving this society new hope. By Howard w. French.  STORY QUESTIONS OR RERUNS:  The Weekend Supervisor is Lynn Hoogenboom.

TOP  Lede story:  BUSH-CHALLENGES (Washington) _ Challenges President Bush will face in the fall. By Richard L. Berke and David E. Sanger.  With photos NYT 10 sent Sept. 7; NYT 1 sent Sept. 5; NYT 9 sent Sept. 4 and NYT13 sent Aug. 31.  (We plan to move the story by 3 p.m. ET in ``w'' news file.)  Top center story:  CHINA-EXECUTIONS (Hefei, China) _ China routinely executes more people than all other countries combined. This year, though, has been far from routine. Without much notice at home or abroad, the government has begun sending unknown thousands of people to execution grounds, often after they have been tortured into confessing crimes that to foreigners seem minor. By Craig S. Smith.  With map.  Off-lead story:  ISRAEL-MOOD (Jerusalem) _ To someone who last lived here in 1995, the darkened mood, among Palestinians as well as Israelis, is as enveloping as a shroud. There was a sense in the mid-1990s that these long-suffering combatants had come to grips with the fact that they were destined to go through life together and that they might finally figure out how to share their postage-stamp-sized land. Now, they seem doomed to claw at each other into the far future. Everyone, especially in Jerusalem, has a gremlin inside whispering that it may not be safe. By Clyde Haberman.  With photos NYT 2,3 sent Sept. 7.  FOLD  SCHOOLS-JUNK-FOOD (Undated) _ For countless American children, breakfast or lunch drops out of a vending machine at school: a can of soda, perhaps, washing down a chocolate bar or a bag of potato chips. Now a growing number of states are striking back, trying to curb the rise in childhood obesity by placing strict limits on the sale of candy, soda and fatty snack foods in schools. By Greg Winter.  With graphic.  2-graf refer:  CINCINNATI-RACE (Cincinnati) _ Talk has been sounding more precious than cheap this summer along the deep racial divide laid bare in civil rights protests and running violence on the streets here last spring. There has been an unusual effort to mine candid talk about grievances as the means for settling a pending racial profiling lawsuit against the city and the police. By Francis X. Clines.  (Scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in ``a'' news file.)  BOTTOM  ARRANGED-MARRIAGE (Morristown, Tenn.) _ Casey Moss and Kara Price never dated one another. Yet two years ago, when Kara was 14 and Casey was 20 and heading off to medical school, they pledged their lives to one another in an improvised ceremony at their church that they called a betrothal. While their story may seem a throwback to a quaint Victorian age, Casey and Kara are actually on the front edge of a small but growing movement among conservative Christian youth who are rejecting the dominant culture's approach to dating and romance.

NFL PREVIEW  FBN-PREVIEW-OFFENSE (Undated) _ Winning with defense is on the mind of every NFL team this season, but in their hearts, offense still rules. Offense, and particularly the passing attack, remains the sexy part of the game, the fans' favorite, the league rulemakers' desire, the players' fancy. And the way the game is now played, when you find a top-notch offense, you find a team that uses the slot receiver as a potent weapon. By Thomas George. 1,300 words. With graphic.  FBN-PREVIEW-DEFENSE (Undated) _ For much of football history, the middle linebacker was the most glamorous and most feared position on defense. The position was made exceptionally popular by a nonpareil group from the late 1950s until about 1970, considered the golden age of middle linebackers. But after Dick Butkus retired, the middle linebacker became less of a factor as teams went from a four-man defensive line front with three linebackers _ a scheme that allowed the middle linebacker to be the star _ to a 3-4 alignment of three linemen and four linebackers. Now, as often happens in football, a cycle is repeating itself and middle linebackers, like old movie stars making a triumphant return to the screen after a long absence, are again dominating football. By Mike Freeman. 1,800 words. With graphic.  FBN-PREVIEW-CONTRACTS (Undated) _ For several players, this is their money season. It is the year their contracts expire and they audition once again for their current teams or, if they gain free agency in 2002, for new ones.

, he said,	 Leading someone on is prohibited in the Bible, he said, citing a passage from First Thessalonians that warns against ``defrauding.'' His first book opens with a bride's nightmare in which her groom stands at the altar, holding hands with the phantoms of all his previous girlfriends. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he writes,	 In his book, Clark advocates ``Lordship dating'' and encourages couples to set boundaries mindful of God's will for them to remain pure. He warns girls not to flirt, or brush against boys, or hug. If you must hug, he writes, ``you can either put your hand out to protect your chest, or you can stand far enough away to make it a light hug.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he says,	 It seems like just yesterday, he says, that he was taking them on long hikes and campouts in the mountains -- turning a bunch of Depression-era boys into men who would go off and fight a war. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he sits,	 The dogs are trained to work under tough conditions and learn to detect the smell by being rewarded with food. When the dog smells something, he sits, and when the investigator asks, the dog will point with his nose. And that nose has led to some breaks in fire investigations. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 On the Middle East in particular, he said, Europeans have been careful to keep a unified line with Washington, so that one side could not be played against another. He said he hoped a Peres-Arafat meeting could be arranged this week in the Middle East, to be followed by further meetings at the U.N. General Assembly session in New York. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he added,	 ``We have to avoid any impression that we are creating even a de facto NATO protectorate in Macedonia,'' Fischer said. Macedonia is not Kosovo, he added, saying: ``It is a democracy and a sovereign government and a member of NATO's Partnership for Peace, and we must be very sensitive to the wishes and concerns of the elected officials and the Parliament.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 International involvement remained necessary to keep the conflict from resuming, he said, particularly while the most difficult political stages of the Macedonian solution took place. He identified these stages as the return of the regular Macedonian police and army to areas now under the control of the Albanian rebels and the return of refugees of both ethnicities to their homes, both of which were best done under the eyes of civilian monitors, probably under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 The young stars show levels of flaring hundreds of times as strong and as frequent as the most powerful outbursts seen from the sun today, Feigelson said. It is as if, he said, ``this quiet yellow ball'' was once ``covered with firecrackers.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 Jeffords has been much the taciturn Yankee in the weeks since announcing his defection from the party of his ancestors on May 24, but he said on Friday night that the Senate Republican leadership was determined to ``wipe out the moderates' influence.'' He became an independent, he said, to restore that influence and to emphasize the need for the two parties to work together. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 Chafee's death in 1999 sharply reduced the influence of this faction, Jeffords said, but he had hoped that the new balance of power in the Senate would give them leverage again. For a time that seemed to work, he said. On the budget resolution, moderate Republicans joined Democrats to trim President Bush's tax cut proposal and add money for education. But when the measure went to a House-Senate conference, he said, ``all of our work was stripped out.'' Republican leaders made sure no moderates served on the conference committee, ``which was totally controlled by the right wing of the Republican leadership,'' he said. That was a ``clear signal to me that the Republican leadership had no interest nor need to work with the moderate wing of the party.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 Faced with this situation, he said, ``something radical needed to be done,'' and he quit the Republican Party and gave the Democrats control of the Senate agenda. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he conceded,	 Asked how he was being treated by fellow senators after his switch, Jeffords said things were ``pretty much back to normal.''

, it seems,	 More significant was the fact that the bad news on jobs followed bad news about consumer spending. The much-ballyhooed tax rebate, it seems, isn't having much impact. So much for cheery forecasts of imminent recovery. Now what? </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, they argued,	 Furthermore, responsible behavior can be rewarded _ and irresponsible behavior punished _ quite quickly. In 1993, in the face of a still-sluggish economy, Robert Rubin and Larry Summers urged Bill Clinton to commit himself to fiscal discipline. Such a commitment, they argued, would help keep long-term interest rates down and would do more to stimulate the economy, even in the short run, than any attempt to pump it up with deficit spending. And they were vindicated by events. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, they say,	 Such caution suggests a broader predicament. The United States has ample resources and a deep interest in curtailing the flow of drugs across its borders, but officials are nervous about being drawn into a chaotic war in Colombia that has simmered for decades and, they say, can result only in a stalemate. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, they add,	 But officials insist that they have incorporated the lessons of the past by barring U.S. troops from a combat role and broadening the presence of the state by bolstering development projects and the justice system. Through aerial spraying, they add, Colombian and U.S. teams have eradicated 62,000 acres of drug crops in the southern Putumayo province. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, they said,	 He needed to talk about economic issues differently, they said, and to spur the economy with new measures that went well beyond the recent tax cut. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, they said,	 Even before the dinner _ and before the ominous news on Friday that the unemployment rate had risen to 4.9 percent _ Bush's aides were already recalibrating his fall agenda. There will be more and more economic prescriptions, they said, diluting what was initially planned as a season devoted largely to his education agenda and talk about values under the banner of what Bush calls ``communities of character.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, she said,	 By contrast, Hughes said she was pleased in August with the small events in Texas where Bush appeared in informal settings relating to ordinary Americans. From now on, she said, there will be more of a blend of those events as well as grander appearances, like his first state dinner, held last week, which will show Bush in more of a presidential mode. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 Rothman, who is scholar in residence at the McGregor School at Antioch University, said he had never heard of conflict resolution being applied this way as an alternative to a federal civil rights suit. But whether between Jew and Arab in Jerusalem or black citizens and the police in Cincinnati, he said, the common complaint underlying group-identity conflict is the same: ``There's not enough mutual respect.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, she wrote,	 Garbarino found a leadership vacuum at Big Cypress. In effect, she wrote, no one wanted to lead. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, she says,	 Another woman likes to prepare for the Jewish Sabbath by shopping on Friday at Mahane Yehuda, a central Jerusalem market that has had its share of suicide bombers. Now, she says, she tries to do her Friday shopping very early in the morning. The crowds are sparse at that hour. Maybe a bomber will not think it worth his while. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, they say,	 But others say that a 10-year program of farm aid will only drain the evaporating budget surplus, and that the payments are not helping the neediest farmers. Instead, they say, the farm subsidy program rewards large farmers and corporations, which receive most of the money. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 Sometimes after the first contract, said Bill Polian, president of the Indianapolis Colts, more time is needed to assess a player. Sometimes, he said, after a veteran player has earned a contract or two, a season is needed to see how much he has left. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, they said,	 Drug manufacturers and distributors said they now had virtually complete control over the custody of prescription drugs, from the factory floor to the retail pharmacy. But after drugs leave the United States, they said, they could not be sure of the conditions under which the drugs are stored and handled. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, they say,	 Those who opposed the walkout say the conference on racism was custom made for America to display some of its most impressive social achievements, presented by a secretary of state who is himself descended from slaves. Instead, they say, the decision buttressed criticism of a pattern of American ``unilateralism'' and disengagement. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, they say,	 Supporters of the walkout say America could not possibly have tolerated the near hijacking of the conference by Israel's foes, whose certainty of a majority defied any effort at negotiation. The conference in Durban, South Africa, they say, was doomed from the outset. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

, he said,	 Herbert Berman, a candidate for city comptroller, said that he was not necessarily opposed to financing construction of the stadiums, as long as the teams make a substantial contribution. But, he said, the stadium deals should be made by the next mayor. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, they say,	 Giuliani has long argued that new stadiums would serve as economic generators, promoting the development of new hotels, restaurants and other businesses in the local neighborhoods. But most economists regard sports stadiums and arenas as poor public investments, providing a small number of seasonal jobs and having little impact on the economy. With only 81 home games a year, they say, it is unlikely that many new businesses will spring up beside a new stadium that has its own restaurants, game rooms and clothing shops. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 The executive director of Legal Aid, Daniel L. Greenberg, called the mayor's plan a ``frontal attack'' on the organization. The move, he said, comes as Giuliani is being forced to sit for depositions in a federal lawsuit filed by Legal Aid that accuses him of illegally retaliating against the organization because of the strike. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 Joseph DePlasco, a spokesman for Mark Green, the public advocate and another mayoral candidate, said Giuliani's move appeared to be a vendetta and added, ``It is wrong for the mayor to attempt to bind a new administration to his policies.'' Legal Aid, he said, ``is a venerable and respected institution with dedicated public interest lawyers who work for low pay.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

, he never,	 Even though he hasn't been here for three years, he never, ever really left. He firmly ingrained himself on the region's sports consciousness before he ever bounced a ball in Celtic green. Was it really 11 years ago that he was mistaken for a bank robber in Wellesley? Was it 10 years ago that he pumped up his Reeboks, soared to the basket in the Charlotte Coliseum, blinded one eye, and won the Slam Dunk championship? </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he adds,	 Brown has been an Orlando resident for some time, settling in the ultra-exclusive Isleworth section of town long before Tiger Woods was there. They're neighbors now, and Brown says he demands two shots a hole when they play golf together. Alas, he adds, ``It's still not enough.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

, he said,	 Wurst is fond of saying ``the first President Bush did more for arms control in one year than (former President Bill) Clinton did in eight.'' Now, he said, it's up to the second President Bush to follow through on campaign promises to slash the nuclear arsenal and to take thousands of weapons off quick-launch alert. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

, he said,	 In North Carolina, he said, ``I had a big house and a garden, and I rented it for $800 a month.'' It had so many rooms that he couldn't fill them with furniture. ``I had rooms where I would keep a plant,'' he said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

, he said,	 Being offered a job at Hunter was his dream. In the South, his students were very polite, he said. Here, he said, ``Hunter students are more like my friends; they'll contradict you.'' And he relates to them. ``I find I identify with my students who are struggling to get by,'' he said. They exchange tips on where to find great second-hand clothes. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

CULTURE  ANIMALS-IN-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ Animals have been part of the movie business from the very beginning, even before Rin Tin Tin first fetched the sheriff or Cheetah clambered up Johnny Weissmuller's leg.

DIABLO: William Chang has spent countless hours in front of his computer playing the wildly popular video game called Diablo II. But he's not playing to win _ he's playing to profit. The Orange County resident hunts for virtual treasures _ weapons or magical items _ that can boost a player's powers in the game. But in an unusual, entrepreneurial twist, he's taking these imaginary items and auctioning them online to other serious gamers for cold hard cash. Chang and thousands of other online treasure seekers are part of a virtual economy built on the demand for these items found in video games. Chang's biggest payoff so far was a weapon that sold for $750 on EBay. Other traders have sold items for up to $2,000. BY JOSH GREEN  MERGERS: Investors have knocked down the value of Hewlett-Packard and Compaq shares by 22.4 and 14.2 percent, respectively, since Labor Day when the computer-makers disclosed their urge to merge. But HP Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Carly Fiorina remains gung-ho about the latest potential high-tech combo. At a conference in Boston last week, she told skeptical shareholders and portfolio managers that ``these companies fit together like a zipper.'' In the argot of the mergers and acquisitions trade, Fiorina explained that the proposed $25 billion deal is ``a clear creator of shareholder value in the relatively short-term,'' providing impressive ``synergies'' and ``a very compelling platform for growth.'' Sound familiar? BY PETER SINTON  CHANG: JoMei Chang is her name and global domination _ accompanied by a soft voice and a disarming smile _ is her aim. Chang, the co-founder and chief executive officer of Sunnyvale softwaremaker Vitria Technology, makes no secret of her boundless ambition, but she doesn't boast about it either. Standing before a roomful of recruits at a recent company orientation, wearing a stylish silk suit and standing barely over 5 feet tall, Chang spelled out a corporate vision as clear as the diamonds at her throat. ``What is our goal? Our goal is worldwide dominance,'' she told the assembled troops in soft, heavily accented English. ``How do we do it? It's very simple. We do not take no for an answer.'' That's tough talk for a CEO whose company's revenue _ after five years of rapid-fire growth _ is slipping and whose once high-flying stock has slid to $2.40 from $273 at its peak in late 1999. BY CAROL EMERT  ONLINE (COLUMN): In the market for Internet service? Maybe you want a superfast DSL or cable connection, or perhaps a simpler, less-expensive hookup via America Online is more your speed. Whether you're upgrading your connection or bringing the Internet home for the first time, selecting an Internet service provider, or ISP, will depend on how familiar you are with computers and what you plan to do online. ONLINE GUIDE COLUMN BY JOHN BATTEIGER  NETWORTH (COLUMN): Has the Gap gotten too big for its britches? That's the question of the week as Gap stock sinks lower than a pair of ultralow-rise jeans. Gap shares fell to their lowest price since December 1997 last week after the San Francisco company reported that same-store sales fell 17 percent in August. It was the 16th consecutive monthly drop in sales at stores open more than a year. With $14 billion in revenue, Gap is the nation's largest specialty apparel retailer, 40 percent bigger than its closest rival, Limited. NET WORTH COLUMN BY KATHLEEN PENDER  SONICBLUE: Sonicblue Inc. chief executive Ken Potashner likes to say his company's business is ``disruptive.'' ``We use that word a lot,'' Potashner said. ``It's a good word. Disruptive technologies, disruptive products that change the status quo.'' Indeed, the Santa Clara company's best-known products, the Rio brand of MP3 digital audio players, have already helped disrupt the way the recording industry does business. Last week, Sonicblue introduced a pricey ReplayTV digital video recorder capable of storing up to 320 hours of video and sharing those files via the Internet. The firm hopes the machine will disrupt the way consumers watch TV. BY BENNY EVANGELISTA  TECH21 (COLUMN): In the wake of last week's megamerger news, at least one thing is perfectly clear: Dell Computer has become the scourge of the PC industry. Everyone else in the business is reeling from the combined effects of sagging demand and the scorched-earth price war Dell began this spring. But Dell just keeps gaining ground, and I don't see anything on the horizon that's likely to slow it down _ certainly not the tag team of Carly Fiorina and Michael Capellas. In fact, a market share of 40 percent no longer looks quite so much like the megalomaniacal fantasy I thought it was when Michael Dell, the Round Rock, Texas, company's founder and chief executive officer, began talking about that target a year or two back. Worldwide, Dell's share in the second quarter, measured in units shipped, was only 13.1 percent, according to Gartner Dataquest _ enough to put it at the head of the pack in an industry that remains highly fragmented but obviously a far cry from 40 percent. TECH 21 COLUMN BY HENRY NORR  BIOSCOPE (COLUMN): Pride, profit and a page out of biotech history will be on trial in Los Angeles during the next few weeks, as Genentech Inc. battles the City of Hope Medical Center in a dispute over whether the biotech giant owes the hospital $460 million in royalties. Stories about the dispute started appearing shortly before the trial began last week, and snippets of testimony will dribble out until early November, when a Los Angeles County Superior Court jury is expected to decide what was meant by two key clauses in the contract that launched the biotech industry. The case revolves around a contract written in 1976, when the fledgling South San Francisco firm hired two scientists at the Southern California hospital to help do what had never been done before _ splice a human gene into bacteria to produce insulin and growth hormone, two medicinal proteins.

(His producers were even more thrilled, he said, because the film is to be released in the United States.) </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

It's a metaphor for me.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

, he insists,	 Rather than plagiarism, Sahr argues, what his site really offers students is a mixture of research and inspiration. The site helps intimidated students ``get their feet wet,'' providing bibliographies and research material. Besides, he insists, students would not use his Web site to plagiarize material because it would be too easy for teachers and professors to check the site themselves. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

, he said,	 Sahr said that he and his two partners, Yasha Harari and Nimrod Carmi, did not exercise quality control. Anything and everything gets posted, he said, except for the occasional violent essay or anything that proselytizes for a political cause. As a result, a student downloading an essay has no way of knowing if the paper received an A or an F. ``We tell people, `You could be downloading garbage, and you probably are,''' Sahr said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

On its own, they agree, immersion might have had a less impressive launch. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, they say,	 Opponents of immersion argue that the gains are statistically insignificant. They also say that immersion pupils will not keep pace with fluent English speakers over the long term.

By Elisabeth Rosenthal.  PLANE-MISHAP (Toronto) _ The first reports were of an out-of-control flight salvaged at the last moment by quick thinking and heroism. But by now, the story of how a Canadian jet crossing the Atlantic survived disaster has changed into a tangle of missteps. By Barbara Crossette.  BERLIN-JEWISH-MUSEUM (Berlin) _ The tortured history of the life and destruction of Germany's Jews was on display Sunday night, as prominent politicians and cultural figures turned out for the opening of a new museum, in a building so strongly symbolic and emotionally disorienting as to overshadow the exhibit it houses.

NATIONAL _ GENERAL (Moved in ``a'' category)  TROUBLED-TEENS (Colombia, S.C.) _ Parents who have given up trying to handle troubled teen-agers on their own now have more avenues of outside help than ever. They include therapeutic boarding schools, ``emotional growth'' schools and residential treatment schools. There also are rural farms and desert boot camps, many imposing strict military or religious discipline. Some are as well-established as a prep school, others as small and informal as a teacher's home. What they have in common is cost: usually thousands of dollars a month. A special report. By Sara Rimer.  With photos NYT 13 and 20.  MISS-LAND-DISPUTE (Canton, Miss.) _ Mississippi decided last year that nothing would stop its effort to acquire a huge Nissan truck factory and finally take a place in the international economy. It successfully outbid every other competing state for the plant. As part of the package, Mississippi agreed to acquire more than 1,500 acres for the plant using the state's power of eminent domain, if necessary, to move out homeowners living on the site. And that is when this high-revving engine of Mississippi's new economy ran directly into the Archie and Bouldin families, a small but unyielding pocket of an older Mississippi that is not quite as impressed by the rush to join the global economy.

CHINA-TV-MEDIA (Shanghai, China) _ AOL Time Warner and the News Corp. are both expected to win licenses soon from the Chinese government that will allow them to broadcast television programming into a portion of southern China. That was the positive news. But behind the hoopla that will surround the announcement of licenses is the realization that about 97 percent of China's 1.26 billion people will still be barred from receiving foreign broadcasts.

The new terminal means that most passengers will no longer board and deplane on the Tarmac, where buses carried people to and from the existing terminals.  The 190,000-square-foot terminal is the largest in the United States devoted to regional flights. It has 38 gates, 24 of which offer covered jetways leading to the doors of regional jets. (US Airways uses 35, AirTran the other three.) The terminal also has a 10,000-square-foot food court and a 3,700-square-foot US Airways Club.  A free shuttle bus will take passengers to US Airways jet flights at Terminals A, B and C.

Rand McNally Now More Than Maps  Rand McNally is trying to tap the Internet and its cartographic services to create competition for AAA. The new program, Rand McNally Road Explorers, will offer roadside assistance and discounts with hotels, rental-car companies and other highway-travel service benefits.  What Rand McNally hopes will set Road Explorers apart is its members' ability to tap into the Internet to print out detailed maps, similar to those found in its road atlases, and driving directions from the Web site. AAA members have long been able to order TripTiks, customized printed itineraries with highlighted road maps, to help plan a driving vacation. They can be prepared while a member waits at AAA branches, or ordered on the Web with a 14- to 21-day wait.  The Road Explorers program, expected to be launched this month, will have two levels of subscription annual memberships. Premier ($34.95) provides the discounts and mapping services; Premier Plus ($79.95) adds roadside assistance, including four tows a year, for any family member. Information, www.randmcnally.com.  Brazilian Treasures on Loan in New York  A monumental Baroque altarpiece from Brazil will occupy the rotunda of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum as part of ``Brazil: Body and Soul,'' from Oct. 12 to Jan. 27. The exhibition, numbering around 350 objects, will include artwork from the 17th and 18th centuries as well as modern and contemporary Brazilian pieces.  The recently restored altar is approximately 45 feet high and 26 feet wide and comes from the Monastery of Sao Bento in Olinda in northeast Brazil. Other highlights of the exhibition include feather capes and other body ornaments from the Amazonian and coastal regions, as well as gold and silver jewelry.  The modern section of the exhibition will include works from the 1920s and '30s by Tarsila do Amaral, Anita Malfatti and Lasar Segall, among others. Representing the 1950s to the'70s, when the Concrete and Neo-Concrete movements were in vogue, there will be a display of works by artists including Franz Weissman, Mary Vieira, Luis Sacilotto and Sergio Camargo.  Running concurrently with the show will be a film festival, a music program and a lecture series featuring Brazilian art scholars and a symposium called ``Brazil: Visual Culture Matters.''  The Brazilian exhibition moves to the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, in March.

Kim warned of growing economic difficulties while welcoming a new cabinet that he formed after the break-up of his ruling coalition last week. Korean manufacturers, he said, should not rely so heavily on export of products such as semiconductors, whose fall on world markets is blamed for Korea's plummeting export figures. Several hours later, at a reception for the country's top business leaders, Kim said his government would remove some of the restrictions that they say have impeded them since the economic crises of 1997 and 1998.  SWITZERLAND: WTO STILL SNAGGED ON CHINA  Negotiators trying to put the final touches on China's entry into the World Trade Organization appeared to be stymied by some last-minute problems, including the conditions that will govern the expansion of the insurance company, the American International Group. Envoys insisted they could meet Thursday's deadline to usher in one of the trade arbiter's biggest members.

EDIT-TERROR-OLIVER _ Monday night on the History Channel, I watched ``Moment of Truth'' with historian and author Stephen Ambrose. It centered on World War II and the ordinary men and women who answered in various heroic ways the call to arms after our country was attacked. Each spoke of that particular moment _ in a foxhole or parachuting behind enemy lines or scaling a cliff with the enemy shooting at them like fish in a barrel _ that was for them a moment of truth. Tuesday morning, again on television, I watched history in the making. (Thomas Oliver, Atlanta Journal). MOVED.  EDIT-TERROR-JOURNAL _ In the heady days after Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, colleagues rushed to congratulate Adm. Isoroku Yamamoto, the man who had planned and executed the stunning operation.

Evers ``reverse-engineered'' his oil, he says, after tasting the oil from Fattoria Mansi Bernardini, a 350-year-old Tuscan farm. Intent on replicating that taste, he imported the same four Tuscan olive varieties in the same proportions used at Mansi Bernardini and planted 22 acres of them on his Healdsburg estate. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

NY-CHURCH-GARDEN (New York) _ You can hear the sound of water before you see it, burbling out of the fountain at the newly restored biblical garden at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine. The garden, tucked behind the church that towers over Amsterdam Avenue at 113th Street, offers solace to those in search of calm, a place to do some soul-searching or to simply contemplate a flower. This week, many people sought its benches and the shade of its grapevine-covered arbors. ``I saw many people throughout the day sitting in silence in the garden,'' the Rev. Jay Wegman said Wednesday, recalling the crowds that came on Tuesday, the day terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. You could hear sirens, he said, and children playing in the schoolyard next to the garden. By Anne Raver.  GARDEN-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Garden questions answered. By Leslie Land.

Business Day Front Page of The New York Times, Thursday, Sept. 13.  (Lede)  TERROR-ECON (Washington) _ Central banks around the world swung into action Wednesday in a coordinated effort to calm financial markets and reduce the chances that the attack on the United States would lead to a global economic crisis. By Richard W. Stevenson.  (Scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET.)  (Center display)  TERROR-MISSING-FIRM (New York) _ Until Tuesday, few people beyond the rarefied world of the government bond market had ever heard of Cantor Fitzgerald LP. But in the wake of the attack on the World Trade Center, the 57-year-old firm has emerged as a magnet for Wall Street's concern about the devastation and personal tragedy that the financial community has experienced. Of the 1,000 employees who worked at the company's headquarters on the 101st, 103rd, 104th and 105th floors of One World Trade Center, the first tower to be hit in Tuesday's attack, only about 270 had been accounted for by Monday afternoon. And almost all of those had been on vacation or otherwise out of the building. By Diana B. Henriques and Jennifer 8. Lee.  (Scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET.)  TERROR-LIABILITY (Undated) _ The families of almost everyone who died in the World Trade Center attack or in the rescue effort are entitled to some kind of compensation, lawyers and experts in employee benefits say. So are the passengers and crews of the planes that were rammed into the twin towers. Some insurers estimate that they may end up paying $30 billion to $40 billion, or at least twice as much as the worst previous insurance disaster in the United States, Hurricane Andrew in 1992. And contrary to some reports, these policies do not exclude acts of terrorism, said Dean O'Hare, the chief executive of the Chubb Group. ``If it's terrorism, it's absolutely covered,'' O'Hare said. By David Johnston and Joseph B. Treaster.  (Scheduled to move by 8 p.m. ET.)  (Center right)  TERROR-MARKET (New York) _ A reeling financial community decided late Wednesday to resume trading of bonds on Thursday but to delay the resumption of stock trading for at least one more day. ``New York is the financial capital of the world,'' Richard Grasso, the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, as he announced the decision, which was reached after a prolonged meeting of government and financial industry officials. ``It has been, it is, and it will remain so in the future.'' By Jonathan Fuerbringer and Alex Berenson.  (Scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET.)  (Bottom)  TERROR-NORRIS-COLUMN (New York) _ If the motive was to halt the operations at the heart of the capitalist system of financial trading, then the terrorist attacks on Tuesday were a success. Wednesday, dispirited people found it their duty to rapidly reconstruct an intricate financial system. So the work went on even as Wall Streeters learned which of their colleagues had died and which firms had lost the bulk of their personnel. By Floyd Norris.  (Scheduled to move by 8 p.m. ET.)

, they said,	 ``I suppose the first thing that would pop into most people's minds would be that perhaps the security of the airlines or at the airports was lax,'' said William Shernoff, a lawyer in Claremont, Calif., who represents plaintiffs in insurance cases. ``That would probably be the most fertile ground.'' The insurers' and plaintiffs' lawyers say they expect an avalanche of lawsuits against the airlines, the security companies that the airlines hired to screen passengers at the airports, and the government agencies that run the airports. In addition, they said, under a federal anti-terrorism law, families can sue any terrorist organizations that are deemed responsible, even though collecting any judgment would be next to impossible. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

Christine Levite, a spokeswoman for American Express, said that the company was trying to assist ``hundreds of thousands'' of business travelers whose trips were disrupted this week.

But when disaster struck at its heart, it seemed more like a large extended family that had just suffered unimaginable losses and was wondering just how it would right itself.  Everyone, it seemed, had a friend, family member, co-worker or competitor who had reason to be in the World Trade Center on any given day. And the attack wrought a combination of emotional wreckage and urgent pressure to sort out business issues involving billions of dollars.  COMPANIES TRY TO RESTORE ORDER  Across corporate America, senior managers and executives grappled with trying to restore at least a semblance of business as usual _ even as they knew that, emotionally at least, it was anything but. Executives, many of them stranded in cities hundreds of miles from their usual bases, set up command posts in hotels and in offices borrowed from clients and customers as they tried to run their companies and figure out how to get home.  The gears of the economy began grinding again, though many of the human beings turning the cranks needed comforting and many of their customers were depressed.  TRAVEL INDUSTRY STILL IN TURMOIL  With the nation's airports closed, thousands of travelers struggling to return home from business trips, and conferences and corporate meetings canceled, the business travel industry, including airlines, hotels and car rental companies, faces turmoil for the coming week and uncertainty about prospects in the near future.  Federal authorities said that most planes would remain grounded until extra security measures could be put in place. It could take days for the air-travel system to return to any degree of normalcy.  OPEC VOWS TO MAINTAIN OIL SUPPLY  Oil-producing countries have hurried to issue assurances that the attacks and any subsequent retaliation by the United States will not affect petroleum supplies. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which produces about 40 percent of the world's oil, said its members would not use oil as a political weapon as the U.S. reaction to the attacks takes shape in the weeks ahead.  BUSINESSES FACE LOSS OF RECORDS  As businesses began to digest the loss of life, they also had to address the loss of records. While many financial firms have automatic backups of their records, law firms are especially dependent on hard copies of documents that might be used in litigation or as legally binding originals.  EXODUS FROM NEW YORK FEARED  Some business executives, especially those in the real estate industry, expressed fear that more companies will move out of New York City to places with lower costs, more available land and fewer risks.  MEDIA COMPANIES POSTPONE PLANS  Television networks backed away from premiere dates for entertainment series; advertisers scrapped plans for product campaigns; Hollywood studios postponed dates for releases of big-budget movies; and publishers canceled promotional activities for high-profile new books. The print newsmagazines, on the other hand, are publishing special issues Thursday and Friday.  The coverage of the attacks brought tens of millions of Americans to television sets throughout Tuesday, peaking in President Bush's address to the nation, which according to preliminary figures, reached about 80 million viewers.  U.S. ACCOUNT DEFICIT NARROWS  The U.S. current account deficit narrowed in the second quarter as slowing economies around the world reduced the level of trade, government figures showed. The current account shortfall, the broadest measure of international commerce because it includes investments, shrank to $106.5 billion in the April-June period after narrowing to a revised $111.8 billion in the first quarter. As the United States and global economies have cooled, imports and exports have declined.  G.E. AND HONEYWELL APPEAL RULING  General Electric and Honeywell have appealed the European Commission's rejection of their $45 billion merger, the European Court of Justice said. The appeal is not aimed at resurrecting the deal but is an effort to nullify the ruling that GE has a dominant position in the aerospace sector. That ruling, if left unchallenged, could prevent GE from making future acquisitions. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010913.0007 type=story > <HEADLINE> ATTACK DRAWS NATION TO TV COVERAGE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-TERROR-TV-RATINGS-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

The garden, tucked behind the church that towers over Amsterdam Avenue at 113th Street, offers solace to those in search of calm, a place to do some soul-searching or to simply contemplate a flower. This week, many people sought its benches and the shade of its grapevine-covered arbors. ``I saw many people throughout the day sitting in silence in the garden,'' the Rev.

A couplet by the eighth-century poet Wang Wei, it reads, ``Walking to where the water ends, I sit and watch when clouds rise,'' and it was transcribed on the fan by the Southern Song emperor Lizong, Ma Lin's patron. Such imperial collaborations were a regular feature of Song art, though few matching pairs survive.

, I think,	 The easiest way, I think, is to mount the trap door with solid brass butt hinges, the kind used for front and back doors. The barrel of the hinges will not only show but will stick up a bit, so to solve that sticking-up problem, cut out a shallow slot so the hinges can be mounted flush. They will show, but not much, and will not stick up. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

That's pretty much where she was in the 1980s when she was starring in a string of high-profile projects like ``Missing,'' ``The River'' and ``Crimes of the Heart.'' But it's a tricky time, she said, and so easy to make a misstep. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

, I thought,	 ``This is a film that I've been meaning to look at for a while,'' Washington said. ``Partly, it's because I remember seeing it back when it came out and really liking it. But it's also because of the subject matter. In the film I'm directing, the story is partly about the relationship between a psychiatrist and his patient, who's a troubled kid, just like in this movie. I've always been a fan of Redford's work, both as an actor and as a director. So I knew I needed to see this movie again. It's been sitting there on my table at home. When this came up, I thought, all right, this is great. I'll get to see it on the big screen. That's even better.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, you know,	 ``I saw it when it first came out and, you know, I was like everyone else: I thought it was a wonderful film,'' Washington said. ``It was a very thoughtful examination of this troubled family, and I remember enjoying the way all of the relationships were so layered and complex. I wasn't surprised when it won all those Oscars. But I don't know that I've ever seen it in its entirety since it came out.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

Much of the time, he said, he has been too wrapped up in his roles to pay a whole lot of attention to what his directors were doing. That was certainly the case, he said, in his Oscar-nominated performance in Norman Jewison's ``Hurricane'' in 1999. ( Washington won the Oscar for best supporting actor for ``Glory'' in 1989.) But during the shooting of both of these most recent films, he said, knowing that he was about to direct his own film, he paid close to attention to everything: the way the director interacted with the crew, the choices about lighting, the kinds of problems that arose and how they were dispatched. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

On Tuesday, he stood at the edge of the Potomac River and looked with sadness and anger upon the dark plume of smoke rising up from the smoldering rubble of the Pentagon. ``This city means freedom to me,'' he said. ``Now, I'm really worried for our country.'' The mightiest superpower in history, it seems, has suddenly been laid naked by terrorists willing to use commerical aircraft as weapons in a war that targets civilians. What sort of sacrifice can Americans expect to make in the weeks and months ahead, as the country and its institutions gird for this grim new war? And how much, after all, can the country change and still stay true to its core calling as a beacon of freedom for the rest of the world? (Deans, Cox News Service) </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

This may be more of a pastiche of observations from Atlanta and NYC architects, including John Portman: one in Manhattan says speculation has already begun about what will take the WTC's place. Rahimzadeh explains why the WTC was the collision of a aberrant act of terrorism on the one building that would react as it did. Atlanta's skyscrapers are built differently, and would react differently. Hopefully, he said, they would survive longer. And one Atlanta architect says the bombing may have put the lid on ego trips that the trips that the Donald Trumps of the world are inclined toward.

The company had hesitated earlier to accept AIG's offer of 7,000 won ($5.50) a share because it was more than 10 percent below the stock's market price before the attacks. Controlling stakes in two other Hyundai financial businesses will also be acquired by AIG, which will spend $850 million in all; the Korean government will invest $750 million for minority interests.  SOUTH KOREA: STIMULUS PLAN  Faced with new forecasts of much slower growth, the government announced a plan to spend $8 billion on road and railroad construction, including building a rail line to the new Inchon airport and restoring a line to North Korea that has been closed since 1950. A private research institute predicted that the economy would grow only 1.7 percent, not 6 percent, in the second half of 2001.  EUROPE  SWITZERLAND: ACQUISITION TALKS  The Zurich Financial Services Group confirmed that it is in an advanced stage of negotiations with Deutsche Bank to acquire asset manager Zurich Scudder Investments. As part of the deal, Zurich may acquire Deutsche Herold and other Deutsche Bank insurance subsidiaries in Europe but hang onto its British asset manager, Threadneedle. Zurich Financial said there would be no additional statement until negotiations are completed.

ON THE SECTION FRONT  WTC-RELOCATION (New York) _ Along with offices in midtown, Alan Weil's law firm had 600 employees on five floors of One World Trade Center. When Weil got word that almost all of the employees of Sidly Austin Brown &AMP; Wood were safe, his relief was tainted by a chilling thought: if his 135-year-old firm was going to recover, he would have to act quickly. By noon, he had arranged to lease four more floors in the midtown building. Others within the firm set up delivery of 800 desks, 300 computers and cellphones by the score; contractors were hired to expand the company's computer network. You can get almost anything in New York over night, but even more important were the employees. Some walked from the rubble at the trade center to the midtown offices to report to work.

While many Saudis of his era sweltered in the desert sun, Osama bin Laden had air-conditioned houses and private stables, and was pampered by servants.

The law will prohibit lenders from forcing borrowers, who are frequently members of minority groups and the elderly, to buy certain kinds of loan insurance. It will also limit the number of points lenders can charge to 6 percent of the loan amount, prohibit repeated refinancings and prohibit loans to people who do not have the means to repay them.

A spokeswoman for the commission, Jonna VanDyk, attributed the drop in citations to successful public education programs for drivers and bartenders, like the 0.08 signs that began showing up on state roads in 1998. Since 1998 the number of citations issued annually has fallen by about 1,000, to 37,661 for 2000. There has also been a 10 percent drop in accidents involving drunken drivers and an 18 percent drop in fatalities from accidents involving these drivers since 1998.

In a meeting on Wednesday with state authorities, officials of the Minnesota Association of Professional Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 6 agreed to extend a strike deadline by two weeks, to Oct. 1, in a dispute over wages and health benefits. The unions have nearly 30,000 members, representing about 60 percent of state government workers.  SOUTH  MISSISSIPPI: ADVOCATE DROPS FLAG EFFORT  The leader of a movement to amend the state Constitution to preserve the state's flag, which includes the Confederate battle emblem, says he will halt the drive. The leader, Greg Stewart of Tunica, said he would not submit the signatures, numbering more than 90,000, that he had gathered on a petition to put on the ballot a measure keeping the flag as it is, saying a referendum last April when two-thirds of voters said they did not want change is protection enough. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010914.0004 type=story > <HEADLINE> PRESIDENT'S MISSILE DEFENSE PLAN GAINS IN WAKE OF TERROR ATTACKS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WASHINGTON (BC-TERROR-MISSILE-1STLD-WRITETHRU-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

But he added, ``I don't know when the memory of this will go away, certainly not Monday. People won't be able to play with the happiness and joy they customarily play with. The general feeling among the players, I think, is it's only baseball.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

Relatives remember the private man -- daughter Diane shares a Christmas home movie in which she fell out of the new playhouse built in the background. She was relieved to see that he had dropped the camera when she fell, she notes, because once she was aware of what had happened, Walt had already turned the camera on her receiving first aid. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

Mixing carbon dioxide into the water makes it more acidic, which potentially could harm marine organisms. Brewer doubts the amount of carbon we're likely to add will cause much harm, as the pH of seawater already varies significantly by location. Besides, he says, nature eventually delivers 80 percent of atmospheric carbon into the sea anyway: ``We already have an ocean CO2 disposal program we put it in the air and the air puts it in the ocean.''

Bechetta Jackson, Brett Hoffman, Mitch Mitchell, Darren Barbee, others.  ATTACK-RALLY  DALLAS _ Covering a tolerance rally at Thanks Giving Square by North Dallas High School, the first school to be designated an international high school. Rally is in response to attacks against Muslims and those of Arab descent. Eva-Marie Ayala.  ATTACK-ISLAM  Monitoring for any further attacks on mosques in North Texas. Other hate incidents. Developing. Byline TK  ATTACK-MOSQUES  Covering today's prayer services at local mosques. Details TK  ATTACK-AIRPORT  Going to D/FW Airport for checks and color. Also check with Love Field. Work in national information about airports. National Airport may remain closed because of approaches over government buildings. New York airports reopening? Info from airlines on how many flights flown today. Mike Lee, Maria Recio, Dan Reed.  ATTACK-AIR  The terrorists apparently all boarded planes originally at small airports, so they did not have to go back out and through the security screening at the larger airports where they made connecting flights. We look at the security measures at small airports to see whether the new security rules will make certain that this isn't a loophole in the security system. Jeff Classen, Mike Lee.  ATTACK-AIR-SECURITY  Look at how the screening devices at airports work and about the new types of security systems now available to detect weapons. What kinds of weapons can be detected? Which ones can't be? Gordon Dickson, Jeff Classen.  ATTACK-EMPLOYEES  Veteran airline employees, including many pilots, say they want further security improvements, because the new steps don't allay their fears about attacks. Talking to airline employees about their fears and about what they want to see done. Byron Okada.  ATTACK-RESERVES  Story about the call-up of reserves. Going to Fort Hood and talking with reserve units in the Metroplex. Checking Naval bases along Texas coast. John Moritz, R.A. Dyer.  ATTACK-DALLAS  Chase reports that there was a planned fifth hijacking attempt from Dallas/Fort Worth airport. Following on the two men arrested at Amtrak station in FW. DEVELOPING. Gabrielle Crist, Ginger D. Richardson, Chris Vaughn  ATTACK-TEXAS  State government pauses to remember America's victims. Checking for more price gouging reports and the status of Texas Task Force 1 that is poised to deploy the state's search and rescue specialists. Byline TK  ATTACK-COLLAPSE  A look at why and how WTC towers collapsed. Structural engineers say collapse was inevitable because of fire. Some also say that the firefighters and police should have been pulled out earlier, because the timing of the collapse could have been predicted by a technical expert on the scene. May not make today. Rebeca Rodriguez  ATTACK-CHILDREN  Children's views and thinking about the attacks. Letters they have written, and other writing from them to show how this has affected young people. Byline TK  ATTACK-IMMIGRANTS  How are our littlest immigrants dealing with the pain and tragedy that comes with the terroristic acts against the World Trade Center and Pentagon? We talk to young immigrants from countries like Mexico and as far away as Congo. Many don't speak English. They have been talking about what it means to be an immigrant now in a country of immigrants, about patriotism and how to treat immigrants from the Middle East with respect.  ATTACK-SPEND  Will consumers stop spending as the nation remains focused on the terrorist attack? We talk with shoppers, restaurants, movie theaters, retailers, car dealers, etc. to find out. Some shoppers say they're not going to stop spending money. But experts expect consumer spending to slow. Movie theaters have been sparse this week and some restaurants have already felt the effects.  ATTACK-SOUTHWEST  Southwest Airlines resumes service today. Checking to see how operations are proceeding. Southwest, which has profited by its ability to quickly turn its planes around, faces a particular challenge with the new security procedures.  ATTACK-PAY  A number of employees aren't getting paid because their checks were to be flown in. One is Michael Benesik at Simplified Employment. One thousand people need paychecks, and they are being driven in from Detroit.

, she wrote,	 Indeed, Scarry suggested that the desire to describe pain objectively (and by describing it, remove it) is, in one sense, a creative force. When people forge tools or build things, they are often trying to alleviate discomfort. But first they must define the discomfort. To use a mundane example, she wrote, ``the human body, troubled by weight, creates a chair; the chair recreates him to be weightless.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

, he said,	 But acknowledging, even accepting, individual frailty is drastically different from being willing to accept that our country is penetrable. Most citizens may choose fury and a desire for retaliation instead. ``After the fear and dismay, people will be experiencing a great deal of anger,'' said Elliot Aronson, a social psychologist and professor emeritus at the University of California at Santa Cruz. Quick work by the government in identifying the culprits, he said, would focus the anger and allow the country to move forward. ``Anger can be a very healthy emotion leading to feelings of strength and resolve rather than helplessness and despair.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, they say,	 Anger and retaliation, however, will not be healing for our nation, psychologists suggest. They are only the first steps of a disorderly, uncertain process. Some of the needed ingredients, they say, are restoration of national security, our leaders' expressions of grief, large and small symbols to honor the dead. But impediments to healing _ from lack of confidence in our military and political leaders to war itself _ could well dominate for some time. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

, they said,	 Those who expressed opinions about how investors might best approach the market now were unanimous in urging caution, avoiding precipitous decisions at an emotional time when the economy is already teetering on recession. It is probably a bad idea, they said, even to buy oil or gold stocks or to sell airline or insurance issues, as was commonly espoused in recent days. ``In the past, whenever I try to time things, I've been dead wrong,'' Goetzmann said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

Instead, he said, the money is spread throughout banks in countries with loose or nonexistent banking laws, making it much easier for bin Laden to finance terrorism. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

On Tuesday, he stood at the edge of the Potomac River and looked with sadness and anger upon the dark plume of smoke rising up from the smoldering rubble of the Pentagon. ``This city means freedom to me,'' he said. ``Now, I'm really worried for our country.'' The mightiest superpower in history, it seems, has suddenly been laid naked by terrorists willing to use commerical aircraft as weapons in a war that targets civilians. What sort of sacrifice can Americans expect to make in the weeks and months ahead, as the country and its institutions gird for this grim new war? And how much, after all, can the country change and still stay true to its core calling as a beacon of freedom for the rest of the world? (Deans, Cox News Service). MOVED. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

But John Portman's chief engineer was in Atlanta, watching television, and could do nothing but watch the laws of physics do their fatal and inevitable work. The men and women who build and design skyscrapers and skylines say this most American style of architecture _ full of majesty and ego _ will survive the the NYC disaster. But it will be changed, and possibly be shorn of its braggadacio. This may be more of a pastiche of observations from Atlanta and NYC architects, including John Portman: one in Manhattan says speculation has already begun about what will take the WTC's place. Rahimzadeh explains why the WTC was the collision of a aberrant act of terrorism on the one building that would react as it did. Atlanta's skyscrapers are built differently, and would react differently. Hopefully, he said, they would survive longer. And one Atlanta architect says the bombing may have put the lid on ego trips that the trips that the Donald Trumps of the world are inclined toward.

Klapwijk said that if gold is needed, refiners will make it in the right size and with the approved serial numbers.

And that, they say, could delay projects that have yet to begin, as well as some Midtown projects already under way. Among those that may be threatened by the demands of new construction at the trade-center site are the Guggenheim Museum project planned for the East River, the East River Plaza in Harlem, and the billion-dollar stadiums for the Yankees and the Mets. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, they said,	 There was at least one report of looting at a darkened store in Lower Manhattan and instances of people pretending to be construction or rescue workers to get past the police barricades. Officials were especially rankled by the appearance late Thursday night of a woman who, they said, made the bogus claim that she had spoken by cell phone with survivors under the rubble _ a story that sent a rush of hope and then disappointment through the ranks of the exhausted rescue teams.

That was a break for ownership. All Bloch said was that the Patriots should have given Glenn a second notice to return and allowed him that opportunity when he said he was coming in for a meeting. However, the issue of the millions the Patriots have taken back from Glenn in bonus money remains undecided and will require further arbitration or a lawsuit. But what is Glenn to do in the meantime? He said repeatedly that he just wants to come back and play. Does he want to play for the $500,000 left in his contract? If football means what he says it means to him, he will, and worry about the other issues when they come up in legal proceedings. If he balks again, however, he could entrap himself . . . Patriots coach Bill Belichick was circumspect in his comments on Glenn after being fined by the league for previous remarks during trainng camp. ``Terry is suspended by the league and certain rules and restrictions apply,'' Belichick said when asked if he would reach out to Glenn. ``At all cost I want to abide by those restrictions.'' Then he laughed . . . However, it was telling that quarterback Drew Bledsoe seemed less sympathetic toward Glenn than he has so many times in the past when trouble brewed.

NATIONAL - GENERAL (Moving in ``a'' category)  ATTACKS-HATE (Phoenix) -- Hundreds of people across the Phoenix area Sunday mourned the slaying in Mesa of a Sikh gas station owner whose only crime, his loved ones say, was that he looked Arabic and wore a turban. Balbir Singh Sodhi's death may be the first homicide in the country related to the backlash against Arab Americans after Tuesday's terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. And if classified as a hate crime, it could be the first homicide in Arizona history prosecuted as such, officials said. Within a 30-minute time span Saturday afternoon, police believe Frank Roque, a 42-year-old Mesa resident, fired shots in three separate incidents. First, they say, he drove a black Chevy S-10 pickup to a Chevron gas station and opened fire, killing Sodhi, 49, the owner. Roque then headed to a Mobile gas station, where police say he fired at a Lebanese-American clerk, but missed. Ten minutes later, Roque arrived at a home he used to own and fired multiple rounds, police said. A family of Afghani descent now lives there, and nobody was injured.

, he said,	 But in the end, he said, the consequences would have to be faced. They could not, he added, be used as a reason to excuse inaction. The necessity for Pakistan to choose _ to help or hinder, to be with the good guys or the bad guys _ can no longer be avoided. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 Symbols of patriotism were everywhere. A loudspeaker blasted the national anthem through the streets. The five columns outside the New York Stock Exchange building were draped with a huge American flag. Some workers carried American flags in their hands, taped to their backs or affixed to their lapels and ties. Brian Sullivan, 22, an examiner at the New York Stock Exchange, donned a blue tie with an image of the Statue of Liberty standing atop an American flag. It was, he said, his attempt at solidarity. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he says,	 Belafonte hopes that the anthology will both offer blacks a deeper self-awareness and further awaken whites to a history of oppression that is still shrouded, he says, by a cloak of silence. As it was for his close friend, the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. _ who wrote and recorded a sermon for ``The Long Road to Freedom'' that was a prototype for his ``I Have a Dream'' speech _ Belafonte's effort to close the racial divide is rooted in compassion. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, you know,	 Yet if Cassavetes (1929-1989) was the first independent, he could just as well be called the last. He made movies before ``independent film'' became a lower-case brand name: before Sundance and IFC and video rights and a Miramax or Fine Line wanting to sign the latest 20-something festival winner to a two-picture deal. Not that he would necessarily have had it any other way. There was a self-destructive quality to Cassavetes, born of equal parts pridefulness and naivete. As he once admitted, ``I'm sort of my own Mafia, you know, breaking my own knees.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he says,	 Other actors may have run from playing a man who lures boys to his house with pornography but also enjoys talking about poetry with them. But Cox, who has played Titus Andronicus with the Royal Shakespeare Company, King Lear and Richard III at the National Theater in London, and the first screen incarnation of Hannibal Lecter in Michael Mann's ``Manhunter,'' did not run from the opportunity. The provocative role, he says, ``was like waving a red rag at me.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

The selection should be something the giver thinks the couple would like or want, even when selected from the Internet. Bride magazine research found that the average spent on a wedding gift is $100 and that couples register their preferences at two or three stores. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

The Port Authority had the same results. ``We tested the hell out of it,'' said Tozzoli, who saw the second jet collision from the toll plaza on the New Jersey side of the Holland Tunnel.

, he said,	 What they dug up instead, he said, was garbage, animal carcasses, leather shoes, bottles, cannonballs, oyster shells, timber and other debris that had been dumped on the shore and used to extend the shoreline west over 300 years, to the other side of what is now West Street. Below that was river bottom, and below that was glacial till _ gravel scooped up and left by the glaciers that once covered New York _ and hardpan clay. About 75 feet below the ground was mica schist, the bedrock that defines all Manhattan geology and high-rise real estate. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he says,	 The condition of the bathtub wall is also unknown, according to Tamaro.

A curtain of smoke wafted in the breeze where the towers had stood. The day was this bright, many said, when they saw a jet plane bank at the Statue of Liberty and head for the World Trade Center. It was this clear, they continued, when they saw people falling out of the skyscrapers. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

, he said,	 But he said repeatedly in the interview that no one put pressure on him to apologize. ``Nobody's talked to me about this, not one politician,'' he said. Instead, he said, he made the decision after much prayer. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 Robertson, he said, had only discussed the possibility that God could lift his protection over America. ``He wasn't saying that did happen,'' Falwell said. ``He was saying that could happen.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 Retirees depending on their portfolios for income seemed among the calmest on Monday. Younger clients are more difficult to work with, he said, because ``they have higher expectations.''. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, they say,	 Legal experts say the courts are unlikely to impose many restrictions on Congress' security decisions. As a result, they say, the country can adopt security measures as stringent as its people will tolerate politically or support financially. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, I think,	 ``It is a profound affront to be metered and measured,'' he said. ``And that is, I think, the debate of the future.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, they noted,	 Legal experts say the civil libertarians will find little sympathy in the courts. In World War II, they noted, the Supreme Court approved the internment of Japanese-Americans, a decision that constitutional scholars now widely consider to have been wrong. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, they said,	 Some security officials said Americans had yet to focus on the more difficult questions most likely to follow tighter airport security. Once airports and airplanes are more secure, they said, the country will have to consider extending many restrictions to other public places like stadiums, train and bus stations, universities, elementary schools, parks and reservoirs. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 Al-Hallak's attorney, Stanley Cohen of New York, said reports are false that his client _ a former friend and religious adviser to el Hage when they both lived in Arlington _ has fled to Mexico. Instead, he said, the Muslim cleric now lives and works in the Washington area, where he has already been approached by FBI agents. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

, he said,	 He added later that Arab Americans and Muslims should not have to fear for their safety as they move through their daily lives. Nonetheless, he said, since the attack, some women ``don't want to go about their ordinary daily routines because, by wearing cover, they're afraid they'll be intimidated,'' he said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

, he said,	 Robert A. Olstein, manager of the Olstein Financial Alert Fund, said he used Monday's decline as an opportunity to buy stocks that were hit especially hard, such as those of insurance companies and financial services firms. As a result, Olstein said his fund is fully invested in stocks and carrying no cash cushion for the first time in three years. One reason he was able to take such an aggressive stance, he said, was that his fund experienced no shareholder selling. ``Our shareholders are reacting like true professionals,'' Olstein said. ``I have seen no panic as in past crises.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 John Lipsky, chief economist at J.P. Morgan Chase, said that it was not a big sell-off. One reason for the modest retreat, he said, was that investors had already driven short-term interest rates to their lowest levels in recent weeks as they anticipated further Fed cuts. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he wrote,	 To some, this was another symptom of what Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross has called the denial of death in America, taking what was once an intimate part of family life and turning it into a distant spectacle. Others had a darker view. In 1996, the cultural historian Neal Gabler lamented television's fascination with tragedy and reporters' pursuit of grief-stricken relatives, whose televised pain, he wrote, effectively made viewers ``voyeurs in suffering.'' The poet Thomas Lynch, who for years has held a day job as a funeral director, voiced similar complaints in 1999, arguing that ``Grief TV'' provided little but ``user-friendly'' catharsis, a ``virtual substitution'' for the sort of real mourning one experiences firsthand when a loved one _ not a celebrity-stranger _ dies. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, she said,	 ``Our Islam section has really emptied out,'' said Virginia Harabin, a supervisor at Politics &AMP; Prose, a bookstore in Washington.

Now it is living a third-millennium fairy tale with the return of King Simeon II to Bulgaria's political life. By Corinne La Balme.  TRAVEL- NORTHWEST-RAILS (Undated) _ Michael Upchurch took two different types of trains on the Northwest rail corridor from Eugene, Ore., to Vancouver: the Coast Starlight, which continues to Los Angeles, and the newer Amtrak Cascades, with its tilt-train technology that offers a smoother and speedier journey. There are points where he wanted to shout ``Stop the train, I want to get off!'' Every pier and sand spit looked like the gateway to an island life. By Michael Upchurch.  PRACTICAL-TRAVELER (Undated) _ An estimated 5 to 8 percent of children under 3, and up to 3 percent of school-age children, have true food allergies. For millions of families, vacations are a daunting prospect. Kevin Flynn writes about traveling with a six-year-old, who is severely allergic to milk, eggs and peanuts.  TRAVEL-RIO-CORCOVADO (Undated) _ This city's most renowned landmark, the 98-foot-high statue of Christ the Redeemer that stands atop Corcovado Mountain, celebrates its 70th anniversary next month. In conjunction with the event, the municipal government has begun building a new system of elevators and escalators to make it easier to reach the 2,308-foot summit. By Larry Rohter. (760 words)  TRAVEL-NY (New York) _ NYC &AMP; Co., the city's official tourism marketing organization, has taken steps to help visitors do what Mayor Giuliani has asked them to do: Come to New York and spend money. By Joseph Siana. (280 words)  FRUGAL-TRAVELER (Undated) _ Through trial and error, and more than three years of research, Daisann McLane has come up with a way of dressing that doesn't overload luggage, is comfortable to wear, practical to maintain on the road, and keeps a fashion-conscious traveler happy.  TRAVEL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Items on themed driving tours with stops at historic hotels; an exhibition of the work of Emily Carr at the British Colombia Museum in Victoria; 1,000 events planned for Black History Month in Britain; ways to explore Fiordland in the southwest corner of New Zealand.

, she said,	 She liked the pace _ a lot less hectic than at the MERC. The money is good, she said. The job doesn't follow you home. But the best part about it, she said, as corny as it sounds, is the people. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, she said,	 ``It's all a numbers game, but there are real live voices on the other side of the phone that you develop relationships with,'' she said. ``I talk to the same person 20 or 30 times a day and they become part of your family.''

, he said,	 ``My heart felt like it was going to shoot out of my mouth,'' said Tony Amos, the night manager of Shuckums in Hollywood, who identified two of the hijackers from photos the FBI showed him. The two and another man ``got wasted'' in his place, he said, downing chicken wings and cranberry juice, Stolichnaya and orange juice, and Captain Morgan's spiced rum and Coke. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 Deuitch said his former address in Pompano Beach, near where other hijackers are believed to have lived, may have shown up on a database search. Also, he said, his credit card number may also have been lifted during his recent visit to the Middle East. He plans to sift through his statement for any unauthorized purchases. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

, she said,	 Later, after joining the Marine Corps in 1984, she appeared at sporting events, including a Yankees' playoff game in 1996. But Monday's performance, she said, had meaning for her both as an American and a Marine. ``I can't say how honored I was.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, she said,	 ``We are Americans, too,'' said Gutierrez, 40, who fled war-ravaged Guatemala 15 years ago. The United States, she said, is the greatest country on earth. ``They made a big mistake,'' she said of those who leveled the twin towers and took thousands of lives with them. ``Instead of tearing the country apart, they made us united.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

, he noted,	 ``Unaffiliated young males are the most dangerous sector of the social system virtually everywhere,'' said Lionel Tiger, an anthropologist at Rutgers University. ``The entire cauldron of Mideast radicalism is fueled by a huge bulge of young males who foresee no jobs and hence no possibility of marriage under the prevailing system.'' In the United Arab Emirates, he noted, so many young men were unable to afford the traditional marital expenses that the government began offering stipends to any man who married a local woman. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he explained,	 Donohue said his only hope that his brother was still alive lay in a joke the two shared. Watching a horror movie, he explained, when the monster burst in, they would turn to each other and say, ``Time for self,'' which meant, ``There was no time to say goodbye, it was just time to run,'' Donohue said. ``Like I said to Stacey, Craig knew what time for self was.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, he said,	 Doris was also devoted to her work. A graduate of New York University, she had worked in some of the city's finest establishments _ Le Cirque, the Mayfair Hotel and the Warwick Hotel _ but her job at Windows was, he said, a dream come true. She worked from 6 a.m. until 5 p.m., and sometimes came in on the weekends. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

, she added,	 What is current etiquette in our culture, she added, is to send a gift promptly. The notion that one has a year to send a gift is a myth, Post said. The selection should be something the giver thinks the couple would like or want, even when selected from the Internet. Bride magazine research found that the average spent on a wedding gift is $100 and that couples register their preferences at two or three stores. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

Some builders advise planning on 5 percent more than the budgeted amount, but Husak suggests 10 percent, to allow flexibility. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz
, she advises,	 ``When builders give a price,'' Husak explains, ``they want the job, so they often quote the lowest grade cabinets and carpet, unless you specify up front'' exactly what you want.

My perfect travel dress, acquired on sale for $85 in Italy two years ago, is made of light, tightly woven linen. Packed, it folds up flat into a freezer-sized Ziploc bag. I arrive at my hotel, shake it out and put it on a hanger; the next day the wrinkles have fallen out and the dress is good to go. </P> 	nyt_eng_200109.gz

Many state laws require beaches to close if tests show dangerous levels of bacteria. But Joan Rose, professor of water pollution microbiology at the University of South Florida College of Marine Sciences, studies another threat _ viral infection _ that usually goes unmentioned.  Recreational waters off California, Florida and other coastal states show surprising concentrations of viruses that can cause maladies ranging from gastrointestinal distress to possibly fatal myocarditis.  Here, Rose talks about the danger in the waves.  Q: How do viruses get into the oceans near our beaches?  A: In California, mostly as runoff from storm drains. In the Florida Keys, infected water leaches from septic tanks and sewer lines, or is washed into the ocean by thundershowers. There's an amazing interchange between groundwater and adjacent surface water, such as a canal or lake. In Key Largo, we flushed virus tracers down toilets and found them 24 hours later in canals 10 to 20 yards away. Then the tides washed them out toward the reef.  Q: How widespread is the problem?  A: We don't know how prevalent virus infections are, but someone in the community is always infected and excreting these viruses because we can always find them in sewage. We find more viruses in winter when the water is cooler _ that's probably related to their survival _ and when it rains. Overall we've detected human viruses at more than 60 percent of the coastal sites we've tested.  Q: Is this a serious public health risk?  A: Key West had an event where people would swim around the island. They canceled it last year because of water quality. Two years ago, 30 percent of the participants reported gastric, skin, eye or respiratory symptoms. So there's definitely a risk. We've stressed our coastal environment around the world.  Q: Does wastewater pose a threat to aquatic wildlife as well?  A: Fish can get infected with Aeromonas and other bacteria. Upsets in the ecosystem may lead to toxic algae that could also be a problem for fish. We need to know much more about the ecology of water _ estuarine, ocean, groundwater, even water in pipes.  Q: What's the next step for your research?  A: We'd like to learn when and where we're at risk by understanding land-use and transport patterns and by tracking virus sources. We'd also like to take a beach or two, create circulation models and see if we can get some kind of predictability. We want to be able to tell the public what we think is going on so they can make the judgment for themselves. In the long run, we need better storm-water management.  Q: Do you take any precautions when you go to the beach?  A: I pay attention to state evaluations of beaches. I don't like to swim in natural waters in certain countries. I don't swim in canals next to areas with septic tanks. I try to avoid very crowded beaches, because they can have greater pollution.  Q: Do you ever feel grim working with sewage and germs?  A: Actually, I love it.  THEY INVENTED IT WHEN? THE VACUUM CLEANER  In 1869, Chicago inventor Ives W. McGaffey created a sweeping machine that used a fan to create suction, but the device had to be cranked by hand. In 1901 British engineer Hubert C. Booth devised a motorized method, and other designs followed.  These first true vacuum cleaners were huge gasoline-powered contraptions drawn by horse from door to door by professional housecleaners.  In 1907, Ohio janitor James Murray Spangler invented a portable 40-pound electric vacuum, which he sold to entrepreneur William H. Hoover. Manufacturers soon added attachments for crevices and upholstery _ the 1913 Eureka even doubled as a hair dryer.  In 1926, Hoover introduced a model with beater bars and brushes, which greatly increased its dirt-fighting power. Lighter, more efficient motors and better batteries allowed for the introduction of handheld vacuums, led by Black &AMP; Decker's Dustbuster in 1980.

The families and lawyers who had hoped the two might be freed left the country when the attacks on the U.S. interrupted their trial for illegal preaching against Islam. The members of this evangelical church, whose pastor visited the women in Kabul last month, is on a mission that won't stop, they say, even when it means sending people into dangerous lands.

The attacks, the largest in recent months, belied Russian claims that two years of war had left the Islamic-led separatists incapable of mounting a serious offensive. Military spokesmen said Russian troops had killed 17 guerrillas in Gudermes and taken 13 more into custody. Twenty-two suspects were held Tsotsin-Yurt, including several accused of carrying out the attack on the helicopter, the Interfax news service said.  ITALY: RIGHTIST DENIES IMMIGRANT SLUR  Umberto Bossi, leader of the Northern League, denied responsibility for an anti-immigrant flier that was distributed Sunday at the party's annual gathering in Venice. The flier bore an image of Osama bin Laden and the words ``Illegal Immigrants (EQ) Islamic Terrorists.'' Italy has become an important point of entry for immigrants from Albania and points east, and nearly 1,000 landed in the south over the weekend. On Friday, the center-right Cabinet approved a draft law introducing tougher immigration regulations, including prison terms for illegal immigrants who return after being expelled.  ITALY: ANARCHISTS ROUNDED UP  A hundred sites were searched across northern Italy and 60 people were questioned as part of an investigation by the Milan prosecutor into possible terrorist activities by Italian anarchists. The groups are suspected of being involved in plans to attack targets like the Milan cathedral, but the prosecutor said the searches were not linked to the attacks in the United States.  SWEDEN: NUCLEAR PLANT TO CLOSE  Sweden will close a second nuclear reactor by 2003 as part of its plan to phase out nuclear energy by 2010, Prime Minister Goran Persson said as he opened the autumn session of Parliament. He said the government expects the conditions laid down by Parliament for closing Barseback 2, in southwestern Sweden, to be met ``by 2003 at the latest.'' Sweden voted in a referendum in 1980 to shut its 12 nuclear reactors by 2010. So far, only the smallest reactor, Barseback 1's 600-megawatt plant, has been closed, in 1999. Nuclear energy provides about half the national electricity supply, and Parliament has stipulated that Barseback 2 can be shut only after its output has been replaced by renewable energy or conservation.  TURKEY: HOTEL-BUILDER SENTENCED  Sevan Nisanyan, owner of several small hotels in Sirince, a historic village, has been sentenced to a year in prison for making illegal improvements to one property and having artifacts from an old mosque in another, said his wife, Mujde Nisanyan. Nisanyan is in jail near Sirince, in the southwest.  IRELAND: A SENSE OF RACISM  More than 80 percent of the members of ethnic minorities in Ireland feel that racism is a serious problem and that the government is not doing enough to combat it, according to a survey of 600 people by Amnesty International. Women reported more racism and discrimination than men; just over half of those surveyed do not feel confident reporting racist incidents to the police.  IRELAND: BLOWIN' IN THE WIND  Environment Minister Noel Dempsey decreed a 14-cent fee for each plastic bag used to carry groceries. The Irish use 1.2 billion bags every year, or 325 per person, he said, and they are the most visible form of litter in the countryside, where they get caught in trees and hedges and along riverbanks. Starting in February, stores will be required to charge customers for each bag.  AFRICA  RWANDA: TRIAL OPENS FOR PASTOR  A pastor extradited from the United States last year went on trial on Tuesday with his son at a U.N. tribunal in Arusha, Tanzania, on charges of involvement in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. The pastor, Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, a Seventh-day Adventist, is the first church leader to come to trial. He and his son Gerard, a medical doctor, have pleaded not guilty to charges of genocide and crimes against humanity during 1994, when Hutu extremists massacred more than half a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus. A prosecutor said the pastor encouraged Tutsi men, women and children to seek refuge in a church and hospital in Kibuye, then called Hutus to come kill them.  MIDDLE EAST  EGYPT: 15-YEAR-OLD IS SENTENCED FOR HOMOSEXUALITY  A court found a 15-year-old youth guilty of ``practicing sexual immorality,'' a local phrase for homosexuality, and sentenced him to three years in juvenile detention. The youth and 52 men were arrested in May in a raid on a nightclub. The youth was tried separately because he is a minor. Three years was the maximum sentence he could receive. The men are being tried in an emergency state security court, which denies any chance of appeal. They are accused of sexual immorality and forming a group that insulted Islam. Homosexuality is taboo in Egypt, but not prohibited by law.  NIGERIA: ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE  Poor management of the environment costs Nigeria $5 billion a year in ruined land and lost forests, said Muhtari Aminu-Kano, executive director of the Nigerian Conservation Foundation. Much of the damage results from oil and gas extraction in the Niger Delta, he added. Illegal logging is speeding deforestation and the southward advance of the Sahara, which threatens to destroy rare plant and animal species in northern parts of the country.

"140862"	"we"	"have"	" Focusing on records or specific times, we have, I think, downgraded the intrinsic value of our sport, Masback said. It's not the ancient Olympian value, and the further sport is away from its ancient origins, the less compelling it is. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20040807.0044 type=story > <HEADLINE> PLEASE DON'T CALL HIM 'SENATOR' </HEADLINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"

"154220"	"they"	"have"	" Does anybody honestly believe that the Chinese would ever let an American company take over a Chinese company? asked Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.

"158735"	"we"	"have"	" We've never really had a problem getting the flanker involved in our offense and clearly the last couple weeks, we have, Gruden said. So, we're taking a look at what we're doing and he's taking a look at what he's doing.

I am glad that there are iconoclasts out there that are ready to take up the mantle of individuality, but the fact of the matter is that Macs became the marginal OS once Windows 3.1 came out and Apple insisted on controlling their own hardware. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
