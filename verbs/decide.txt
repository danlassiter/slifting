Milburn, a former health minister who will now have the formal title of chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, is seen as a close ally of Blair in his rivalry with Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer.

If he could rewrite it now, he says, the mother who raised him (and died after the book was published) would play a bigger role. But Obama would still break the mold of most memoir writers, if only because an autobiography promises feats worthy of record, conversations with famous people, a central role in important events.

PRISON-ABUSE-CONGRESS (Washington) _The CIA kept dozens of detainees at Abu Ghraib prison and other detention facilities in Iraq off official rosters to hide them from Red Cross inspections, far more than has been previously reported, two senior Army generals said Thursday. An inquiry by three Army generals issued last month found eight documented cases of so-called ghost detainees, but two of the officers said in congressional testimony and interviews later that depositions with military personnel at the prison suggested the number was far higher. By Eric Schmitt and Douglas Jehl.  CHECHNYA-WIDOWS (Grozny, Russia) -- Sketches of four Chechen black widows -- two who took down Russian passenger airliners on Aug. 24, one who bombed the Moscow subway just before the Beslan school attack, and one whose current whereabouts are unknown. They worked in the Grozny market and lived nearby, in a square marked by absolute squalor, deprivation, and destruction. The participation of these women in terrorist acts -- despite Chechnya's deeply patriarchal society, or perhaps because of it -- reflects the radicalization of a war that began as a separatist struggle but has now turned increasingly brutal and nihilistic. It has also exposed the deep schisms that are tearing apart Chechnya, where few people interviewed here this week spoke warmly of Russia or the Kremlin, but where all expressed horror at the bombings, the school siege and other attacks that have been carried out for the sake of Chechnya's independence. By Steven Lee Myers.  CAMPAIGN-DEBATE (Washington) -- The next big political events are the presidential debates. We look at how both sides are approaching them, their strategies and how important they may be. By Jim Rutenberg.  WTC-JUMPERS (New York) -- They remain, three years later, open questions and many people wonder if firm answers would lead to more pain or less, to practical lessons for society or to simply a spectacle for the morbidly curious. How many people jumped from the upper floors of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11? Why did so many more people jump from the north tower than the south? What floors did they come from? Who were they? The attack on the World Trade Center was one of the most observed catastrophes in history, and those who fell or dropped from the towers were, briefly, its most public victims. They emerged one or two at a time from a blanket of smoke and fire that rendered mass death virtually invisible. Nearly all the others killed that day -- whether high in the trade center, on board the hijacked airplanes or deep inside the Pentagon -- were beyond the sight of survivors and witnesses. Those who came through the windows of the towers provided the starkest, most harrowing evidence of the desperate conditions inside. By Kevin Flynn and Jim Dwyer.  WORKPLACE-STRESS-III (Undated) -- For Michael Jones, an architect in New York, juggling multiple projects and running on four hours of sleep is business as usual. He has adjusted, he says, to a rapid pace and the constant pressure that pushes his colleagues to blow up from time to time. One design project can drag on for more than a year, requiring six-day workweeks and painstaking time and effort. At the moment, he said, he is working on four. Jones belongs to a rare breed of worker that psychologists have struggled to understand for decades, not for the sheer amount of stress they grapple with from day to day, but for the way they flourish under it. They are a familiar, but puzzling force in the workplace, perpetually functioning in overdrive to meet the demands of a punishing schedule or a difficult boss. To colleagues, these men and women may simply seem like workaholics. But psychologists who study them call them resilient, or hardy, and say that they share certain backgrounds and qualities that enable them to thrive under enormous pressure. By Anahad O'Connor.  Third of three articles, Sick of Work on stress in the workplace.  TERROR-TAPE (Undated) -- Ayman al-Zawahri, the No. 2 figure in al-Qaida, appeared in a new videotape aired on Al-Jazeera on Thursday, saying U.S. forces have only limited movement in Afghanistan. Zawahri, the right-hand man of Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, spoke to the camera for several minutes in the videotape, wearing a white turban with a machine gun at his side.

Well, if he's going to ask that, then he ought to ask why she's wearing fishnets to frog dissections, but never mind. Her desperate, pleading voice and his overhearing her chief captor yelling at her have Ryan convinced that something is up. </P> 	nyt_eng_200409.gz

Jandek on Corwood is terribly padded nevertheless, and eventually even the fans have to admit they might like Jandek less if they knew any more about him -- that his mystique is as important as his defiantly uneasy music. You may not get all the answers you want, wrote the artist, rebuffing yet another journalist. It's better that way. Whatever you think of Jandek's art, he's clearly a marketing genius.

And indeed, in scores of phone calls that continued until the last minutes, people reported that they had gathered in conference rooms or offices that were protected from fire by walls.

The Danish case may have produced an unusual result, but it reflects a broad unease in many European countries about the increase in non-European, often Muslim, populations, a phenomenon that had led to the growth of several rightist anti-immigrant parties -- among them the Danish People's Party, which won 22 seats in the 179-member Danish Parliament in the 2001 elections. But only relatively tiny Denmark, with about 450,000 foreign-born residents in a population of 5.3 million, has actually enacted regulations that have essentially forced some of its citizens to choose between their loved ones and their country. </P> 	nyt_eng_200409.gz

He said he paid smugglers $2,200 to bring him into the United States in a three-day desert walk.

Collecting and selling scrap aluminum can be lucrative. But all this work is temporary at best. Gonzalez said he had hoped to take home as much as $5,000 to help build the four-bedroom house he plans for his wife-to-be, who is waiting for him.
