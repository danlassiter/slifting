She bought Cipro over the Internet. She thought about taking her family and heading for the mountains. Finally, she decided she needed to conquer her fears. To do that, she began taking self-defense classes. Experts say Americans are looking for ways to regain a sense of control. The terror attacks robbed many Americans of their security and people are reacting in different ways to regain it. With PHOTO. By TANYA EISERER  ATTACK-MISSIONARIES  UNDATED: As some Muslims in Islamic countries riot and rage over the bombing of Afghanistan, missionaries forced to relocate after Sept. 11 are slipping back to those countries _ more determined than ever to step up their Christian messsage, church leaders say. While some question the validity of their work, missonaries forced to evacuate from from Central Asia and other hot spots after Sept. 11 are back, despite the danger of increasing anti-American sentiment. By DARREN BARBEE  (NON-ATTACK)  CCC  FORT WORTH, Texas _ The Civilian Conservation Corps planted its last tree almost 60 years ago, but for Ed Bearden, the memories are fresh. He has two reminders of the CCC at the north side shop where he repairs recreational vehicles. The reminders are a pair of rusting hulks that look like they might have been pickup trucks a long time ago. Bearden said one is a 1938 Chevy. The other, also a Chevy, Bearden believes might be a 1936 model. He's not sure. On the door of one of the hulks is a very faint outline of a CCC insignia. The CCC was a Depression-era program to put young men to work in parks and national forests. Some called it ``Roosevelt's Tree Army.'' Neither truck has run in about 30 years, and both look it. The windows are gone, as is part of the floor in the cabs. Some fenders are hanging from what looks like twisted coat-hanger wire. The seats are naked springs. The truck beds are gone. By PAUL BOURGEOIS  RADIO-CHANGE  FORT WORTH, Texas _ Any time a radio station changes format, it's bound to upset longtime listeners. Especially if that station is a small-town station with a decidedly local emphasis. Especially if it's an oldies station, and it flips to ... southern Asian music. By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story will move in ``n'' regional category for Texas points only.  E N T E R T A I N M E N T  PATTI-LABELLE  UNDATED: Whenever someone asks me which celebrity tops my list of favorite people to interview, I answer, without hesitation, Patti LaBelle. Why? Because this sister-girl keeps it real. In the 10 times I've interviewed her during the past 11 years, Miss Patti has always been outrageously candid, wonderfully gracious and unbelievably humble for a celebrity of her stature. That's why I didn't gag myself with a spoon when I heard she was writing one of those ``self-help, self-esteem, `this is how you can be happy' books'' that normally just freak me out. In ``Patti's Pearls: Lesson in Living Genuinely, Joyfully, Generously,'' the recently divorced LaBelle shares words of wisdom that have been passed on to her by family and friends throughout the years. By MIKI TURNER  TV-NYPD BLUE  UNDATED: It still snags enough viewers to rank in the top 20 for the season, advertisers still chase after its middle-income audience, and star Dennis Franz is so beloved he could come out against the airing of Sunday's Emmy Awards and then reconsider with nary a cross word spoken about him. But none of this disguises the fact that NYPD Blue is making its customary late arrival Tuesday with the customary questions: Is it on its last legs? Is it time to hand in the badges? By KEN PARISH PERKINS  BOOKS-ZELDA  UNDATED: Here's how to live like Zelda Fitzgerald, should this ever become your goal: First, read ``Sometimes Madness Is Wisdom: Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald, A Marriage'' by Kendall Taylor (Ballentine, $28). Be beautiful, blond, talented and born into a prominent Southern family with a history of mental illness. There's more.... By JESSIE MILLIGAN  TV-STATUE  UNDATED: Mary Richards never liked to make a scene. Imagine how embarrassed she'd be (she'd probably start to stammer) if she knew about the fuss she has stirred up in Minneapolis. Last spring, TV Land _ the cable network that airs re-runs of ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' _ announced it would sponsor a life-size bronze statue of Mary Richards in downtown Minneapolis. An artist was commissioned in May and is still working on the project. City officials like the idea. But not everybody else does. By ALYSON WARD  DISNEY  UNDATED: The Disney empire is celebrating the 100th birthday of its founder, Walt Disney. These days, some children don't even realize that Walt Disney was a real man who built a network of movies, television shows, theme parks, radio, clothing, toys, cartoons and more from a funny drawing of a mouse. A Q&AMP;A on Walt. By AMANDA ROGERS  C O M M E N T A R Y  LABBE-COLUMN  UNDATED: The way Texas Gov. Rick Perry talks about making the return of organized prayer to public schools a campaign issue, you'd think he was running for the White House instead of the Governor's Mansion. Perry apparently thinks America needs a Supreme Court that will rule school-sponsored prayer permissible, given that he was quoted as saying the justices ``took it out. They can sure put it back in.'' The U.S. Constitution is as clear as cling wrap that the president has the power to appoint Supreme Court justices. Perry must be eying 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. as a future mailing address. By J.R. LABBE  T R A V E L  CHRISTMAS-TOUR  FREDERICKSBURG, Texas _ Settled more than 150 years ago by German immigrants who knew the value of good beer and good food but also of a dollar, Fredericksburg was always a prosperous town, but not a flashy one. Now, though, although it retains many of its traditional celebrations, it's just about the best place around to base yourself for a Hill Country Christmas Tour. Accompanied by TOUR-DETAILS. By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ  TOUR-DETAILS  UNDATED: Fredericksburg and the Hill Country, details, details, details. ACCOMPANIES CHRISTMAS-TOUR.

To promote tolerance and understanding, Barnes &AMP; Noble is working with the Anti-Defamation League to ``Close the Book on Hate.'' Take a look at some of the children's books on the campaign's reading list: books that teach tolerance by emphasizing diversity _ or by, wonderfully, taking it for granted. By ALYSON WARD  SCARY-HALLOWEEN  UNDATED: It was the scariest Halloween ever at my house this year. Oh, there have been some that came close, like whenever Halloween falls on a Sunday, and a low turnout is expected. But this year's Halloween sent a chill through me. You see, no one came. Well, almost no one. One measly bag of candy made it into the bags of a rock star, a pirate, a bumblebee and a handful of superheroes. By KATHY HARRIS  TURKEY-TALK  UNDATED: Butterball is making the Turkey Talk-Line Internet site a little juicier this year with the Ladies of Talk-Line 2002 Calendar. Hang the limited-edition calendar on the refrigator for tips, recipes and tales from the Butterball staff. A brief. By BEVERLY BUNDY  GOODBYE-GUY  FORT WORTH, Texas _ Sometimes there's no good reason to tell a story, except that a good story is always worth the telling. It's both sweet and tart like a lemon drop melting on your tongue, bringing back memories of the way things used to be when a person stayed in one place his whole life long, knew his neighbors, tipped his hat and worked from can to can't, grateful that there was work to be done. In every town there are stories of people who have triumphed over unbelievable adversity while others have lost everything to illness or insanity, drink, drugs or selfishness. There are those who have loved their families and honored them _ and those who have betrayed everything that is sacred. Guy Thompson knows a hundred stories about the famous, the infamous and the ordinary people of Fort Worth. He is the city's oldest working funeral director, a man who has buried power brokers and paupers with equal dignity for the past 60 years. Everyone knows him, but few know his story. At 81, he is still a lion who roars, a perfectionist who runs Thompson's Harveson &AMP; Cole Funeral Home with an uncompromising hand and a sure instinct for setting the perfect stage for that final curtain. He has guided thousands of mourners through the final moments meant to commemorate an entire lifetime. He has grieved, too, and his own life is a mix of memories both sweet and tart. By MARY ROGERS  ANDERSON-COLUMN  UNDATED: Dearest Children, It has been a long and lonely week without you. I am so sorry that you could not accompany me on this seven-day cruise from New Orleans to Jamaica, Grand Cayman and Cozumel. You know that I would have brought you along with me if you had been on your summer break, but school is soooo important! Besides, I'm working. Really, I am. This is strictly research. I'm studying the effects of sun, rest and gourmet meals on overworked, middle-aged parents. (That would be me.)

"156377"	"you"	"answer"	" When Bob Altman calls, you answer, she said. If you ask any comedian, they'd like to do all kinds of stuff. But the opportunities are limited because people just see us as the characters that we play. Those times are shifting -- definitely Adam Sandler showed more than one side, especially in (open-bracket)Anderson's film(closed-bracket) 'Punch-Drunk Love.' So when (open-bracket)Altman(closed-bracket) called and said, 'I've got a movie for you; do you want to do it?' I said, 'Are you crazy, of course.' </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz

, he added,	 The decline is not because of cuts in the SBA budget, insisted William Elmore, SBA associate administrator for veterans business development. One reason, Elmore said, is that the agency does not extend loans to companies already struggling with debt. In the next few weeks, he added, the SBA will distribute its first pre-mobilization guide for businesses and employees across the nation. </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz
