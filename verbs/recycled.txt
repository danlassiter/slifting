"127206"	"he"	"recycled"	" Warhol and Joseph Cornell were his friends, Gertrude Stein his natural soul mate. But unlike Warhol, Johnson made art that was not big, deadpan and hands-off but small, eccentric and open-ended. Impermanence was his mantra. Over the years, he recycled, chopped up and modified his collages, as if keeping them in a constant state of possibility and flux. They accumulated more and more obscure and hermetic meanings along the way. By the end, his art had become a dense, private code, occasionally morbid and sometimes very hard to decipher. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
