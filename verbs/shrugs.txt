"138483"	"she"	"shrugs"	" ``Nosh New York,'' by Myra Alperson (St. Martin's Griffin, $16.95, 318 pages). East Side, West Side, all around the town, Alperson, a city tour guide, leads a food excursion through the Big Apple, concentrating on lunch, breakfast and snack spots, mostly in multicultural Queens and Brooklyn. Entries such as ``Uruguayan Jackson Heights'' give a sense of the book's scope. Of course, Alperson, a good New Yorker, is opinionated and sugar-free. Recommending only a short stop in Coney Island, she shrugs, ``How can Coney Island be merely a side trip when it's so rich in history? There's a simple answer: `Try to have a good meal there.''' Citywide directions for subways, buses and driving are included. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20031012.0013 type=advis > <HEADLINE> COXnet Cox News Service Sports budget for MONDAY, Oct. 13, 2003    c. 2003 Cox News Service </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 10-12-03 18:18:00EDT (BC-SPORTS-BJT-1013-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> c. 2003 Cox News Service  All articles by Cox Newspapers emplOyeus c. 2003 Cox News Service.
