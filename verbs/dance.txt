"4505"	"they"	"dance"	" It stars comic Ralph Harris as 20-year-old Josh Jerrico, the oldest of the seven Jerrico orphans. And here's where ``On Our Own'' gets strange: All the other Jerricos are played by members of the Smollett family, a talented troupe discovered by the producers, who then built a show around them. They sing, they dance, but they can't act particularly well, so Harris, who is an adequate actor, was brought in as honorary senior Smollett. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199409.gz"
"34351"	"they"	"dance"	" Bloolips is a five-man troupe of British drag queens. They sing (Ray Dobbins created the pastiche of clever songs), they dance, they act, they clown and, because they're in drag (English music hall has a venerable drag tradition), they do on the stage what we do in our dreams, which is to play whatever part we need to, in violation of sexual, social or intellectual unities. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"

"133597"	"they"	"dance"	" It opens with Arthur, Guinevere and the knights and ladies of the Round Table celebrating the Christmas season. They sing, they dance, they joust. The wine flows. Hearts are light. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"137827"	"they"	"dance"	" Indeed. The movie aspires to be a ``Frankie and Annette Do 'Grease' '' for the hip-hop generation. Clarkson and Guarini cavort on Miami's South Beach with girls in bikinis and guys with washboard abs. They sing, they dance, they update KC and the Sunshine Band's ``That's the Way I Like It.'' They meet cute, get in fights, make up and kiss. (Note to fans: The pair says there has never been, nor shall there ever be, any extracurricular smooching.) In other words, it's fluffier than the hair on Guarini's head. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200306.gz"
"151276"	"we"	"dance"	" It was so strange, I couldn't relate at all, he said. But this pope encouraged us to celebrate in an African way, he continued. We sing, we dance, we clap, we use our drums. We will always, always be grateful to him. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"159430"	"you"	"dance"	" Although I was a veteran concertgoer and had seen rock's biggest names, including the Stones and the Who, I had never experienced anything like this. The energy and passion were remarkable, both onstage and in the crowd. Seeing Bruce is a participation sport: You sing, you dance, you only sit when he tells you to. Twenty-eight songs and three-plus hours later, I was as sweaty and exhausted as the Boss. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"169455"	"they"	"dance"	" The puppets sing, they dance, they behave badly, they make bad decisions, they have moral crises, director Chris Humphrey said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"171154"	"they"	"dance"	" And his old hits have benefited him in his current incarnation. When Giovanni Reggioli, the young conductor of the Washington National Opera on opening night, heard that Friedkin was directing, he said he was pleased. Of course I knew his name from the movies, Reggioli said. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060919.0197 type=advis > <HEADLINE> SUNDAY-EARLY-BUDGET-NYT </HEADLINE> <TEXT> The New York Times News Service plans the following articles from its Arts &amp; Leisure and Travel sections for use Sunday, Sept. 24, and thereafter.

COVER STORIES  TV-SECRET-SLUMBER (Undated) -- They sing, they dance, they say like: meet the Slumber Party Girls, the Monkees of the 21st century. By Dave Itzkoff.  FILM-SHORTBUS (Undated) -- In the crazy and no doubt kinky history of casting calls, there have surely been few like the one for Shortbus. It was all about sex, but not because the actors were coming on to the director, John Cameron Mitchell. And not because Mitchell was looking for big-name hotties to lure audiences into theaters. He wanted people whose sexual histories might become fodder for the screenplay. He wanted erotically adventurous recruits for an expedition to what he saw as an unexplored confluence of drama, comedy and unblinking pornography. By Frank Bruni.  THEATER-SONDHEIM (Undated) -- Jesse Green talks with theater legend Stephen Sondheim about his apprentice days in the early 1950s at the Westport Playhouse in Connecticut.  FILM-QUEEN (London) -- Sarah Lyall reports on Stephen Frears' The Queen, starring Helen Mirren, about the British royal family following the death of Princess Diana.  MUSIC-EVERYBODY'S-TALKIN' (Undated) -- David Browne on Everybody's Talkin', four new versions of the Fred Neil classic. What's in a song?  ODDBALL-ART (Los Angeles) -- John Strausbaugh tours the Center For Land Use Interpretation, a collective in Los Angeles with a deadpan sense of humor dedicated to documenting oddball bits of the American landscape.  MAINE-PRINTMAKING (Undated) -- A report on the diverse history of printmaking in Maine, pegged to The Maine Print Project: Celebrating 200 Years of Printmaking in Maine, a vast series of exhibitions this season in the Northeast. By Deborah Weisgall.  Bestseller Lists  BESTSELLERS-HARD-L (Undated) -- Best-selling hardbacks, long-form list.  BESTSELLERS-HARD-S (Undated) -- Best-selling hardbacks, short-form list.  BESTSELLERS-PAPER-L (Undated) -- Best-selling paperbacks, long-form list.  BESTSELLERS-PAPER-S (Undated) -- Best-selling paperbacks, short-form list.  BESTSELLERS-CHILDREN (Undated) -- Best-selling children's books.  NOTEWORTHY-PAPERBACKS (Undated) -- Short summaries of other paperbacks.  TRAVEL-ITALY-LUCCA (Undated) -- Where can you find the best food in Tuscany? This historic walled city, once the home of a thriving banking and silk trade but now often bypassed by tourists heading to Florence or Sienna, might just be the place. By Mark Bittman.  TRAVEL-LAURENTIANS-CANADA (Undated)-- Canada's Laurentian Mountains are the northern Francophone cousins of our own Adirondacks. They're not high, but come autumn, they are dramatic: Weeks before the colors in New England peak, these rounded mountains are quilted in blazing yellows and reds. And there's plenty for a family to do in these woods -- from a luge ride down the face of Mont Tremblant to a quiet paddle on a Laurentian lac to apple picking with the Quebecois. By Amy Virshup.  TRAVEL-BORA-BORA (Undated) -- The famously calm waters of Bora Bora have seen a lot of action lately. Once a far-flung hideaway for honeymooners and reclusive figures like Marlon Brando, this French Polynesian island is now surprisingly accessible, thanks to new airline routes from the United States and a wave of luxury resorts opening this year. By Bonnie Tsui.  TRAVEL-MEXICO (Undated) -- Here in Careyes, on Mexico's Pacific coast, the well-heeled scene is all about not making a scene. By Julia Chaplin.
