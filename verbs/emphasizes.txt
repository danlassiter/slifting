By NANCY WARTIK c.1996 McCall's (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  When Debra Sartell gave birth to her son, Cole, three years ago, she expected to enjoy motherhood. Instead she found that her anxiety was controlling her life.  ``I had no idea I'd be such a worried mother,'' says Sartell, 40, who was also running a talent-coordinating business from her San Francisco home.  ``But it seemed as if there was never one relaxing moment. Everything made me nervous. Was Cole eating well enough? Was he playing with something dangerous? I don't remember ever feeling unconcerned. I was even anxious when he was sleeping because I was waiting for him to wake up and cry.''  From time to time, everybody has experienced the grip of anxiety. It can make people feel as if their life is veering out of control.  Anxiety can take many forms. Some people lose sleep worrying about their child; others shudder at the thought of riding in a crowded elevator or speaking in front of a group of people.  Researchers at Pennsylvania State University in University Park have found that 15 percent of the college students they studied consider themselves chronic worriers; they expect the worst and mull over their problems without ever reaching solutions.  What's more, anxiety disorders _ in which the fear or worry is so severe it impedes normal functioning _ affect an astonishing 13 percent to 18 percent of people in the United States each year. (Almost two thirds of the sufferers are women.)  Fortunately, researchers know more than ever about effective strategies for reducing anxiety. The techniques here can help even the most stressed-out among us calm down _ and relax! THE HIGHS AND LOWS OF ANXIETY  Anxiety often manifests itself as a feeling of unease or apprehension _ at worst, it's the overwhelming sense that something catastrophic might happen.  Sometimes anxiety is expressed by physical sensations _ such as a racing heart or breaking out in a cold sweat.  Unpleasant though it may be, anxiety isn't always a bad thing. It can signal a need to take immediate action or solve a problem: Anxiety pushes people to save for a rainy day, to call the doctor if a child's fever rises or to rehearse for an upcoming job interview.  ``Anxiety prepares us to deal with challenging future events,'' says Dr. David H. Barlow, director of the Phobia and Anxiety Disorders Clinic at the State University of New York in Albany. ``It helps us to achieve our goals.''  But too much angst has the opposite effect. It causes mental wear and tear, which makes it hard to handle demanding situations.  Constant worry, for example, can cloud your thinking and interfere with decision making.  What causes high anxiety? Genes play a part, as does your upbringing.  ``Overprotective, smothering parents give their children the message that the world is dangerous,'' Barlow says.  In addition, studies show that those who lose a parent early in life _ by death or by separation _ may be more prone to worry. So are people who've recently struggled through major stresses like divorce or job loss. Even happy events, such as a promotion _  or, in Sartell's case, a new baby _ can trigger anxiety.  Not surprisingly, prolonged stress may also cause the problem.  ``A lot of the people I see have a history of overextending themselves,'' says Edmund Bourne, a psychologist and author of ``The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook'' (New Harbinger Publications, 1990).  Reducing the stress in her life was the solution for Sartell. When her son was 2 years old, she lightened her load by closing her home-based business and found her anxiety beginning to recede.  ``I don't think I realized how much impact my worrying had,'' she says. ``I feel like I'm becoming a whole person again.'' SEVEN WAYS TO SOOTHE TENSION  For many people, anxiety relief lies in learning to cope more successfully with stressful situations. Experts recommend these strategies.  1. Prove yourself wrong: Record every fear that passes through your mind for several days, suggests Michael Fordyce, a psychologist in Fort Myers, Fla.  ``Then put your journal away for a week. When you take it out, figure out how many of your worries came true. The average person will find that almost 90 percent of one's fears never come to pass!''  2. Focus on the present: ``Worry is future-oriented,'' says Jennifer Abel, a psychologist at Psychiatric Consultants in St. Louis. ``If you focus on the present, where there's rarely anything immediately threatening, it's harder to worry.  ``I have people tune in to the sounds of the birds outside, or focus on the texture of a chair. Then I ask them to try to worry at the same time, and they can't do it.  ``You can try this anywhere _ if you're stuck in traffic, notice the colors of the cars around you, the speed at which the cars in the opposite lane are traveling.''  3. Look for a hidden cause: ``Often anxiety masks a painful emotion,'' explains Dr. Katherine Shear, director of the Anxiety Disorders Program at Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic in Pittsburgh.  ``You may be angry about something. Ask yourself what you were thinking about or doing at the moment you started feeling anxious. It might help to talk this over with a friend or counselor.''  4. Schedule a worry break: Allot a half hour each day to do nothing but fret; if anxieties arise at other times, save them for your worry session.  When Pennsylvania State researchers tested this method, they found it reduced daily angst by 40 percent within a month. Such sessions can be even more productive if you use them to solve problems.  ``Try brainstorming possible solutions, no matter how ridiculous they seem,'' Abel says. ``Then evaluate your options. This also helps you decide which worries you can do something about and which you may just have to let go.''  5. Take a deep breath ... and relax: ``Abdominal breathing is a powerful technique for calming anxiety,'' Bourne says.  When you feel yourself becoming anxious, put your hand on your stomach and feel it rise as you breathe deeply. Inhale to a count of four; then exhale to that count.  6. Practice healthy habits. Doing aerobic exercise for at least 20 minutes three or four times a week defuses tension. And don't skimp on stress-reducing slumber. Lack of sleep can worsen anxiety.  7. Cut back on caffeine: This stimulant increases tension. DO YOU HAVE A DISORDER?  If your anxiety seriously interferes with your life or sense of well-being, you may have one of these three common disorders: a phobia (an irrational fear of a particular object or situation, such as flying; panic disorder (terror attacks that strike out of the blue, triggering a pounding heart, dizziness and other symptoms); or generalized anxiety disorder (uncontrollable feelings of worry lasting for months).  These problems can be disabling in some cases. Fortunately, even those people with severe cases of anxiety can be helped successfully.  ``We have treatments that are up to 90 percent effective,'' says Dr. Larry Michelson, co-director of the Stress and Anxiety Disorder Institute at Pennsylvania State.  ``Seek help early, because anxiety disorders tend to get worse if left untreated.''  Start by seeing your doctor for a physical exam. Anxiety can be a symptom of a medical condition, including low blood sugar, thyroid disorders and some heart problems.  If nothing is detected, psychotherapy may be the next step. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has proven extremely effective. Ask your doctor to recommend a qualified professional to oversee your treatment.  ``People make dramatic progress with CBT,'' says Jerilyn Ross, president of the Anxiety Disorders Association of America and author of ``Triumph Over Fear: A Book of Help and Hope for People With Anxiety, Panic Attacks and Phobias'' (Bantam, 1994).  ``One agoraphobic woman I worked with was housebound for 32 years. After five months of therapy she was able to do her own shopping and go to the movies.''  In addition to therapy, patients sometimes need medication. Antidepressants, including Prozac, are increasingly prescribed to those with panic disorders and some phobias. Benzodiazepines, such as the tranquilizer Xanax, also quell fright and panic.  Propranolol, a drug primarily used to treat high blood pressure, can help people conquer performance anxiety by reducing sweating and trembling and by slowing a racing heart.  Remember, though, that all these drugs have side effects _ Xanax, for example, can be addictive _ and they don't cure anxiety; they only stop its symptoms.  Experts advise people taking medication to try behavioral approaches simultaneously.  ``Once you understand your own responses to stress, you can gain control of the symptoms rather than having them control you,'' says Dr. Una McCann, chief of the unit on anxiety disorders at the National Institute of Mental Health.

Includes a 350-word sidebar Color slides available of speaking coach Karen Kalish showing proper public speaking technique. By DIANE NAUGHTON c.1996 The Washingtonian (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) (Editor's Note: Suzanne Gordon is a pseudonym. All other names are real.)  Public speaking sometimes is more feared than death. ``The Book of Lists'' by David Wallechinsky and Amy Wallace (Bantam, 1993) reports public speaking as the No. 1 fear among those surveyed, while death came in fourth. Comedian Jerry Seinfeld has concluded from this that at a funeral, most people would rather be lying in the coffin than giving the eulogy.  Why are people so afraid of public speaking? Although ``death by oratory'' _ a phrase from Michael Klepper's ``I'd Rather Die Than Give a Speech'' (Carol Publishing, 1995) _ has never been reported, there is the potential for embarrassment, and ``embarrassment is the social equivalent of death,'' says Burt Rubin, director of the Roundhouse Center's Public Speaking Anxiety Program in Alexandria, Va.  Public-speaking anxiety, also known as stage fright, has affected many famous people, including Willard Scott, Lily Tomlin and Laurence Olivier.  ``Perfectionism is the glue that holds this problem together,'' says Dr. David Charney, medical director at the Roundhouse Center.  Stage-fright sufferers tend to be competent, ambitious people.  ``The single biggest occupational group we see is lawyers,'' Rubin says.  The Roundhouse Center also has treated teachers, physicians, clergy, salespeople, military personnel, even on-air radio personalities. Many are mid-career people in positions of responsibility who want to rise higher and can no longer avoid public speaking at their jobs. IT'S ALL IN YOUR MIND  Someone once said, ``The human brain starts working the moment you are born and never stops until you stand up to speak in public.''  It turns out that the brain is the culprit behind stage fright. Fear of public speaking, like fear of physical danger, triggers the body's ``fight-or-flight'' response. The brain causes the release of chemicals called catecholamines _ adrenaline is one _ which increase heart rate and cause rapid breathing, tremors and increased perspiration.  Stage fright becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: We don't want people to see our nervousness and we get more fearful, which causes more adrenaline to be released.  For many of us the fear is worse right before and at the start of a speech. Typically, we never look as nervous as we feel. FEAR IS GOOD  Most people can handle stage fright by learning a few tricks of the trade. Georgetown instructor Laura Lazar Holbrook works with students on rewriting their ``internal scripts,'' especially what she calls negative self-talk: ``that pitter-patter in the back of our minds as we get up to speak, such as ``I'm going to blow this one.'''  Roundhouse clients learn to displace fear with more useful thoughts.  ``The problem is you are thinking about yourself and not about what you are going to say,'' Rubin explains.  ``The secret is in the preparation,'' says Joan Detz, speechwriter and author of ``Can You Say a Few Words?'' (St. Martin's Press, 1991). If you know your material and your audience, she emphasizes, a lot of the anxiety goes away.  Detz also encourages people to ``put positive affirmations in your mind,'' even if it's ``Next Tuesday, this will be over,'' or ``I know more about this project than anyone else in the room.''  Mary Ellen Doran-Quine, a speech pathologist in Reston, Va., teaches techniques to get the fight-or-flight response under control, such as an exercise she calls the ``stomach squeeze.''  Even if the fear can't be totally eliminated, it can be used to the speaker's advantage.  ``I like to be a little nervous,'' says Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America. He thinks nervousness adds energy to his presentations. MAKING SPEECHES MEMORABLE  The way a speech is written _ the words chosen, the images created _ is the key to making it memorable and enjoyable.  Karen Kalish of Kalish Communications in Washington, D.C., gives her clients a simple outline for writing a speech.  ``Start with a great opener,'' she says, ``something to make people react.'' Then identify the three points you want to make _ ``audiences can't remember more'' _ and support these points with lots of examples and anecdotes.  ``The close has got to be memorable,'' says Kalish, a former reporter for ``Entertainment Tonight'' and Channel 9 in Washington, D.C., ``as it may be the only thing the audience will remember.''  Detz recommends organizing a speech around groups of three. She points out that the human mind is attracted to things that come in threes.  She says you can add sparkle to any speech by using devices such as anecdotes, lists, personal details, repetition, parallel structure, quotations and visual imagery.  Professionals who are used to writing reports may find writing a speech to be quite a different process, because speeches are intended for the ear, not the eye.  Valenti, who served as an adviser and speechwriter for Lyndon Johnson, tries to achieve a cadence and rhythm to his speeches.  ``If you compose a long sentence, try to follow it with a shorter one,'' he writes in his book ``Speak Up With Confidence'' (Morrow, 1982). This not only gives the speech a rhythmic balance, but it gives the speaker a chance to breathe.  Valenti says he also tries to ``fetch up words that are out of the ordinary'' to make presentations interesting _ ``fetch up'' being a case in point.  There's a fine line between interesting words and pompous jargon, speech coach Arch Lustberg warns. Among words to avoid, he says: infrastructure, paradigm, indigenous and parameter.  If you use visual aids, keep them simple, advises Laura Trifoli of Executive Process, an Oakton, Va., management-consulting company.  ``People will tune you out,'' she says, if you try to communicate too much on one slide or overhead.  A good rule of thumb is to keep to five or six lines per slide. Try not to read from your audio-visuals, but instead look at the audience. And never turn your back to the audience, Trifoli says.  If it's humor you want to use, you must be comfortable delivering it.  ``Good humor should grow out of the material naturally,'' Detz says.  Valenti says that to use humor, the speaker has to have a great sense of timing.  ``Reagan was great at this, but he was an actor. Most executives botch it every time.'' WHO IS A GOOD SPEAKER?  The speech itself is important, but so is the personality of the speaker. If an audience perceives you as competent and likable, you've won the battle, Lustberg says.  To be seen as competent, he suggests omitting ``you knows'' and ``ahs'' from your presentation and staying silent _ but maintaining eye contact _ when pausing to gather a thought.  Lustberg says the key to likability is an ``open face'' with brows raised and eyes wide, as when you are talking to a baby or pet.  Just as actors use their entire bodies, so must speakers.  ``We rake people in with our eyes and seduce them with our voices,'' Doran-Quine says. She believes that eye contact and voice are the most crucial parts of body language in public speaking.  Lustberg gives one simple rule for effective eye contact: Always look at someone in the audience while you're speaking. Look down at your text or notes only when you are pausing.  Lustberg's answer to the question, What should I do with my hands? Men, he says, wrongly use the ``fig leaf,'' clasping their hands over their crotch, while women tend to cross their arms in front of their chest. This sends the wrong signal: Don't hurt me!  ``As speakers, we should allow our arms to hang comfortably by our sides until we can make an appropriate gesture,'' Lustberg writes in his quarterly newsletter. PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE  The one thing all coaches and classes stress, but can't do for you, is practice.  Young Winston Churchill, considered one of the most eloquent speakers of all time, used to practice speaking in a tree house on his mother's estate during his early days in Parliament.  Although most of us do not have access to a tree house, we do have a mirror, stopwatch and tape recorder, practicing essentials recommended by Kalish.  One of the best forums for practicing is Toastmasters. It certainly worked for ``Home Improvement'' star Tim Allen, who was president of a Toastmasters club while serving time in a federal prison for selling drugs.  Toastmasters members pay $36 a year to the international organization, plus additional local club dues.  Local colleges and universities offer courses in public speaking through their adult-education programs. But if you want one-on-one training, you may want to consider a public-speaking coach. -0- SIDEBAR: HOW TO MANAGE STAGE FRIGHT  _ Slow down. If you feel anxious, slow down both your thinking and your speech.  _ Speak with emphasis. Anxiety occurs when you try to do two things at once: give your speech, and think about your fear. If you concentrate on the speech _ by putting greater emphasis on the words themselves _ this should reduce anxiety.  _ Stay in the present. Use your senses of touch, hearing and sight to displace thoughts about yourself _ about how nervous you feel or how you'll do. Those only make you more nervous.  Listen to the previous speaker or the person introducing you, making a mental imprint of every word. Or focus on something in the room, such as the conference table or carpet, and memorize its features.  _ Use a thought-stopper. Place a rubber band loosely around your wrist. If your thoughts turn to yourself when giving a presentation or in anticipation of one, snap the rubber band to get back on track.  _ Diminish your ego. People in some stage-fright groups are asked to give a serious speech while holding a rubber chicken. This gives them permission to be a little foolish and explore how that feels. Taking yourself too seriously increases and sustains public-speaking anxiety.  _ Accept stage fright. The more you accept that you have stage fright, the less panicky you will get. Stage fright has to do with fight-or-flight reactions; the more you struggle, the greater the anxiety.  _ Pause. When we fear something, our natural reaction is to speed up, to get through the experience quickly. Instead of starting your speech in a rushed manner, take command of the lectern and the audience's attention by pausing. Don't begin until your anxiety level is steady or falling, not rising.  _ Want to be there. People with stage fright, like claustrophobics, often feel trapped. But by and large, we are in public-speaking situations because we put ourselves there. Remind yourself of this.

By IAN SPELLING (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  David Schwimmer wanders into the restaurant at the Four Seasons Hotel in Manhattan. A few patrons notice him but try their best not to let him notice that they've noticed.  The star of NBC's runaway hit ``Friends'' is in town to promote ``The Pallbearer,'' his first film since the series transformed him into an unlikely sex symbol.  ``If we'd done this interview just three years ago, we'd probably be sitting in a McDonald's,'' the good-natured Schwimmer says, laughing, as a waiter places a pot of hot tea before him. ``I'm still not used to all of this.''  Schwimmer could have cashed in on his newfound fame by seeking out a would-be blockbuster. Instead, he opted to star in ``The Pallbearer,'' an ambitious romantic comedy laced with black humor. The actor plays Tom Thompson, an unemployed recent college graduate who lives with his mother (Carol Kane) in Brooklyn, pals around with his friends (Michael Rapaport, Michael Vartan, Bitty Schram and Toni Collette) and hopes to romance Julie DeMarco (Gwyneth Paltrow), his greatest high-school crush.  Tom's life takes a bizarre turn when he answers a phone call from Ruth Abernathy (Barbara Hershey), who asks him to be a pallbearer at her son Chris' funeral. Tom agrees, though he has no memory of his former classmate and supposed best friend.  ``This was the best (movie) script I read,'' Schwimmer says, dressed down in a black sweater and black jeans. ``I read 30 or 40 scripts last season, when I was looking for a project for the spring.  ``I had the luxury of knowing I was employed on `Friends,' so I was extremely picky and there was no rush for me to leap into a movie, no matter how much money was offered. I thought the first movie out after `Friends' was important.  ``I didn't want to do a piece of fluff or a broad comedy. I wanted to do something that had a little more substance and style.  ``Then I saw this script and knew I had to play Tom. I fought like hell in the auditions and I got it.''  Schwimmer describes Tom as a regular guy trying to get his act together. As the story unfolds, Tom reacquaints himself with Julie, who initially doesn't remember him, and embarks on an affair with Mrs. Abernathy.  In the film's 90 minutes, Schwimmer explains, Tom matures from a boy into a man.  ``I tried to play that arc emotionally in terms of Tom's inner life and physically in terms of his appearance,'' he says. ``Tom learns the world doesn't revolve around him anymore and that his actions affect other people.  ``When you start to realize those things and consider other people's feelings, that's when you become a man or, I should say, an adult.''  Schwimmer, 29, says working with first-time director Matt Reeves was fun. Having been born in Queens, Schwimmer was pleased to shoot ``Pallbearer'' in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens. Further, the actor enjoyed performing with the film's ensemble cast, particularly Paltrow.  He and Paltrow, daughter of actress Blythe Danner, got on swimmingly from Day One.  ``We connected, and I think that comes through on screen,'' Schwimmer says. ``I'm much older than she is and I've got a lot of training in theater, but she came in and nailed it.  ``She's really good, good beyond her years.''  Ultimately, Schwimmer feels that committing to ``Pallbearer'' was the right choice for him, and he sounds satisfied with the movie, which Miramax will release nationally on May 3.  ``It's Matt's film, his vision, and I think he got what he was after,'' Schwimmer says. ``For me, it's hard to watch scenes I liked be edited out or moments I thought were important be shortened.  ``In theater, you have control of a moment and in films you don't. That's frustrating.  ``Overall though, I watched `The Pallbearer' and I laughed and I almost cried at the end. So I'm happy with it.''  As for ``Friends,'' the series is about to end its second season firmly ensconced in the Nielsen ratings' top five. Schwimmer reports that he and his castmates all felt pressure to maintain the show's quality and to live up to the hype surrounding it.  Fans of ``Friends'' got their wish earlier this season when Ross (Schwimmer) and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) finally began dating. While Schwimmer likes how the relationship has evolved, he wouldn't mind if problems emerged.  ``I'd like to see that initial heady phase die down and reality set in,'' says Schwimmer, who in December broke up with his girlfriend of several years. ``That could happen if Ross becomes frustrated that Rachel doesn't have a real career or sense of ambition.  ``This is in my head, though I've expressed it to some degree to the writers,'' he adds. ``I think Rachel is still the baby, that she still needs to find herself.  ``I think they should break up sometime next year. Then it'll become much more heated, because they'll be dating other people while in a breakup situation.  ``After two or three years, hopefully, they'll get back together, resolve everything and get married.''  While Schwimmer seemed to come out of nowhere when ``Friends'' debuted, the actor already had about a decade of acting experience. He began performing while in high school and continued at Northwestern University and Oxford University.  In 1988, he joined seven of his friends from Northwestern in founding the Chicago-based Lookingglass Theatre Company. With that troupe, he has been involved in 50 productions in capacities ranging from actor to writer to director.  By 1993, Schwimmer was working regularly on television and in films, adding to his resume roles in such series as ``Monty'' and ``NYPD Blue,'' and the films ``Crossing the Bridge'' (1992) and ``Wolf'' (1994). Then came ``Friends.''  Considering his current level of popularity, Schwimmer is refreshingly levelheaded.  ``I'm 29,'' he says. ``All of this didn't happen when I was 15, so I know who I am and have a good sense of myself.  ``I have a great family and am close to my parents, sister and grandparents. I've got great friends and the theater company I can run to when I need my sanity.''  The most difficult aspects of celebrity, he notes, are dealing with the paparazzi and the loss of privacy that accompanies an increased public profile.  ``I haven't been able to fully make peace with those things,'' he says with a mournful look. ``At times it's made me think about just giving it all up.  ``Sometimes it's just not worth it, and that's a shame. I think the media and tabloid journalism, especially on TV, have done some damage.  ``It's gotten ugly, ugly, ugly, and there's no reason in hell why, on a Saturday afternoon, I have to outrun people chasing me in a car. There's no reason why I can't just have a life.''  Schwimmer plans to spend his spring/summer hiatus from ``Friends'' in Chicago, where he'll direct his theater troupe in a film titled ``Dogwater.'' It will be his film-directing debut.  ```Dogwater' is a comedy about a 10-year high-school reunion,'' he says. ``I'm so excited. For eight years I've wanted to direct the whole company in a film, and now I'm getting my chance.''  Upon its completion, ``Dogwater'' will be released by Miramax, the studio with which Schwimmer recently signed a development deal.  Right now, Schwimmer appears to have it all, with ``Friends,'' ``The Pallbearer,'' his film-directing debut and a development deal _ not to mention hot tea and an attentive waiter at a ritzy hotel.  ``Something's got to give,'' Schwimmer says, laughing. ``But I don't worry about it going away, going `poof,' because I'll always have my family and friends.  ``I've saved money, and I think I'll always have my talent. So, if for some reason I'm suddenly blacklisted in Hollywood, I'll go back to my theater company or I'll teach.  ``I'll find something, and I'll be happy.''

By CINDY PEARLMAN World rights except Chicago (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Call him the lyin' king.  Nick Nolte lies. About everything.  ``I've lied since I was born, but I'll be honest with you,'' Nolte promises. Then he smirks.  What about the story of his accidentally leaving a suitcase containing his deceased father's artificial leg in a New Mexico bar?  ``Made that one up,'' he rasps, stretched on a couch in a Los Angeles hotel suite.  He once said that he'd been offered the lead in ``Superman'' (1978), but insisted he would only do it if he could play him as a schizophrenic.  ``That's true. Superman is a schizophrenic,'' Nolte says.  Did he once have 16 tons of river rock delivered to his home in Malibu as an experiment?  ``That's true. Actually, I wanted to see what 16 tons of rock looked like,'' he says.  He's said he was once supposed to host ``Saturday Night Live'' but bailed out on Thursday.  ``True,'' he says. ``I didn't know where I would be on Saturday.''  Did he meet his first wife at the circus, where she was doing a trapeze act?  ``False, but Cosmopolitan magazine printed it,'' he says with a laugh.  What about his acclaimed college-football career?  ``Uh, not really,'' Nolte says, cracking up again. ``But it sounded good when `North Dallas 40' (1979) came out.''  Well, then, what's Nolte's favorite lie of all time? He doesn't hesitate.  ``Once I told a reporter that I had a testicle tuck. And he believed me! It started going around. Doctors were going on `Hard Copy' to talk about it. There were pictures and diagrams.''  Given this history, one takes everything Nolte says about his new film, ``Mulholland Falls,'' with a certain skepticism.  In the film, opening April 26, Nolte plays Maxwell Hoover, who works in the ``Hat Squad,'' a special anti-organized-crime unit within the early 1950s Los Angeles Police Department. Hoover investigates the murder of a woman (Jennifer Connelly) and uncovers a possible scandal within the Atomic Energy Commission, headed by a shady character played by John Malkovich.  ``Naturally, I spent months doing ride-alongs with real cops. I saw several murders, drug deals, punks in the gutter,'' Nolte says.  This could be true _ actors are always talking about their exhaustive research. But Nolte's smile gives him away.  ``Like I would train with cops! How many cops have I played in my life? About a million? I could talk `cop' in my sleep.''  Hollywood has more than its share of characters, but few more offbeat than Nolte.  ``Nick's nuttier than a fruitcake,'' his mother once told GQ magazine. And she should know.  For all of that, he's professional enough to have spent more than 20 years in Hollywood _ and proven his ability to anchor big-budget films. Besides Connelly and Malkovich, the all-star cast of ``Mulholland Falls'' includes Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Chazz Palminteri and Melanie Griffith, who plays Nolte's wife. Cameos include Rob Lowe, Daniel Baldwin and singer Aaron Neville.  It was the script which initially attracted Nolte, however.  ``Honestly, I was looking for something a little gritty. The character I play is in deep trouble, which is a good thing to find in a character. I don't like flawless people and I don't like playing them. They bore me,'' Nolte says.  ``The other big reason to do this movie was that I could work with the director Lee Tamahori, whose work in `Once Were Warriors' (1994) I found brilliant.''  Nolte's judgment isn't always reliable. Last year, he teamed with the prestigious producer Ismail Merchant and director James Ivory for ``Jefferson in Paris,'' which proved a major disappointment.  ``Look, I've been around so long that when a movie doesn't do something big, you lick your wounds and just push on,'' Nolte says. ``I found all that historical research fascinating.''  He shrugs.  ``You don't stay in this business as long as I have without a rebound plan. I know how to bounce back. I don't brood about things anymore.''  This philosophical approach reflects the new Nolte. There was a time when he brooded about everything and usually found solace in a bottle.  ``Drinking was inevitable. I was always full of pain,'' he says.  This pain dated to his childhood in Omaha, Neb. At age 10, he climbed up to the roof of his garage and attempted to leap into his neighbor's yard. He missed and impaled himself on the fence instead.  The fence post nearly pierced his lower intestine, which would have been fatal. Instead, it went through his groin.  ``I had this awful scar. The boys were relentless about it. In gym class it was, `Oh, he looks like a girl.' It was really a horrible time.''  Desperate to get out of Omaha, Nolte began to earn money by selling fake ID cards in front of bars. That is when his serious drinking began. Caught with the ID cards, he was kicked off the high-school football team, convicted of a felony and given five years probation.  He moved to Los Angeles, and on a lark auditioned at the Pasadena Playhouse, and was accepted. His rugged good looks and acting talent led to TV-series appearances, a couple of TV movies and then, in 1975, his movie debut in ``Return to Macon County.''  But fame was no solace to his depressive mood and only accelerated his drinking.  ``As I got more famous, I wanted to run away from it,'' he says. ``In a lot of ways, I liked failure more than success. At least failure has a nice lesson in it. And I figured that success was just a setup for failure anyway.''  So he drank. By 1985, when he made ``The Ultimate Solution of Grace Quigley'' with Katharine Hepburn, Nolte was out of control. When he arrived late on the set one day, Hepburn had had enough.  ``I hear you've been dead drunk in every gutter in town,'' she said angrily, ``and it has to stop.''  ``I can't stop,'' Nolte responded. ``I've got a few more gutters to go.''  There was no one incident that halted his drinking, Nolte says.  ``Finally drinking became an issue of life and death. I just knew that eventually the cork had to be put in the jug. It was really a question of, `Do you want to live?'''  Eight years ago, after what he estimates as 30 years of drinking, he walked into an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.  Now, he says, he is in control.  ``It's a daily thing but not a struggle anymore. I go to AA, but it's not like if I see a bottle of booze somewhere that I have to think, `Willpower, willpower.' I'm just at peace with myself.''  Today, his pastimes are considerably more innocuous.  ``I garden,'' he says. ``Doesn't that sound pathetic?''  Nolte even says he's given up lying. ``I'm past those days,'' he says, but he can't entirely keep a straight face.  There was the time he said his ex-wife carried a tranquilizer gun when she was around him.  ``I like that one,'' he says with glee.  And what about the reports that he ate dog food for a week before the infamous ``Down and Out in Beverly Hills'' (1986) scene in which he devours some puppy chow?  ``Now that's true,'' he says. ``But it was Beverly Hills gourmet dog food, which is nutritionally better than Dinty Moore stew.''  His creative approach to the truth may be genetic, at least if you can trust Nolte's recollections of his mother.  ``She worked at Marshall Fields in Chicago in the 1930s and was a model. She always claimed that she dated Frank Capone (brother of the famous gangster Al Capone).''  Did he believe her?  ``Of course not,'' Nolte says and smiles.

"58009"	"he"	"emphasizes"	" Even so, Rakove in his own way seems to undercut any strict originalist view. After all, the Philadelphia Convention did not transmit Holy Writ, like Moses on Mount Sinai. The convention, he emphasizes, was a debate. The framers wrote a proposal _ a bill, in effect; the state legislatures, with ratification, made the Constitution the law of the land. ``Meaning must be derived from usage,'' Rakove writes, and any sensible originalism must take into account the understandings of the original words that developed afterward. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"

They include the power to set revenue estimates (now, the council must accept the mayor's estimates) and the power to approve mayoral appointees (now, the council has almost no say over who gets key city posts). And until the council gets such powers, Vallone maintains, it cannot exert itself both effectively and responsibly. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
