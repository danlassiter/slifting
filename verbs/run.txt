, he writes,	 Besides ``tipping its hat to Edward Said,'' Cannadine said, his title is a reference to the use of pageantry in the empire, the trappings of class. The British Empire, he writes, ``was about antiquity and anachronism, tradition and honor, order and subordination; about glory and chivalry, horses and elephants, knights and peers, processions and ceremony, plumed hats and ermine robes; about chiefs and emirs, sultans and nawabs, viceroys and proconsuls; about thrones and crowns, dominion and hierarchy, ostentation and ornamentalism.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200108.gz

For one thing, he said, Cannadine had improperly understood his argument in ``Orientalism'' _ ``that the notion of the Orient was the creation of outsiders, and that it was a way of fortifying English identity and not just of creating other races.'' In addition, Said said, Cannadine simply missed the larger point about empire. </P> 	nyt_eng_200108.gz

In a lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court, the Ethiopian-born owners of the Royal Valet Parking Co. say they were told that their predominantly African-American and Asian employees did not fit the ``image'' of the hotelier at its Clift Hotel in San Francisco. A representative of the hotelier denied the claim.  SOUTH  NORTH CAROLINA: NEW VOTER IN STATE  In the clearest sign yet that she intends to run for the Senate in her native state, North Carolina, Elizabeth Dole registered to vote in Salisbury, the town where she was reared and where her mother still lives. Dole, a Republican and former presidential candidate, said she would decide ``soon after Labor Day'' whether to run for the seat being vacated by Sen. Jesse Helms. On Thursday, Dole terminated her voter registration in Kansas, the home state of her husband, former Sen. Bob Dole.  NEW ENGLAND  MASSACHUSETTS: CAMPAIGN FINANCING DELAY  Candidates for state office have yet to receive any of the $23 million set aside for the state's new campaign financing law, and an interim state budget will only extend their wait. Candidates who meet the law's fund-raising and spending restrictions were supposed to be eligible for matching public money on Aug. 1, but the Legislature continues to argue over how the law should be administered. Some legislators threatened to shut down the state government by holding up the emergency budget if it did not include the campaign financing, but relented to get the overdue budget passed.  WASHINGTON  WHITMAN LOBBIES FOR NOMINEE  In response to mounting questions in the Senate, Christie Whitman, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has begun a public lobbying campaign on behalf of Donald Schregardus, President Bush's nominee to be the agency's top enforcement officer. In a letter, Whitman cautioned senators not to be misled by the ``raw numbers'' presented by environmental groups contending that Schregardus was lax in enforcing environmental laws in Ohio, where he directed the state's environmental office. Rather, she said, they should examine the environmental ``indicators'' that show the state became cleaner during his tenure. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010824.0426 type=story > <HEADLINE> PRISON SENTENCE HANDED DOWN IN HASKELL INDIAN NATIONS UNIVERSITY </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-HASKELL-SENTENCE-KAN) </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200108.gz

Ex-Massachusetts homeboy Mike Sherman, on his new dual role of coach and general manager of the Packers: ``Being a dad and a coach, that's harder than being a general manager and a head coach.'' Of course, Sherman has been a father for 18 years and a general manager for less than 18 weeks, so he may change his mind after he deals with a few of the things predecessor Ron Wolf had to face in rebuilding the Packers into an NFC powerhouse over the last decade. While many coaches talk of family life being important to them, says Sherman, football too often seems to win out. ``I would not want to be the best football coach and general manager and lose my family in the process,'' he said. Unlike so many of the maniacs wearing whistles, Sherman has been known to sneak away from the team complex to watch one of his kids' school or sports activities, then go back to work to study film before going home. You've got to hope a guy like that can win in the NFL, because if he does, there might be a tad more sanity among the members of his fraternity. </P> 	nyt_eng_200108.gz

When David Stern meets with the owners at the next Board of Governors meeting, he needs only to bring a picture of Mase to illustrate how the luxury tax has turned most teams into financial wusses, including the heretofore spend-free Heat. Mason is coming off an All-Star season, is versatile and valuable (and, we admit, a handful), and he can't find a home. The Heat won't re-sign him because of luxury tax concerns. They won't trade him, even-up, for the same reason. Milwaukee appears to be the only quasi-serious suitor, but has little to offer. Mase's case might get a boost, however, from the recent deal that sent Tim Hardaway to Dallas. The Heat now have a trade exception to utilize, and that might be helpful in a multi-team deal.

Amazon, the online bookselling site, features reviews written by readers, and jokers learned long ago that they could post fake reviews on the site under pseudonyms. A series of book reviews on Amazon.com _ supposedly written by Andrew Lloyd Webber, the creator of Broadway spectacles like ``Evita,'' ``Jesus Christ Superstar,'' ``Phantom of the Opera'' and ``Cats'' _ brought the practice to comic highs and lows last week.  The 18 reviews under the composer's name promoted books about such diverse topics as alien abduction and raising the ornamental fish koi. (``I was a late-comer to their charm and probably would not have thought of becoming a keeper had I not got utterly, hopelessly and embarrassingly trashed on slings in Singapore several months ago and stolen a couple of carp from the pond in my hotel lobby.'') Other false Lloyd Webber endorsements went to guidebooks on combating halitosis and premature ejaculation.  Many reviews were not fit to print and might qualify as libelous if not for the latitude that the law affords to obvious parodies and to attacks on public figures who, in the words of former Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. of the Supreme Court, thrust themselves into the vortex of fame.  Webber did not respond to a request for comment.  Carrie Peters, an Amazon spokeswoman, said, ``We don't encourage anyone to impersonate anybody on our site.''  The company, she said, has screening mechanisms to prevent fake postings, but ``occasionally, things like this get through.'' The books and other products referred to in the reviews, including a Cave Raider action figure, are genuine, she said.  After they were brought to the company's attention, the pages were quickly removed from the site. IN SOFTWARE EMPIRE, THE SUN NEVER SETS ON `BESPOKE'  There would seem to be little of the Englishman in Mark Barrenechea, a garrulous native New Yorker who is a senior vice president at Oracle in Silicon Valley. But last week, during a presentation about the corporate software market, Barrenechea used a Britishism so frequently that a reporter felt compelled to ask him about it.  Bespoke was the term. It means custom-made. ``We'll work with customers to tie their bespoke applications into our information architecture,'' Barrenechea said in one of many variations on the theme. When asked about his use of the term, Barrenechea said he had probably picked it up while living in England a few years ago.  Americans, if they are familiar with the word at all, probably know it in the context of bespoke suits, or other custom-made clothing. But in Britain these days, bespoke is spoken not only by haberdashers but by techies. On its Web site, for example, SandiTech, an information technology consultant in England, says it develops ``bespoke software for specific client requirements.''  In his 1995 novel ``The Diamond Age,'' Neal Stephenson, an American science-fiction writer, envisions a future so dystopian that the social structures of Victorian England have been recreated to maintain at least a semblance of civilization. A character is asked his professional position and department and replies: ``Engineering. Bespoke.''  This impresses the questioner, who says, ``I know only the very finest engineers make it to Bespoke.''  Last week a search on Google.com for ``bespoke and software'' yielded more than 50,000 matches _ many of them linked to overseas sites. An armchair linguist might infer that the globalization of the information technology industries has caused British English to become more of a lingua franca of the world's techies.  ``It seems that the global communications boom, coupled with companies spanning many countries, is giving rise to a superset of English vocabulary,'' SandiTech's managing director, Gary Smith, wrote in response to an e-mail query.  One technology capital where ``bespoke'' and ``custom'' are both understood is Bangalore, India. Given the country's history, India has a decidedly British flavor to its English. But its cross-fertilization with the United States high-technology industry has also made the Bangalore region conversant with American geek-speak.  Saritha Rai, a business writer in Bangalore for The New York Times, offered this e-mail observation: ``Most Indian software companies that deal with both American and English clients are quite adept at making the switch between `lift' and `elevator,' `line' and `queue' and `bespoke' and `custom software,' depending on whom they are speaking with.'' UNLEASHING ICONS AND EMBRACING DESKTOP CLUTTER  Remember the ``clean desktop'' for Windows XP? That was the original plan for the new Microsoft operating system, a default desktop screen with a pristine countryside scene uncluttered by icons. Instead, the user would go to the ``start menu,'' and a single click would bring up a menu of eight iconlike links to software applications, Internet services or Web sites. At least three of them would be Microsoft offerings.  Microsoft reversed course last month and declared that PC makers could put icons on the Windows XP desktop, after a federal appeals court found that Microsoft's past contracts with PC companies were an overly restrictive abuse of its monopoly power. At the time, Microsoft portrayed the move as going the extra mile to accommodate a pesky court ruling, even though, the company insisted, its clean desktop approach made PCs less confusing to users while affording plenty of competitive choice.  Other PC makers are mostly weighing their desktop plans. But Compaq Computer has decided to risk confusing users and give them choices. Asked about the number of icons that will appear on the Compaq desktop machines for consumers, Kevin Kyle, a marketing executive, replied, ``Tenish.'' Those 10 or so, he said, will be in addition to three desktop Microsoft icons that the Microsoft is mandating. Compaq previously announced its agreement to make America Online its featured Internet service provider. Disney, Kyle said, will also get an icon on the Compaq desktop. He would not say who the others would be. Compaq, like its rivals, is eager to tap new sources of profit. Selling the valuable icon space on PC desktops and entering into revenue-sharing deals with companies like AOL Time Warner and Disney are welcome sources of revenue.  In the case of AOL, Compaq's agreement for a desktop icon was only one element in a broad three-year deal, including commitments by AOL to buy Compaq computers and by Compaq to advertise with the media giant. The three-year deal could generate two-way business in the range of $1 billion. ``This is one the broadest relationships we've ever put together,'' said Mike Mulcahy, vice president for global alliances at Compaq. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010826.0081 type=story > <HEADLINE> THIS FALL, BLACK IS BACK </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-FASH-BLACK-HNS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200108.gz

Martel is very good at  setting up a situation and, as is true with many writers, much less good  at resolving plot contrivances without resort to coincidence or the  suspension of disbelief. Still, ``Billy Strobe'' is compelling reading  for at least two-thirds of the way. Billy wants to be a lawyer like his  father, committed to the underdog. But he also hungers after the  respectability his Okie background denies him, and he enters into a  stock-market scam for which he is sent to Soledad prison. There he  avoids gang rape and probable death by becoming a jailhouse lawyer,  completing a law degree by correspondence school, and being hired by a  prestigious San Francisco law firm for the publicity value the  rehabilitation of an ex-felon may bring it. Soon he is trying to find  evidence to exonerate his father, who killed himself awaiting  imprisonment for fraud, and to free a Soledad lifer who he is convinced  was framed for murder. Paths converge, echoes of John Grisham's ``The  Firm'' become louder, and in the end there is a courtroom scene of  which, I think, Wright would have been disapproving, but until we get  there the story, and the writing, hold one fascinated. </P> 	nyt_eng_200108.gz
, I suspect,	 Between O'Shaughnessy and Martel fall Fredrick Huebner's Shades of  Justice (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $24) and Steve Martini's The Jury (Putnam,  $25.95). In Huebner's book a forensic psychiatrist returns to Bainbridge  Island, near Seattle, to examine the mental state of a successful  painter who has been charged with killing her husband. Few of the  characters are sympathetic, and Huebner uses clumsy techniques of  exposition to get the facts before the reader, but there are many  fascinating bits and pieces in the book, even if a half-awake reader  will see who committed the murder long before the various legal eagles  do. ``The Jury,'' on the other hand, remains consistently interesting to  the end, as lawyer-sleuth Paul Madriani seeks to defend a medical  researcher who is charged with the murder of an African-American  research assistant. Racism, sexual harassment, the ethics of human  genome research, and the scene in San Diego all figure in the solution,  which is nicely tied up. Wright would, I suspect, remark that he knew  very few lawyers who were also detectives, but hey, isn't that what this  kind of fiction is all about? I am going to miss The Practical Lawyer. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010827.0120 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-BOOK-TIPS-BOS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> WHAT'S HOT ON THE JUST-PUBLISHED LIST (For use by New York Times News Service clients) c.2001 The Boston Globe  ``The Wild Blue'' by Stephen E.

, they progressed,	 There are programs, even some good ones, that are available to the poor mentally ill, but they exist inside hospitals. You have to find them yourself. Public-relations campaigns for treating mental illnesses _ signs on buses, TV ad spots and so on _ have had some success at bringing people into clinics, but the idea that indigent depressed people will ever have the wherewithal to seek and find help, even if they did figure out for themselves that they were depressed, is ludicrous. A program that did a basic mental-health screening at family-planning clinics or at job centers or at places where welfare checks are distributed might allow us at least to But the best place to start would probably be the welfare rolls. Major depression is frequently triggered by stresses, and there is no question that the lives of welfare recipients are extremely stressful. At the moment, however, welfare officers do no significant screening for depression. Some pilot studies are under way on the treatment of depression among the poor, and the results appear surprisingly consistent. I was given full access to subjects from several of these studies _ some involved therapy, others medication, still others a combination of the two. To my surprise, everyone I met felt that his or her lot had improved during treatment. They felt better about their lives, and they lived better. Even when faced with insurmountable obstacles, they progressed, often fast and sometimes far. Over and over again, as I spoke to more poor people who had been treated for depression, I heard tones of astonishment. How, after so many things had gone wrong for them, had they been swept up by this help that had changed their entire lives? ``I asked the Lord to send me an angel,'' one woman told me. ``And he answered my prayers.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200108.gz

KIDS-IMMUNIZATIONS  UNDATED: With a recent study showing that Texas ranks worst in the nation in vaccinating preschool children against serious diseases, officials are working to boost immunizations and track them better. But that push is hampered by a lack of funding and a booming population, officials say. A recent study by the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ranked Texas 50th among the states in immunizing children.

BOOKS-`WARLOCK'  The title of Wilbur Smith's new novel, ``Warlock,'' refers to a 200-year-old Magus who roams the landscape of ancient Egypt working machinations on behalf of the Pharaoh and tutoring his young prince. Unfortunately, the Magus' powers do not extend to preventing the murder of Pharaoh at the hands of his power-hungry first lieutenant, who then declares himself the new leader of Egypt. This sets the stage for the power struggle that forms the heart of the story. The story of ``Warlock'' is as simple and straightforward as its title. Smith does not bother with metaphor or literary allusions.

McGovern flew the maximum 35 missions over Germany in an incredibly difficult-to-steer plane that was miserably uncomfortable, with aluminum doors so thin a man could break through if he fell against them.

Brian De Palma's horror classic ``Carrie,'' arriving Tuesday as a special 25th-anniversary edition DVD, centers on an introverted young girl with an awesome, terrifying power. This low-budget sleeper tapped into a vein of high school angst, alienation and retribution that remains as frighteningly relevant today as it was in 1976.

EXP-MIDEAST-U.S. (Washington) _ The United States said Monday that Israel's assassinations of Palestinian leaders were inflaming and complicating the Middle East conflict. In language rare in official statements from Washington, the State Department also called on Israel to alleviate ``the pressure, the hardship and the humiliations of the Palestinian people.'' The State Department repeated its frequent appeal to the Palestinian Authority to stop attacks on Israelis and arrest those responsible for attacks. (Summary from wires) (Staff byline to come.)  EXP-MIDEAST-VIOLENCE (Ramallah, West Bank) _ Widening the scope of its targets, Israel killed Abu Ali Mustafa, head of the militant Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, in an airborne missile strike on his office here Monday. It was the first time during 11 months of rising violence between Israelis and Palestinians that Israel had assassinated the top-ranking leader of a Palestinian faction in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. By Joel Greenberg.  EXP-U.S.-IRAQ-PLANE (Washington) _ Iraq said Monday that it had shot down a U.S. reconnaissance plane. The U.S. military confirmed that a $3.2 million unmanned RQ-1B Predator aircraft had gone missing over Iraq and may have been shot down while operating to enforce a ``no-fly zone'' over much of the country's south. Iraqi television aired video footage of what it described as the wreckage of the U.S. plane scattered over the desert near the port city of Basra. (Summary from wires.) By Thom Shanker.  EXP-U.N.-U.S.-RACISM (Washington) _ Secretary of State Colin Powell will not attend the U.N. conference on racism opening in Durban, South Africa, at the end of this week because language deemed anti-Israeli is still in the program. But a more junior delegation may still attend. By Jane Perlez.  EXP-CENTRAL-AMERICA-DROUGHT (Pillado, Honduras) _ A merciless and stubborn summer drought has left almost 1.5 million subsistence farmers in central America with no crops to sell and no food to eat. By David Gonzalez.  EXP-BUDGET-SURPLUS (Washington) _ Congressional budget analysts warned Monday that the economic downturn and President Bush's tax-cut package would force the federal government to spend $9 billion from the Social Security surplus this year and billions more over the next three years. By Philip Shenon.  EXP-SCI-STEM-CELLS (Undated) _ A strange new list of world powers has emerged, at least in the field of human embryonic stem cell research. The roster is evidence of the inventiveness of the newcomers, but also of how much the United States and Europe, the usual powerhouses of biomedical research, have been held back by political restrictions. By Nicholas Wade.  EXP-MALL-WALKERS (Evergreen, Ill.) _ Most of America's 1,500 enclosed shopping centers open early each morning to legions of sneaker-shod, hyperorganized and often elderly mall walkers. But Evergreen Plaza tried to go boldly where no mall had gone before, sending out this notice: ``The mall will no longer be available to walkers.'' Burned by a firestorm of bad publicity, it has been forced into retreat. By Blaine Harden.  EXP-TOSHIBA-LAYOFFS (Tokyo) _ Toshiba announced layoffs of 10 percent of its work force, or 18,000 jobs, and said it would lose about $1 billion this year. Widespread press reports say a similar announcement from Hitachi is imminent. By Miki Tanikawa.  EXP-WRIGLEY-GUM (Chicago) _ The member of the Wrigley family currently in charge of the William Wrigley Jr. Co. is being applauded for aggressively pushing the company to reinvent itself with a host of new products and marketing initiatives. By David Barboza.  EXP-E-BOOKS (New York) _ Last August, top executives from Microsoft, Barnesandnoble.com and several book publishers assembled for a news conference to usher in the coming age of the electronic book. But a year later, the main boast of electronic books appears to be that they don't gather dust. Publishers and online bookstores say only the very few best-selling electronic editions have sold more than a thousand copies. By David D. Kirkpatrick.

, we learn,	 But step back, and the magic is intertwined with the real. Why is the fairy realm any different from the world outside? The duke, who supposedly looms over the play with legal severity, had, we learn, previously dallied with the fairy queen; he had also, before the play, abducted his affianced, Hippolyta, in battle. Demetrius, one of the lovers, had, outside the forest, earlier loved Helena, before turning his affections to Hermia, only to turn back to Helena. And Lysander, the supposedly true lover of Hermia, won her affections with the familiar earthly magic of ``rings, gauds, conceits.'' The forest, with all its dreamy illusion, is just a variation on the court. </P> 	nyt_eng_200108.gz

(Top lede)  TOSHIBA-LAYOFFS (Tokyo) _ In a sign that the problems besetting Japan's big technology companies are deep and far-reaching, Toshiba Corp. said Monday that it would eliminate some 19,000 jobs, or 10 percent of its work force, and that it expected to lose almost $1 billion in the current fiscal year. Plummeting prices for memory chips were at the heart of the trouble, the company said. By Miki Tanikawa.  (The story has moved.)  (Center display)  WRIGLEY-GUM (Chicago) _ After years of stagnant volume growth in the United States, the William Wrigley Jr. Co., the maker of Doublemint, Juicy Fruit, Big Red and Winterfresh, is benefiting from brisk sales of sugarless chewing gums and gaining against its two biggest rivals, the makers of Dentyne and Carefree. The member of the Wrigley family currently in charge is being applauded for aggressively pushing the company to reinvent itself with a host of new products and marketing initiatives. In perhaps its boldest venture yet, Wrigley is moving into the health-product business by creating a division that aims to use chewing gum as a palatable way to deliver a wide-range of remedies.

(Center right)  ASSOCIATES-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ Computer Associates will probably defeat Sam Wyly's attempt to replace four members of its board when shareholders vote at the company's annual meeting on Wednesday, independent analysts say. But win or lose, Wyly's bid has already encouraged change at Computer Associates, the fourth-largest independent software company.

But Cythera Inc., which has no connection to the computer game, is obscure no more. The company, which was known to be working on human embryonic stem cells, turns out to have derived nine colonies of such cells, according to a list released by the National Institutes of Health. That is more than other organizations better known for stem cells, like the University of Wisconsin. By Andrew Pollack.  (Scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET.)

With a little forethought, he said, big private houses, with all the trimmings, could be reincarnated as art museums or adoption agencies for homeless children. </P> 	nyt_eng_200108.gz

When Larry Coker replaced Davis, he agreed to Williams' request. ``As an offensive coordinator, I wanted D.J. to play offense,'' Coker said. ``But you see things differently as a head coach and, I think, D.J. can most help this team at linebacker.

Rego said he was confident the musical will find an audience uptown. Just in case, though, the team returned to the show's old stomping ground: ``Urinetown'' had a booth every day at this year's recent Fringe festival, selling discount tickets outside the Theatorium and offering free tickets to Fringe volunteers. </P> 	nyt_eng_200108.gz

, I think,	 But I don't think ``First Love'' is an autobiographical play. It is about a specific couple on the stage, Harold and Edith. In many ways those two people stand for other couples in love for the first time. There are iconic moments: the first meeting, the first date, first sex, the fight, the reconciliation, the wedding that goes south right as it reaches the altar. Those moments, I think, are absolutely recognizable to anyone who has been in love or been saturated with images of love and romance in movies, magazines and television. What I love about ``First Love'' is that my father plays with those images. It's first love, but these are not a couple of dippy young kids; they are two mature, sophisticated, well-read, dysfunctional adults. </P> 	nyt_eng_200108.gz
, I thought,	 CHARLES MEE: Theater really feels like me. One of the reasons I stopped writing history was that I felt trapped in a form of discourse that seemed false to me. The form of history, I thought, required me to frame rational, dispassionate statements about the world that were meant to contain the truth, but they were statements about a world that made you want to weep and shriek and cry out. And that content wasn't allowed. Somehow, the theater allows me to use both my mind and my heart. That's why it feels good to me. </P> 	nyt_eng_200108.gz
, I think,	 People who love theater as it has been for 5,000 years, with the exception of this small, unusual period in theatrical history, welcome the return of a more highly theatrical form. And that's the tradition out of which, I think, I work, out of which a lot of work is being done in Europe today and out of which a lot of downtown avant-garde work is being done. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010829.0365 type=story > <HEADLINE> DARK ECONOMIC NEWS UNDERLINES NEED FOR TAX CUTS, BUSH SAYS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> SAN ANTONIO (BC-BUSH-TAXES-1STLD-WRITETHRU-2TAKES-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200108.gz
