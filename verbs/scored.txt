"134900"	"he"	"scored"	" Six games into the season, the Red Storm had learned a painful lesson: Hatten had to perform, or else. Fortunately for St. John's, he usually did.

Most of all, he scored, providing offense for a team that sometimes seemed to have no other options. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"148844"	"we"	"scored"	" When Providence came on, the shots came in flurries. But I got confident as the game went on. We dominated the first period, and the second was kind of even. They were coming fast and, in the third period, it was neck and neck. It's huge for a goaltender when you know your team is not going to let down.

But I've been calm in the last two games, and it seems to work out very well. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"

And then I said, 'Now it's time to go back at it.'  </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"161385"	"they"	"scored"	" We were right there in the first half, but then in the second half, they put together a nice drive, made some third downs, and got a score, said Jacksonville coach Jack Del Rio. We had a ball dropped [by Jimmy Smith] on third down, which would have extended a drive for us. Instead of keeping it close, they scored, and that's where it got away from us. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
