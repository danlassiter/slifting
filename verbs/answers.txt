When someone in the Borders Bookstore audience asks the 59-year-old chef how he keeps going, he answers, ``Anything is easier than being behind a stove 12 hours a day.

"37662"	"he"	"answers"	" Rosie's husband was long since gone, having died in 1960 from bronchial pneumonia. She was alone with little Kenny in a run-down neighborhood, the floor made of concrete, the windows cracked. When people ask Lofton today why he doesn't talk much, he answers, ``It's probably the way I was brought up. We had nothing. And when we did get something _ a new toy, some new shoes, anything _ we protected it so no one messed it up.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"

"117326"	"she"	"answers"	" Well, she answers, her mother has just moved in with her because her father died and nobody else could take her in, her husband drinks too much and her son just got picked up by the police for doing drugs.

"139658"	"she"	"answers"	" The issue haunts Aird's comments, even when she talks about something else. Asked whether children today are being raised well, she answers, I don't idolize the past, 'Let's go back there.' I'm really interested in what we can create out there in the future. But right now there are three values that are being taught by our culture: self-indulgence, self-gratification, and excessive materialism. I don't think it's going to be a very happy place to live in if that's the reigning value system. For my children, I want a world where we have a better balance. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"

"151098"	"she"	"answers"	" But the earnest, preachy movie was creaky in its own day. It never occurred to me that I'd fall in love with a Negro, Katharine Houghton says perkily as the daughter. Reminded that her fiance, the flawless Sidney Poitier character, is a very important doctor, she answers, And when I'm married to him I'll be important! This tame vision of middle-class liberalism was sent out into the world of the Rolling Stones, the Vietnam War, Black Power and women's liberation. No wonder the remake is so timid. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"151814"	"he"	"answers"	" When Cuban, who recently awarded Johnson a four-year, $10 million contract, is asked how he identified him as a coaching prospect, he answers, The players told me. They said, 'He's gonna be good.' Or, 'He is good.' </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz

, he said,	 Ransom, a native of Mexico, has lived much of his adult life in the United States. Many Latinos, he said, adopt little U.S. culture at first. Some live in Hispanic neighborhoods and have scant reason to learn English. The closeness of Mexico also makes it easy to maintain ties to home. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz

, he questioned,	 So this was his chance to provide on-the-job training. At 6-foot-7, he towered over the student umpire, and as Clarke jabbed a forefinger at his adversary's chest, he questioned, at high volume, the student's eyesight, judgment and ancestry. But the student held his ground and kept his composure. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, you know,	 A: That's a true story. I conflated a few people, because it was more than one. When I moved to where I live (in rural North Georgia), I'd have these kids who'd come see me all the time. I watched them grow up over the years. A couple of them became gay and, you know, a couple of them became gay bashers. In a way they were like one person, because they both went through hating themselves and talking to me about what was going on in their lives ... </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, he said,	 The traveling, the reuniting of families, the big meal, all are reminiscent of a certain American holiday in November. We Jews do food very well, Jeffrey Salkin agreed. But it is unfortunate, he said, if Passover becomes a sort of Jewish version of Thanksgiving. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, he added,	 And, he added, if the opt-out were still in force by the time the SEC accepted international standards, my guess is we would require a reconciliation before the SEC would accept a filing from such a company. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, they say,	 Amityville's residents have tried, they say, to distance themselves from that machine. When the producers of the original wanted to shoot their movie in Amityville, the village said no, forcing them to set up shop in Toms River, N.J. When American International Pictures asked to premiere the movie in Amityville, the village, again, declined. And you will not find a single shop or vendor with The Amityville Horror merchandise for sale: No I survived Amityville T-shirts, 112 Ocean Ave. dollhouses or glow-in-the-dark pig masks. A town that could have easily cashed in on its notoriety has steadfastly refused to do so. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz

, he says,	 To avenge the defeat, he says, he took up the guitar, after wasting decades on drugs, alcohol and woman-chasing. He says he summoned his brother's spirit and is now booking club gigs, teaming with the drummer Buddy Miles, who played in Jimi Hendrix's Band of Gypsies. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, he said,	 But with the help of steady guitar lessons, he said, he is writing songs by channeling his dead brother's spirit into his lyrics and guitar solos. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, he said,	 He was my big brother, my best friend, my surrogate dad, he said. He was in charge of me: fed me, took me to school, taught me sports. Hendrix recalled watching his brother graduate from a one-string ukulele to an old acoustic guitar to a $40 Sears electric guitar. While Jimi never taught Leon guitar, he said, he would fall asleep each night listening to Jimi's incessant practicing and go along to band rehearsals and gigs and, later, on tour. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, she said,	 Whitenton talked about her childhood in rural Alabama and her father, a fiddler, who taught her and her four younger brothers to play. He owned the first radio there, she said, and her mother put it in the window by the porch on Saturday nights so neighbors from near and far could set up chairs on the lawn and listen to the Grand Ole Opry broadcast. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, she said,	 A year later, Orio has grown used to her new routine, which saves her about $368 a month in gasoline costs and another $125 in parking fees.

While almost all are related to spinal surgery, there is also one for an ergonomic gun handle and one for an improved paper clip. Michelson said when inventing, he worked nights and weekends at his kitchen table or in his garage. Not being married until 2000, he said, he had time for inventions. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, he said,	 Bassiouni's report covered all aspects of human rights violations in Afghanistan, detailing concerns about inequities against women, abduction and trafficking of children, illegal seizure of property, lack of due process and social and economic abuses against minorities, displaced people, the poor and the disabled.

In a rambling discourse, he said his role was part of a plan to force the release of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, a blind Muslim scholar who is serving a life sentence for conspiracy to blow up New York bridges and tunnels and other landmarks in 1993. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, you know,	 I thought, you know, it's only a matter of time before someone gives me a proper clonking, he said. I've got a wife and two beautiful kids and I've got the most incredible office of brilliant people that I work with, and we're all very happy, and I've got responsibilities. So driving around on a 125-cc plastic vulnerable machine isn't probably the cleverest thing to do in London. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz

"159472"	"he"	"answers"	" Ah yes, Dylan -- an artist Baez has been linked with ever since they were a couple in the early 1960s.

Suffering can humanize people, she answers, but it also damages them. One of the first signs of damage is the need to turn our rage and shame onto someone else; to play, however briefly, the superior Us to a lesser Them. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
