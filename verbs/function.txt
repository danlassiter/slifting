"149251"	"they"	"function"	" In different ways, Maria Full of Grace and Million Dollar Baby both revisit the theme of upward striving that has been a staple of American movie realism at least since the Depression. The paths their heroines take -- drug smuggling and prize-fighting -- are different of course, as are the fates that await them at the end of their struggles, but the defining contours of their personalities are remarkably similar. They are stubborn, quick on their feet and sometimes reckless, meeting even the most gruesome and terrifying prospects with winning, heartbreaking decisiveness. Though both Sandino and Swank are lovely to look at, they function, in these movies, much more as objects for identification than objects of desire. Their ordinariness, the feeling that the world they occupy is one we might inhabit, however distant it may be from our actual lives, is part of what makes the audience care about them. And even though she dwells in the allegorical, quasi-science fiction landscape of Charlie Kaufman and Michel Gondry's wild imaginations, Winslet's Clementine may be the most familiar character of them all -- a flaky, passionate, changeable creature as maddening as she is irresistible. Clementine could be someone you know, or someone you've dated, or -- most likely, perhaps -- someone you've dated's idea of you. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"
