(Deans, Cox News Service).  ISRAEL-LABOR -- JERUSALEM -- The Israeli Labor Party holds its primary Tuesday for the Jan. 28 elections. Frontrunner Amran Mitzna calls for immediate negotiations with the Palestinians despite the violence. Heading into the vote, he said one of his first acts as prime minister would be to remove all the troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip. Labor is expected to lose the general elections to Ariel Sharon's Likud, but Mitna's candidacy would at least provide a distinct alternative. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).  EDs: Moving about 7 p.m. ET, after vote totals are announced.  NATIONAL  HOMELAND -- WASHINGTON -- After months of heated, partisan debate, the Senate will approve a White House plan to create a new homeland security department Tuesday, handing President Bush a major victory. A Democratic effort to strip several last minute GOP provisions from the bill failed after moderate senators were promised by the GOP leadershp that several changes will be made later when Congress approves spending bills for the department. Both parties claimed victory, but no one was happier than Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, a champion of the president's plan who is retiring after 18 years in the Senate. (Moscoso, Cox News Service).

NERVE-GAS -- ANNISTON, Ala. -- A coalition of 12 environmental groups filed another lawsuit in federal court on Tuesday to halt the incineration of more than 2,000 tons of nerve gas and other deadly chemical weapons at the Anniston Army Depot. The oft-delayed incineration, which will be carried out at a specially built $1 billion facility, was scheduled to begin early next year. But the latest lawsuit could once again delay indefinitely the start up. The environmental groups said the incineration will release toxic chemicals into the air that could imperil the health of surrounding communities. (Seabrook, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 14.  OPED/EDITORIAL  SCHUETT-COLUMN -- GIBSONBURG, Ohio -- An over-active imagination is a priceless asset. Just think what a boring population we'd be without the ability to invent and exaggerate _ no Leonardo daVinci (flying machine, 1492), no George Lerner (Mr. Potato Head, 1952), no federal Office of Management and Budget (Fiscal Year 2003). No Harry Potter. But being a full-time resident of fantasy land also has its drawbacks. (Schuett, Cox News Service). MOVED.  YOUNG-COLUMN -- Sen.

(Emling, Cox News Service).  HDEPOT-SALES -- ATLANTA -- Home Depot's same store sales were down 2 percent in the third quarter. The company is blaming itself for undertaking a major reset in stores across the country to freshen up and update older stores. The resets are necessary but they're disrupting customer traffic.

(Bond, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 18.  DOWDOW -- ATLANTA -- Disappointing sales for Home Depot irked investors Tuesday, prompting them to sell shares and collect more profits from October's big rally.

(Atlanta Journal-Constitution)  LIFESTYLE  SUGAR-BUSINESS -- SAVANNAH, Ga. -- With Americans indulging their sweet tooth as never before, these would figure to be good times in the sugar business. They aren't, not in some quarters. This refinery, which spins out the South's most popular sugar, Dixie Crystals, is running near capacity. But half of the nation's other sugar refineries have closed in the past decade. Savannah Foods, once the nation's most profitable sugar maker, lost its corporate identity in the mergers that roiled the industry during the '90s. The company that bought it, Imperial Sugar of Texas, was forced to file for bankruptcy protection last year after debt from acquisitions and a world sugar glut mucked up its balance sheet.

ENTERTAINMENT/ARTS  MOVIES-HEAVEN -- WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Director-screenwriter Todd Haynes wants to take us back to the 1950s, or at least to Hollywood's image of what the 1950s were like. In Far From Heaven, opening on Friday, he pays tribute to the women's pictures of director Douglas Sirk, who idealized American life with vivid Technicolor melodramas, full of well-appointed suburban homes and high-style fashions, yet they were stories of heartache and societal barriers. (Erstein, Palm Beach Post). 40.
