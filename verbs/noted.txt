"3550"	"he"	"noted"	" Willson said it was appropriate for Congress to take care of pregnant women and children first because the cost was relatively modest and the return on such investment great.

"4404"	"he"	"noted"	" Silverman, the Maryland lawyer, said he did not believe that fines were ever worth fighting over. ``They never worked,'' he insisted. Moreover, the fact that the courts are allowing only relatively small fines, he noted, encourages people to say it's worth, say, $5 a day, to them to hang onto that pet or the illegal flagpole they just put up on the front lawn.

Obligations of TRPA, the compact directed, ``shall not be binding on either State.'' TRPA's prime function, we noted, was regulation of land use, a function traditionally performed by local governments. Further, the agency's performance of that function gave rise to the litigation.

Soon their dream restaurant was hemorrhaging money. ``I had to spend all my time here and couldn't be at our other restaurants,'' Rick laments. Those locations, too, began to falter -- and, one by one, to close. In 1992, Weylu's Sure in Brockton even filed for bankruptcy. Shortly thereafter, Michael Bruno, the Changs' accountant at the time, stated in an affadavit that all his clients' businesses had liabilities in excess of their assets.

See id., at 152, n. 40; Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 s301, 87 Stat. 1004. But we specifically observed in that case that the directors were placed on the board to protect the United States' interest ``in assuring payment of the obligations guaranteed by the United States,'' and that ``(f)ull voting control . . . will shift to the shareholders if federal obligations fall below 50% of Conrail's indebtedness.'' 419 U. S., at 152. Moreover, we noted, ``(t)he responsibilities of the federal directors are not different from those of the other directors to operate Conrail at a profit for the benefit of its shareholders,'' ibid. which contrasts with the public-interest ``goals'' set forth in Amtrak's charter, see 45 U. S. C. s501a. Amtrak is worlds apart from Conrail: the Government exerts its control not as a creditor but as a policymaker, and no provision exists that will automatically terminate control upon termination of a temporary financial interest.

By living rent-free at Simpson's home for six months, she noted, Kaelin saved himself $6,000. ``And with all of that, you don't feel obligated to him?'' she asked him. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"
"18151"	"they"	"noted"	" Opponents, however, argued in favor of the need for experience and pointed out that voters can impose term limits every two years at the polls.

"20120"	"he"	"noted"	" Most impressively, he noted, the Mandela government not only followed through on a promise to reduce auto tariffs, but did so in the middle of an auto-industry strike, when unions allied with the dominant African National Congress were clamoring to keep the tariffs in place. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"20457"	"she"	"noted"	" Historically, culture was no stranger to the Olympics Games, said Rita Dove, the 1993 American poet laureate who helped to organize this event, which, in addition to the panel discussions, included afternoon and evening readings by the laureates.

"20556"	"he"	"noted"	" At a hearing last August, he noted, Ms. Mazzola testified that she accompanied Fung throughout his time at Simpson's house on June 13 and would have seen Vannatter hand over the envelope containing the vial had he done so. But in the past week Ms. Mazzola has testified to napping for a few moments while in the house, and said she might have missed the moment Fung received the envelope. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"20772"	"he"	"noted"	" Retirement, he noted, provides time for sifting for meaning in life's fading facts.

"20783"	"they"	"noted"	" And along with expressions of sympathy came somewhat more testy reminders that the United States could hardly regard itself as less violent than the rest of the world.

This brings the club's relationship to the library full circle, she noted, because the first gift the club gave to the university was the stained glass window still seen on a west wall in the library. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"21140"	"he"	"noted"	" Matheson concurred that EAP testing had excluded Simpson and Goldman. But he insisted that his original report had included a proviso: that the blood could have been Ms. Simpson's and that deterioration might have skewed the results. Ms. Simpson's hand, he noted, had been immersed in moist blood, a medium that would only have hastened such degradation. Indeed, blood that was clearly hers had similarly degraded. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"

"21339"	"she"	"noted"	" Outside the jury's presence, Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark persuaded Ito to bar the knife. There was no dispute, she noted, that it had been planted after the fact; the police had previously combed the entire area with metal detectors. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"21415"	"he"	"noted"	" ``I'm neither surprised nor not surprised; I'm pretty neutral,'' said Notebaert.

"21438"	"she"	"noted"	" ``The reciprocal arrangement is, they go back to the legislature and try to get these bills passed,'' Schwartz said, citing state Sens. Charles Duke of Colorado and Don Rogers of California as two whose agendas this year were linked to extremists.

"21961"	"she"	"noted"	" What is more, she noted, the dollar demonstrated its biggest one-day gain in nearly four years against the Japanese yen and the German mark. Big institutional investors and traders, especially in Europe, ``are now calling a bottom'' to the dollar's slide in value, she said. ``With the dollar reaching bottom, some foreign money is returning'' to American financial markets, she said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"22132"	"they"	"noted"	" Brokers and builders and their lawyers expressed concern that the decision could damage home sales and housing investment.

"22199"	"we"	"noted"	" We recognized this distinction between maximum occupancy restrictions and land use restrictions in Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494 (1977). In Moore, the Court held unconstitutional the constricted definition of ``family'' contained in East Cleveland's housing ordinance. East Cleveland's ordinance ``select(ed) certain categories of relatives who may live together and declare(d) that others may not''; in particular, East Cleveland's definition of ``family'' made ``a crime of a grandmother's choice to live with her grandson.'' Id., at 498-499 (plurality opinion). In response to East Cleveland's argument that its aim was to prevent overcrowded dwellings, streets, and schools, we observed that the municipality's restrictive definition of family served the asserted, and undeniably legitimate, goals ``marginally, at best.'' Id., at 500 (footnote omitted). Another East Cleveland ordinance, we noted, ``specifically addressed . . . the problem of overcrowding''; that ordinance tied ``the maximum permissible occupancy of a dwelling to the habitable floor area.'' Id., at 500, n. 7; accord, id., at 520, n. 16 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). Justice Stewart, in dissent, also distinguished restrictions designed to ``preserv(e) the character of a residential area,'' from prescription of ``a minimum habitable floor area per person,'' id., at 539, n. 9, in the interest of community health and safety.

A QUESTION OF COLOR AND `COLORED'  In the New Yorker's description of the dinner that preceded Seventh on Sale/The Return to New York, a sale of designer clothing to raise money for AIDS, writer Hilton Als reported:  ``After dinner, a number of people took to the dance floor, among them Rosie Perez, who, being colored and female, brash and vulnerable, is emblematic of the new New York.''  Colored? Once a term Americans used to describe African Americans, ``colored'' has been pretty much out of use since 1955 or so. (In South Africa, however, it is still used and includes anyone non-European, including Indians). Furthermore, Perez is Latina _ a ``person of color'' in accordance with current parlance _ but not African American. She is also ``colorful,'' meaning flamboyant, but that's not what Als meant, either.  When we asked the New Yorker's Maurie Perls to explain, she then asked Als _ who, she noted, is black.  ``He wrote it very specifically with that word in mind,'' she said after talking with the writer. ``What he was trying to say in the article is that there is not a lot of distinction in New York between being colored and not colored, and indeed that Rosie Perez is the symbol of the new city. He's using it in a very positive way.''  THE SCULPTOR SPEAKS UP  William Behrends, the North Carolina sculptor who worked on the official Capitol bust of former Vice President Spiro Agnew, called from Washington, where the statue was being unveiled, and described his thoughts on creating a work of art to celebrate a disgraced politician.  ``I, of course, was in college and a young man during that time'' of Agnew's resignation, he said. ``I was certainly aware of all that. This commission is to commemorate someone who served as vice president, which Mr. Agnew did for five and a half years. If it was going to be done, I thought I'd be honored to do it.''  Behrends said he hadn't given a lot of thought to Agnew's deeds. ``A much more important thing to me was where it was going.''  Among the sculptor's other subjects are a statue of Henry Ford II in Detroit and a bronze of Vivian Smith, a limited partner in the Houston Astros, that stands outside the Houston Astrodome.  He's at work on a statue of an official of the New York Port Authority, and from Washington will fly to Indianapolis, where he has been sculpting the winner of the Indy 500 for years.  TO STEINEM, SISTERHOOD IS POWERFUL  Asked about anti-feminist Camille Paglia in the latest issue of Interview, feminist Gloria Steinem begins by comparing her to Clarence Thomas, ``someone who was helped by a movement they weren't a part of, but then discovered they could be rewarded for opposing it. ... Their main purpose seems to get ... credentials for their attacks.''  Steinem goes on to say that Paglia is worse than Thomas because Paglia blames women themselves for their problems. And she says that Paglia is worse than Pat Robertson because at least ``he knows what the women's movement is doing.''  And then she compares Paglia to Arianna Stassinopoulos, whose book, ``The Female Woman,'' was written, she says, to counter Germaine Greer's ``The Female Eunuch.''  ``The anti-feminist book didn't last,'' opines Steinem, ``because it just didn't reflect women's experience. Most women want to know how to deal with real problems and make their lives better, not how to hurl insults at other women.  ``Incidentally, Arianna finally married Michael Huffington, the guy who used his family's money to make such a fool of himself running for the U.S. Senate in California.

"25919"	"he"	"noted"	" But Darden argued that the second test was far more accurate. That was partly because Simpson no longer needed to wear protective gloves underneath; Rubin, he noted, couldn't get into his own gloves when he put on latex gloves beforehand.

"26040"	"he"	"noted"	" The strategy was best summed up by Lord Tebbit, a former party chairman and a figure revered by the right. He said all the Cabinet members were ``locked in'' and unlikely to break ranks. The only danger, he noted, was from ``a stalking horse candidate,'' adding: ``I think John Major has probably taken the best tactical opportunity that he can to force the issue, get it over, and I think with a clear wind behind him nobody's going to challenge him in November.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

More than half of those, she noted, cost less than $304, meaning that a minimum rent of $400 would in effect mean at least a 30 percent increase.

"26502"	"she"	"noted"	" Sandy Richards, a spokeswoman for Alamo, said her company left the program after deciding it was not cost-effective. She said Alamo joined late, having begun April 11, 1994, and the company was uneasy that the criteria varied so much. In addition, she noted, driving records of all states are not open to scrutiny; at the moment 15 states and the District of Columbia make records partly or wholly available. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

"26679"	"she"	"noted"	" Ms. Clark insisted that studio photographs were necessary, since images taken from drivers' licenses did not adequately show the victims' hair.

"27184"	"he"	"noted"	" Tony Blair, the Labor leader, suggested that the Tories' troubles were just beginning. The prime minister, he noted, ``said the election would clear the air _ it hasn't.''

"27689"	"he"	"noted"	" Gifford has found when helping to reconstruct ``The Shakers'' that ``sometimes, according to the notation, I was wrong.'' But, he noted, Humphrey herself wouldn't hesitate to change the dance.

"28956"	"he"	"noted"	" Dr. John Coffin, a molecular biologist at Tufts University and a member of Varmus's committee, took a middle ground. ``There is a valid argument to be made on both sides,'' he said. ``There is always a range of opinions as to how fast to push something.'' Pushing too slowly, he noted, can get researchers mired in technical minutiae, while pushing too fast can waste opportunities to perfect the method. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"28957"	"he"	"noted"	" Culver thinks it may be too soon to launch into a clinical trial, ``It is my opinion as a scientist and a physician that we've got a lot more we can learn and do to optimize this type of gene delivery and destruction of tumor cells,'' he said. When a clinical trial begins, he noted, refinements of the method are no longer of interest. ``Once the decision is made the refinement issues are only scale-up issues,'' he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"29112"	"he"	"noted"	" Clearly, Gingrich likes the limelight, and he says he has found it by being the House Speaker. Huge crowds already seek him out, he noted, and his book, ``To Renew America,'' has soared to the top of the best-seller lists. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"

"29448"	"he"	"noted"	" What Kassirer objected to most deeply is the manner in which the new system of corporate healthcare involves physicians to some degree in a form of rationing. In the old days, he noted, physicians were never at risk, no matter what they ordered for their patients. It cost them nothing to order tests, ask for consultations, keep patients in the hospital longer than expected. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"29517"	"they"	"noted"	" Although the project had obtained a building permit, the protesters challenged the approval on several points. The elevator terminated at the third floor where there are two bilevel units, they noted, leaving a planned roof garden reachable only by stairs.

"29679"	"she"	"noted"	" ``We are arguing for a specific set of policies, not for a specific date on which to get to balance,'' she said.

"29771"	"he"	"noted"	" Thompson said he would also try to forge a common position on welfare, but feared there was not enough time to do so before the Senate begins debating the bill in a few days.

"30344"	"he"	"noted"	" Daniel Mitchell, a Heritage Foundation economist, says experience doesn't square with industry claims. In an interview in his Washington office in May, Mitchell pointed out that the Tax Reform Act of 1986 didn't affect home values and housing market activity signficantly. This is a crucial point, he noted, because the '86 law reduced the value of the home mortgage deduction dramatically when it cut the top marginal tax rate from 50 percent to 28 percent for most taxpayers. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"

"32053"	"they"	"noted"	" Republicans scoffed at the memorandum, calling it an attempt to frighten the public.

"32197"	"he"	"noted"	" I went to see ``Clueless'' with my kids the other night. The ticketseller punched out three tickets from the computer, but when I handed them to the usher who stood a foot or two away, he was momentarily confused. He had heard me ask for ``Clueless,'' which made sense, for it is a movie about teen-age babes, and there I was with two teen-age babes, but the tickets, he noted, were for ``Babe'' _ a movie about a pig.

Reducing the counsel fees from the requested $691,000 to $250,000, the Vice Chancellor offered this observation: ``(T)he defendants' willingness to create the settlement fund seems likely to have been motivated as much by their concern as to their potential liability under the federal claims as by their concern for liability under the state law claims which this Court characterized as `extremely weak.'''

"58577"	"she"	"noted"	" Friday's report ``provides little support for the latest inflation scare,'' said Cheryl Katz, senior economist at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.

In addition, he noted, the government had already allocated about one-third of the year's public spending budget in the 50-day the stopgap budget passed earlier.

"62292"	"they"	"noted"	" ``The introduction of new, efficacious therapies may not be associated with greater social equity,'' said the study authors, a group from Washington University and other St. Louis-area institutions plus Harvard Medical School.

"63035"	"she"	"noted"	" In the majority opinion, Justice Ginsburg said concerns about the destructive impact of placing men and women together at VMI reflected the same ``ancient and familiar fear'' that once kept women out of the law and other professions. Realistically, a VMI education may not be the right choice for most women, she noted, but Virginia would not argue it is suitable for most men either. ``Women seeking and fit for a VMI-quality education,'' she wrote, ``cannot be offered anything less under the state's obligation to afford them genuinely equal protection.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199606.gz"

"63869"	"she"	"noted"	" The signs of that could be seen as early as last year, she noted, in the 69-day strike by Boeing workers.

"64465"	"he"	"noted"	" ``A whole slew of budget proposals has been falsely or unrealistically planned, usually against better judgment,'' said Karl Diller, the budget spokesman of the opposition Social Democrats.

"64505"	"they"	"noted"	" White House and Republican officials alike said they assumed that Perot, 66, would defeat Lamm for the nomination. Beyond Perot's role as the Reform Party's founder, they noted, Federal election law is unclear as to whether Lamm would be entitled to the $32 million in matching funds that Perot would get as a result of his showing four years ago, a factor that the party's voters would likely consider a strike against the former governor. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"
"64607"	"he"	"noted"	" When the laws were written, he noted, the personal computer and the virtual office were barely a dream.

Intel Corp., the world's largest microchip maker, will unleash Monday its largest advertising campaign supporting its semiconductors for server systems.  The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., is preparing for a tussle with Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and IBM in making chips that run the most expensive servers. This year, as it introduces several faster server chips, Intel said, it will spend tens of millions of dollars putting its message on billboards, magazine pages and Web sites.  The advertisements play off the microprocessor, the chips that run personal computers and led Intel to $34 billion in sales last year.  ``If you know and love Intel, you know and love Intel for the PC,'' said Deborah Conrad, vice president for the company's business marketing and alliances group.  Intel is trying to change that. In one of the advertisements, a pair of headphones perches above the word ``microprocessing.'' Beside it, above the word ``macroprocessing,'' sits an expansive bank of speakers worthy of a heavy metal concert.  Intel's microprocessors power 85 percent of the servers that sell for less than $100,000 _ chips that handle more simple Internet data transactions _ according to International Data Corp., a research firm. But this year, Intel is trying to stake its claim in a market it has barely dented _ faster machines that run corporate data centers.  Intel holds only 3 percent of the midrange market and 5 percent of the high-end market. High-end servers sell for more than $1 million, bringing higher profit margins for their manufacturers.  Within the next few weeks, analysts expect leading computer makers to begin selling the first servers that feature Intel's newest chip, called the Itanium. The Itanium, whose release is two years behind schedule, will be Intel's first 64-bit chip. Intel will follow the Itanium with a more advanced 64-bit chip, code-named McKinley, next year.  Conrad said Intel expected to use its manufacturing prowess to produce and sell the chips more cheaply than its competitors. Analysts said it would take at least a year before that strategy is reflected in the market share figures.  ON PRIVACY, ONE MORE REASON TO WORRY  In the increasingly futile battle against unsolicited marketing, consumers may be vulnerable to incoming mail from an eyebrow-raising source: employees who have taken the liberty of lifting addresses from their companies' databases to do their own free-lance marketing.  Last week, a public relations manager at PrimeLearning.com, a company in Stamford, Conn., that conducts online corporate training, sent an e-mail message advertising her ``3 BR, 2 Bath Dutch colonial'' home for sale in nearby Darien.  The message, she noted, typographical error and all, was to ``everyone I've every come in contact with.'' Apparently, that included the news media contacts in the company's database.  When asked by telephone about the propriety of mixing work contacts with a for-sale-by-owner advertisement, the publicist said, ``If I crossed a line, I apologize.''  In a separate phone conversation, her boss, Cindy Terzian, the vice president for marketing, said the company was not aware the message had been sent. The action was ``contradictory to the company's privacy policy,'' Terzian said, although she added that it was a gray area because many of the names in the media database had been collected by the employee before she joined the company.  Then there is the former employee at a Crate and Barrel store in Manhattan who took what might be considered more serious liberties when he left his job to pursue a real-estate career. He mailed cards to former customers _ apparently using addresses copied from company records.  ``You may remember me from Crate &AMP; Barrel,'' the card read. ``We worked together when you made a purchase in the furniture department. I'm now launching my career in residential real estate sales and rentals. I thank you in advance for your support with direct business and referrals.''  Bette Kahn, a spokeswoman for Crate and Barrel, said the former sales associate took the customer data ``without our permission and without our knowledge; it's definitely against our policy to give our lists out for anything.''  In general, corporate policies about the use of customer data tend to focus on how it can be used by the business _ not necessarily by employees. So is it time to educate staff members about how data-privacy rules govern employee access to customer or other business contact information?  ``We've never addressed it specifically, like, `You cannot take this list and do anything else with it,''' Kahn said. ``It always went without saying here.  ``But the more we deal with computers, the more access employees have. And the more possibilities there are of someone doing something not quite kosher with those names. Maybe it should be part of our training.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010520.0099 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-GRAPHICS-BUDGET-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Here are the New York Times News Service Macintosh graphics scheduled for Monday, 05/21/01.

REDIAL: Pacific Bell violated state rules by forcing customers to listen to an ad touting its ``repeat dialing'' feature when callers dialed a busy telephone number, a California Public Utilities Commission staffer ruled this week.

The 21/2-year-old company, which has been steadily eating away at Cisco's dominance in the market for the large routers that carry Internet traffic, said it will earn 8 or 9 cents per share, instead of the 24 cents expected by analysts.

Blair has said the government will decide within two years whether a referendum should be held on scrapping the pound. By the end of trading, the pound had weakened once again and fallen to $1.3755. The euro fell to 84.39 U.S. cents. The moves reflected a trend among investors to link the pound to the euro in dollar trading.  EUROPEAN UNION: DVD PRICE INQUIRY  The competition commissioner, Mario Monti, said his department was investigating why the prices of digital videodiscs were higher in the European Union than in the United States. The commission is examining the coding system that film production companies and the makers of digital videodisc equipment use to limit sales of discs to one or another geographical region. Such a system could be a smoke-screen to allow companies to maintain artificially high prices, Monti said.  SWITZERLAND: SOFTWARE SHARE OFFER  Temenos Group, a Swiss company that makes banking software, said that it and its existing investors would sell shares in an initial public offering that would value the company at as much as $941 million. The Geneva-based company, which makes software for 300 banks and financial services companies including Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., plans to sell 10.8 million shares, and existing shareholders will sell about 1.9 million shares. The company will use the proceeds from the offering to repay at least half of a $60 million loan from Deutsche Bank, and keep $50 million for acquisitions and expansion in the United States and Japan. The shares, in one of the largest technology stock floats in Europe this year, will be priced between $14 and $17. The final price is to be set on June 25 or 26, when trading is to start on the Swiss Stock Exchange.  ASIA  KAZAKHSTAN: OIL PIPELINE STUDY  The Bush administration has authorized money for a study on a $2.8 billion oil pipeline from Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, to Ceyhan, a Turkish Mediterranean port. The new senior adviser for Caspian Basin energy diplomacy, Stephen Mann, signed the $346,000 grant, from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency to Kazakhstan's national oil transportation company. The grant will pay for a study to evaluate potential routes for Kazakh oil to link up with the pipeline. The study will also examine whether Kazakhstan's only Caspian port, Aktau, can handle heavy tanker traffic.  SOUTH KOREA: DAEWOO PROFIT  Daewoo Motor announced an operating profit for last month of $10.4 million. The figure, twice as high as the operating profit reported by the bankrupt company in April, was expected to improve the bargaining position of the company's creditors in talks with General Motors. Although the company still lost $20.4 million in the first five months of the year, company officials said they hoped to show a profit for the year. Negotiators for General Motors and Daewoo Motor's creditors are working on a memorandum of understanding that will form the basis for final talks that would give GM control of the company. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010611.0230 type=story > <HEADLINE> FINNISH TELECOM EXECUTIVE RESIGNS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> LONDON (BC-EUROPE-TELECOM-465&AMP;ADD-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"

"94974"	"he"	"noted"	" Richard G. Parker, author of ``Bodies, Pleasures and Passions: Sexual Culture in Contemporary Brazil'' and professor of anthropology at the State University of Rio de Janeiro, describes the prejudice against Pelotas as ``an example of a broader pattern of linking regions or places to notions about sexuality'' in Brazilian society.

"95372"	"he"	"noted"	" Among the black and Hispanic lawmakers, there is a concern that soft money is needed to carry out voter registration and get-out-the-vote activities by the parties. But as Rep. Harold Ford of Tennessee noted Tuesday, the Shays-Meehan bill would not apply to fund-raising by independent groups like the NAACP. and labor unions for their grass-roots turnout efforts. The House's Democratic Campaign Committee spends only 4 percent of its funds on turnout activities, he noted, and a significant portion of that money would still be allowed under the new law. Blacks should be sensitive to Ford's assertion that the Shays-Meehan bill ``will help to diminish the influence of special interests'' that have prevented enactment of health care reform, a higher minimum wage, safe workplaces and a clean environment. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"

Still, she sounds optimistic about Sun's long-term prospects. The company, she noted, supplies the computers and software that help power corporate computer networks and the Internet. Sun has emerged from recessions in the past, typically stronger than ever.

"97297"	"he"	"noted"	" The poet laureate of the United States, Billy Collins, said that since Sept. 11 he had been inundated with poems from friends _ poems by Yeats, by the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, by the Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska _ all writers, he noted, from countries that have known war. ``We, as innocents, as Americans, have never been invaded,'' Collins said. ``We haven't produced a poetry that has much authority in this area. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"
"97409"	"he"	"noted"	" Jeffrey D.

"97431"	"they"	"noted"	" At a rally on Monday morning near Minnesota's domed Capitol, union leaders, joined by hundreds of workers, maintained that the strike was justified. In past years, they noted, they have often accepted raises that failed to make up for inflation. Now they want a catch-up raise that would be higher than the inflation rate, a demand not met by the state's latest offer, made late Saturday night. State officials, predicting a budget shortfall, say they cannot offer more. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"97443"	"I"	"noted"	" There was no evidence, I noted, that the questions had done any good at an American airport. That's still true, since the hijackers on Sept. 11 were apparently sly enough to avoid answering, ``Well, a friend did give me some box cutters.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"97475"	"he"	"noted"	" For example, he noted, north Dallas already has seen about 15,000 layoffs announced this year in the telecommunications and electronics industries. That helped push Dallas' jobless rate to 5 percent, higher than Fort Worth-Arlington's 4.3 percent. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"

"97954"	"she"	"noted"	" Leora Lowenthal, a senior social worker at New York University Medical Center who has also counseled relatives, said that the nature of the event itself _ ``the horror of it, the violence, the feeling of human cruelty'' _ could make death harder to accept. And for many, she noted, the last communication from loved ones was a cell phone call saying that they were fine and on their way out. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"98009"	"he"	"noted"	" Later, over a lunch of halal pizza, Muhammad said he knew that his message critical of some American Muslim leaders would be controversial among those gathered for prayers.

"99172"	"he"	"noted"	" In recent weeks, he noted, many Americans have moved from discussing the World Trade Center and the Pentagon to talking incessantly about anthrax.

"99328"	"he"	"noted"	" Perhaps they should have, Lomax said. The global economy was slowing before Sept. 11, he noted, and many industries, including airlines, were feeling the pinch. Now, he said, opportunists are taking macabre advantage of the cover provided by the terrorism attacks. ``We felt there had been a lot of companies around the world using it as an excuse for what they had been wanting to do for a long time,'' Lomax said.

"99370"	"he"	"noted"	" There has been little complaint from residents about the midnight truckloads of Washington mail, and far more resolution to stand up to the terrorist threat, Berger said. More than ever, the mayor said, it is clear that candor works best with the public, which has responded wholeheartedly. Three weeks after the attack on the World Trade Center, he noted, union and management leaders from the local Ford Motor plant flew six New York City firefighters here for a breather from the devastation in Lower Manhattan. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"99468"	"he"	"noted"	" He said the problem arises for directors because, when a company is solvent and everything is fine, their duty is to the shareholders. But, he noted, if a company becomes insolvent, the directors' duty shifts to the creditors. Often the slide into deep financial trouble is not obvious until after the fact. At that point decisions to pursue policies that seemed like a good way to maximize profits for shareholders could now look like ill-advised speculation to a judge who cares most about how those moves affected creditors. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"

"100527"	"he"	"noted"	" The most credible source of information, the census, is prohibited by federal law from asking about religious faith. Most surveys involve about 1,000 people, which makes measurement of any group, including Muslims, who constitute about 1 percent of the population, iffy at best.

"102511"	"she"	"noted"	" The idea of compromising by allowing for a cost-based exemption came from Johnson, who said the exemption should apply if an employer's costs would rise by 1 percent or more. Johnson said the experience of companies that have voluntarily adopted insurance parity suggested that the cost increase would be much less than 1 percent.

"102746"	"they"	"noted"	" Economists offered one ray of hope. The worst jobs reports often come out at the end of recessions, they noted, just before things start to turn up.

"109289"	"he"	"noted"	" Tudor once complained that Ballet Rambert's small stage, where he learned to choreograph, caused him to work in miniature rather than on an opera-house scale. When he staged ``Jardin'' for New York City Ballet in 1951, he thought Horace Armistead's decor was too grand, making his characters look too rich. Caroline, he noted, was entering into a marriage of convenience because her family was on the decline. He spoke of his own ``middle-class petit bourgeois background.'' It is background brought to the fore by the main characters in the Joffrey cast. Even the desperation of Maia Wilkins, a superb and luminous Caroline, can be explained by her implied shabby genteel situation. It is a compliment rather than an insult to say that everyone onstage looks very ordinary. Suddenly a new staging of an old ballet provides a valuable insight. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020313.0120 type=story > <HEADLINE> NEW TECHNOLOGY USES SOUND WAVES TO DETECT LAND MINES </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-NATGEO-TODAY-LAND-MINE-DETECTION-MARCH13-NYTSF) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"

Then they stimulate the cell electrically and it begins to divide in a laboratory dish, enabling scientists to harvest ``stem cells'' that can be used for research on potential therapies. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"

BOX-OFFICE (Los Angeles) -- ``Star Wars: Episode II -- Attack of the Clones'' and ``Spider-Man'' led the movie industry to a record-shattering Memorial Day weekend, as the two box-office titans hit more milestones and finished well ahead of a crop of strong challengers for multiplex movie audiences. Ticket sales for just the top 12 movies totaled a staggering $193.4 million, more than the previous record of $186.1 million grossed by the top 50 movies during the year-ago holiday weekend, according to studio estimates.

Today, the program has won the Big West Conference baseball title and clinched a berth in the NCAA regionals. Not bad for a program that was eliminated because of budget cuts, then brought back because of public outrage -- though not before the entire team had transferred elsewhere.

The company, based in San Carlos, Calif., now expects a pro forma loss before amortization and other charges for its fiscal first quarter of 12 cents to 19 cents a share instead of the loss of 6 cents to 8 cents it had forecast in its last earnings announcement. ``It is a difficult market,'' said Mitchell Kertzman, Liberate's chief executive. ``You've seen enough of that from the cable firms, with weaker spending.'' Demand for Liberate's advanced television software has lagged as telecommunications companies retrench after their late-1990s spending spree. In a statement, Kertzman said that Liberate would be able to turn a profit, minus charges, in the second half of its current fiscal year. The company said it expected to have $240 million in cash and equivalents eventually. Liberate shares fell 16 cents, to $1.95.   HARDWARE  INTEL TO EXPAND OPERATIONS IN INDIA  Executives from the Intel Corp. said Thursday that the company planned to infuse further investments to expand its chip design operations in India. Intel's chief executive, Craig Barrett, who was on a two-day visit to India, made the announcement following a meeting with India's minister for communications and information technology, Pramod Mahajan, in New Delhi. ``Craig Barrett announced that a design team was being set up to engage in high-end, 32-bit Intel architecture microprocessor design and development at its India development center in Bangalore,'' the company said. The Indian center designing and developing the high-end microprocessor will be Intel's third such site, after the United States and Israel. Intel, which has 900 employees in India, is expected to quadruple its staff strength in five years. Since chip design is a non-capital-intensive industry, smaller, independent chip design companies are being set up and are flourishing in the country. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020829.0367 type=story > <HEADLINE> PENTAGON BACKS WIDER FOREIGN SECURITY PRESENCE IN AFGHANISTAN </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WASHINGTON  (BC-AFGHAN-U.S.-1STLD-WRI) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"

Mysteriously the picture began looking like Nelson Mandela. So Breytenbach found a newspaper picture of Mandela and stuck it on the painting. Life, Breytenbach said, is made for collage: ``It's all in the stealing.'' You expropriate materials for new purposes. The French, he noted, call it ``detourner,'' literally to divert or reroute. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"

"133982"	"he"	"noted"	" Gore's motion was seconded by a number of prominent media liberals. Paul Krugman of The New York Times pronounced it ``so clearly true.'' The Washington Post's E.J. Dionne averred that conservatives have won a ``genuine triumph'' _ ``a media heavily biased toward conservative politics and conservative politicians.''

Consumers and businesses are being cautious in their spending, because of the uncertainty in the market, said Wayne Ayers, chief economist at FleetBoston Financial Corp.

"135432"	"he"	"noted"	" Richard P. Alley, an expert on past climate shifts who teaches at Pennsylvania State University, said climate has changed more abruptly a few times since the last ice age, and nature has shifted in response.

"135698"	"they"	"noted"	" Although doctors may understand health care issues better than their colleagues _ Frist wrote a detailed book on bioterrorism _ they face the same survival pressures and political constraints as other politicians, doctors and health specialists said. Traditional Washington power brokers _ lobbyists, interest groups, and the two major political parties _ can blunt good intentions, specialists said.

"136327"	"he"	"noted"	" Receiving no cash at all is rare, although many executives in this group forgo the majority of their base salary or receive a ``notional'' salary that is well below the median for their market peers, Hodgson said. On the other hand, he noted, the options grants given to these executives tend to be very large.

They can withstand the heat of a blow torch and still keep their cool. Every space shuttle has more than 20,000 of them.

First marketed last year as a Muslim-friendly alternative to Coca-Cola and Pepsi, Mecca-Cola has become an unusual protest of U.S. policies in the Middle East.

OPTICS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 02-07-03 22:50:00EST (BC-SHUTTLE-PHOTO-HNS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> That's the initial opinion of an optics expert on whether NASA can learn anything significant from an Air Force photograph that some people believe may show serious damage to space shuttle Columbia.  The photo released by NASA on Friday, taken by a powerful telescope in New Mexico, appears to show a jagged edge on one of Columbia's wings, just before the orbiter was destroyed.  That's the way it appears, but there are so many optical and equipment factors to ce cons5;2923tographic Technology at Rochester Institute of Technology. Many of his former students work at Johnson Space Center.  By way of street credentials, he's the guy who determined for the National Enquirer that O.J. Simpson really was wearing the Bruno Magli shoes in the infamous photograph, apparently making Simpson a liar when he said he never owned them.  The Houston Chronicle forwarded the image released by NASA to Davidhazy via e-mail.  ``Well, I'm only giving you my opinion. I'd be on the side of the person who says, `I don't know what the hell you're going to find from this,''' he said.  News reports of the photograph's existence surfaced Thursday. In the spirit of openness he has tried to assert, shuttle program manager Ron Dittemore released the image Friday.  Dittemore said he was calling in experts to examine the photograph, but, he added, ``It's not clear to me it reveals anything significant.''  The pixels, or smallest image components of the photograph, do appear to show a jagged edge and some vapor-like substance trailing the wing.  It would be easy to assume damage, Davidhazy said. ``If it were jagged to the extent I see it, it's tremendous damage. It's not something you wouldn't notice'' if the spacecraft was being monitored in some other way at that point, he said.  On the other hand, the image appears to be from a digital camera, which means that the equipment has to choose light gray or dark gray for the square pixels, and it can guess wrong depending on lighting conditions.  ``A shuttle tile is smaller than any of these (pixel) blocks,'' Davidhazy said.  One would need to analyze where the photo was taken, where the shuttle was and where the sun was, among other factors, he said.  Davidhazy said he might start by reversing the image to make the dark colors light and light colors dark, and take it from there.  ``When you try to photograph something 40 miles away, it's amazing they got anything,'' he said.

(Broadway, $14.) This solid, if provisional, overview of Clinton's White House years captures the man in all his exasperating contradictions and mercurial political guises. ``Klein doesn't stint on caustic appraisals; even so, he emerges as a disappointed, bewildered, but awed Clintonian,'' William Kennedy said in The New York Times Book Review last year. His account is ``dense but tight, funny, adroitly written and, in sum, the first savvy synthesis of the Clinton Age.''  10TH GRADE, by Joseph Weisberg. (Random House, $11.95.) Jeremy Reskin, the acutely ordinary narrator of this first novel, records his sophomore year in high school, conjuring the lolloping rhythm of suburban schooldays as he holds forth on such matters as the supreme social importance of basement rec rooms. The reader is ``effortlessly and convincingly sucked into the slipstream of dim teenage consciousness,'' David Kamp wrote in 2002.  LIFE SCRIPT: How the Human Genome Discoveries Will Transform Medicine and Enhance Your Health, by Nicholas Wade. (Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, $12.) A science reporter for The New York Times examines, and speculates on, the impact of the decoding of the DNA blueprint, including the possibility that illness will be eradicated and the human life span extended. ``The result is a wonderland tour of medicine's most radical shift in perspective since the germ theory of disease,'' Nathaniel C. Comfort said in 2001.  THE GOLEMS OF GOTHAM, by Thane Rosenbaum. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $13.95.) In this tale of rage and obsession, the ghosts of Holocaust writers like Primo Levi and Paul Celan are unleashed on New York, where they re-enact Kristallnacht, destroy skyscrapers and burn books, all because the public needs to be punished for failing to study the Holocaust well enough. Though it plays loosely with historical fact, ``the novel is rich in detail and vignette,'' Gavin McNett wrote last year.  CAN LOVE LAST? The Fate of Romance Over Time, by Stephen A. Mitchell. (Norton, $14.95.) A leading psychoanalytic theorist argues that love doesn't fade on its own in long-term relationships: We do our best to kill it, or let it grow stale, because we can't tolerate how naked and uncertain romantic longings can make us feel. ``Cheerful, open and humane,'' Mitchell ``reminds us that psychoanalysis is at heart a hopeful profession,'' Judith Shulevitz wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 2002.  Norton has also reissued FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE: Divorce Reconsidered, by E. Mavis Hetherington and John Kelly ($15.95), a summary of nearly three decades of research involving some 1,400 families that finds ample cause for npp564964730:3473:428rospects for divorced couples and their children. Last year Susan Jacoby praised its ``close-up portraits of people speaking for themselves and changing over time.''  THE STARTER MARRIAGE AND THE FUTURE OF MATRIMONY, by Pamela Paul (Random House, $13.95), looks at short-term childless marriages among young people, many of whom, she argues, have too many expectations, not too few. The author's ``observations evoke a winning combination of laugh, wince and nod,'' Allison Pugh wrote last year.  PALLADIO, by Jonathan Dee. (Vintage Contemporaries, $14.) Tackling themes of morality, lost love and the art ofand his former boss, a visionary genius on a doomed quest to use the apparatus of the ad world to disseminate avant-garde art. Though the narrative is overstuffed with ideas, ``Dee has given us a full, rich cultural chronicle,'' Claire Dederer said in The New York Times Book Review in 2002.  INSECT DREAMS: The Half Life of Gregor Samsa, by Marc Estrin. (BlueHen, $15.) What if the six-legged hero of Kafka's ``Metamorphosis'' had escaped his grim fate and been thrust into the events of the first half of the 20th century? Such is the premise of this first novel, in which the bug has verbal encounters with figures like Einstein and Oppenheimer. The result is ``a vivid depiction of a pained creature suffused with generosity, curiosity and heroic persistence,'' Ken Tucker said last year.  CHARLIE CHAPLIN AND HIS TIMES, by Kenneth S. Lynn. (Cooper Square, $19.95.) According to this huge warts-and-all biography, the entertainer was driven by a never-fulfilled fantasy that he could rescue his mother from madness through his success. The result is an ``often fascinating, prodigiously researched book,'' Andrew Sarris said in 1997. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20030208.0040 type=story > <HEADLINE> BC-homeland09-AZR(a) </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 02-08-03 22:35:00EST (BC-homeland09-AZ) </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200302.gz

"146244"	"she"	"noted"	" From the moment Dick Cheney declared his ticket's victory a mandate on Nov. 3, partisans on both sides have been debating what margin it takes to make a mandate. It's not an argument they're likely to settle, though, as reader Sue Safton found when she turned to her dictionary for help. Mandate seems to have taken on a meaning above and beyond its current dictionary definition, Safton e-mailed from Cambridge. In common use, she noted, the word implies some sort of overwhelming majority, yet her Encarta says the barest win can be a mandate: it's merely the authority bestowed on a government or other body by an electoral victory, effectively authorizing it to carry out the policies for which it campaigned. The historical record is also mum on majority requirements. Mandate, which came to English from Scottish law in the 16th century, means an order or duty; its Latin parent is mandatum, given into someone's hand. The political sense, not adopted till the 18th century, is an import from turbulent pre-revolutionary France, where it referred to the obligation of an elected representative to do his electors' bidding -- no creativity allowed. (If Bush knew the mandate was a radical French invention, would he still want one?) In current American usage, a presidential mandate clearly implies some degree of consensus; the question that fuels the semantic battle is how much. A mandate is considered especially strong after a landslide victory, William Safire notes in Safire's New Political Dictionary (1993), but even a one-vote winner is free to use the word. Both FDR and JFK claimed mandates, one for a big win and one for a near-tie. And, Safire notes, a mandate may be or asserted, even if everyone knows -- as JFK's people did -- that it won't pan out in practice. Bush boosters say the mandate label is justified by the popular vote total, the largest in history. Dissenters point out that the vote against Bush was also the largest in history. John Nichols, comparing a century's worth of presidential contests in a Wisconsin State Journal piece, found that the margin most similar to Bush's, in electoral, popular, and congressional totals, came with Jimmy Carter's 1976 win -- which press reports at the time called a slender weak, or skimpy mandate, if they got near the M-word at all. Even Republicans are by no means unanimous in declaring a mandate. The voting machines were barely unplugged when Senator Arlen Specter got himself in trouble by saying that the results showed a narrowly divided country, and that's not a traditional mandate. Lyn Nofziger, a former aide to President Reagan, also downplayed the idea: barring such virtual clean sweeps as Richard Nixon's re-election in 1972 and Ronald Reagan's in 1984, political mandates are usually in the eye of the beholder, he wrote in The New York Times. Pat Buchanan, dissecting the election issue by issue in his syndicated column, declared that though Bush had backing on values, the polling on Iraq suggests that he has no mandate for a five-year war and had best end this conflict soon. And Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona told the Los Angeles Times that his leader had no mandate on domestic issues. Arguments, however, can't settle the question: The proof of a mandate is in the governing. If the 2004 election produced one, we'll see the evidence soon enough. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"

Profoundly moved, he stayed in Washington, D.C., and appointed himself Soldier's Missionary. Over three years he wandered camps and hospitals, bringing small gifts, sitting with men who wanted company, writing letters for them (including, he noted, love letters, very tender ones) or giving paper to those who could do it themselves. Through it all he made notes, often on scraps of paper stained with blood. Today, in the jottings of his Memoranda, we find the heart of the Civil War: the horror and valor, the sounds and smells, the words of brave and dying boys, all recorded by Whitman with his poet's eye and his decent heart.

That's our guiding principle. To that end, the company introduced on Feb. 1 a design that limited the number of ads on the main page. (Bradford would not say by how much.)

"150249"	"he"	"noted"	" Another reason is the cost of litigation. But even when the bonuses may be small enough that they do not justify the cost of filing a lawsuit, Hu said, companies could be vulnerable to shareholder lawsuits because in a sense the company is making a gift to a particular person, and that's not allowed. After all, he noted, company directors have fiduciary duties to shareholders. How can the company simply make gifts to people? he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"

Cannell was the main creative force on the prototype private-eye-with-humor series, The Rockford Files. Huggins, he noted, basically invented a new form in the '50s when he looked around, saw 35 westerns on three networks, decided that what television needed was a funny western and created Maverick. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"

With O'Brien seated across from him, Dr. Phil repeatedly played the salacious phone messages (obscenities deleted) that O'Brien left on a woman's voice mail while on a weekend binge. O'Brien was calm and smoothly well spoken throughout the confrontation, blaming his bad behavior on alcoholism, which, he noted, he had inherited from his father. Castigation came first, then endless amounts of unconditional love: Colleagues at his show gave testimonials to his character and work ethic.

I then reminded him that during his 1994 US Senate campaign, he had objected when NARAL said he wasn't prochoice because he didn't back every item on the group's abortion-rights agenda.

"155765"	"he"	"noted"	" For Dai that is the point of the story. It is semi-autobiographical in that he took some liberties by inventing a couple of scenes -- as when Luo, a dentist's son, extracts the village chief's rotten tooth -- and fusing the experiences of two young women.

But Warner executives, who agreed to speak anonymously to minimize disruption of the filmmaking process, said the studio was relatively slow in assigning a writer because of the project's delicacy. Orloff, they noted, had experience with demanding filmmakers, most recently working on a project about Julius Caesar for Michael Mann and Tom Hanks. With Mariane Pearl's close involvement, they said, his touch will be brought to bear on a script that is expected to track closely with her book, focusing heavily on the young couple's love story, and the wife's vigil -- in the company of characters like a friendly Pakistani intelligence agent and a hunkered-down Wall Street Journal editor -- for a husband who never returned.

Last year, he noted, farmers produced 11.8 billion bushels of corn, a record, but still only exported 2 billion bushels, a number that has remained steady since about the mid-1970s.

"159827"	"they"	"noted"	" The 26-year-old officer's defense team countered that the case against him hinges on troops turning on Anderson to minimize the sentences they face in the killings. They solicited testimony that the lieutenant's accusers could be manipulative or temperamental, capable of bending the truth to protect their interests. Horne, they noted, saw his three-year sentence reduced to one year after cooperating with prosecutors. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"159834"	"he"	"noted"	" Another peculiarity, he noted, was the respect the victors seemed to have shown for their victims. They took the trouble to bury them with their finest robes and adornments, an abundance of jades, necklaces of jaguar fangs and rare shells. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"159933"	"he"	"noted"	" Jeff Battcher, a spokesman for BellSouth, expects AT&amp;T to chiefly use its brand on wireless services for business customers. BellSouth could do the same thing, he noted, though it has no plans for such a move. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"160042"	"he"	"noted"	" The recent slowdown could prove temporary, said Alan Clayton-Matthews, the UMass-Boston professor who estimates the economic growth rate from a broad array of data. State tax collections are strong and income is rising, he noted, suggesting employment might be stronger than official statistics show. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"160124"	"he"	"noted"	" Kalyagin, who also is the chairman of Russia's Union of Theater Workers, appreciates his good fortune in being based in Moscow. Most of the country's regional theaters, he noted, hang on a thread that was nearly cut under proposed changes in government financing. With the changes, he said, most subsidies would have been withdrawn, forcing theaters to commercialize or close while subjecting them to increased government financial oversight, which some feared could lead to censorship. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"160218"	"she"	"noted"	" For state government workers covered by union contracts, pay raises range from zero to cost-of-living hikes in the 2 to 4 percent range, according to Lynelle Jolley, state department of personnel administration spokeswoman. The exception, she noted, are salary hikes for state prison nurses and doctors, which are being raised roughly 18 to 30 percent, respectively, due to a recent court order. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"160464"	"he"	"noted"	" The three largest brewers, which have a 35 percent market share, made only $100 million in profits in 2004, he noted, a seventh of what Heineken made and about 5 percent of what Anheuser-Busch reported. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"160503"	"he"	"noted"	" In a speech last week, Schwarzenegger harked back to the 1950s and 1960s -- a time, he noted, when California became a model of economic power and modern progress. The key to that, he said, was a commitment by elected leaders to build infrastructure -- roads, bridges, aqueducts and schools -- to harness the potential of a growing population. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"160890"	"she"	"noted"	" But Mako Yoshikawa, who teaches writing at Emerson College and whose great-grandmother was a geisha, described the look as demure and wondered whether it would ultimately appeal to moviegoers.

"161068"	"he"	"noted"	" And yet, Treasury Secretary John Snow recently lauded the wage picture in a message of good cheer in this holiday season. He noted that wages were up 1.1 percent from the previous business cycle peak in 2001. At the same point in the cycle of the 1990s, he noted, wages were down 2.1 percent. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"161118"	"they"	"noted"	" Throughout the report, the attorney general's staff cautioned against making overbroad generalizations about any area. Some agencies, they noted, report hate crimes far more vigorously than others. Municipal police departments in Miami, Tallahassee, Sarasota, Daytona Beach, Fort Myers, Ocala and West Palm Beach didn't have any hate crimes to report in 2004. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"161249"	"she"	"noted"	" New Orleans, she noted, has always been known for its libertine lifestyle. The French all but abandoned the city as its colony around 1735 as being unworthy of the nation's support as a colony. Novels like Manon Lescaut portrayed the city as a den of iniquity and corruption, and across Europe, they thought the locals were basically a bunch of rogues, immoral and corrupt, Dawdy said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"161297"	"he"	"noted"	" For example, he says the best two teams he's ever seen were Southern Cal in 1972 and Nebraska in 1995. The winner of tonight's game, he noted, will belong in that group. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"161615"	"he"	"noted"	" It's not whether I actually bother to control it, Sandman said. It's whether I feel I can. The factors that influence worry are often linked. Familiarity, for instance, can moderate the sense of dread, said Dr. Paul Slovic, a psychologist with Decision Research, a nonprofit research institution in Eugene, Ore. Car accidents, he noted, are as horrific as cancer, yet we don't have the same sense of dread around cars that we do around carcinogens because we drive all the time. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"161731"	"he"	"noted"	" Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the majority, acknowledged that the long-running battle over the Oregon law is part of a political and moral debate. But the issue for the court, he noted, was a more technical, down-to-earth one: Did the attorney general go beyond his powers under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"161780"	"he"	"noted"	" Luciano, on a recent morning walking outside an Olympic stadium still crawling with construction workers, added his voice to the debate here about why Turin, and Italy generally, are pleased but not quite passionate about the Games: It is a warm country, he noted, one that lacks the first clue about ice hockey. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"

"161902"	"he"	"noted"	" But, he noted, three years ago United was in danger of dying. Today, it has the potential to be a profitable investment, a reliable business partner and a stable employer. ... The bankruptcy system merely provided the framework. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"161937"	"I"	"noted"	" The saleswoman did a little online research, checking out what other Star Wars sabers sold for previously (sadly, I noted, there was no shortage of those on eBay) and suggested a listing price of $89.99 for each. That seemed reasonable. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"162018"	"she"	"noted"	" Never did we think that Joel would be the one who would make such a huge difference in our lives, said Kate Riggins, John's mother. Had he not persevered in his hunt for information, Richard Hirschfield probably would not have been identified. Hirsch-field's conviction on molestation charges recently was overturned on a technical matter, she noted, so he likely would have been out of prison and on the streets. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"162294"	"he"	"noted"	" Bender said his department is monitoring the lawsuit and stays in touch with its suppliers on the issue. If worst comes to worst, he noted, in a pinch you can still call someone on their cell phone; you can still send e-mail from your desktop. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"162327"	"they"	"noted"	" There are other reasons wine drinkers may be healthier than beer drinkers, the researchers said. Wine tends to be drunk with food, and in smaller amounts, they noted, possibly affecting how the body metabolizes it. And wine drinkers tend to be better educated and better off financially than beer drinkers -- factors that would also help account for their better health. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"162333"	"they"	"noted"	" Phillips and other historians said colonial Campeche was an important Spanish gateway to the Americas and would have had substantial traffic in slaves. Within a few years of the first voyage of Columbus, in 1492, they noted, Africans were shipped to the Caribbean and then the mainland. Their numbers increased steadily as sugar plantations were established by the Spanish on the islands, then in Mexico and coastal Peru. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"

"163316"	"she"	"noted"	" Annette Rauch, a research assistant professor at the Center for Animals and Public Policy at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine of Tufts University in North Grafton, Mass., cited a survey of new pet owners that showed 75 percent wanted counseling on behavior, and 85 percent said they intended to participate in a training course. Over the past few decades, there has been a larger push to train vets in behavior, she said. Behavior problems, she noted, are the leading reason people give their pets away. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"

"163705"	"he"	"noted"	" Though the presence of Mafia wives at trials has not been unheard of in recent years, Raab said, Mrs. Gotti -- the widow of John J. Gotti, celebrated as the Dapper Don and the Teflon Don before spending the last years of his life locked up in a maximum security penitentiary -- never attended any of her husband's major trials. He had four trials after he became boss, and she was never there, Raab said. Partly, he noted, that was because they were on the outs, and she did not visit him in prison, either. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"163805"	"she"	"noted"	" Yet actual assaults stemming from online encounters are rare, said Aftab of Wired Safety. In no instance, she noted, has a predator met a child in person without first communicating with the victim online. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164030"	"he"	"noted"	" Europe's major markets, he noted, have managed to maintain an uneasy power balance for the last few years.

"164179"	"she"	"noted"	" Picasso's handwriting was markedly different from the writing on the work sold through Costco, Widmaier-Picasso pointed out -- especially the way he formed the R and the S in Arias. In the sketch reproduced in the catalog, she noted, the R had a loop, and the S was rounded; in Knickerbocker's drawing, the letters are not articulated as clearly. And in the date, Picasso's 9 had a full circle at the top of the vertical line, she noted, whereas the circle in the image shown was open. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"

"164355"	"he"	"noted"	" Reading the scene, Schwarz said: I had a tingle in my spine. How did she know?

"164434"	"they"	"noted"	" In the half-century since, though, the stigma has faded noticeably. The British advertising board defended its ban on bloody with a survey that showed-as they spun it- that 70 percent of interviewees thought the word was mildly, fairly, or severely offensive. But the Australians responded with counterspin: If you group the responses differently, they noted, you get 85 percent saying bloody is either mildly or not at all offensive. And when it came to broadcast guidelines, bloody was the tamest word on the list: Only 5 percent of people who called it a swear word thought it should never be heard on TV. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164833"	"he"	"noted"	" Rhett Dawson, president of the Information Technology Industry Council, admonished that lobbying was not a dirty word.

"164938"	"he"	"noted"	" But Sen. Rod Skoe, DFL-Clearbrook, questioned Bruininks about how the state would benefit from the additional $2-million-a-year commitment.

"164992"	"he"	"noted"	" The narrative, he noted, was confined almost totally to combat action in a succession of desperate air battles in which the author saw his comrades shot down, blown apart and burned to cinders in flaming planes.

"165333"	"he"	"noted"	" There is every reason to believe that segmented sleep, such as many wild animals exhibit, had long been the natural pattern of our slumber before the modern age, with a provenance as old as humankind, Ekirch wrote.

"165549"	"she"	"noted"	" Sheryl R. Skolnick, an analyst with the CRT Capital Group, said the increase in high-deductible policies meant less revenue for each member but not necessarily that much lower profit, because it is a much skinnier benefit package.

"165641"	"he"	"noted"	" In his letter to the SEC, Bogle argued that when the securities laws were drafted in the 1930s, the mutual fund industry was a minuscule part of the nation's securities markets. Now, with assets nearing $10 trillion, mutual funds are the largest owners of American companies and, if aggregated, the biggest financial institution in the country.

Three people, each with a small piece of the swirling story of illegal immigration in the United States, cannot answer the tangled questions that have washed over politics recently with a sudden, jolting wave. Do 11 million illegal immigrants pose an economic question for the nation, or a political one? Is the debate about the jobs that American-born resident will not do, or the jobs being taken from them? Is it about enforcing rules, or acknowledging rights?

"171942"	"he"	"noted"	" Under IRS rules, he noted, this benefit is available to all clergy members who administer sacraments, conduct worship and direct the spiritual life of a religious institution.

And he's unapologetic about being at the center of things. As the university expands its footprint on the Boston side of the Charles River, he noted, the business school increasingly will be the center of the Harvard campus.

"173818"	"she"	"noted"	" Collins said she feels strongly that society as a whole - not just the arts - is discriminating against people who have passed the age of 50.

"173853"	"he"	"noted"	" State Sen. John H. Adler, a Democrat from Camden County and a longtime proponent of the ban, said that the exemption was a political necessity.

"174565"	"he"	"noted"	" It's lovely that friends want to bring things when they come for the weekend, but we're only there for two days, Adamson said of his vacation home in Pound Ridge, N.Y. The only certainty, he noted, is that on Sunday night he'll be peering into the depths of the refrigerator and making one of three decisions: toss the gift because it won't keep until next weekend; take it back to the city (though it will undoubtedly spill in the car); or look for an expiration date to see if it will survive until he comes back. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

And since North Captiva is a pristine environment, she said, we try to make our eating habits reflect the simplicity of the setting. This means yes to fresh organic food suitable for grilling and no to processed foods. We have skim milk but no bacon, no ice cream, no cake, no cookies, Coleman said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

Pittsburgh plans to raise, not lower, a ball, to signify looking ahead to the future. Delray Beach, Fla., uses 50,000 Ping-Pong balls -- they actually shoot out of a cannon, a city spokeswoman, Leah Norat, said -- that end up peppering the crowd.
