"5619"	"it"	"really"	" ``He had all my stuff,'' she said. ``You suddenly feel like somebody knows you and you haven't given that person permission to know you. You always hear how it feels like a violation. Well, it really, really is.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199409.gz"
"13239"	"they"	"really"	" At Joe's, they really, really like Steve. Joe's Stone Crab is the oldest, coolest restaurant in Miami Beach. Ponce De Leon ate there with his crew. (Ponce ordered the fruit plate, left a nice tip.) Every celebrity who has ever passed through Miami Beach has dined at Joe's, but, well, let's let Rose McDaniel tell it. Rose is the owner's assistant at Joe's, has been there 40 years. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"
"70361"	"he"	"really"	" Kurzweil is a professional food stylist, which means that in a city already obsessed with food, he really, really cares about garlic. So much so that he recently accumulated 117 heads from six stores, lugging them in a canvas bag through the steamy streets of lower Manhattan. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"

"74656"	"it"	"really"	" With Gaultier, the poison is usually part of the point. So when skirts fell below the waist of fishnet stockings, and the elastic band showed, along with the shirt tucked in, he meant it to look that way. It was just a little too convincingly unattractive. His references and design sense are so complex and sophisticated that when he wants something to look aggressive, ill fitting and not quite right, it really, really does. His is a gift with a curse. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"
"83297"	"I"	"really"	" N.B. (Monday, 8 a.m. PST): No, I really, really don't use E-mail much. It's nothing to do with taste, it's a time issue. When I was in my teens and twenties I played a lot of games, everything from cards, to chess, and darts to ping-pong. As I got older I knew had to choose between throwing myself deeper into my craft or sticking with the short term buzz. When Griffin and Sabine came out I got thousands of letters, I loved it, and I tried to respond to eveyone of them. Then I realized I was killing myself trying to keep up. I know my potential for getting carried away, and E-mail has that addictive hook. I'll write about it, but I won't cut into my already overcrowded life by trying to carry on a two way communication with the universe. OK, you might say, be selective then. But that in itself becomes a time eating act. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

"140184"	"they"	"really"	" On the one hand, people might become upset that the focus on Iraq left the United States vulnerable, said Zunes. On the other hand, when people are concerned and scared, they really, really want to trust their commander in chief. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"147916"	"it"	"really"	" When we run it effectively, we have a great chance to win, regardless of how many times he runs or how many yards, Dungy said. When we're running effectively and people have to defend it, it really, really helps us. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"149849"	"we"	"really"	" The Academy Awards are famously vulgar, dependably boring, grievously misguided and widely deemed by both casual viewers and critics a monumental waste of time. But if you pay close enough attention to the Oscars, which will be broadcast Sunday evening -- and, in particular, to the nominations -- you can learn a lot about the industry. The show reveals what the industry is thinking in the moment and lets us catch sight of the future. The event may be the ultimate in self-affirmation -- we like ourselves, we really, really like ourselves! -- but it reflects a larger conversation this otherwise publicity-driven industry does not always share with the rest of us. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"
"157728"	"it"	"really"	" The difference for abortion seems to be this: While the church proclaims that it supports organized labor and condemns aggressive war, it really, really double Dutch means what it says about abortion.

"159572"	"you"	"really"	" Once that's done, you really, really want to get out the plunger and work on the drain. Up and down and up and down and splorp! Yank it up, glaring at the drain: Do not trifle with me, pipes. I have done this before. I have dealt with your kind. I know stuff. I fought a clog in '88 in a house in St. Paul, and it was a contest worthy of a Hemingway novel. Back and forth we fought, the struggle stretching into the night until I finally dislodged an unholy bolus that had been assembling in dark, rank secrecy since the time of FDR. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"166915"	"I"	"really"	" Even before she announced her pregnancy, Vargas confronted a parallel dilemma. At 43, she had to fight the lightweight stigma. When ABC News named Vargas and 44-year-old Bob Woodruff as its evening news coanchors, you could feel the burden of feminist expectation on her shoulders. Especially as a woman, I really, really want to do this well. It's important to have a woman be successful in this role, she told The Washington Post. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"167224"	"I"	"really"	" In my time [at Harvard], I really, truly learned and experienced the Boston fan. Enthusiastic, proud, a winning tradition, hard. I expect that, I expect the fans to be hard and I hope I can deliver. I know I can deliver. It's my commitment to bring back a winning tradition to the Boston Bruins. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"168131"	"I"	"really"	" Coaching never really interested me that much, the whole process of networking to get the initial job and then moving your family around the country. I've done pretty well, so I don't need to do that. But this kind of quenches my thirst for coaching, in a sense. If you told me I had to do this for eight months out of the year, I don't know if I'd do it. But for two months, I really, really enjoy it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"

"169125"	"I"	"really"	" What real impact any independent can have, I really, really don't know, said Delphine Herbert, the coordinator for the Marions for Peace group in Ocala. It's hard in a winner-take-all system of government. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
