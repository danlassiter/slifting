"9174"	"he"	"pleaded"	" Not all oppressed people in the United States were fooled by this cruel and racist policy. Booker T. Washington, the famous African-American leader, was invited to speak at the Atlanta Exposition of 1895 to a grand gathering of business and political leaders, including the President of the United States, Grover Cleveland. In his address, Washington urged the powerful employers to hire America's oppressed minorities rather than looking to foreign countries to supply a cheap source of labor: ``To those of you who look to the incoming of foreign birth'', he pleaded, ``cast down your bucket where you are.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"

They were right. Montana has many populations _ college professors like me, aging hippie organic farmers, the Amish-like Hutterites, Chicano sugar-beet growers and on down the roster of blessedness. I've never met anybody here hellbent on a political agenda involving violent revenge. Still, it's now obvious that if you add the Western attitude of live-and-let-live to right-wing ideology, you've got a problem. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"

"67584"	"he"	"pleaded"	" In 1981, when President Reagan insisted that he could ``balance the budget by 1983'' and still offer massive tax cuts to our wealthiest citizens, Dole argued against the illogical proposition. Cut spending first, he pleaded, and then reduce taxes to the same extent. Never cut taxes while increasing spending. Too bad Reagan didn't listen. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199608.gz"

A limit set in December by the state Fish and Game Commission reduces the annual limit to 24 from the previous 100, and the daily limit to three from four. A law enforcement warden said that the commission's goal was to reduce an overall harvest that has increased 27 percent in Sonoma and Mendocino counties, where red abalone is found in highest concentration. Abalone diving has been prohibited south of San Francisco since 1997.  NORTHWEST  WASHINGTON: PARKSIDE RESORT STALLED  A state judge has stalled a permit for a resort on the edge of Mount Rainier National Park, ruling that the development's conference center exceeded the size allowed for public spaces near an active volcano. Judge Paula Casey of Thurston County Superior Court said the rest of the 440-acre complex was allowable as long as the conference center was scaled down; the ruling overturned a decision by officials in Pierce County, where the resort would be located, who said the private conference center would not constitute a public meeting space.  MIDWEST  MICHIGAN: REVERSAL ON VULGAR LANGUAGE LAW  A 105-year-old law barring vulgar language near women and children was struck down by a state appeals court, which ruled it was too vague. The case stems from Timothy J. Boomer's obscenity-laced tirade against friends who had dumped him out of a canoe into chilly water three years ago. Many families were nearby and police ticketed Boomer under an 1897 law that bans ``indecent, immoral, obscene, vulgar or insulting language,'' a description the court said was not specific enough.  NEW ENGLAND  MASSACHUSETTS: KILLINGS TRIAL BEGINS  Jury selection began in the trial of a man accused of killing seven co-workers in a shooting rampage Dec. 26, 2000. Lawyers for the defendant, Michael McDermott, plan to argue that he is schizophrenic and was thus insane when he opened fire at Edgewater Technology in Wakefield. Prosecutors said that McDermott, a software engineer, plotted the killings as revenge for the company's decision to dock his wages to pay his back taxes.  NEW HAMPSHIRE: SON ARRAIGNED IN ASSAULT  John Christian Broderick, 30, was arraigned on an assault charge and had his bail set at $100,000 in the beating of his father, state Supreme Court Justice John T. Broderick, 54, over the weekend. At the hearing in Manchester, William Delker, an assistant state attorney general, said that the younger man was drunk and attacked his sleeping father so severely early Saturday with a guitar that he broke several bones in his face. The attack followed a daylong argument the two had, according to court documents. Broderick remained in serious condition after surgery on Sunday.  WASHINGTON, D.C.  SHIELDING NAMES IN SUBSIDY PROGRAM  Federal lawmakers put provisions into the $171 billion farm bill to restrict the release of information about who receives federal farm subsidies. Last year, the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit research group, posted the information, which it received through a Freedom of Information Act request, on a Web site detailing how much money each farmer received from the federal government. Some farmers protested that the site was an invasion of their privacy. The House version of the bill, which is still in conference committee, would forbid releasing information about subsidies for conservation programs, a measure supported by ranchers seeking federal money to clean up water pollution caused by their manure. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020401.0287 type=story > <HEADLINE> DECIPHERING ANTARCTICA'S CONTRADICTORY CLIMATE PATTERNS MAY BE A </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-SCI-ANTARCTICA-ART-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
