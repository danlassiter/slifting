"46690"	"she"	"cries"	" ``Bed of Roses'' is sweet and for a time beguiling, but ultimately innocuous. As you watch whimsical florist Christian Slater romance driven banker Mary Stuart Masterson, you keep hoping the story will take on some of the extravagance of the floral tributes with which he first captures her attention, then woos her. At a certain point, of course, bathing her in a rain of roses backfires. He's pushing too hard, she cries, and then she flees. You'd be surprised if she went far: It's not that kind of movie. But for all its softness and charm, ``Bed of Roses'' doesn't really dramatize the feelings so much as lead its stars through them by the hand. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"
"49602"	"she"	"cries"	" Julia Roberts as a Victorian housemaid on her knees washing the front stoop on a wet day. Perhaps the idea was to tell us that she is not the most observant of women. That would at least account for _ if not solve _ the film's single biggest problem. This retelling of the Jekyll-Hyde story from the housemaid's point of view suffers fatally from the fact that we know the story going in, while she needs two hours to find it out. When she learns that her employer, kindly Dr. Jekyll, and his vicious alter ego, Mr. Hyde, are the same man, she cries, ``How could anyone know such a thing? How could anyone guess?'' It is, to put it softly, difficult to identify with Mary's dawning horror. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"

Times News Service  TRADE DEFICIT UP SLIGHTLY AS EXPORTS REACH RECORD  Record exports and a surge in industrial production combined late last year to propel the economy at an accelerating pace. Led by sales of farm products, exports climbed to a peak of $72 billion in November as the nation's trade deficit widened, but considerably less than expected, to $8.4 billion, the Commerce Department reported.  The report also showed that U.S. deficits with both China and Japan narrowed substantially in the latest month. The gap with China, which last year briefly surpassed that with Japan, narrowed from $4.9 billion to $3 billion.  COURT TO HEAR INSIDER TRADING CASE  Urged by the federal government to close a ``large loophole'' in the prosecution of securities fraud, the Supreme Court agreed to review a lower court's decision that cut back sharply on the Securities and Exchange Commission's approach to illegal insider trading. The case may produce one of the most important Supreme Court decisions in years on a question of securities law.  NEW PRICE FOR AT&AMP;T-LORAL DEAL  The $712.5-million deal by Loral Space and Communications to purchase AT&AMP;T's Skynet Satellite Services will be repriced, after the disclosure by AT&AMP;T that one of its telecommunications satellites had been declared permanently out of service.  GAS PRODUCER MAY SELL FIELD  The TransTexas Gas Corp., a major natural gas producer, is close to an agreement to sell one of its largest and most productive natural gas fields to Conoco for about $1.2 billion, people close to the transaction said. A purchase by Conoco would be unusual because major oil companies have been selling some of their large domestic oil and gas fields in recent years as they shift their investment and exploration efforts overseas.  MARKET CONTINUES ITS RECORD WAYS  Propelled by strong earnings reports, the stock market continued its January rally. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 67.73 points, or 1 percent, to close at 6,833.10, its eighth record this year, and a 6 percent gain since Dec. 31. Pacing the advance were: Du Pont, up 2~ points, to 111|, McDonald's, up 1~ to 46], and Merck, up 1~ to 86]. Broader measures were also up, although not as strongly as the Dow. The S&AMP;P 500 rose 6.42 points, to 776.17, and the Nasdaq composite 8.59 points, to 1,349.05.  Prices of Treasury securities changed little in choppy trading ahead of a long holiday weekend. The yield on the 30-year bond held steady at 6.83 percent.  DAYTON HUDSON PARING MERVYN'S  Dayton Hudson said that its Mervyn's division was pulling out of Florida and Georgia and that it would close 10 other stores as part of its effort to turn that division around. As a result of the moves and of previously announced plans to close five Marshall Field's stores in Texas and Illinois, it will take a pretax charge of $134 million against earnings.  AMRE PLANS BANKRUPTCY FILING  Faced with mounting losses, Amre Inc., a home improvement and remodeling company that licenses the Century 21 name from HFS Inc., said that it would file for bankruptcy protection and sell assets to repay creditors. In September, Amre successfully completed a public offering of 1.6 million shares at a price of $16 a share; the stock was last quoted on Thursday at 43.75 cents a share.  EQUITY REIT TO BUY WELLSFORD  Equity Residential Properties Trust, a real estate investment trust based in Chicago and controlled by Sam Zell, said that it would buy Wellsford Residential Property Trust for $620 million in stock. The deal solidifies its position as the nation's largest apartment owner, with 317 complexes comprising 90,873 units _ about double its nearest competitor, Security Capital Pacific Trust.  DOLLAR RISES AGAINST MARK AND YEN  The dollar reached its highest level in two and a half years against the mark and Swiss franc in a rally powered by better-than-expected U.S. trade data and by hints of lower German interest rates from two top Bundesbank officials. The dollar also rose to a 45-month high against the yen, helped by more signs of economic anemia in Japan. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19970117.0780 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-PHOTO-FULL-UPDATE-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> ATTENTION EDITORS: The following photos are part of tonight's N.Y.
