COLUMNS AND COMMENTARY  ATWORK-COLUMN-KAN (Undated) _ It may be hard to remember, what with the intervening Election Day hubbub, but only a week ago it was Halloween _ and an example of an occasional dividing line between parents and nonparents at work. By Diane Stafford. Moved 11-07.  CHILDCARE-COLUMN-BOS (Undated) _ Not so long ago, the typical mother went through menopause years after her children went through puberty. Today, with more women becoming mothers late in life, it's not unusual for the two events to occur under the same roof at the same time. By Barbara F. Meltz. Moved 11-07.  ANIMALS-COLUMN-BOS (Undated) _ Did you know there are birds that use human bones to build nests? Or that many kingfishers don't eat fish? Or that the rhinoceros aukletdigs tunnels 20 feet long? But such trivia is the stuff of Kenn Kaufman's new ``Lives of North American Birds'' (Houghton Mifflin, $35), a spectacular hybrid of detailed field guides and more behavior-centric books. By Vicki Croke. Moved 11-08.  LOFTUS-COLUMN-$ADV14-NYT (Undated) _ The boy handed me his library book, waiting for me to scan it and hand it back. ``The Magic Schoolbus in the Time of the Dinosaurs,'' I say. ``My son has that book.

The fashion industry is hitching its hopes to the Dec. 25 premiere of the lavish film version of ``Evita.''

GENERAL  WASHERWOMAN-GIFT-NYT (Hattiesburg, Miss.) _ The washerwoman's gift of $150,000 to finance scholarships at the local college had taken much of her long and lonely life to save. Oseola McCarty made the gift as she felt her own time creeping to a close, as worsening arthritis made it hard for her to work or sometimes even stand. She had lived by herself since 1967, between rows of hanging clothes, a shy, stooped woman of 88 years who always had a lot to say, just no one to say it to in the quiet little house on Miller Street. Who else might she give her savings to, if not strangers? But an odd thing happened, an unexpected thing. That unselfish gift _ she did not even ask for so much as a brick to be dedicated in her name _ has infused her life with color and experiences and delivered her from the isolation of her past.

GENERAL  WASHERWOMAN-GIFT-NYT (Hattiesburg, Miss.) _ The washerwoman's gift of $150,000 to finance scholarships at the local college had taken much of her long and lonely life to save. Oseola McCarty made the gift as she felt her own time creeping to a close, as worsening arthritis made it hard for her to work or sometimes even stand. She had lived by herself since 1967, between rows of hanging clothes, a shy, stooped woman of 88 years who always had a lot to say, just no one to say it to in the quiet little house on Miller Street. Who else might she give her savings to, if not strangers? But an odd thing happened, an unexpected thing. That unselfish gift _ she did not even ask for so much as a brick to be dedicated in her name _ has infused her life with color and experiences and delivered her from the isolation of her past.

Without them, Steffi Graf, for whom every silver cloud seems to hide a subversive black lining, would be most unhappy.

MOVIE-BARBRA-BOS (Beverly Hills) _ Ever since she sat in front of a backstage mirror as Fanny Brice in ``Funny Girl'' and self-deprecatingly drawled, ``Hello, gawjuss,'' Barbra Streisand has in one form or another starred in the longest-running psychodrama in show business. It goes something like this. Not-so-classic beauty gets _ or sometimes doesn't get _ handsome guy after an uphill struggle. On Friday, Streisand will open ``The Mirror Has Two Faces,'' her 16th movie, the third she has directed. By Jay Carr.Moved 11-11.  STREISAND-MOVIE-NYT (Hollywood) _ Physical beauty _ the obsession with it, the yearning for it, the relevance and meaning of it _ dominate not only Barbra Streisand's new film, ``The Mirror Has Two Faces'' (Tri-Star), which will open Friday, but also, in many ways, her life. By Bernard Weinraub. W/color photo. Moved 11-12.  HOWARD-RANSOM-NYT (Hollywood) _ Movie directors get typed just as much as actors do.

EVITA-MANIA-ART-$ADV10-NYT (New York) _ On her deathbed in 1952, Eva Peron whispered to her husband, ``What I don't want is for people to forget me, Juan.'' They certainly haven't. The fashion industry is hitching its hopes to the Dec. 25 premiere of the lavish film version of ``Evita.''
