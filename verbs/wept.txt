Through the night, after the meals had been served and the lights turned out, Ms. Machado turned in her seat and, first caressing the purse, then hugging it to her heart, she wept, her body trembling in quiet sobs. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"

PHOENIX-OLY (Atlanta) _ Phoenix may have blown its chance to host the Olympic Games anytime soon back in March 1989, when voters rejected the ambitious ValTrans mass-transit program. The Centennial Olympic Games here have proven that getting athletes, journalists and spectators to the competitions on time is a task akin to D-Day, and any city that hopes to host the Games must have an effective mass-transit system in place when making a bid. And it takes more than buses and subways to bid on the Olympics. It requires world-class sporting venues, perseverance, time and money. Lots of money. This quadrennial world party comes with a hefty cover charge. Still, there are people in Phoenix looking to bring the party to Arizona, perhaps as early as 2008. By CLINT WILLIAMS. Story will move in the ``A'' category.  HANDBALL-OLY (Atlanta) _ If the Olympics are about bringing together the world, then the Olympics are about team handball. Fast, physical, high-scoring and unheard of around these parts, handball has been packing the 7,400-seat arena at the World Congress Center here. Danes cheer Norway. Mexicans cheer Korea. The Americans cheer for everybody. It certainly isn't blind nationalism that has brought the hometown hordes. The U.S. teams stink. By CLINT WILLIAMS. Story will move in the ``A'' category.  CASSTEVENS-COL (Albany, Ga.) _ At the same time two bantamweights touched gloves in the ring in Atlanta, an organ played softly inside the Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church. As Olympic women competed in team handball, the husband of the woman killed by a bomb blast in Atlanta's Olympic Centennial Park sat on the front pew, holding hands with family members.

STRESS-OUT (Undated) _ It's a modern-day paradox: Although high technology has made life easier and the workplace more efficient, more Americans than ever before are feeling stressed out, worn down and fed up. Stress levels are at a dangerous point. The American Medical Association estimates that up to 70 percent of all patients seen by general-practice physicians come with symptoms directly related to unrelieved stress. Stress is among the top 10 reasons Americans miss work, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. By JULIE AMPARANO. Story will move in the ``A'' category.  TURTLE-EMAIL (Bahia de los Angeles, Mexico) _ Wallace Nichols rubbed Adelina's arched brown shell and described how he'll get this 210-pound loggerhead turtle to e-mail him twice weekly for the next year or so. For now, Adelina can paddle only across a 20-foot holding pool on a remote Baja California beach. But within a few weeks, if all goes well, she'll begin swimming across the Pacific from Mexico to Japan to mate and lay eggs for the first time in her life, said Nichols, a pony-tailed University of Arizona biologist. The turtle will be wearing a radio-transmitting tag whose signal will be picked up by satellite to identify her location and report how frequently and deeply she dives during the migration.

The owner of talk-radio station KFYI had been trying to explain to me the difference between saying the victims of the Oklahoma City bombing were ``not innocent'' and saying they deserved to die.If there's a difference, I told him, it seems pretty small. Not to Weber. To him, the difference is huge. It has to be. One of his talk-show hosts, John Dayl, has said of the men and women killed by the blast, ``These people are not innocent victims.
