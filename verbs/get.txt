Jean-Bertrand Aristide still wielding power in many rural areas, pressure is mounting on American military forces here to act more aggressively to disarm the still-dangerous remnants of the previous government's paramilitary apparatus.   In a series of public and private statements and gestures over the last week, both the government of Father Aristide and the United Nations, which authorized the American military intervention in Haiti that began on Sept. 19, have expressed dismay at the lack of security around the country.   But American officials, worried about being drawn into an unlimited, long-term operation with no guarantees of success, appear to be resisting the suggestion that they step up their efforts.   MOSCOW (NYT) -- Confidence in Russia's economic policy took another blow Friday when the market-minded economics minister and deputy prime minister, Aleksandr N. Shokhin, resigned in response to the appointment of a new Finance Minister.   Shokhin stepped down after President Boris N. Yeltsin gave the finance post to Vladimir G. Panskov, a Soviet-era budget specialist who spent several months in prison before bribery charges were dropped.   Assuming that Shokhin's resignation is accepted, the development will undermine confidence among international lenders and Western nations that the government will fulfill its promises of tough fiscal discipline and financial stability.   PARIS (NYT) -- Stealing a march on his likely rivals on left and right, France's Gaullist party leader, Jacques Chirac, tried to breathe life into his flagging campaign for the French presidency Friday by formally declaring that he will be a candidate in next spring's elections.   The announcement came as no surprise. Chirac, a 61-year-old former prime minister who made unsuccessful bids for the presidency in 1981 and 1988, has long been preparing for the 1994 race to succeed President FranCois Mitterrand. Indeed, until 18 months ago, he was the clear frontrunner.   Yet, in recent weeks, the campaign has taken on a surrealistic air, with the three main contenders for the Elysee Palace -- Chirac, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Jacques Delors, the Socialists' favorite -- all behaving like candidates but insisting they had not made up their minds.   Croatia (NYT) -- Bosnian Serb forces, apparently retaliating against an offensive by Muslim-led government troops, have hit Bihac town in northwestern Bosnia with two surface-to-air missiles, a United Nations spokesman said Friday.   Thant Myint-U said the missiles landed close to a school, damaging between 30 and 40 buildings and wounding seven people, including one child who was seriously hurt.   It is very unusual - and scarcely cost-effective - to use a surface-to-a ir missile with a 250-pound warhead such as the SA-2 for an attack on ground targets. Military officials with the United Nations Protection Force said the attack suggested some disarray among the Bosnian Serbs, who have suffered a series of setbacks over the past week.   After spending most of the war on the defensive against the better armed Serbs, the Bosnian army has taken over 400 square kilometres of territory from the Serbs recently, including the town of Kupres in south- western Bosnia and several smaller towns to the east of Bihac.   CATANIA, Sicily (NYT) -- On his first trip outside the Vatican since poor health forced him to cancel a journey to the United States, Pope John Paul II began a weekend visit Friday night to Sicily, where alarm is growing over threats to priests from the Mafia.   The 74-year-old pope, who broke his leg in a bathroom fall last April, emerged unaided from his plane here, without the cane he has often used since his fall. But he seemed uncertain of his footing as he descended the few steps to the tarmac. As is usually the case on papal trips inside Italy, he did not kneel to kiss the ground.   The visit here, initially scheduled for last April but postponed because of his fall, was shadowed from the start by the tense yet sometimes ambiguous relationship between the Church and the Mafia, which the pope has frequently condemned.   JERUSALEM (NYT) -- An Islamic militant leader who was killed by a car bomb in the Gaza Strip this week was himself planning a car-bomb attack inside Israel, the Israeli press reported Friday.   In the most detailed article, the newspaper Haaretz identified the bomb victim, Hani Abed, as leader of the military wing of the Islamic Holy War group and an organizer of past attacks in which Israelis were killed.   The information was not attributed to any source, but it bore the unmistakable imprint of Israel's security services. It fueled already intense speculation that Abed was killed by Israeli agents, either to avenge past incidents or to warn other Palestinian radicals what might happen if they continue a new cycle of violence that has gripped Israel and its territories for the last month.   All major political factions in Gaza, including Yasir Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization, have accused the Israelis of killing Abed, an engineering instructor and editor of an Islamic Holy War newspaper. He was blown up on Wednesday as he went to his car in the Gazan town of Khan Yunis.   ZAGREB, Croatia (NYT) -- Even as the United Nations General Assembly proposes to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina, the embargo on Croatia and its Bosnian Muslim allies appears to have become largely a fiction, openly flouted.   Helped by the ready availability of arms and military components in the former Soviet bloc countries and by an apparent American readiness to turn a blind eye, Croatia is now building or assembling everything from battle tanks to MIG-21 fighter aircraft and acting as the main conduit for the flood of weapons reaching Bosnia.   ``What I need, I get,'' the Croatian Defense Minister, Gojko Susak, said in an interview. ``The arms market is saturated, so saturated you would pay three times the price if you got things legally.''  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941104.0153 type=story > <HEADLINE> `NANNY' ACTOR IS SITTING PRETTY </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-TV-SMITH-COLUMN-TEX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"

"22221"	"you"	"get"	" What Palminteri particularly liked about his first romantic screen assignment, he says in a soft, slightly hoarse voice, is the way the romance builds gradually. ``In so many movies, you get, you know, kissing from the moment they meet to rolling in the shower. This was something that was more inside. We weren't groping each he's waiting and I'm waiting. The whole movie, everybody's waiting for something. In each scene, Mira just let more and more of the walls out so finally at the end you couldn't control it anymore.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
