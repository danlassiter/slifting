But for most of us, the day never comes.   Christi McCully, a Creative Memories consultant, teaches people how to turn a box full of photos into a colorful scrapbook that will last several lifetimes.   The Hewitt resident said she became interested in the craft after she discovered that all of her childhood memories were lost forever.   ``I have always been into pictures and when I moved away from home, I left several scrapbooks behind and my parents stuffed them into a storage shed,'' she said.   ``After I recovered them, I was horrified. There was no air conditioning in the shed and the albums were ruined. The pictures and pages were beyond repair.''   Creative Memories is a national company that employs consultants such as McCully to teach people how to preserve their photos using acid-free paper, stickers and albums.   Humidity and photo albums are the worst enemies to photos, said Douglas Severson, a conservator at the Art Institute of Chicago.   ``In some albums, photographs are ruined much more quickly than they would be if you just left them in a shoe box,'' he said.   The worst type of album, he believes, is the most common one: the so-called magnetic album. It has no magnets, but its cardboard pages grip photographs on a sticky adhesive coating covered by a layer of plastic that is peeled back to position the photos.   In such albums, the cheap-quality cardboard gives off peroxides that cause yellow staining in the whites of the prints in both black and white and color photos.   McCully, who recently moved to the area from Jacksonville, Fla., believes she is the only consultant in Waco. People who see her beautiful albums usually become discouraged because they look so professional.   However, if you can use a pair of scissors and peal off stickers, you can make a creative photo album, said McCully, who offers classes to groups and individuals in her home and at seminars.   She offers the following tips to help people create albums safe for their photos and appealing to the eye:   -- The most important thing that she emphasizes is to crop, or trim the dead space, from your photographs using scissors.   ``Most people look at my album and say, ``What a great photographer you are,''' she said. ``But it's not me, it's the cropping that makes the photos look professional and fun.''   -- McCully also recommends using colorful, acid-free paper to frame pictures on a page and to write documentation. She said documentation is important because no matter how visible the event is to you right now, you will eventually forget it.   ``If you don't write a caption for the picture, an important piece of history is lost forever,'' she said.   -- Use photo-safe adhesives to fasten pictures.   -- Record details with colorful water-proof pens. Write humorous captions and list names of those in the picture.   -- Add creative touches such as stickers, vacation brochures and ticket stubs.   -- Store albums in an upright position and not on top of each other.   -- Store negatives in a fire-proof box or a safe deposit box. .  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19940721.0071 type=story > <HEADLINE> INLINE SKATING MAKES FOR A GREAT WORKOUT </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> DAYTON, Ohio  (BC-INLINE-SKATES-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199407.gz"

"34928"	"she"	"believes"	" Although the reservoir from which Pennzoil is pumping oil was formed at the time of the Pleistocene epoch less than two million years ago, oil now being recovered from the reservoir has a chemical signature characteristic of the Jurassic period, which ended more than 150 million years ago, Whelan said. The implication, she believes, is that highly pressurized oil from lower levels of ``stacked'' reservoirs is frequently breaking through geological barriers and ``burping'' upward, eventually reaching the reservoir from which oil is being pumped. The source of the pressurized gas Whelan believes to be powering the process is a bed of Jurassic period ``source rocks,'' more than 30,000 feet deep, which are rich in very hot hydrocarbons. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"

Her 1-year-old son, Brian, suffers from severe respiratory problems and often coughs up thick mucous. She blames the smelter. The plant has been accused of being one of the world's biggest polluters, pouring 2,000 tons of sulfur dioxide into the air each day.

"43553"	"he"	"believes"	" He has had several girlfriends but no loves. He has had many acquaintances but few friends, to whom he will divulge only selected pieces of information. When there is no trust, he believes, there can be no hurt, and that _ not his looks, not his internal flame _ may be the legacy of the father who never was. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"

"44172"	"he"	"believes"	" But sources told the Sun-Times that Barnett is upset with financial provisions as they apply to his assistant coaches. Barnett's ability to keep his coaching staff intact, he believes, has been a critical factor in the Wildcats' ascent. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"
"44349"	"he"	"believes"	" Young notes that ``many historians have had a hard time'' with the Yale project because, he believes, ``the people are so present and historians worry that the people and the memories don't coincide'' with the historical record. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"
"44609"	"she"	"believes"	" A prosecutor with that essential streak of public service, she is determined to pursue certain cases to their full resolution because of their ``symbolic importance.'' When law enforcement officers are murdered, she believes, it is vital to call all those responsible to account to ``send a message that you just don't do this.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"
"44659"	"he"	"believes"	" ``There is a difference between an enemy and an adversary,'' he said in an interview Friday afternoon. Making this in-house distinction, he believes, has been the crux of his success and his league's global growth and prosperity.

"46438"	"she"	"believes"	" Fowler was referring to the first two years of the Clinton administration, which, she believes, left many people wishing for a more mature leader.

"48018"	"he"	"believes"	" Beyond this, he believes, the theater and movies have simply failed to nurture the kinds of stars he directed. ``You need a garden where those flowers grow,'' he said. ``Where do you get the Astaires and the Garlands and the Kellys and the Charisses and the younger ones, like Streisand?

"49112"	"she"	"believes"	" Still, the Energy Department is increasingly eager to let go of some of its information. Hazel R. O'Leary, the Energy secretary, has been saying since she took office almost three years ago that her department needs to build trust with the public, to develop a consensus about the disposal of nuclear materials. For that, she believes, the public must be educated. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"
"49708"	"he"	"believes"	" In a footnote to his Giants career, Elliott ran into Coach Dan Reeves on a flight from Phoenix to New York on Friday. Elliott was returning from visiting the Cardinals, but his mind was made up that he was going to become a Jet. Reeves, he believes, was in Arizona to play golf. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"
"49731"	"she"	"believes"	" Like other woman preachers, King, 65, has had no female models for preaching and draws primarily on her ``personal life experiences'' for her sermons.

"50754"	"he"	"believes"	" Sharlow has always been a Republican, and he still is. His troubles, he believes, do not have a lot to do with politics. A big corporation decided it would make more money without him than with him or his plant, and that desire for a slightly wider profit margin cost him his job.

"51427"	"he"	"believes"	" Buchanan has the attention of the party and the press. He has the adoration of his core supporters. He has, he believes, a remote chance of winning, if he can score a victory in the Middle West. He has power to influence the party on issues like abortion and trade, and expects only to gain more.

"51587"	"he"	"believes"	" The new breed of Western writers likely will be in the forefront of change, he believes, since their work conforms to his credo that the ``best art ought to be useful, ought to help us see in a new way. Good art is political in the sense that it makes us see freshly, take our blinders off. We don't see then through the mirror of our own prejudices.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"
"51953"	"she"	"believes"	" In legislation introduced Thursday, Eshoo, D-Atherton, proposes that labeling standards -- similar to movie ratings -- be used to classify content, which would help segregate on-line material found unsuitable to minors. This, she believes, would offer greater protection to content providers at the same time helping parents use discretion over what is available to their children. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"
"53137"	"he"	"believes"	" Chibana, a grocer in Yomitan, came under heavy criticism for burning a Japanese flag at a national sports event in the village in 1987. The flag, he believes, is a way of forcing people into blind obedience to militarism and fascism. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"
"53212"	"she"	"believes"	" ``Think about a 45-year-old baby boomer having her first child,'' she said. ``Because she grew up in Western society, her body has probably never seen mother's milk _ it's a foreign protein.'' Yet when she starts lactating, she is unlikely to get an immune response to her own milk. Nor do teen-agers reject the hormones that suddenly start coursing through their veins. ``Most of us don't kill ourselves off at puberty _ not immunologically, anyway,'' she said. The simplest explanation for these phenomena, she believes, is that an antigen must be accompanied by a danger signal before it will touch off an attack. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"

But she is not sure whether to believe any candidate's claims of lower taxes, and points to Clinton's broken promise of a middle-class tax cut in 1992 as an example.

His subjects range from the religious revival that the countercultural rebellion of the 1960s actually constituted, he believes, to what he calls ``The Mythic Etiology of the Dirty Old Man.''

When Princess Diana's limo crashed in 1997, she might have lived if paramedics could have swiftly stopped the massive internal bleeding in her chest, lungs and head. Now a group of scientists at the University of Washington in Seattle has developed an experimental technology that could rapidly seal off an accident victim's damaged blood vessels without the need for a single incision.  Doctors commonly stop hemorrhaging with powerful electrical currents that shrink blood vessels and induce blood clots, but the technique, called electrocautery, works only for wounds close to the surface. High-intensity ultrasound _ waves having frequencies of 1 to 10 megahertz, far above the highest audible sounds _ offers far more flexibility, claims bioengineer Shahram Vaezy. His team has found a way to focus very-high-energy ultrasound at precise sites deep within an injured area.  The ultrasound beam is absorbed by the tissue and converted to intense, localized heat, which stops the bleeding by cauterizing the wound.  ``No other energy mode _ not X rays, not lasers _ can go deep and be brought into a tight focus,'' he says.  SEX, DRUGS AND PMS  While studying the ways cocaine constricts the blood vessels in the brain, Harvard pharmacologist Marc Kaufman noticed that female addicts generally did better in rehabilitation therapy and suffered less neural damage than did males with comparable habits. The reason, he believes, is that the women may be benefiting from hormonal changes associated with their menstrual cycle.  Kaufman took MRI brain scans of men and of a group of women at different phases of their menstrual cycle, after giving them the equivalent of two lines of cocaine. Men suffered a 20 percent drop in brain blood flow, while women at the beginning of their cycle showed no change. Even women in later menstrual stages had only a 10 percent decline.  Kaufman believes estrogen's ability to relax blood vessels may lead to a hormone therapy for both male and female cocaine users.  DID THE ORACLE INHALE?  To the ancient Greeks, the oracle at Delphi was the voice of Apollo. To Jelle de Boer, the oracle was more likely an ordinary woman high on hydrocarbons.  De Boer, a geologist at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, believes the medium who served in the shrine delivered her prophecies while immersed in a trance induced by a naturally occurring mixture of ethane, methane and ethylene, a sweet-smelling gas that was used as an anesthetic in the early 20th century.  De Boer had discovered that the Temple of Apollo lies atop the crossroads of two geologic faults. The slipping and expansion of these faults, he believes, allowed volatile gases to escape from oil-rich limestone deposits and rise through fissures and springs into the sunken base of the shrine.  When de Boer and his colleagues recently analyzed sediments from inside the shrine's foundation, they discovered trapped molecules of ethane and methane. They also found these gases, as well as ethylene, bubbling up in the Kerna Spring, northwest of the temple.  Nearly 2,000 years ago, the author and temple priest Plutarch fingered a sweet-smelling gas as the source of the oracle's predictions. But the French archaeologists who excavated the site a century ago dismissed the theory as myth.  De Boer thinks it is time to give Plutarch proper credit: ``He was a very good naturalist. He gave what is basically a primitive geological report.''

When Princess Diana's limo crashed in 1997, she might have lived if paramedics could have swiftly stopped the massive internal bleeding in her chest, lungs and head. Now a group of scientists at the University of Washington in Seattle has developed an experimental technology that could rapidly seal off an accident victim's damaged blood vessels without the need for a single incision.  Doctors commonly stop hemorrhaging with powerful electrical currents that shrink blood vessels and induce blood clots, but the technique, called electrocautery, works only for wounds close to the surface. High-intensity ultrasound _ waves having frequencies of 1 to 10 megahertz, far above the highest audible sounds _ offers far more flexibility, claims bioengineer Shahram Vaezy. His team has found a way to focus very-high-energy ultrasound at precise sites deep within an injured area.  The ultrasound beam is absorbed by the tissue and converted to intense, localized heat, which stops the bleeding by cauterizing the wound.  ``No other energy mode _ not X rays, not lasers _ can go deep and be brought into a tight focus,'' he says.  SEX, DRUGS AND PMS  While studying the ways cocaine constricts the blood vessels in the brain, Harvard pharmacologist Marc Kaufman noticed that female addicts generally did better in rehabilitation therapy and suffered less neural damage than did males with comparable habits. The reason, he believes, is that the women may be benefiting from hormonal changes associated with their menstrual cycle.  Kaufman took MRI brain scans of men and of a group of women at different phases of their menstrual cycle, after giving them the equivalent of two lines of cocaine. Men suffered a 20 percent drop in brain blood flow, while women at the beginning of their cycle showed no change. Even women in later menstrual stages had only a 10 percent decline.  Kaufman believes estrogen's ability to relax blood vessels may lead to a hormone therapy for both male and female cocaine users.  DID THE ORACLE INHALE?  To the ancient Greeks, the oracle at Delphi was the voice of Apollo. To Jelle de Boer, the oracle was more likely an ordinary woman high on hydrocarbons.  De Boer, a geologist at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, believes the medium who served in the shrine delivered her prophecies while immersed in a trance induced by a naturally occurring mixture of ethane, methane and ethylene, a sweet-smelling gas that was used as an anesthetic in the early 20th century.

"104682"	"she"	"believes"	" The key to her success in stirring up Rose Red's ghosts, she believes, is Annie Wheaton (Kimberly J. Brown), a young autistic telekinetic with enormous powers. Brown, who first drew notices in ``Tumbleweeds,'' spends much of her time looking wide-eyed and furrowing her brow, but she does have the look to pull it off. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"105874"	"he"	"believes"	" Goldberg settles some scores with anchor Dan Rather, portraying him as ``the Dan,'' a Godfather-type character who rules CBS News like a Tony Soprano in a tailored suit, brooking no dissent from underlings. This is not even a new take, but Goldberg moves on to more worthy efforts. The TV networks, he believes, don't really favor one party or politician over another, as some conservative critics have charged. ``Real media bias comes not so much from what party they attack,'' he writes. ``Liberal bias comes as the result of how they see the world,'' especially through politically correct lenses. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"106372"	"he"	"believes"	" But he says he has something that none of his critics can offer: a plan, an alternative to the escalating violence. Simply advocating it, he believes, will energize the search for a diplomatic solution by forcing his critics to propose ideas of their own. ``This is the weak point of all the skeptics,'' he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"106731"	"he"	"believes"	" The reason, he believes, is that there has yet to be a machine that can work as efficiently as a dog to detect scents. ``A dog can sniff four times a second, where as a machine can only analyze one smell every three minutes,'' Hawkinson said. ``Can you imagine how long it would take to search the Georgia Dome at that rate?'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"106912"	"he"	"believes"	" The presence of so much better wine, Spurrier claims, has shrunken his beloved 20-point scale. With no more 9's or 10's toward the bottom and, at the very top, wines ranked 19 and 20 in an elite class of their own, he found himself confined to a range from 12 to 18. Stars, he believes, offer more flexibility. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"107124"	"he"	"believes"	" Newman has his share of cookie jars and other kitchen pieces, but over the past few years he's moved away from mass-produced items and toward folk art and other aesthetic objects. He has a number of majolica and other quality ceramic pieces. Such objects from Europe, he believes, tended to be more representational, depicting black people in humanistic ways. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"107652"	"he"	"believes"	" The we-are-the-world talk of joining hands across boundaries suggests ``The Miner's Canary'' could bridge the chasm between liberals and conservatives. But no, Guinier's ideas are as controversial as ever. A flier from a neo-Nazi group was slipped under Torres's office door in response, he believes, to the book's publication. ``The idea that you're asking white people to make common cause with black and brown people is scary,'' Torres says. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"107998"	"he"	"believes"	" So he and his colleagues are testing fragments of the dead bacteria to see if any of them protect against asthma without causing inflammation.

"108414"	"she"	"believes"	" Auf des Heyde admits that it will be hard to imagine life without her ``eight grandmas'' after she graduates from New York University this spring. What she has learned from Roots and Branches, she believes, will shape the way she views older people for the rest of her life. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"108502"	"he"	"believes"	" Zucker and a handful of other Hollywood executives recently formed National Stem Cell Research Coalition, an advocacy group, in an attempt to bring the power of the entertainment industry to the debate on research. Tuesday, his daughter Katie, in a lilac-colored pants suit and a beaded headband, stood quietly by his side as he proclaimed that he was mystified by opposition to research that, he believes, could save her life. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"109098"	"he"	"believes"	" Volker believes it is fair to count the inmates as population because the prisons are where they are, and because, he believes, the 2000 census so terribly undercounted the population upstate. He is sure that his home county, Wyoming, gained more than 917 people in the 1990s, though he acknowledges it remains a part of New York with ``more cows than people'' and that between the cows and the inmates, he would sooner trust his electoral fate to the cows. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"

THE INNER SAVANT  THE-INNER-SAVANT-DISCOVER _ Nadia appeared healthy at birth, but by the time she was 2, her parents knew something was amiss. She avoided eye contact and didn't respond when her mother smiled or cooed. At 6 months, she spent hours in repetitive play, such as tearing paper into strips. But at 3 1/2, she picked up a pen and created from memory sketches of galloping horses that only a trained adult could equal. Nadia is an autistic savant, a rare condition marked not only by severe mental and social deficits but also by a mysterious talent that appears spontaneously _ usually before age 6. Allan Snyder, a researcher and physicist, has advanced a new explanation of such talents. Savants, he believes, can tap into the human mind's remarkable processing abilities. A report.

THE INNER SAVANT  THE-INNER-SAVANT-DISCOVER _ Nadia appeared healthy at birth, but by the time she was 2, her parents knew something was amiss. She avoided eye contact and didn't respond when her mother smiled or cooed. At 6 months, she spent hours in repetitive play, such as tearing paper into strips. But at 3 1/2, she picked up a pen and created from memory sketches of galloping horses that only a trained adult could equal. Nadia is an autistic savant, a rare condition marked not only by severe mental and social deficits but also by a mysterious talent that appears spontaneously _ usually before age 6. Allan Snyder, a researcher and physicist, has advanced a new explanation of such talents. Savants, he believes, can tap into the human mind's remarkable processing abilities. A report.

It was Halloween night, 1986, and I had seen her through the glass door of the John Peter Smith Hospital emergency room. Her son, the third-oldest of nine children, had been shot and was in surgery.

ENTERTAINMENT and CULTURE  (Will move in ``e'' category)  MADISON-COUNTY-SEQUEL (Undated) _ Ten years after his ``Bridges of Madison County'' conquered the best-seller list (it sold 6 million hardcover copies in North America, which makes it the best-selling hardcover novel of all time), Robert James Waller has written what he describes as an epilogue to the original story. That book, ``A Thousand Country Roads,'' will appear in stores late this month. Despite the platinum pedigree of ``Country Roads,'' it makes its way to print with a surprising number of questions, commercial, artistic and otherwise. By Leslie Kaufman.  GRAMMYS (New York) _ The Grammy Awards will again be held in New York City. By Jon Pareles.  BOOK-EDITORS (New York) _ One of the enduringly intriguing questions that pops up every now and then within the book publishing community is how does one calculate the value of the book editor? It was raised again by the scramble among publishers to sign up the second literary novel by the mega-selling author of ``Cold Mountain.'' As of this writing, the sale has not been made, delayed in part by the author's quandary over this very question. By Martin Arnold.  FRANCE-ALGERIAN-ACTRESS (Paris) _ For an actress of 25 who graduated from the National Conservatory of Dramatic Art in June, Rachida Brakni's screen and stage career has begun on an impressive note. Yet she has been noticed for more than her acting and striking appearance. She is also the French-born daughter of poor Algerian immigrants. By Alan Riding.  TV-NEWS (Undated) _ Critic's Notebook: The recent coverage of the Arab-Israeli conflict suggests that network newscasts in the United States remain important by default. Their audience remains huge. More than 30 million people watch the network news programs each night, while the cable news channels _ CNN, MSNBC and Fox News Channel _ combined would be lucky to reach 3 million in prime time. By Caryn James.  LIVING-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ ``Living It Up,'' by James B. Twitchell, reviewed by Janet Maslin.  TV-BATTLE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Watching ``Battle for the Holy Land'' may not give you a better understanding of the horror there. It surely won't give you hope. But the program, Thursday's installment of the ``Frontline'' series on PBS, does put a human face on the intractable conflict, even if that face is seen in shadow or mostly wrapped in a scarf. By Ron Wertheimer.  HOME  (Will move in ``l'' category)  ANIMAL-DESIGN-SECRETS (Berkeley, Calif.) _ A Q&AMP;A with professor Robert Full, a biologist who studies the way animals move and spends his days handling geckos, poisonous centipedes and other multilegged creatures. Creepy crawlers, he believes, are a source of wisdom for anyone who is designing robots, like Rhex, the all-terrain Hummer of mechanical movers. Fuller answered questions about the promising convergence of biology and design. Chee Pearlman.  (With photo)  HIGH-TECH-REVISED (New York) _ Joan Kron's apartment, with its bathroom-tiled living-room seating and chemical-flask flower vases, was widely publicized in the 1970s when Kron was the co-author of ``High Tech,'' a domestic guide to industrial resources like commercial-kitchen shelving. The book became a bible of style. This month, Kron is completing the renovation of her three-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side. ``I didn't want to be frozen in time,'' she said, discussing design generally. By William L. Hamilton.  JUNGLES-DOMESTICATED (Miami) _ When you have a name like Raymond Jungles, maybe you are fated to rip up lawns to bring the jungle back to South Florida.

The leaders said they regard the suicide attacks as the most successful strategy they have ever employed. By Joel Brinkley.  NATIONAL _ GENERAL (Moved in ``a'' category)  SCI-COUSINS-MARRY (Undated) _ Genetic counselors say that despite numerous state laws and widespread belief that first cousins should not marry, the risks are not high. For the first time, the counselors have issued guidelines and say the laws should be abolished. By Denise Grady.  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.)  SCI-KIDS-CANCER (Undated) _ In an echo of the mammogram findings of last year, researchers say screening tests can detect neuroblastoma, one of the most common childhood cancers, but there is no evidence that early detection does anything to lower death rates. By Gina Kolata.  BUSINESS DAY _ (Moved in ``f'' category)  ADELPHIA-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ Many investors may have been surprised by the recent revelations from Adelphia Communications, the nation's sixth-largest cable television company, whose shares fell an additional 16 percent on Wednesday as the bad news mounted. But last week's disclosure _ that the Rigas family, which controls the company, had borrowed at least $2.3 billion from Adelphia without recording that fact on the books _ should not have come as a shock. By Florence Fabricant.  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.)  ENRON-ASSETS (Washington) _ A provision of state law in Texas and Florida could allow several former executives of Enron who own luxury homes to shield millions of dollars in assets from angry shareholders and former employees, a prospect that has alarmed members of Congress who want to close down the sunbelt loophole. By Philip Shenon.  INEQUALITY-ECONSCENE (Undated) _ Nearly 50 years ago, Simon Kuznets, a winner of the Nobel in economic science, predicted that income inequality would follow an inverted-U pattern over time _ ``widening in the early phases of economic growth when the transition from the preindustrial to the industrial society was most rapid; becoming stabilized for a while; and then narrowing in the later phases.'' New research that updates and extends this classic work, however, turns the Kuznets curve on its head. By Alan B. Krueger.  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.)  SHACKLETON-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ While weather can be mundane, it can also be dramatic, and in that vein two cable television networks are joining forces to promote special, related programs on both channels this month. The unusual joint venture involves the A&AMP;E Network, which is presenting ``Shackleton,'' about a famous expedition to the South Pole in 1914, and the Weather Channel, which is presenting ``StormWeek,'' about severe weather conditions.

"111582"	"he"	"believes"	" The professor and his UConn colleagues plan to build a device to test whether it's possible to transport a subatomic particle, probably a neutron, through time. The energy from a rotating laser beam, Mallett hopes, would warp the space inside the ring of the light so that gravity forces the neutron to rotate sideways. With even more energy, it's possible, he believes, a second neutron would appear. The second particle would be the first one visiting itself from the future. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"112173"	"he"	"believes"	" Smoking, says Johnson, seems to be associated with exactly the group of anxiety conditions that have recently been found to be linked to respiratory disorders. And conditions that are not linked with smoking _ such as obsessive compulsive disorder or social anxiety disorder _ are probably not affected by breathing problems either. This, he believes, is the key to why smoking can affect the mind. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"112177"	"he"	"believes"	" Smoking, says Johnson, seems to be associated with exactly the group of anxiety conditions that have recently been found to be linked to respiratory disorders. And conditions that are not linked with smoking _ such as obsessive compulsive disorder or social anxiety disorder _ are probably not affected by breathing problems either. This, he believes, is the key to why smoking can affect the mind. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"112255"	"he"	"believes"	" But Barrett's characters in this book are selfish, in the sense that they are concerned entirely with personal goals and ambitions. Their focus is on individual struggle for achievement and pleasure, and often those who care for them or help them are left thoughtlessly behind. In the title story, ``Servants of the Map,'' young surveyor Max Vigne leaves behind his child and pregnant wife to map the Himalayas. On this journey, Max becomes the lonely outsider in a group of merciless military officials. He is discouraged and humiliated, but he does not share his pain in letters home to his wife. When he finally overcomes that misery, he does not write to her at all. Instead, he keeps the rewards of success to himself. His concern is individual achievement, and that, he believes, can be accomplished only by neglecting others. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"113420"	"he"	"believes"	" Sharansky believes in ``autonomy'' for the Palestinians, but not a Palestinian state. Two years ago, he resigned as interior minister after Prime Minister Ehud Barak joined U.S.-sponsored peace talks at Camp David. Yasser Arafat, he believes, is the mastermind behind ``the network of terror.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"113783"	"he"	"believes"	" The man who made ``Targets'' became, he believes, a bit of a target himself. He fell for Cybill Shepherd, who had made her film debut in 1971's ``The Last Picture Show,'' and the affair broke up his marriage with Platt. In her book ``Cybill Disobedience,'' Shepherd says that they were the Hollywood couple du jour, but adds that their behavior could be alienating to others: ``We were arrogant and smug, the message being: we're Cybill and Peter, and you're not.'' He and Shepherd stayed together through most of the '70s, but when he used her in other movies, the films bombed: She was miscast as the lead in an adaptation of Henry James' ``Daisy Miller.'' In the musical ``At Long Last Love,'' she was one of a quartet of actors who weren't exactly known for their singing voices. The misfires hurt Bogdanovich's career in more ways than he expected. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"115222"	"he"	"believes"	" Wolfram spins out elaborate speculations based on these ideas _ suggestions about free will, the structure of space, the nature of mathematics. ``There is so much in the book,'' Sejnowski said, ``that it will be years, literally years, before people assimilate it.'' Meanwhile, reactions to Wolfram, he believes, will be ``all over the map.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"115233"	"he"	"believes"	" Wright claims that he was not permitted to pursue ``Vulgar Betrayal,'' a Chicago-based investigation into Hamas and nonprofit groups in the United States that, he believes, were being used to ``recruit, organize, train and support Hamas terrorist operatives and to plan and carry out terrorist attacks.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"115256"	"he"	"believes"	" Wright claims that he was not permitted to pursue ``Vulgar Betrayal,'' a Chicago-based investigation into Hamas and nonprofit groups in the United States that, he believes, were being used to ``recruit, organize, train and support Hamas terrorist operatives and to plan and carry out terrorist attacks.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"116090"	"he"	"believes"	" If the Nets believe they have identified certain matchup advantages, so be it. O'Brien doesn't think that's the case, and so he plans no new wrinkles at the defensive end tonight. What has worked for Boston before, he believes, will work again, assuming, of course, that the proper effort and mental sharpness is there. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"116632"	"he"	"believes"	" Dudley sees a change occurring in some front offices. He believes the GM job, as defined for decades, is changing. More and more clubs, he believes, will separate the duties of player/talent evaluation from some of the other GM chores, such as contract negotiations and dealing with the media. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"116696"	"she"	"believes"	" In any lineup, you would pick Auclair as the chic Parisienne. Now in her late 70s, she still emanates glamour _ she looks like the late photographs of Garbo. (When I told her so, she growled in her low bass voice, ``Say that again!'') And hers is a glamour radiant with vigorous intelligence. She can discuss all the great violinists of past and present from a uniquely informed and often personal perspective. Enescu, she believes, was the greatest musician of all, the most completely musical person she ever met. She admires some contemporary players, such as Frank Peter Zimmermann and Gidon Kremer. When another name is brought up, her look is quizzical. ``Don't you find him a little _ small?'' She is always ready to praise the achievements of her students and colleagues. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"118411"	"he"	"believes"	" And that, he believes, has contributed to a great evil: Some priests have ``taken advantage of the collar and the trust given to the collar.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"119396"	"he"	"believes"	" Up in the sky-high mountains east of Los Angeles, a sky-high former champion works and waits for July 20. That night, he believes, Vernon Forrest will finally fight the real ``Sugar'' Shane Mosley. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"120692"	"he"	"believes"	" So you won't find Paul Blake joining Voice of the Faithful. Some of those most actively involved in the organization, he believes, are trying to push their own ``politically correct agendas, anything from women priests to whatever the fad of the moment is.'' All in all, he believes most at St. Gerard's are happy with the status quo. ``There were some mistakes made by Cardinal Law, but we're a church that preaches forgiveness, and now we need to practice it.''  `We dropped the ball' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"
"120831"	"he"	"believes"	" Gomes, 60, is well aware that his assessment defies the stubbornly held assumptions of his baby boomer contemporaries about their supposedly self-indulgent children, Generation X. This so-called Millennial Generation, he believes, has a fine-tuned sense of altruism and social responsibility, and a great interest in political participation. Gomes suggests they may be poised to become our nation's next ``greatest generation.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"
"121520"	"he"	"believes"	" But that doesn't make memetics any clearer, Aunger argues. In 1933, the geneticist T.H. Morgan suggested that there was as yet no consensus about what genes are or even ``whether they are real or purely fictitious.'' For Aunger, memetics is not even at that stage of ignorance. Memes, he believes, have been so broadly characterized that they seem to be ``everywhere and yet nowhere because they can be anything and nothing.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"121920"	"she"	"believes"	" And what scares her more than anything else is that the face, she believes, will be not that of a monster, but of a man she would not look twice at if she saw him on the street. ``A normal guy,'' she said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"121942"	"she"	"believes"	" And what scares her more than anything else is that the face, she believes, will be not that of a monster, but of a man she would not look twice at if she saw him on the street. ``A normal guy,'' she said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"122361"	"he"	"believes"	" The young Coetzee is a hopeless romantic; he has read the poets and yearns for a life full of passion, both with a woman and with his art. True love will make him into a man, he believes, and he is ready to suffer for the artistic life. But reality rears its head: He takes a job as a computer programmer at IBM in London, where he experiences only a string of unfulfilling dates. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"122838"	"he"	"believes"	" ``People are scared about environmental dangers,'' noted Dr. Glenn Swogger Jr., a psychiatrist in Topeka, Kan. ``Being scared affects their ability to think realistically and use good judgment.'' Underlying these fears, he believes, are uncertainty about the effects of exposures to certain substances, a tendency to overreact and seek scapegoats in stressful situations, guilt about our affluence and an unspoken wish to return to a simpler and purer world. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"123071"	"he"	"believes"	" All the trips up the hill, he believes, have prepared him for one last charge up the mountain. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"123497"	"she"	"believes"	" Because San Miguel is friendly, cool, calm and quaint, it has over the years attracted a sizable colony of the permanent residents referred to as norteamericanos, though nobody is sure just how many they are. About a thousand norteamericanos live in San Miguel year-round, says real estate broker Peggy Zavala and another 2,500, she believes, own houses there, visiting from time to time. On any given day, some 1,500 American tourists are in San Miguel's hotels or renting houses from absentee owners. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"

"124184"	"she"	"believes"	" The obstetrics crisis, she believes, is part of a long continuum: ``It's very striking to me that what is happening in this health-care crisis is hitting women first. It's a circular pattern, and it always comes back to women somehow.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"124370"	"she"	"believes"	" But on balance, she believes, ``I'm moving forward now.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"

"124399"	"he"	"believes"	" First, because he thinks that it is the right thing to do. The risks of not taking action against Iraq, he believes, are greater than the risks of doing so.

TRANSMITTED SEPT. 20, 2002  WINEMAKERS TOAST THE DRY SPELL  NATGEO-TODAY-WINE _ Virginia winemaker Dennis Horton's Viognier grapes have produced a bumper crop _ thanks, he believes, to the summer's parching drought. In 11 states, this year has been the driest or second driest on record, capping four years of inadequate rainfall. This summer has been the hottest in the United States since the 1930s, and the third hottest on record. But, for many grape varieties, that kind of weather is good to grow in. By Peter Standring.

TRANSMITTED SEPT. 18, 2002  WISDOM FROM THE OWL  NATGEO-TODAY-LEARNING _ The barn owl is a source of wisdom about how humans learn, especially as we age. The older we get, the tougher it is to pick up new skills like languages, music and mathematics. But a new study of juvenile and adult barn owls suggests that older birds learn more, and faster, when their training goes step by step. The barn owl study has lessons for human victims of brain injury who must relearn skills _ and for general teaching practices as well. By Bijal P. Trivedi. WITH PHOTO.

Judson takes on a Miss Lonelyhearts persona as Dr. Tatiana to explain, in thoroughly researched detail, the hows and whys of the birds and the bees in her new book, ``Dr. Tatiana's Sex Advice to All Creation.''

After all, the principles that permeate Carter's life are rooted in the South Georgia Sunday school lessons and rocking-chair porches of Plains _ population, 637.  That Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, could live by those simple, eloquent principles and still rise to the pinnacles of power sends a powerful message: Winning the respect of the peoples of the world does not require sacrificing the public good to arrogance, big money, sloganeering or power for power's sake.  Carter was not always hailed for strong leadership when he was the state's governor or the nation's president. His great strength as a humanitarian was finally recognized in his post-presidential contributions through the Carter Center.  His hands-on style shaped the center into an effective voice for peaceful change, whether Carter was trudging through the mud villages of Nigeria to eradicate Guinea worm, sweating in Atlanta's summer sun with a Habitat for Humanity house building crew, monitoring a local election in rural China or mediating with intractable leaders in Haiti and North Korea to avert disaster. Carter's Camp David Accords remain a high point in Middle East negotiations at a time when the United States has lost its credibility as an honest broker in that part of the world.  At the heart of Carter's greatness is a religious and moral structure seldom seen in world leaders, one he does not foist on others, one he lives. He has always contended that ``the most important things in life are the things you don't see, the things that never change.'' What has made Carter an effective peacemaker is that he sees some redeeming quality in every human being, even the most despicable.  In one of his poems, ``Always a Reckoning,'' Carter writes how things on the family farm had to balance out _ acres plowed and cotton picked. Humans are also capable of that kind of reckoning, he believes, if they are open to fair-minded give and take. It is a message that other leaders should take to heart, especially those who would resort to violence first and seek peace later.  Carter the peacemaker is a deserving winner of the Nobel prize. But most of all, he is one of us.  Martha Ezzard is a member of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution editorial board.

IRAQ-U.S.-RESERVES (Washington) _ The Pentagon considers the role of the National Guard and Reserves in a possible war with Iraq. By Eric Schmitt.  IRAQ-INSPECT (Baghdad, Iraq) _ Iraq on Wednesday angrily denounced both the U.N. inspectors, accusing them of making a ``purely provocative'' visit to a presidential palace, and the United States, contradicting Washington once again and insisting that it has no weapons of mass destruction. Seventy-two hours before the Iraqis have said they will hand over what they promise will be a bulky accounting of their weapons programs, the complexity of the diplomatic minuet that will decide whether or not America goes to war was on full display. Demetrios Perricos, the Greek who heads the inspection teams, reasserted U.N. neutrality, but at the same time sending teams to two of Iraq's most important sites. By John F. Burns.  IRAQ-KURDS (Barda Qaraman Camp, Iraq) _ A visit to the refugee camps for people from the oil rich city of Kirkuk, just south of the line of demarcation between Iraq-controlled and Kurdish-controlled territory in northernmost. If there is an attack on Iraq, it is probable that the thousands of people in the camps are simply going to pick up and walk home _ a likely friction point for a post-Hussein regime. By C.J. Chivers.  With photo and map.  UNITED-AIRLINES (Washington) _ A look at the Air Transportation Board, one of the most secretive agencies in Washington. It has the authority to commit up to $10 billion in taxpayer money. Its actions are likely to reshape the airline industry, and its decision in the next few days will probably determine whether United Airlines declares bankruptcy. By Edmund L. Andrews.

TRANSMITTED Dec. 6, 2002  IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC, A DANGEROUS LEAP FOR TOURIST DOLLARS  NATGEO-SOUTH-PACIFIC-RITUAL (Pentecost Island, Vanuatu) _ It's a death-defying ritual, practiced for centuries. On this South Pacific island, in the former New Hebrides, the Naghol, translated as ``land-diving,'' is an ancient form of bungee jumping _ a rite of passage and a way to bless the yam crop. Divers ascend flimsy wooden towers 75 feet or higher, tie jungle vines to their ankles and leap. Divers aim to skim the ground with the top of their heads. Not always do they come away unharmed. These days the islanders are finding other reasons to dive. Tourists have discovered the Naghol, and on Pentecost Island, a fever to cash in has taken hold. By Zoltan Istvan. WITH PHOTOS.  ART AVAILABLE: Four images _ of the ``land-diving'' ritual and divers on Pentecost Island in the South Pacific, and of the National Geographic Channel logo _ are available electronically by calling The New York Times Syndicate's Graphics Desk at 212-499-3339.  TRANSMITTED Dec. 4, 2002  ANCIENT ECHOES FROM KUKULCAN  NATGEO-MAYAN-ACOUSTICS _ Clap your hands in front of the 1,100-year-old Temple of Kukulcan in the ancient Mayan city of Chichen Itza and, to some researchers' ears, the pyramid answers in the voice of the sacred quetzal bird. ``Now I have heard echoes in my life, but this was really strange,'' says David Lubman, an acoustical engineer who runs his own firm in Westminster, Calif. The Maya, he believes, may have built their pyramids to create specific sound effects. By Bijal P. Trivedi. WITH PHOTO.

TRANSMITTED Dec. 2, 2002  ANIMAL ACUPUNCTURE  NATGEO-ANIMAL-ACUPUNCTURE _ When Mary Morrison's 16-year-old border collie, Shadow, was diagnosed with kidney disease last year, traditional veterinary medicine offered two options: kidney dialysis or euthanasia. Morrison chose another option altogether: acupuncture. Three times a month for the past year, Morrison has brought Shadow to the Del Ray Animal Clinic in Alexandria, Va. Shadow represents both the promise and challenge facing veterinary acupuncture. Anecdotal evidence suggests that acupuncture is an effective treatment for a host of ailments in animals. But researchers still understand relatively little about why and how this alternative therapy works. By Sean Markey. WITH PHOTO.

Feces carry at least 20 known viral, bacterial and protozoan pathogens, from polio to salmonella. Saliva can transmit herpes and syphilis. Nasal mucus harbors whooping cough and tuberculosis. Fleas transmit the plague, lice transmit typhus, and flies transmit trachoma, while animals carry a motley crew of pathogens from tapeworms to anthrax. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"133925"	"she"	"believes"	" Nor is O'Brien convinced the message she favored during the general election was the right one for this year. She won the primary, she believes, by portraying herself as an independent watchdog, touting her record of cleaning up the Treasury. But for the general election, she emphasized a more traditional Democratic agenda of a caring government, underestimating voters' impatience for change, she said. At times she seemed too liberal, she suggested, such as when she told a reporter she would sign a bill legalizing gay marriage if it were passed by the Legislature _ an extremely remote possibility. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"134108"	"he"	"believes"	" One starting point for a renaissance of Lebanese food, he believes, might be with the traditional meze. Meze means appetizer in Arabic, although several languages around the Mediterranean claim the word. The chef thinks the concept developed independently among different peoples, starting in the early 1920s at the small riverside restaurants near the Bekaa Valley town of Zahle. Travelers rested by a brook before hauling over the soaring Lebanon range to Beirut and the coast. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"134882"	"he"	"believes"	" Paul Virilio, 70, a French urbanist, philosopher and prolific writer, began developing this thesis after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in the United States in 1979. Now, he believes, we are more accident-prone or rather, technology and communications have made accidents more global in their impact. In his view, if an accident was long defined as chance, today only its timing and consequences are hard to predict; the accident itself is already bound to occur. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"135837"	"he"	"believes"	" ``Clearly, by inflating production figures, his game plan is to psychologically wear down the workers,'' said Michael Shifter at the Inter-American Dialogue, referring to Chavez. ``As time passes, he believes, the workers will get fatigued and come back to their jobs, before they lose them forever.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"135862"	"he"	"believes"	" Pro-globalization Columbia economist Jagdish Bhagwati laments that his younger colleagues are spending so much of their time chasing after figures that are both so elusive and, he believes, so meaningless. ``I'm more worried about poverty because that's really much more critical,'' Bhagwati says. And here the news may be good: By many accounts, even where inequality is increasing, poverty is on the decline. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"135869"	"she"	"believes"	" Dalton says that Roosevelt's image is so fixed in the American consciousness that almost anyone today equates his image with robust health, glorious military action, uncompromising patriotism and the great outdoors. This, she believes, is partially myth, with much of the exaggeration attributed to Roosevelt himself. He made wonderful copy, and he knew it. He was ``dee-lighted'' to cooperate with journalists and biographers who spent a disproportionate number of words on the colorful aspects of his character. Later writers often accepted the ``facts'' of earlier books and articles, and perpetuated the image. Dalton's self-imposed challenge was to bore through to the reality of the man. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"

Patterson had just won a Pulitzer Prize for his columns supporting racial justice and civil rights. King, who had won a Nobel Peace Prize three years earlier, was magnanimous in his praise: ``I am sure that all people of good will in general and all Atlantans in particular are very proud of you and your magnificent achievements.''  The correspondence between the black preacher and the white editor, which surfaced during preparation of a new book on journalism and civil rights, serves as a mirror and a model for our times: a mirror in the way it reflects on war, justice and race, and a model of two men conversing across racial and political boundaries in search of mutual understanding.  Patterson wrote a column that anchored the editorial page of the Constitution every day for nine years, from 1960 to 1968. Continuing the white Southern liberalism espoused by his mentor and predecessor, Ralph McGill, Patterson used the drumbeat of his daily column to persuade his white Southern kinfolk that they must change on matters of race.  With respect, King was wrong about ``all Atlantans'' being proud of Patterson's Pulitzer. The editor's family members were harassed as ``nigger lovers.'' For security, he kept a ball-peen hammer near his typewriter.  But Patterson was emboldened by the early leaders of the struggle for black equality. To read his columns _ more than 3,200 in all _ is to relive the daily human and political drama that we now call the civil rights movement.  On Aug. 28, 1963, Patterson was standing at the Lincoln Memorial, notebook in hand, recording the historic cadences of King's speech before 200,000 marchers.  ``In a few impassioned and triumphant moments,'' he wrote, ``King swept the marchers to a new vision of the Negro's destiny in America by praising and celebrating America, and lifting their eyes from the 'valley of despair' to purple mountain majesties. 'I have a dream,' he boomed again and again, and each dream showed him liberty and pursuit of happiness for all races of Americans soon, from the cliffs of the Rockies to the slopes of the Alleghenies, from Stone Mountain in Georgia to the broad Mississippi. 'I have a dream,' he roared, weeping, and his dream stretched from sea to shining sea, and all the way from the speaker's stand at the Lincoln Memorial to the far end of a crowd that stretched to the Washington Monument.''  By 1966 young black leaders like Julian Bond had begun turning their attention to the war in Vietnam, equating oppression of the poor in America with military oppression of the Vietnamese people. Patterson, who had fought in Patton's army in World War II and reported from the front lines in Vietnam, found this new view of American foreign policy offensive, and said so in columns critical of King.  King's letter to Patterson addresses the difference between the two men: ``I did not come to my position on the war in Vietnam without great soul-searching and long moments of reflection and meditation. I have come to the conclusion that the ultimate measure of a man is not where he finds himself in moments of comfort and moments of convenience, but where he finds himself in moments of challenge and moments of controversy.''  With his letter King sent a pamphlet he had written on Vietnam, along with an autographed copy of his new book, ``Where Do We Go From Here,'' and invited Patterson to meet for an off-the-record conversation on war and civil rights. Patterson responded, ``Just as you know my difference with you is a sincere one, I want you to know that I consider your position also to be the expression of a clear heart.''  Patterson did not tell King that, on two occasions, the FBI had approached the editor with information designed to embarrass the preacher. Go down to this airport, said one agent, and you'll catch King with a woman who's not his wife.  Patterson later described to Howell Raines, now executive editor of The New York Times, what he told the FBI man before he showed him the door: ``Look, we're not a peephole journal. Furthermore, I'm shocked that you would be spying on an American citizen, whether it's Dr. King or some other person, because if it can happen to him, it can happen to all of us.''  The proposed meeting between King and Patterson never took place. Within a year King was dead, felled by an assassin's bullet. Two days later, on April 6, 1968, Patterson wrote, ``Martin Luther King Jr. is home now, forever. If his life and death failed to move us to take our own worst natures in hand to build here one nation in brotherhood because we believe in it, then he failed. He could do no more in his 39 years than show us the way.''  On the day of King's funeral, Patterson pressed through the crowds and was ushered in the back door of Ebenezer Baptist Church. He wrote, ``We will not even now see the overwhelming injustice we continue to visit upon these people who still believe in us unless Dr. King's death teaches us that we must hereafter be among them, and know them, and take their hands and walk with them as men whose friendship will ennoble us. Jobs, housing, education are only programs. Knowing and loving our neighbors is the needed memorial to Dr. King.''  At the age of 79, Patterson continues to write and speak about war, race and justice. He has lived long enough to see the American system of apartheid dismantled, the city of Atlanta transformed and thriving, and an African-American woman, Cynthia Tucker, writing from his old desk at the Constitution. In spite of such progress, this is not the promised land.  ``The work is not finished,'' he wrote in 2002. Only brave political and editorial leadership, he believes, will ``lift up the people we held down for so long and cleanse from American history the stain of past wrongs.''  The final paragraph of King's letter continues to speak to Patterson, as one great Georgia writer expresses himself to another with no expectation that his words will be published some 35 years later:  ``It is my great hope that the dark clouds of war will soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear-drenched world, and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of peace and brotherhood will shine over our great nation and the world. Sincerely, Martin Luther King Jr.''  (Author and journalist Roy Peter Clark is a senior scholar at the Poynter Institute in St. Petersburg, Fla.

Patterson had just won a Pulitzer Prize for his columns supporting racial justice and civil rights. King, who had won a Nobel Peace Prize three years earlier, was magnanimous in his praise: ``I am sure that all people of good will in general and all Atlantans in particular are very proud of you and your magnificent achievements.''  The correspondence between the black preacher and the white editor, which surfaced during preparation of a new book on journalism and civil rights, serves as a mirror and a model for our times: a mirror in the way it reflects on war, justice and race, and a model of two men conversing across racial and political boundaries in search of mutual understanding.  Patterson wrote a column that anchored the editorial page of the Constitution every day for nine years, from 1960 to 1968. Continuing the white Southern liberalism espoused by his mentor and predecessor, Ralph McGill, Patterson used the drumbeat of his daily column to persuade his white Southern kinfolk that they must change on matters of race.  With respect, King was wrong about ``all Atlantans'' being proud of Patterson's Pulitzer. The editor's family members were harassed as ``nigger lovers.'' For security, he kept a ball-peen hammer near his typewriter.  But Patterson was emboldened by the early leaders of the struggle for black equality. To read his columns _ more than 3,200 in all _ is to relive the daily human and political drama that we now call the civil rights movement.  On Aug. 28, 1963, Patterson was standing at the Lincoln Memorial, notebook in hand, recording the historic cadences of King's speech before 200,000 marchers.  ``In a few impassioned and triumphant moments,'' he wrote, ``King swept the marchers to a new vision of the Negro's destiny in America by praising and celebrating America, and lifting their eyes from the 'valley of despair' to purple mountain majesties. 'I have a dream,' he boomed again and again, and each dream showed him liberty and pursuit of happiness for all races of Americans soon, from the cliffs of the Rockies to the slopes of the Alleghenies, from Stone Mountain in Georgia to the broad Mississippi. 'I have a dream,' he roared, weeping, and his dream stretched from sea to shining sea, and all the way from the speaker's stand at the Lincoln Memorial to the far end of a crowd that stretched to the Washington Monument.''  By 1966 young black leaders like Julian Bond had begun turning their attention to the war in Vietnam, equating oppression of the poor in America with military oppression of the Vietnamese people. Patterson, who had fought in Patton's army in World War II and reported from the front lines in Vietnam, found this new view of American foreign policy offensive, and said so in columns critical of King.  King's letter to Patterson addresses the difference between the two men: ``I did not come to my position on the war in Vietnam without great soul-searching and long moments of reflection and meditation. I have come to the conclusion that the ultimate measure of a man is not where he finds himself in moments of comfort and moments of convenience, but where he finds himself in moments of challenge and moments of controversy.''  With his letter King sent a pamphlet he had written on Vietnam, along with an autographed copy of his new book, ``Where Do We Go From Here,'' and invited Patterson to meet for an off-the-record conversation on war and civil rights. Patterson responded, ``Just as you know my difference with you is a sincere one, I want you to know that I consider your position also to be the expression of a clear heart.''  Patterson did not tell King that, on two occasions, the FBI had approached the editor with information designed to embarrass the preacher. Go down to this airport, said one agent, and you'll catch King with a woman who's not his wife.  Patterson later described to Howell Raines, now executive editor of The New York Times, what he told the FBI man before he showed him the door: ``Look, we're not a peephole journal. Furthermore, I'm shocked that you would be spying on an American citizen, whether it's Dr. King or some other person, because if it can happen to him, it can happen to all of us.''  The proposed meeting between King and Patterson never took place. Within a year King was dead, felled by an assassin's bullet. Two days later, on April 6, 1968, Patterson wrote, ``Martin Luther King Jr. is home now, forever. If his life and death failed to move us to take our own worst natures in hand to build here one nation in brotherhood because we believe in it, then he failed. He could do no more in his 39 years than show us the way.''  On the day of King's funeral, Patterson pressed through the crowds and was ushered in the back door of Ebenezer Baptist Church. He wrote, ``We will not even now see the overwhelming injustice we continue to visit upon these people who still believe in us unless Dr. King's death teaches us that we must hereafter be among them, and know them, and take their hands and walk with them as men whose friendship will ennoble us. Jobs, housing, education are only programs. Knowing and loving our neighbors is the needed memorial to Dr. King.''  At the age of 79, Patterson continues to write and speak about war, race and justice. He has lived long enough to see the American system of apartheid dismantled, the city of Atlanta transformed and thriving, and an African-American woman, Cynthia Tucker, writing from his old desk at the Constitution. In spite of such progress, this is not the promised land.  ``The work is not finished,'' he wrote in 2002. Only brave political and editorial leadership, he believes, will ``lift up the people we held down for so long and cleanse from American history the stain of past wrongs.''

KOREA-U.S. (Washington) _ The United States on Friday condemned North Korea's decision to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, saying it further escalated the crisis and posed a serious challenge to global disarmament efforts. Washington also rejected Pyongyang's contentions that it could immediately withdraw from the treaty and that the step was legal and justified by steps taken by the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Early Friday, President Bush called China's president, Jiang Zemin, to urge joint action to stop North Korea from what several senior administration officials believe is an effort to accelerate a program that would develop five or six nuclear weapons in the next few months, while the White House focuses on Iraq. By David E. Sanger with Julia Preston.  Editors, KOREA-U.S.-1STLD-WRITETHRU has moved and will be updated; this story subsumes KOREA-U.N. budgeted earlier and now scratched.  And  KOREA-ENVOYS (Santa Fe, N.M.) _ Clinton-era diplomatic big-gun Bill Richardson launched a second round of talks with two North Korean envoys early Friday as the crisis over Pyongyang's nuclear program escalated, officials said. The former U.N. ambassador was upbeat over the tone of the private talks, which cast him as an unusual go-between in the deepening standoff over the Stalinist hermit state's weapons scheme. By Steven R. Weisman.  And  KOREA-ASSESS (Washington) _ North Korea's decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty is a calculated exercise in brinkmanship that appears intended to step up the pressures on the Bush administration to engage in full-fledged economic and political negotiations with Pyongyang. In a sense, North Korea's threat to withdraw does not change the basic situation on the Korean peninsula. Pyongyang has been violating the treaty for years by engaging in a clandestine program to enrich uranium. It has already thrown out the agency's inspectors and removed key monitoring equipment. By Michael R. Gordon.  JOBS-REPORT (Undated) _ The nation continued to bleed tens of thousands of jobs in December, the Labor Department reported Friday, jolting forecasters who had expected a modest upturn in employment and suggesting that American business remains highly pessimistic about the economic future. Payrolls in non-farm businesses dropped by 101,000, and the unemployment rate stayed at 6 percent. The Labor Department also revised the number of jobs lost in November to 88,000 from 40,000. Though cornerstones of economic growth like increasing productivity and financial stability remain intact, companies have been unwilling to expand production or commit to investments in new equipment and technology that would support job creation. By Daniel Altman.  An early version has moved.  With photos, NYT2-3.  DEATH-PENALTY-DECLINE (Undated) _ For the first time in a generation, the number of inmates on death row has dropped. And the number of people sentenced to death in 2001, the most recent year for which data is available, was the lowest since 1973. Despite enduring and strong popular support for the death penalty, these numbers suggest that those directly involved in the justice system share at least some the concerns that prompted Gov. George Ryan of Illinois to undertake a sweeping review of his state's approach to capital punishment. The drop in the number of death sentences is the product of a number of phenomena, including a lower murder rate. But legal experts across the political spectrum agreed that advances in DNA technology, combined with recurring disclosures about sloppy or abusive police work have raised grave doubts about the way capital punishment is carried out. By Adam Liptak.  With graphic.  IRAQ-MOBILIZE (Hinesville, Ga.) _ At a surplus shop outside Fort Stewart, home of the Third Infantry Division, women are working until midnight in a mad dash to stitch names into uniforms. The town and base is crawling with activity. This is the fretful deployment dance before the big, long hush. And it's happening _ again. The Army's entire 3rd Infantry Division, based at Ft. Stewart, is leaving, and few corners of the country are turned as inside out by the showdown with Iraq as Hinesville, Ga. During the gulf war, after the 3rd Division was dispatched to Saudi Arabia, many businesses here went under. By Jeffrey Gettleman.  With map.  CALIF-FISCAL (Sacramento, Calif.) _ Gov. Gray Davis releases his budget plan calling for tax increases and major spending cuts to deal with a $34 billion deficit. By John M. Broder.  With graphic.

"143228"	"he"	"believes"	" Brasil shared his theory: Powerful foreign interests want to lock up Roraima's deposits of gold and tin ore, copper and diamonds, so that they will be available in the future. Private cartels, he believes, secretly finance groups helping native tribes regain land and rights. The United States and other governments, Brasil said, pressure the Brazilian government to give land to the tribes.

"143576"	"she"	"believes"	" While the Smiths were staples on the UK charts, they never became a mainstream radio band stateside. The group peaked on the Billboard charts in 1985 with How Soon Is Now?, which reached No. 36. People were turned on mainly through word of mouth, from record store clerks to curious young music fans to like-minded friends, with strong support from alternative and college radio. Today the Smiths' musical legacy is passed down in similar fashion, from older sisters and brothers to younger siblings, from bass player to drummer, from alt-rock radio host to new listener. WFNX (101.7 FM) DJ and assistant music director Julie Kramer still spins the Smiths on 'FNX's Leftover Lunch program. (Kramer was, she believes, the first DJ in the US to play the Smiths when she returned to her job at UMass-Dartmouth's radio station from a year abroad with a vinyl 45 of the band's second single, This Charming Man.) But unlike other nostalgia groups, the Smiths are also included in the station's regular-rotation </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"143589"	"he"	"believes"	" The upcoming Iraqi elections, he believes, will face an agonizing double-bind in which going ahead is bad, but waiting is worse.

"144735"	"he"	"believes"	" Carr does not deny that religion has frequently lent itself to political manipulation in the 2004 campaign, but that impression, he believes, has been magnified by caricatures reflecting an automatic reaction by the news media that religious leaders are always acting out of political motives. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"145621"	"she"	"believes"	" From Judge Robert Bork and philosopher Allan Bloom, she came to believe that the United States suffers because moral absolutes have become relative.

"145673"	"he"	"believes"	" Welch challenges what he calls the culture of medicine, questioning the widespread presumption that it never hurts to look.

"146561"	"she"	"believes"	" Israel interviewed three design luminaries for her book -- architect and product designer Michael Graves; architecture critic Charles Jencks; and architect and town planner Andres Duany -- and took them through a series of exercises to determine whether their childhoods had influenced their homes and later work. Each of them, she concludes in the book, subconsciously reworked their history of places not only to create their own homes but their well-known public buildings and/or architecture/planning philosophies. Duany, for example, is a pioneer of New Urbanism, the planning movement that encourages human interaction through the design of walkable, people-centered neighborhoods. Not coincidentally, she believes, he grew up in Barcelona, where he spent hours every day on the streets and in cafes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"146833"	"he"	"believes"	" Of course, Murray's revered status, celebrated in a two-day symposium at Brigham and Women's Hospital last week, says as much about the intractability of medicine today as it does about the gifted surgeon from Wellesley. Parrish contends that today's researchers face formidable obstacles to promoting new ideas - from winning regulatory approval to finding business partners to turn drugs and devices into realities. All these developments, he believes, help explain why cancer remains the second leading cause of death 33 years after President Richard M. Nixon declared war on cancer. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"146988"	"he"	"believes"	" Lake, for his part, requested two ground rules in agreeing to see and discuss the film: that he not be made to appear self-serving or self-exculpatory (a rule that tended to take care of itself), and that he be allowed to air his views on the current situations in Darfur in Sudan and in the eastern Congo. The extensive loss of civilian life in those places, he believes, is a direct echo of the Rwandan genocide, and this time, he asserts, international powers should not sit idly by, as they have largely done to date. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"147899"	"he"	"believes"	" When the couple first bought the rambling 1886 house, it was surrounded by a gently sloping one-acre yard shaded by century-old trees, and Santostefano saw the potential for a therapeutic landscape. His brand of relational therapy relies on the notion that memories of traumatic experiences must be enacted, or relived, through physical action in order to be transcended. For young children especially, he believes, outdoor activities -- something as simple as lying on soft grass -- can unlock those memories. And thanks to a $200,000 grant from an art dealer, he and his wife now had the chance to create an ideal environment for their new institute's work. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"

"148803"	"he"	"believes"	" And this season, his wings are in greater motion than ever -- he estimates about 7,000 flaps a game -- because, he believes, the team now needs more enthusiasm exhorted from the home fans than in recent years, especially last year. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"148879"	"he"	"believes"	" As a barrage of insurgent mortar shells shook his house - close, but not too close - Rubaie spoke of how three of his mother's brothers were executed, along with his sister's husband, for working in the Da'wa party, a Shi'ite Islamist movement that Hussein viewed as a threat. Rubaie's mother had several heart attacks and died, he believes, from those stresses. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"149559"	"she"	"believes"	" A little seasoning, she believes, does wonders. Similarly, she likes to enhance her message by peppering her words with easily remembered French phrases.

Photo and graphic notes will be added on Friday. If you have questions about stories, call (888) 346-9867 or (212) 556-1927. For questions about photos, call (888) 603-1036 or (212) 556-4204.  On the Cover  Editors: The cover stories will be budgeted on Friday. Stories under consideration are features on a malpractice attorney and Martha Stewart's impending return from federal prison.  Commentary  ECON-COLUMN (Undated) -- The weekly Economic View column: Though Social Security's fiscal direction has taken center stage in Washington of late, Medicare's future financing problems are likely to be much worse. President Bush has asserted that the Medicare Modernization Act, which he signed in 2003, would solve some of those problems -- the logic is irrefutable, he said two months ago. Yet the Congressional Budget Office expects the law to create just $28 billion in savings during the decade after its passage, while its prescription drug benefit will add more than $400 billion in costs. So, how can Medicare's ballooning costs be contained? One idea is to let people die earlier. By Daniel Altman.  EVERYBODYS-BUSINESS (Undated) -- The column: Your humble servant grew up as the son of two brilliant economists. I studied economics at Columbia University under some big names in economics. When I was in law school at Yale, I took classes in finance in the graduate school of economics under geniuses. None of these people, however, taught me to be a great investor. I have been a stockholder of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's company, for more than 20 years, and I have done well with the stock. But even reading Buffett's famous annual letters to stockholders did not teach me to be a great investor. The fact is that I am not a great investor, at least in the sense that I can consistently or even often beat the broad market indexes in any meaningful way. But here comes the important part: Many other people aren't great investors, either. By Ben Stein.  KARMAZIN-SIRIUS (Undated) -- It can be crowded at the top. That is what Mel Karmazin found after CBS, of which he was chief executive, merged with Viacom in 2000. He agreed to stay on as president of Viacom under the combined company's CEO, Sumner M. Redstone; four rocky years later, Karmazin stepped down and cashed in his options. Last fall, Karmazin signed on as the chief executive of Sirius Satellite Radio, the second-largest (and only other) satellite radio broadcaster after XM. The move recalls his roots as the founder of Infinity Broadcasting, the radio group that popularized Howard Stern. Karmazin spoke recently about Stern, who will be joining Sirius in January, as well as Redstone and Sirius's business. Following are excerpts from the conversation. By Laura Rich. In Q&amp;A format.  FIGHTING-GERMS (Undated) -- More and more, the United States is a nation of germophobes. The nation's germ obsession should come as little surprise. The news has been full of health worries -- whether from the SARS epidemic, viral outbreaks on cruise ships or biological weapons threats. During commercial breaks, TV advertisers have done their part to sound the alarm about germs lurking in places as varied as your laundry and your mouth. Consumers now have their pick of germ-zapping products: from toothbrush sanitizers and air purifiers to antibacterial soaps, cutting boards, clothing, keyboards and even refrigerators. About 75 percent of Americans use at least six or more antimicrobial products regularly. Have consumers gone too far? Perhaps. By Amy Cortese.  WOMEN-PAY (New York) -- Do you think that Lawrence H. Summers, Harvard's president, stirred up a hornets' nest by suggesting that women's brains are not genetically wired for math or science? Wait until you hear Warren Farrell on the subject of women's pay. Sure, Farrell accepts that women, as a group, are paid less than men. But the way he sees it, using pay statistics to prove sex discrimination is akin to using the horizon to prove that the world is flat. Women, he believes, methodically engineer their own paltry pay. They choose psychically fulfilling jobs, like librarian or art historian, that attract enough applicants for the law of supply and demand to kick in and depress pay. They avoid well-paid but presumably risky work -- hence, the paucity of women flying planes. And they tend to put in fewer hours than men -- no small point, he says, because people who work 44 hours a week make almost twice as much as those who work 34 and are more likely to be promoted. An At Lunch feature by Claudia H. Deutsch.  Investing  INVEST-CASH (Undated) -- After suffering through years of derisively low interest rates, people with cash on their hands may finally be able to get a decent return for parking their money safely in bank accounts or in money market funds. Such savers may still have a hard time coming out ahead, after taxes and inflation, but the overwhelming consensus is that the rate increases that the Federal Reserve began last June will continue and that such investments will become more attractive. By Robert D. Hershey Jr.  INVEST-OVERSEAS (Undated) -- The Strategies column: Investors who look overseas to reduce the risks of holding stocks can find support in a new study. Contrary to recent objections that this strategy does not work well, if it works at all, the research has found that global portfolios have been significantly less risky over the long run than ones containing domestic stocks alone. By Mark Hulbert.  CARS-VOLVO-COMPACTS (Undated) -- Volvo's first attempt at a line of small cars did not go well, but it is back with a new S40 (and a wagon version, the V50). Built on a well-regarded platform shared with the Mazda 3 and a new European version of the Ford Focus, the latest Volvos are compelling compacts. And, significantly, they give Volvo a footprint in a market that is expected to become very crowded in the next few years: Premium compact cars priced from roughly $25,000 to $33,000. Audi is about to bring its A3 to America, and both BMW and Mercedes have small cars on the way. The question remains whether Americans will learn to equate small with upscale? By Sheryl Jensen.  For Monday release:  CARS-RACECARS-COLLECT (Undated) -- Among the most valuable collector cars are racing machines that claim a piece of motorsports history, including Ford GT40s that became legends at Le Mans in the 1960s, or the very first Ferraris. One New York investment banker has a garage full of these racetrack icons, and like some of his fellow collectors he actually drives them on the street -- with state registration papers, license plates, annual safety inspections and all. Of course, it doesn't hurt to have top-notch mechanics at your beck and call. By Nick Kurczewski.

To improve his calorific intake and promote an efficient recovery of his strength, nutrition via the positioning of a nasal gastric tube has begun, said the Vatican spokesman, Joaquín Navarro-Valls. The announcement did not say exactly when the feedings had started. But the ailing pope appeared silently at the window of his chambers at 11 a.m. local time, without a feeding tube in place. For the first time, the Vatican seemed to damp down a bit its normally upbeat assessment of the pope's medical condition, now characterizing his convalescence as slow. By Elisabeth Rosenthal and Ian Fisher.  An early lede has moved.  IRAQ (Baghdad, Iraq) -- A car bomb exploded outside a primary school west of Baghdad Wednesday, killing a guard, as insurgents launched attacks on pilgrims traveling to Karbala for a Shiite religious festival. The bomb detonated in the town of Abu Ghraib outside the Abu Ghraib School, Interior Ministry officials said. Five civilians standing nearby were also injured. By Robert F. Worth.  LAURA-BUSH (Kabul, Afghanistan) -- With Laura Bush on a five-hour visit to Afghanistan, with extraordinarily tight security. By Carlotta Gall.  WOLFOWITZ-EUROPE (Brussels, Belgium) -- Paul Wolfowitz came to Europe as a supplicant, trying to shed his image as a unilaterialist hawk and entreat his hosts to approve him as president of the World Bank. The nomination of Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense and a leading architect of the American-led war in Iraq, to the World Bank post by President Bush has sparked a firestorm of protest among political commentators and in much of the European media. But instead of taking revenge and objecting to him, European leaders have given him the green light, however grudgingly, another sign of Europe's realization that it must repair relations with the United States in Bush's second term. By Elaine Sciolino.  ZIMBABWE-ELECT (Harare, Zimbabwe) -- Advancing Thursday's legislative elections in Zimbabwe. By Michael Wines.  INDONESIA-QUAKE ( Gunung Sitoli, Indonesia) -- A report on the earthquake from the island of Nias, off the western shore of Sumatra, where people are still lying under piles of rubble as their neighbors, with almost no heavy equipment, tear with their hands at blocks of concrete and piles of brick. By Seth Mydans.  KYRGYZSTAN (Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan) -- Developments. Felix Kulov, one of the two most popular Kyrgyz leaders to emerge from last week's coup, on Wednesday resigned as security chief, distancing himself from the new government just three months before a presidential election. His move raises concerns of more unrest and divisions among the impoverished central Asian state's new rulers, less than a week after President Askar Akayev fled. By Craig S. Smith.  CHINA-TAIWAN (Beijing) -- A high-ranking delegation from Taiwan arrives in Beijing. By Christopher Buckley.  UNITED STATES -- National General (a code)  MINN-SHOOTINGS (Dateline TK, Minn.) -- The investigation of a shooting spree that left nine people and the gunman dead on a Minnesota Indian reservation widens as the authorities seek to determine how many people may have plotted to commit the rampage. The authorities had said that 16-year-old Jeff Weise acted alone in killing nine people before taking his own life, but on Sunday they arrested, Louis Jourdain, a high school student and son of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa chief, as part of the investigation into a potentially wider plot. By Monica Davey.  SCHIAVO (Pinellas Park, Fla.) -- In a new legal twist in a case already marked by back-and-forth maneuverings, a federal appeals court agreed late Tuesday to consider a request for a new hearing on whether a feeding tube should be reconnected to the severely brain-damaged Terry Schiavo. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ruled without comment. The motion was being considered by all 11 judges on the Atlanta panel, a court official said Wednesday.  JACKSON-TRIAL (Santa Maria, Calif.) -- Prosecution testimony continues in the Michael Jackson child molestation trial. By Charlie LeDuff.  UNITED STATES -- Washington (w code)  SCOTUS-AGE-DISCRIM (Washington) -- The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that older workers can, in some circumstances, recover damages from their employers for harm caused by age discrimination even if the harm was not deliberate. The court, ruling 5-3 in a case that has been closely watched by business interests, held that the 1967 Age Discrimination in Employment Act does allow such lawsuits. But the court also made clear that the estimated 75 million people covered by the law, meaning workers over the age of 40, must clear a high threshold of evidence to prevail. By Linda Greenhouse.  FINANCIAL (f code)  AIG-BERKSHIRE (New York) -- American International Group said it had discovered improper documentation for a controversial transaction with Berkshire Hathaway and said that it would delay the filing of its annual report with regulators. It was the first time that AIG has said a deal with General Re was improperly recorded as an insurance transaction. AIG also intends to seek relief from the SEC to allow the continued use of registration statements on Form S-3, which means it needs the agency's permission to continue selling registered life insurance products. By Gretchen Morgenson.  With  DUBLIN-INSURE (Undated) -- Dublin is the boom town in the growing use of finite insurance. Looking at how Ireland became the new Bermuda. By Timothy L. O'Brien and Brian Lavery.  MCI-QWEST (Undated) -- Qwest's board meets to discuss is options regarding MCI, including a counteroffer or taking its offer directly to shareholders.

MITSUBISHI-SUIT (Tokyo) -- Mitsubishi Motors said it would sue seven of its former executives for damages, including three past presidents, for their roles in what it called a cover-up of vehicle defects that has decimated sales. By Todd Zaun.  ECONSCENE (Undated) -- The weekly Economic Scene column. By Alan B. Krueger.  Editors, the News Service will file these briefs, except when all items are from other news agencies:  In addition, many clients receive condensed versions of 15-20 major news stories, summarized in the TIMES-EXPRESS-BUDGET.  ENTERTAINMENT/ARTS (e unless otherwise indicated)  MCEWAN-NOVELS (New York) -- In London, where people study the literary pecking order more closely than Americans do, Ian McEwan is currently ranked the best British novelist of his generation. It is only a matter of time, he believes, before the mantle passes to Kazuo Ishiguro, who has a new novel just out, or to Julian Barnes or Salman Rushdie, who both have books coming later this year. But in fact McEwan, 56, has held the title at least since 2001, when his novel Atonement earned almost unanimously favorable reviews on both sides of the Atlantic, and the reception for his new book, Saturday, with just a few naysayers chiming in, has only cemented his standing. What his celebrity mostly means, McEwan said in an interview in New York this week, is that every time he has a book out, newspaper editors in Britain call him requesting, say, an essay on My Favorite Armchair or, as happened just recently, asking him to name his two favorite vegetables. By Charles McGrath.  SIN-CITY-FILM (Los Angeles) -- Robert Rodriguez's new film, Sin City, will be Harvey Weinstein's last release for Disney-owned Miramax Films and like Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill before it, pushes the limits of mainstream film violence. Cannibalism, decapitations, dismemberment and torture feature heavily in the story and Disney, which has been moving its mix toward the family end of the spectrum, faces the difficult task of squaring the circle without disassociating itself from what might be a big hit. By David M. Halbfinger.  TOWELHEAD-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) -- Towelhead, by Alicia Erian (S&amp;S). Reviewed by Janet Maslin.

MCEWAN-NOVELS (New York) -- In London, where people study the literary pecking order more closely than Americans do, Ian McEwan is currently ranked the best British novelist of his generation. It is only a matter of time, he believes, before the mantle passes to Kazuo Ishiguro, who has a new novel just out, or to Julian Barnes or Salman Rushdie, who both have books coming later this year. But in fact McEwan, 56, has held the title at least since 2001, when his novel Atonement earned almost unanimously favorable reviews on both sides of the Atlantic, and the reception for his new book, Saturday, with just a few naysayers chiming in, has only cemented his standing. What his celebrity mostly means, McEwan said in an interview in New York this week, is that every time he has a book out, newspaper editors in Britain call him requesting, say, an essay on My Favorite Armchair or, as happened just recently, asking him to name his two favorite vegetables. By Charles McGrath.  SIN-CITY-FILM (Los Angeles) -- Robert Rodriguez's new film, Sin City, will be Harvey Weinstein's last release for Disney-owned Miramax Films and like Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill before it, pushes the limits of mainstream film violence. Cannibalism, decapitations, dismemberment and torture feature heavily in the story and Disney, which has been moving its mix toward the family end of the spectrum, faces the difficult task of squaring the circle without disassociating itself from what might be a big hit.

NYT News Service  INTERNATIONAL  (Coded I)  ISRAEL-GAYS (Undated) -- When international gay rights leaders picked Jerusalem to hold a 10-day World Pride festival and parade this August, they said they wanted to make a statement about tolerance and diversity in the Holy City. Now conservative leaders of three faiths - Christianity, Judaism and Islam - have united to try to stop the festival from going forward. Their alliance was nurtured by a Christian pastor from San Diego who, like many American evangelical leaders, is an outspoken supporter of Israel and had formed relationships with Israeli politicians and rabbis. By Laurie Goodstein and Greg Myre.  With photos.  NATIONAL  (Coded a)  STATES-GAMBLE (Dover, Del.) -- Gambling has become a critical source of revenue for a number of states, in some cases surpassing traditional sources like the corporate income tax and helping states lower personal income or property taxes. We're drunk on gambling revenue, said Wayne Smith, the House majority leader in the Delaware Legislature. Gambling revenues are like free money. In Rhode Island, South Dakota, Louisiana and Oregon, not to mention Nevada, taxes from casinos, slot machines at racetracks and lotteries make up more than 10 percent of overall revenues, according to a new report. In Delaware, West Virginia, Indiana, Iowa and Mississippi, gambling revenues are fast approaching 10 percent. By Fox Butterfield.  With photo.  HITLER-PSYCHOLOGICAL-PROFILE (Undated) -- The first psychological profile of Hitler, commissioned by the Office of Strategic Services, a predecessor to the CIA, has been posted by the Cornell University Law Library on its Web site. By Benedict Carey.  FINANCIAL  (Coded f)  NY-STADIUM-DOLAN (Undated) -- If Cablevision loses its bid to block the Jets from building a stadium above the railyards on the Far West Side of Manhattan, which is likely to happen Thursday, its pugnacious chief executive, James L. Dolan, will be a double loser. Dolan will not only face the prospect of stiff new competition for Cablevision's Madison Square Garden, but he will have made Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and much of the city's civic establishment his enemy. In addition, his unsuccessful campaign will have cost him a fortune, while he is still facing an internal battle at Cablevision with his own father, Charles F. Dolan, who controls the company. By Richard Sandomir, Geraldine Fabrikant and Charles V. Bagli.  CABLE-BULK-DEALS (Undated) -- Planned communities sprouting up across the Sun Belt and apartment blocks in big cities are the hottest battlegrounds for customers in the pay television market. With new subscribers harder to find, more consumers are being locked into compulsory plans in developments where a homeowners' association or management company charges residents for property upkeep, security and the like. By Ken Belson.  (Story moved on 3-29.)  AIG-MARKETPLACE (Undated) -- The accounting improprieties uncovered by American International Group and disclosed to the public Wednesday not only concede that the company's net worth will have to be reduced by $1.7 billion and that its annual financial report will be later than expected. They also paint an unattractive picture of a company that during the last five years, regularly reached into its bag of tricks to beautify its financial performance. By Gretchen Morgenson.  CIR-CIRCUITS-COLUMN (Undated) -- You might not imagine that there's a single movie-distribution channel left to invent. These days, a movie can reach you by pay-per-view, on a plane, at the video store, on a TV movie channel, on the Internet, at the front of a Greyhound bus, in the second row of a minivan or even -- get this -- in a movie theater. (Hey, it could happen.) Not to seem ungrateful, but none of these mechanisms deliver the holy grail: any movie, any time. There is, however, a low-tech distribution channel that comes pretty darned close: DVD rentals by mail. By David Pogue.  With graphic.  DAYLIGHT-AD-COLUMN (Undated) -- As most Americans prepare to push their clocks ahead this weekend when daylight saving time arrives, Madison Avenue is falling back -- on one of the most popular ploys in the marketing handbook, capitalizing on the calendar. By Stuart Elliott.  LIFESPAN-ECONSCENE (Undated) -- In extraordinary circumstances like this, President Bush said of the Terri Schiavo predicament, it is wisest to always err on the side of life. Uwe E. Reinhardt, a Princeton University health economist, said that from his perspective President Bush was not quite right: the president should have said err on the side of life years. By Alan B. Krueger.  SPORTS  (Coded s)  BKC-MICH-STATE (Kansas City) -- Last season, UConn pulled off the double, with the men's and women's basketball teams each winning their respective Division I championships, something no school had accomplished before. Now Michigan State, with its men's and women's teams both in their respective Final Fours, is hoping to follow in UConn's path. By Jere Longman.

BKN-LAKERS (Los Angeles) -- The Lakers, without Phil Jackson and Shaquille O'Neal but with Kobe Bryant, now seem certain to miss out on the playoffs, one of the more remarkable developments in the 2004-05 NBA season. By Howard Beck.  SOC-VECSEY-COLUMN (Birmingham, Ala.) -- Sports of The Times column: Eddie Johnson lost the thousand-mile stare he wore in the last 15 minutes in Azteca Stadium. Landon Johnson was getting over a dreadful game he played in Europe a month ago. Being home was the operative theme as the United States prepared to play Guatemala in the third of 10 qualifying games this year, in the long road toward the World Cup tournament next year in Germany.

CIRCUITS  (Coded a)  Editors, Circuits stories in The New York Times have moved from their own free-standing section into the Thursday business section. The News Service, however, will continue to budget and distribute these stories in exactly the same way as before, using the same special selector code (tie-z) and the a category code (instead of the usual f for business stories).  In addition, The Times plans to publish special Circuits sections throughout the year, tentatively scheduling eight of them for the remainder of 2005. The News Service will budget and distribute these stories as well.  Two features will be absorbed into other sections and be budgeted and filed as part of these sections: GAME-THEORY becomes a part of the Weekend section and ONLINE-SHOPPING will go to a new weekly Style section. A third feature, DIGITAL-DIARY, is being dropped.  Circuits stories from The New York Times News Service for Thursday, March31.  CIR-CIRCUITS-COLUMN (Undated) -- The weekly State of the Art column: These days, a movie can reach you by pay-per-view, on a plane, at the video store, on a TV movie channel, on the Internet, at the front of a Greyhound bus, in the second row of a minivan or even -- get this -- in a movie theater. Not to seem ungrateful, but none of these delivery mechanisms deliver the holy grail: any movie, any time. There is, however, a low-tech distribution channel that comes pretty darned close: DVD rentals by mail. Seven years ago, Netflix invented the category, the business model and the prepaid, two-way shipping envelope. Now, as nearly 3 million subscribers are helping Netflix hit its profitable stride, Blockbuster and Wal-Mart have entered the market by taking a page from the Netflix playbook. Actually, they've taken pretty much the entire playbook. All three services look and work almost exactly alike. Netflix must be furious. By David Pogue.  CIR-CELLPHONE-FEATURES (Undated) -- In recent years, cellphone makers have tended to view their technologies that millions of people press to their faces every day less as simply phones and more as platforms for a plethora of services and features. Practically each new iteration of cellphone promises more, like digital music, streaming video, 3-D video games, location-based navigation and full Internet browsing -- not to mention a camera. And with more features often come more buttons, complications, costs and thicker operating manuals. Some critics call the phenomenon feature creep. And not all users are happy. By Michel Marriott and Katie Hafner.  CIR-Q&amp;A (Undated) -- Techno questions answered: What an RSS feed is; replacing the rechargeable battery on a Pocket PC; Internet security programs for Windows users. By J.D. Biersdorfer.  CIR-GEEK-NOTES (Undated) -- Techno news and notes:  -- All-in-one home entertainment center package for digital audio and video, for $10,000;  -- M-Audio Trigger Finger, a finger pad peripheral, lets you program and perform percussion and drum parts by drumming your fingers;  -- New cable lets you download photos from camera to photo iPod, bypassing the computer;  -- 3M's blackout privacy technology makes on-screen data visible only to the user; passersby see a black screen;  -- Voice Of The Fan allows ESPN site visitors to create an animated character, then record their rants and raves (about the NCAA basketball tournament, for example) and share them with the millions of others.  HOME  (Coded l)  KIDS-WING (Undated) -- When Ashlee Burt arrives home from school, she goes upstairs to her personal suite on the second floor of her family's spacious Spanish-style home in Saddle River, N.J., where a bedroom, bathroom and sitting room are decked out with all the creature comforts a 15-year old needs. Besides a computer, a television and DVD player, there is a private telephone line. Everything in the suite, including a convertible sofa, is decorated with her favorite jungle theme including zebra stripes and jungle foliage painted onto the walls and ceilings. A bamboo frame bed is covered with an animal print fabric. As the size of the average American house continues to grow, the simple kids room with bunk beds and shelves cluttered with toys and books is morphing into an entire wing or a suite. Like the master suites enjoyed by parents, these kids' quarters often come with a dressing area, a walk-in closet and a space for entertaining -- in this case for sleepovers. By Andree Brooks.  OBRIEN-FABRIC (New York) -- When Louis Comfort Tiffany built his dream estate on Long Island, in the early 1900s, he was so obsessed with the furnishings he did everything short of inventing the glue gun. For the dining room chairs he chose French velvet, dying it in a deep-blue-and-ivory pattern that echoed wisteria growing nearby. The house is long gone, but the Metropolitan Museum of Art plans to bring the dining room back to life for an exhibition next year, using photographs, salvaged fragments and the skills of Kevin O'Brien, a Philadelphia fabric designer, inventor and entrepreneur. O'Brien, 46, has been making unusual fabrics for more than a decade, attracting couturiers like Zac Posen; celebrities like Whoopi Goldberg and stores like Saks, which is carrying his spring line of linen, silk and velvet pillows. By Deborah Baldwin.  ST-LOUIS-PRESERVE (Undated) -- Until it was torn down last month, the neoclassical Century Building in St. Louis, with its 10-storey marble facades accented by ornate friezes and pilasters, graced an entire downtown city block. But after months of protests and lawsuits brought by historic preservationists, the building was razed in February to make way for a parking lot. With its familiar plot and cast of characters -- preservationists squaring off against developers and politicians -- the battle for the Century felt in many ways like a typical preservation dispute. Yet it also had an unusual twist: For what is believed to be the first time, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the nation's most powerful preservation group, sided with the wreckers and helped finance the redevelopment project that led to the Century's demise.

We have ignored the ecosystem of the Mississippi Delta at our peril for more than 100 years, and the situation is much worse because of that, says Vale.

"160478"	"he"	"believes"	" Still, he believes, the air marshals program is nothing more than window dressing. The millions spent on the program would be better used on scrutinizing air cargo more thoroughly, for instance. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"161119"	"he"	"believes"	" Part of the answer, he believes, is to talk about race and equality all the time, not just after a night of violence. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"161718"	"he"	"believes"	" The key, he believes, is to make education relevant to students and to help stem the high dropout rate -- estimated by the district now at about 25 percent -- by reaching struggling students at the critical ninth- and 10th-grade levels. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"161917"	"she"	"believes"	" NABLUS, West Bank - With her textured handbag, heavy mascara, and a veil revealing only her eyes, Alaa Awdeh sounds like the ultimate feminist. Women, she believes, should have equal rights in Palestinian society, especially the right to die in the armed struggle against Israel. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"162279"	"she"	"believes"	" Before long, he was painting Denali scenes across the classroom walls. The largest spreads out in summertime glory, with greens and yellows merging and colliding among wildflowers, benevolent moose and soaring eagles. Thomas isn't surprised. Each child in her small group, she believes, harbors a gift. One is quick at math, another can reel off the actors from every popular movie from the past 10 years. They are also extraordinarily close and communicate through what she calls a vibrational process. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"162508"	"she"	"believes"	" The 34-year-old actress was here to push her new film, which, she believes, is not only a rare look at interracial dating (she never saw last year's abysmal Guess Who) but is also the first studio-backed film starring an African-American woman to be produced, written and directed by women of color. That would be, respectively, Stephanie Allain, who also produced last summer's Hustle &amp; Flow, and Kriss Turner, who writes for Chris Rock's show, Everybody Hates Chris. Director Sanaa Hamri, who is Moroccan, honed her skills directing music videos with Sting, Destiny's Child, Prince, Seal and Mariah Carey. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"162791"	"he"	"believes"	" However, a sanctions regime will likely be imposed, he believes, simply because there is no other way to object to Iran's decisions short of war. But Ikenson warned that sanctions often breed a sense of nationalism and support for the regime in the targeted country. While I believe sanctions are a probability over the next few months, I doubt they will be any more useful than as a means of covering the bases before making the case for war, he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"162898"	"she"	"believes"	" He was my best friend, she said. His killer, she believes, could be getting close to someone else's son, a notion that she says terrifies her. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"163372"	"he"	"believes"	" Then, as fate would have it, Scott's passion for new money was rekindled. This idea, he believes, has the potential to turn many vegetarians into meat lovers and open a whole new market for the beef industry. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"163411"	"he"	"believes"	" Steinbrenner has guaranteed nearly $450 million to those six, but none have won a championship with the Yankees. Clearly, he believes, it is time for them to do that. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"163789"	"he"	"believes"	" That's not the way the vice president of Fathers and Families New York sees it. Randall Dickinson agreed that the law is unevenly weighted, but it is the 2.5 million noncustodial parents and their families in New York who are at risk, he said -- and it's usually men, he believes, who lose access to their children as well as to their money. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164452"	"he"	"believes"	" Nonsense, Parker says. The critics, he believes, have the story entirely backward. He is not the enemy of diversity, but its biggest supporter. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164760"	"she"	"believes"	" That story is repeated across generations of the Goodrich clan. Five of Ada Goodrich's eight children have asthma. So do 17 of her 25 grandchildren. And so does she: Goodrich was hospitalized earlier this month with pneumonia - a complication, she believes, of asthma. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164763"	"she"	"believes"	" Fager has testified before Congress, urging the Federal Communications Commission to enforce regulations against airing indecent material before 10 p.m. That, she believes, is a first step in keeping this material away from children. The FCC has had no response. She is regularly accused of trying to curtail free speech, which she denies, heatedly. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"165724"	"he"	"believes"	" Self, however, won't make any other predictions about the 2006-07 basketball season for the Big 12 Conference. Well, maybe just this: With four new coaches in the league, it's going to be different -- and that, he believes, is good. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"

"166251"	"he"	"believes"	" Lee's senior year is now passing in a high school in a tiny Mississippi town where he saw kids at a bus stop making fun of a girl's looks. He watched, in pain, and later wrote the poem Beautiful because everyone, he believes, is beautiful in some way. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"167029"	"she"	"believes"	" The woman known for her no-nonsense ways - along with a quick and generous smile - says she is no flag-waving hawk. Most wars, she believes, probably weren't necessary, though she suspects some were. She doesn't pretend to be a deep thinker on such matters. She sees war through the prism of her family - the long absences, the worried days, the fear of opening the newspaper. The loss. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"167927"	"he"	"believes"	" Spain's Ferran Adria, the world's most influential chef according to nearly all food media and chefs, seems to agree when he writes ? A product should be touched, turned over, looked at from all angles, as a sushi expert does with a tuna fish. This, he believes, is the fundamental role of the chef. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"168142"	"she"	"believes"	" Some kids just aren't into competitive sports, football, baseball, says Jennifer MacDougall, a recreation consultant in the Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management at N.C. State University. Activities such as skateboarding, BMX biking, rock climbing are all becoming more pervasive, says MacDougall, in part, she believes, because ESPN's X Games has brought to life more options for physical activity. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"168610"	"he"	"believes"	" To Mills the paradox is that his house, he believes, is highly contextual. With its stucco walls that emulate adobe, its palette of earth tones, its exposed timbers and its courtyard plan, he said, it couldn't be in any other city in the world but Santa Fe. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060712.0145 type=story > <HEADLINE> SHRINKING PHOTOS FOR E-MAIL </HEADLINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"
"169044"	"he"	"believes"	" Robinson's future is in the hands of the Nationals' new ownership group. The game has changed; he says he hasn't, contrary to some observations that he has mellowed. He is concerned about the lack of minorities in decision-making positions and the decline in the number of black players, a reflection, he believes, of the need to reach out to the black community. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"

"171085"	"he"	"believes"	" At 36, Biffle has slogged his way to Nextel Cup with a workman's steps, capturing championships in the truck and Busch series, struggling early in his Cup career before becoming a star last season with a series-high six wins. He finished 35 points behind champion Tony Stewart, and to this day is dogged by the thought of a lug nut left loose on his car at Texas with three races left . The mistake forced an extra pit stop and eventually, he believes, cost him the title. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171598"	"he"	"believes"	" And the reason for this, he believes, is that Reds is, in large part, a movie about American politics during wartime, and about the opposition to American hegemony at an earlier stage of its development. The fact that Reed, Bryant and their allies initially come together in opposition to American involvement in World War I -- a war whose motive Reed succinctly identifies as profit -- is something current audiences are likely to notice, and perhaps be provoked by. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"

"172175"	"he"	"believes"	" Mark Tushnet, a professor at Harvard Law School, also sees the new legislation as more sensitive than its predecessors. As a matter of formal constitutional law the threats to civil liberties posed by the military tribunal statute are either small or around the margins, he argues. While language in the law that might apply its provisions to US citizens, he believes, might run into trouble with the Supreme Court, he thinks the rest of it might very well not. For example, it's a matter of real, serious constitutional debate, he argues, whether to admit hearsay evidence in military trials of non-US citizens-as the new statute does-or to extend rights to non-US citizens held by US forces outside the country. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172370"	"she"	"believes"	" With movies, you're always dealing with so much uncertainty, she said during a recent phone interview. The way films are made, she believes, subverts any claims to something as smooth, rhythmic and self-proclaimed as a stride. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"173331"	"she"	"believes"	" It is true, decorating disasters are a subjective matter. The error that makes one person take to her bed may be barely noticed by, say, her partner. Walk into the $4.8-million Greenwich Village home of Rebecca Bond, a marketing consultant who is married to Jonathan Bond, a founder of Kirshenbaum Bond &amp; Partners, an ad agency, and you'll be hard-pressed to see what's wrong with the sofa she pronounced dead on arrival. (The color, she believes, is too dark for the room.) But Bond, who is her own designer, is an admitted perfectionist. Her assistant picked up so many shades of paint for the third floor hall that the salesman at the paint store offered her a free T-shirt. Bond found a wonderful antique sink, in stone, for $700 or $800 on a buying trip to France, but then could not decide on the right place to put it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
