Despite deep fare cuts, the major airlines continue to report sharp drops in passenger traffic. American Airlines said its traffic dropped 9.7 percent in July from July 2001; Continental Airlines' traffic was off 8.6 percent, and Delta Air Lines' was down 6.6 percent _ on systems that are now putting 6 percent to 10 percent fewer seats in the air than this time last year. When they report their July traffic this week, the other major carriers, United Airlines, Northwest Airlines and US Airways, are not expected to buck the dire trend.  Meanwhile, the hotel business also languishes in the doldrums. Occupancy rates at U.S. hotels were off 3.6 percent, to 59.5 percent, in the first half of this year compared with the first half of 2001, according to Smith Travel Research.  PKF Consulting said that hotels experienced an average 19.4 percent decline in profits in 2001. PKF also said that hotels in major cities _ which are typically most dependent on business travel _ had a drop of 9 percent in occupancy rates in the first quarter of 2002.  Hardest hit: San Francisco, where hotel occupancy was off 17.1 percent in the first quarter, compared with drops of 4.9 percent in New York, 13.5 percent in Chicago, 10.2 percent in Los Angeles, 14.5 percent in Boston and 12.5 percent in Dallas.  Any positive news? ``We believe that full-year 2002 industry operating performance will improve slightly versus 2001,'' said Mark Lomanno, the president of Smith Travel Research. Assuming, he hedged, that the economy starts growing and there are no further terrorist calamities.  SOUTHWEST AIRLINES LOWERS SOME FARES  Let the good times roll in Las Vegas. Southwest Airlines last week announced a spate of low fares for travel between Los Angeles and Las Vegas this fall. That is a route, incidentally, that many more people are driving rather than flying these days to avoid airports.  From Sept. 3 through next Jan. 10, one-way fares between Los Angeles and Las Vegas are $19. You read it right, $19. That doesn't include various airport and security fees, which can pile another $17 or so onto that ticket price.  At the same time, feisty little National Airlines is cutting the cost of upgrades to first class on its routes between Las Vegas and any West Coast city it serves, in a bid to attract business travelers and high rollers. First-class upgrades now cost $40 each way on routes between Las Vegas and Los Angeles or San Francisco, and $60 between Seattle and Las Vegas. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020805.0269 type=story > <HEADLINE> UNIVERSITY WARNS THAT INFECTIOUS BODY PARTS MAY HAVE BEEN SHIPPED </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 08-05-02 22:00:00EDT (BC-BODY-PARTS-HNS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
