"28567"	"he"	"raps"	" Shaggy is not like other dancehall reggae artists. On ``Boombastic,'' the top 10 single and title track from his second album, released last week on Virgin records, he raps, ``With my sexual physique, Jah know me well built'' (Jah is short for Jahweh, or God.) The next thing one hears in the song is Shaggy laughing at himself. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"75985"	"he"	"raps"	" He hasn't had to rethink his rap, which always avoided the glamorization of sex and violence endemic to the genre. ``I can't rap about killing people or selling drugs 'cause that's not my reality,'' says O'Neal. On his latest album, he raps, ``I know you're just jealous, but I'll spank on that ass like Monica Seles.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"

"114490"	"he"	"raps"	" On ``One for the Road,'' he lays out his goals and derides some of his peers. In this tongue twister, he raps, ``I'd forgive those who rhyme / To kill the time, while mine cultivates the consciousness / and chill the spine.'' In Green's mind, hip-hop offers too much Nelly and not enough Public Enemy, although he doesn't criticize specific artists. No, he simply states, ``Hip-hop has become heartless, literally. It's almost robotic, no conscience. (That's) amusing and entertaining to begin with, but detrimental in the long run.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
