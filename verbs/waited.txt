Musicland's 9.0 percent junk bonds due in 2003 fell more than 7 percent 37 cents on the dollar. The company, based in Minnetonka, Minnesota, sells pre-recorded home entertainment products.  Looking ahead, Outdoor Systems Inc., a Phoenix-based provider of outdoor advertising, and Goss Graphic System a Westmont, Illinois-based operator of newspaper and other presses., are among lower-rated firms planning to raise money in the junk bond market in coming weeks. Bonds are considered below investment grade, or junk, if they carry ratings below ``Baa3'' by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and ``BBB-'' by Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp.  They typically pay the highest yields because they're considered the riskiest of corporate debt.  Among bonds in the Salomon Brothers indexes, those that pay interest in cash rose an average 17 cents per dollar face amount of bonds; bonds that pay deferred interest rose; bonds of distressed companies rose.  Bonds that pay cash interest rose to 211.40, up from 195.34 at the beginning of the year. Deferred interest bonds rose to 206.76, up from 192.99 at the beginning of the year. Distressed company bonds rose to 102.48, up from 102.26 at the beginning of the year.
