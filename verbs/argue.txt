"1170"	"they"	"argue"	" For one thing, they argue, economic growth is gearing down to an annual rate of 3 percent or so, which is more or less in line with the nation's capacity to expand without suffering production bottlenecks that result in shortages, rising prices and a higher inflation rate. That kind of concern played a role in the Federal Reserve's decision to slow the economy by raising rates, beginning in February. Greenspan indicated in his testimony yesterday that the Fed did not yet know whether the economy had slowed enough to rule out another rise in interest rates. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199407.gz"

"2135"	"they"	"argue"	" That is, there is a segment of society -- reflected by this judge -- which believes that the mother of small children belongs at home with them no matter what extenuating circumstances there might be. Day care is not needed, they argue, if women do as they should and stay home. And, whether elected politicians, judges, or voters, they apply pressure to keep day care opportunities and better pay for providers in check. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199408.gz"
"2221"	"they"	"argue"	" Currently, most of these organizations get discounts from doctors and other medical providers by promising to provide them with a minimum amount of business.

"2385"	"they"	"argue"	" No one is suggesting that animals are just little people with fur or feathers. Instead, they argue, many species give strong indications of possessing self-awareness, awareness of others and a certain degree of foresight and intention, all traits that the orthodox anti-anthropomorphists insist animals do not have.

"27157"	"they"	"argue"	" Redwood immediately conceded defeat, saying Major had won ``fair and square.'' Senior Conservative politicians said the result was a clear victory for Major. Under party rules, Major needed a simple majority of the 329 Conservative legislators, or 165 votes, and 15 percent or 50 votes more than his nearest rival to regain leadership of the U.K.'s ruling Conservative Party and continue as prime minister. On June 22, Major stunned politicians and investors alike by resigning from the leadership of the ruling Conservative Party and sought an open re-election as party leader. His aim was to end three years of party infighting over Europe, in particular whether Britain should persist in leaving open the option of joining a future single European currency. On June 26, John Redwood, an anti-European cabinet minister, resigned from the cabinet to challenge Major declaring immediately that he would never abolish the pound. Superficially, the issue in the leadership election was whether Britain should agree to abolish the pound and adopt a future single European currency. In fact ``euroskeptic'' Conservatives legislators see sterling as a symbol of nationhood whose abolition, they argue, would mean giving up British sovereignty for membership in a European federal superstate dominated by Germany. Redwood's challenge as champion of the ``euroskeptic'' right was just as much a surprise as Major's resignation. The prime minister's principal challengers inside the cabinet have long been identified as Michael Heseltine, the pro-European Trade and Industry Secretary and Michael Portillo, the anti-European Employment Secretary. In the event, neither man so far come forward to challenge Major. Not only did Redwood put Major on the defensive over European policy, he also promised a 5 billion-pound tax cut immediately upon being elected. Major was then forced to concede future tax cuts were probably sending U.K. stock and bond prices lower and driving sterling down on concern that Britain's budget deficit would widen. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"

"27238"	"they"	"argue"	" U.K. Prime Minister John Major named a new cabinet to shore up his Conservative Party's ailing fortunes one day after he won re-election as party leader. Facing an opposition Labour Party riding high in the polls, Major named Michael Heseltine, once a potential contender for his job and a renowned election campaigner, to the new post of deputy prime minister. Major, who must call an election by April 1997 at the latest, also appointed Heseltine as chairman of the important non-Treasury policymaking cabinet committees. With the appointments, Heseltine, a supporter of greater European economic unity who was formerly Trade and Industry Secretary, becomes the virtual public persona for the policies of the government and the Conservative Party. ``This is an important and vital position in running the government and in the presentation of the party,'' said a government official in Major's 10 Downing Street residence. ``This is a new and unique position.'' The prime minister also appointed Malcolm Rifkind, former Defense Secretary, as Foreign Secretary, to replace Douglas Hurd, who announced two weeks ago announced he was retiring from politics. Hurd was an ardent pro-European whereas Rifkind has adopted a more cautious approach to European policy in recent months. Analysts said his appointment may accordingly signal a less hospitable U.K. approach to closer European integration before next year's European inter-governmental conference on union. Major's new cabinet predictably drew a negative reaction from the Labour Party. John Prescott, Labour Deputy Leader, described the new line-up as ``pretty second rate.'' He added: ``It's all about being safe, it won't fizz with new ideas.'' The cabinet shakeup came the day after Major won a leadership election he called two weeks ago to end three years of party infighting over European integration. Major won 66 percent of the votes of the 329 Conservative legislators eligible to vote. His challenger, anti-European John Redwood, won 89 votes and there were eight abstentions, 12 spoiled ballots and two non-appearances. Financial markets reacted positively to the resolution of the uncertainty over Major's party leadership, though many analysts said the new cabinet won't improve the Conservatives' long-term prospects. ``I'm not sure the landscape has changed that much,'' said Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International (Europe). ``The risk of having a Labour government sometime in the near future is still there.'' Major left Kenneth Clarke in the key job of Chancellor of the Exchequer. He also appointed William Waldegrave, a member of the party's center-left wing, to the job of Chief Secretary to the Treasury in charge of public spending. In another move designed to shore up voter support, Major merged the departments of Education and Employment, in line with his longstanding belief that the jobs of the future depend on higher educational standards. Gillian Shephard, former Education Secretary, will head the new department. In a sop to the party's anti-European wing, Michael Portillo was appointed Defense Secretary, a senior cabinet post, though overall Major did little to placate the party's anti-European rightwing, many of whom voted for Redwood. ``This is an obvious attempt to balance the right and the left but this would be viewed as a bit of a shift towards the left,'' said Andrew Milligan, chief economist at New Japan Securities. ``The right doesn't get a lot in this reshuffle.'' Major called the leadership election on June 22 to clear the air and win a ``vote of confidence'' from his parliamentary party after three years of party infighting principally over the European integration issue. Major's position on policies towards European economic and monetary union has been under attack from the anti-European right-wing of the Conservative Party since the British pound was forced out of the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992. Major has refused to rule out future British membership in a future single European currency and that the question might have to be put to a referendum. His gambit was designed to end party infighting over Europe, in particular over whether Britain should persist in leaving open the option of joining a future single European }currency. Superficially, the issue in the leadership election was whether Britain should agree to abolish the pound and adopt a future single European currency. In fact, ``Euro-skeptic'' Conservatives legislators see sterling as a symbol of nationhood whose abolition, they argue, would mean giving up British sovereignty for membership in a European federal superstate dominated by Germany. However, there is little current indication that international investors, who have largely fought shy of U.K. financial markets in the past six months, will be encouraged. ``This will all be forgotten in two weeks,'' New Japan Securities' Milligan said. ``International investors haven't been assuaged.'' </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950705.0217 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-FINANCIAL-NYT-BUDGET) </DATELINE> <TEXT> FOR THURSDAY AMs  Financial stories in sight at this hour from The New York Times News Service for newspapers of THURSDAY, July 6.

"27239"	"they"	"argue"	" Heseltine's appointment is similar to a move by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who made Lord Whitelaw her deputy in the mid-1980's to act as her ``eyes and ears'' in the party. Going on the attack only hours after his appointment, Heseltine rejected Labour Party charges that the new cabinet was a tired team with no new ideas. ``They get up in the morning to create a sound bite,'' he said, referring to the Labour Party. ``You can't run a country on a sound bite.'' The prime minister also appointed Malcolm Rifkind, former Defense Secretary, as Foreign Secretary, to replace Douglas Hurd, who announced two weeks ago announced he was retiring from politics. Hurd was an ardent pro-European whereas Rifkind has adopted a more cautious approach to European policy in recent months.

COX-TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Commentary. To move Thursday.  COX-KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Commentary. To move Thursday.  INTERNATIONAL  COX-RUSSIA-AMERICANS _ MOSCOW _ Cowboy boots on the walls, California burgers, pina coladas. Americans, Europeans and Russians mixing at the bar. Welcome to Moscow 1995 and the American Bar &AMP; Grill _ one of dozens of new western oases that cater to a burgeoning expatriate community and growing Russian wealth. The cafes and shops mirror broadened opportunities that have transfigured lifestyles and made Moscow unrecognizable from its stodgy image of 10, even five, years ago. ``As a westerner, I have access to literally every type of food or commodity that I want _ one, if I have the time to find it, and two, if I'm willing to pay for it,'' said Steven Traylor, a 48-year-old construction engineer, sipping a draft at the bar. Once grudgingly open only to foreign diplomats, journalists or scholars, Russia today is a new frontier where everyone, from evangelists to investors, accountants to eco-activists, is trying to make his mark. There may be as many as 30,000 Americans living here today. A look at their lives. (Kunstel/Albright) With photos. To move Tuesday.  COX-SHEVARDNADZE _ TBILISI, Georgia _ The streets in this violent Caucasus republic are safer to walk. The economy is making a feeble start at recovery. The Russian bear has had his paw slapped. The beginnings of statehood here are the doing largely of Eduard Shevardnadze, the leader who even his friends worry has resorted to autocratic means to accomplish democratic ends. ``I think sometimes he plays not according to the rules. But do the the people against him play by the rules?'' asked Alexander Rondeli, a Shevardnadze advisor and professor of international relations. After detaining much of his political opposition in jail _ following an attempt on his life _ Shevardnadze feels secure enough to leave the country in the weeks leading up to Nov. 5 elections to address the United Nations, meet with President Clinton in New York on Tuesday and to huddle with congressional and administration officials in Washington. (Kunstel/Albright) To move Thursday.  Eds: Photo possible.  COX-MIDEAST-ECONOMY _ JERUSALEM _ The promise of profits has helped fuel the Middle East peace process. But economic gains have been stymied by the political bottlenecks in the emerging peace between Israelis, Palestinians and Jordanians. Political and business leaders from Israel and the Arab world will gather in Amman, Jordan, on Oct. 28 for a four-day conference, only the second of its kind to map a strategy of economic cooperation. The main goal of the Israelis is to convince Arabs that its already hearty economy won't dwarf its neighbors once trade is opened. (Holmes) To move Wednesday.  COX-POCAHONTAS _ GRAVESEND, England _ Add a legendary American Indian princess to an English town with a death-knell name and the result is one of the most improbable, and forgotten, fragments in Anglo-American history. Pocahontas _ the 17th century Indian princess, not the new Walt Disney film _ is buried on the grounds of St. George's Church in Gravesend, a Thames River town about 20 miles southeast of London. Her remains are thousands of miles from her tribal birthplace in what became Virginia. (Salome) To move Tuesday. With photos.  DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (i) international and (e) entertainment categories.  WASHINGTON  COX-POWELL-ADVISERS _ WASHINGTON _ Colin Powell has lots of friends, but does he have any advisers? It's hard to know who the former Joint Chiefs chairman is turning to - if anyone - for advice as he ponders whether to seek the presidency. This story will look at who _ other than his wife and kids _ is whispering in Powell's ear. (Shepard). Reskedded from last week.  COX-CPI _ WASHINGTON _ On the plus side, fiddling with the Consumer Price Index could save the federal government $281 billion over the next seven years. On the minus side, that would cost the average Social Security recipient more than $2,800. Veterans, disabled people and retired military and civil servants whose pensions and benefits are tied to the CPI would suffer similar losses. Taxpayers whose personal exemptions and tax brackets are tied to the CPI would also pay a little more in taxes. But some leaders in Congress believe that such changes would be less painful than the other cuts Congress contemplates as it tries to balance the federal budget within the next seven years. Besides, they argue, for years those recipients and taxpayers have been getting more than they should have. Their reasoning: Because the CPI measures price changes, not the cost of living, it goes up faster than the cost of living _ which should be the real basis for annual adjustments in benefits and tax rates. (Mollison)  COX-CPI-DATA _ How much the federal government would save and how much the average Social Security recipient would lose if Congress accepts an advisory ucommission's recommendation to base future cost-of-living adjustments on the CPI increase, minus one percentage point.

WELLS _ Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. made an unsolicited offer to buy First Interstate Bancorp for about $10.8 billion in stock, seeking to form a banking powerhouse covering much of the western U.S. The acquisition would be one of the biggest U.S. bank mergers, second only to the planned $11.4 billion combination of Chemical Banking Corp. and Chase Manhattan Corp. announced in August.

SOMEBODY GET HIM A HOBBY! Hal Davis, the most dangerous editor at National Law Journal (hdavisljextra.com) since he got his Internet log-on, found and forwarded this:  ``Wouldn't the sentence `I want to put a hyphen between the words Fish and And and And and Chips in my Fish-And-Chips sign' have been clearer if quotation marks had been placed before Fish, and between Fish and and, and and and And, and And and and, and and and And, and And and and, and and and Chips, as well as after Chips?''  Address replies to Hal directly.  ALL RIGHT, WE'LL DO IT, BUT WE YANKS ARE STILL GOING TO MISS THOSE KICKY LITTLE U'S IN `NEIGHBOUR.' A dialogue uncovered in the Usenet news group alt.english.usage:  Elliot (mppe4central.susx.ac.uk): ``English is spoke in England. That's why it's called English. The term `British English' is a pathetic nonsense.''  Richard Kaulfuss (dkaulfboehme.demon.co.uk): ``Though not very well, apparently. In fact you're wrong. If anything, the converse is more likely to be true. If you took your head out of the sand for a little while, you would realise that English is no longer a single language (not that it ever was), but a family, and British/Australian/Indian/Black/Scots English are all perfectly valid descriptions of members of that family. Like it or not, American English will be the undisputed world standard within the next 50 years, if it isn't already, and all other varieties will be described with reference to it.''  Rex Knepp (kneppstarbase.neosoft.com): ``Shouldn't you be speaking United-Kingdomish then, Elliot?''  Peter Drew (petedrewinnotts.co.uk) of Franchlodin Petkats, Nottingham (!): ``I always speak in United Kingdom Of Great British And Northern Irish. I think you'll find that infinitely more intelligible than United Kingdom Of Not-So-Good British And Southern Irish.''  IN FLUSHING, N.Y., NEARLY EVERYBODY READS The Flushing Tribune.  FOUND IN THE CARBONS BIN. Here is an excerpt from News From the Net, the Chief Copyboy's other column on the New York Times News Service, the most noble wire service of them all. This column should appear in every English-language newspaper in the world before all our most literate readers abandon us entirely in favor of something cybernetically satisfying:  ``It's just like real life. On the Internet, women are a recurring subject of conversation, if not a standing reason for a bar brawl.  ``This bugs women.  ``They don't like being hit on, put down or held up to ridicule on the `Net. When they post a comment in any of the thousands of Usenet newsgroups, they hate to read condescending drivel from some male geek, or get sexual propositions from a dozen of them. Women don't like men who log on with female- sounding names to tease other men, or to try to worm into women's on-line discussions.  ``It keeps many women from logging on at all. How many? Who knows? But most estimates put the male-to-female on-line ratio at about 7-to-3, 6-to-4, around there.  ``So women probably will welcome Judith Broadhurst's new book, `The Woman's Guide to Online Services' (McGraw-Hill, $19.95), a primer for computer users who reason without the X chromosome. It covers all the standard how-tos, with tips on hardware and on-line services, and many special forums and services for women.  ``Stacy Horn, founder of a woman's on-line service called Echo in New York (information via e-mail at echo(at)echonyc.com), says it thus:  `` `If you're not wired or in some way reachable by e-mail, you're going to fall out of so many information loops that are available online. You used to have to go to luncheons and cocktail parties to network. Now you have to be online.' ''  And: (Subhed) Calling the law  ``Keyboard cruisers don't have to give up their legalese, even if they miss Murder One over on the house's conventional screen. Misc.legal is a group for posting questions of law, answering same, and arguing the herein aforementioned. And many of the contributors are lawyers or know what they're talking about.  ``Someone borrowed your car, dinged something, fled the scene, and now it's back in your driveway and there's a gas- masked officer talking to you from behind the ring of cruisers through a bullhorn? Probably too late for Usenet to be useful, but you should see how steamed the (group's other) contributors are, arguing about that multimillion-dollar McDonald's hot-coffee verdict.''  Thus endeth the excerpt. Editors don't need the gift of prophecy to see the advantage of regularly reading thousands of discussion forums, advice columns, political debates and bulletin boards. Our former readers certainly are going to Usenet. If you're not already a client of NYTNS, contact author Charley Stough at addresses below for special arrangements.  OOPS, HOLIDAY GIFT TIME AGAIN. Where do those calendar pages go? Well, there's still plenty of time to get examples of those BONG Collection typewriter-jewelry goodies. When you give presents to people, they owe you presents back, see, and the return volley will certainly be worth more than these:  Earrings or tie tacks/lapel pins, $12.50.

The Further Adventures of Herman ``Speed'' Graphic, ace photographer for the Chagrin Falls Commercial Scimitar, and his Faithful Companion, Typo the Wonder Pig.  PANEL ONE: Doffing his trenchcoat, a deathbed gift from an ancient mystic wire service executive editor on a fog-shrouded eastern island, Speed takes his place next to Typo in front of the Photo Lab computer terminal. Typo greets him warmly, ``Great staff-meeting outburst, Boss! I'm already pulling in the scoring!''  PANEL TWO: Typo reports, ``OK, Layout Desk. The comment is Colorful display 3.7, vocabulary 4.3, startle quotient 4.9! Good score, Boss!' ''  Speed remarks, ``Well, I gave it all I had, but they're easy! What about the News Desk?''  PANEL THREE: Typo declares, ``Here they are now, Boss! Inspired use of prop, drop-kicking lectern over meeting table, 4.89 points! Cocoa spillage by visiting graphics consultant, a full Five for Secondary Effect! This is historic, Boss!''  Speed observes modestly, ``Yeah, but News desk guys are so impressionable! Why, at staff meetings back during the Streaking Craze ... !''  PANEL FOUR: Typo gasps, ``The big one, Boss! Features Desk, inventors of the Career-Enhancing Tantrum, announce ... Piercing Shriek, 5.0! Shredding Tearsheets, 5.0! Chandelier as Trapeze, 5.0! ... And finally, Technical Points ...! What, Boss? Only a 2?!''  INTERPANEL BOX: Speed growls, ``The fix is in.''  PANEL FIVE: Sitting safely on the ledge outside the 8th-floor photo lab window, Speed reviews the critique sheet, grumbling, ``Technical! Just because I was trying to get a 7-column photo on a 6-column page! It's the old built-in prejudice against picture people! Those word guys get all the breaks!''  Typo remonstrates, ``Aw, Boss, think of the good side! Features Editor Hyperba Lee can't stay hysterical forever, and a good tantrum raises morale in the whole newsroom! And besides, to replace the movie reviewer you gotta win best-of-five tantrums anyway!''  A connoisseur of great insubordinations, BONG Chief Copyboy Charley Stough, Dayton Daily News, 45 S.

"39649"	"they"	"argue"	" Some anthropologists, meanwhile, don't want to see remains returned to the soil, when scientific analysis could yield valuable information.

"39881"	"they"	"argue"	" Hydrogen advocates concede that the fuel ignites at a relatively low temperature and spreads quickly. But, they argue, because it is so light, disperses quickly, and releases only half the heat that burning gasoline does, it is far less dangerous than gasoline. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"
"40774"	"they"	"argue"	" They hooted loudly at Symington's effrontery, just as they do at Arpaio, and chalked it up to an itch to divert attention from his personal financial problems (at an estimated state cost of $10,000). After all, they argue, one doesn't tweak the federal government's nose _ and win. It isn't . . . well, uh, it just isn't done in polite circles. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"
"40953"	"they"	"argue"	" To many in state politics, Pataki's failure to capture New York's attention is no accident; rather, they argue, it reflects a strategic decision to minimize the risks of making bold policy changes with uncertain consequences. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"
"40954"	"they"	"argue"	" Environmentalists contend that the office represents a furtive effort to give businesses more input into the rule-making process, and ordinary citizens less. Moreover, they argue, the governor has used it to rewrite the state's regulatory philosophy without making the case to the public. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"
"41959"	"they"	"argue"	" Conservatives also are blaming government for America's low savings rate and the feeble growth in charitable giving. If only government would cut taxes, they argue, people would give more to charity and save more for retirement. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"

"42157"	"they"	"argue"	" The football players and the Clinton Justice Department, however, argue that multi-employer groups should lose their antitrust exemption when bargaining ends and an impasse has been declared.

"42472"	"they"	"argue"	" But some groups say Brazil should keep the national security portion and kill the environmental piece.

"42526"	"they"	"argue"	" Republicans counter by saying that US troops will be in danger, and it will be very hard to leave as planned in one year if the Bosnian government does not have a well-trained and equipped army.

"43266"	"they"	"argue"	" He and other Toyota executives said the new Corolla offered better mileage and a roomier interior than the old one.

"43342"	"they"	"argue"	" Using historical tax rates may be deceptive as well. Current rates are more reflective of what future liabilities will be, they argue, and today's top individual rate of 39.6 percent is much lower than the 50 percent to 70 percent rates that prevailed from 1963 to 1986. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
"44145"	"they"	"argue"	" To some analysts, however, the experience of the recent past has stretched that rule to the limit.

"44146"	"they"	"argue"	" Sinai and others find that forecast implausible, in large measure, they argue, because labor is getting more than government statistics _ or Roach _ suggest.

"44709"	"they"	"argue"	" The fact is that on Whitewater, Madison and the Foster suicide, critical parts of the paper trail are missing. Last summer, White House lawyers showered the committee with 35,000 pages of remaining documents. This material, they argue, proves that the Clintons were passive investors in Whitewater and clears them of charges that they improperly benefited from their ties to McDougal and, in return, used their influence to prop up his savings and loan. As 1995 drew to a close, the White House also brandished a report prepared for the Treasury Department that reached the same conclusion. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"

"46686"	"they"	"argue"	" Indeed, a growing number of mostly liberal intellectuals are making just that argument. They agree with Samuelson that things are pretty good _ though primarily in social terms (racial equality, the environment, care for the elderly). But while Samuelson says life would get even better if government stepped aside, the ``new Progressives'' arguing for creative government solutions _ which, they argue, got us here in the first place _ march on. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"

By Elaine Sciolino.  YUGOSLAVIA-SAUDIS (Washington) _ Following up on reports that Saudi Arabia provided arms to Bosnians, with U.S. acquiescence. By Steven Engelberg.  CHINA-RAMPAGE (Fuyang, China) _ Here in Zhejiang Province, where the future looks as bright as anywhere in China, it came as quite a shock when about 10,000 residents went on a rampage last fall, smashing, looting and burning their way through the city after the municipal authorities shut down a city-run lottery three days earlier than expected. City officials are still puzzled. Foreign Journal by Patrick Tyler.  NATIONAL (These stories will move with an `a' category)  MIDWEST-WEATHER (Chicago) _ In Minnesota and Wisconsin, the cold _ not snow or ice _ has closed schools for thousands of children, a state of emergency has been declared in parts of Louisiana and Arkansas because of snow and ice, and crops are endangered in Texas because of the cold.

FEMINIST-EXPO (Washington) _ Leaders of the first feminist exposition, meeting here this weekend, say key objectives are maintaining affirmative action programs and redefining the budget battle as a gender issue because, they argue, women and children and families get the short end of the stick from the Republican proposals. By Karen De Witt.  IOWA-CAMPAIGN (Des Moines) _ The conventional wisdom, ever since Jimmy Carter, has been that organization is the key to Iowa. By that standard, Dole and Gramm should be far out front. But the Forbes blietzkrieg is throwing the conventional wisdom on its head. By R.W.

"47935"	"they"	"argue"	" Yet many historians assert that complete objectivity is a fallacy. There is no real way, they argue, to present an object purely as an object.

"49314"	"they"	"argue"	" As Dole and his strategists prepared themselves for an indecisive result in New Hampshire, they signaled they were resigning themselves to a war of attrition.

"49805"	"they"	"argue"	" Warner-Jenkinson is supported by a group of high-technology companies, including Intel Corp. and Seagate Technology Inc. They say companies need to know ahead of time what a patent covers, so they can design competing products without breaking the law.

Times News Service  Albert Speer: His Battle With Truth By Gitta Sereny. Vintage, $18. The author writes that Speer was the lone man in Hitler's inner circle to wrestle with his conscience. But she also demonstrates that Speer was dishonest with others and probably himself over just how much he knew. ``The effect is stunning, a veritable `Rashomon' of Nazi genocide,'' Claudia Koonz wrote here in 1995.  Atticus By Ron Hansen. Harper Perennial, $12. In a kind of contemporary retelling of the parable of the prodigal son, Atticus, an aging former rancher, enjoys a Christmas visit from his younger child, Scott, a dissolute painter. Soon after, he is informed of Scott's suicide in Mexico. Although Atticus' own investigation reveals that the death was a murder, this novel is less a mystery than an exploration of motive and identity. ``Mr. Hansen writes vigorously, and like an angel,'' our reviewer, Janet Burroway, said last year. The same publisher has also reissued two of the author's earlier works.  The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford ($12) depicts the moral ambivalence of James and the peculiar relationship he had with Ford, a sycophant who ultimately killed him. The evocation of their eerie partnership is ``vivid and sustained,'' David Freeman wrote in these pages in 1984. The Old West is also the setting for Desperadoes ($12), which centers on the exploits of the Dalton gang, peace officers turned murderous rustlers. The novel opens in 1937 as the Daltons' last survivor mulls over their past, which Hollywood is about to re-create. ``The writing is so accomplished and the book has such an authoritative tone that one finds it difficult to think of this as a first novel,'' Jerome Charyn said in the Book Review in 1979.  Lewis Carroll: A Biography By Morton N. Cohen. Vintage, $17. The author of so much immortal nonsense was also a brilliant mathematician and a religious man who condemned himself for sinning. But Cohen believes that whatever Carroll's feelings were, his behavior toward children was innocent. This book is ``entertaining and convincing,'' Peter Ackroyd wrote here in 1995. Carroll's talent for satire is itself parodied in Dreamhouse, by Alison Habens (Picador USA, $14). In this wry updating of ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,'' a heroine named Celia eats drug-tainted tarts and has an identity crisis. Last year our reviewer, Lisa Zeidner, said, ``There's a genuine pleasure to be had in thrusting cross-dressers, hip-hop and the feminist rhetoric of date rape into last century's story.''  Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation By Laura Silber and Allan Little. Penguin, $12.95. Two British journalists use detailed interviews and documentation to show that the Serbian president, Slobodan Milosevic, deliberately started the bloody Balkan conflict. Europe also bears responsibility, they argue, for prematurely recognizing Croatia. Their book ``is one of the finest volumes to come out of the war,'' Chris Hedges wrote in these pages in 1996.  The moral aspects of the devastation are the focus of Love Thy Neighbor: A Story of War, by Peter Maass (Vintage, $13). The author condemns the West for not aiding the victims of ethnic cleansing; at the same time, he emphasizes that the Serbs' behavior exemplified capacities of which we cannot conveniently absolve ourselves. He ``sees all this, feels it deeply and conveys it beautifully,'' Brian Hall said in the Book Review last year.  Blackwater By Kerstin Ekman. Translated by Joan Tate. Picador USA, $15. This novel revolves around a murder in the Scandinavian wilderness, but, like ``Smilla's Sense of Snow,'' it deals with more: the destruction of the environment, the wounds of history and the complexities of the heart. It is ``a rich adventure, the kind of long, lush, thoughtful page-turner many of us crave but rarely get our hands on,'' Beverly Lowry wrote here last year.  The Myth Of Wild Africa: Conservation Without Illusion By Jonathan S. Adams and Thomas O. McShane. University of California, $14.95. The authors' thesis is that endangered animals cannot be saved unless the needs of the people who live among them are also considered. With more incentives, they write, local Africans might help more species. ``The authors . . . make the complexity of the continent, its ecosystems and its political problems abundantly clear,'' our reviewer, Robert S. O. Harding, said in 1992.  The difficulties of conservation also emerge in Of Tigers and Men: Entering the Age of Extinction, by Richard Ives (Avon, $12.50). Written by a naturalist who journeyed through Asia to see a tiger in the wild, the book is an elegy for a vanishing world. It ``is a poignant inquiry into the place of man and nature,'' Raymond Bonner wrote in the Book Review last year.  Toward Amnesia By Sarah Van Arsdale. Riverhead, $11. A marine biologist reacts to the end of her long affair with another woman by pursuing oblivion _ even to the point of moving to a faraway island and assuming a new identity. ``The novel comes to life when Ms. Van Arsdale turns her observant eye to the narrator's clumsy bumps into the real world,'' Susannah Hunnewell said in these pages in 1996. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19970303.0394 type=story > <HEADLINE> COUPLE MAY WANT TO MODERATE STOCK POSITIONS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-FINANCE-HOOKER-BOS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199703.gz"

Yet things may be changing. Hundreds of brown pelicans are swarming around the point and its little offshore rock islands, raising hope that the remarkable seabird knocked back by the pesticide DDT will once again return to mate, build nests and hatch young in Central California.

Some people collect artistic figural frogs, which are shaped like animals or have a statue rising out of the center. Bathing beauty flower frogs (of women in swimsuits) were made in Germany in the 1920s. English Glass frogs produced in the 1920s and '30s were Britain's answer to American Depression Glass.

SPORTS (``s'' category)  OLY-WOMEN-DISCUS (Sacramento, Calif.) _ There is an elegance to the women's discus throw that often gets lost in the swirl of activity in most track meets. At the U.S. Olympic Track &AMP; Field Trials, UCLA's Seilala Sua threw a near American record throw of 216 feet, 2 inches. By JOHN CRUMPACKER.  FBN-NINERS (Stockton, Calif.) _ When John Milem was a Marine recruit, his drill instructor at Parris Island (S.C.) would make the young man get on his knees. Then the sergeant would stand on Milem's footlocker. All this so the DI could look down on him. Milem is a 6-foot-9, 290-pound defensive end in 49ers training camp, a tough former barroom bouncer who looks like your average Marine _ only bigger and stronger. By BRUCE ADAMS.  POLO-CLUB (Saratoga Springs, N.Y.) _ The new owner of Saratoga Polo Club is investing $1.5 million in improvements and charging significantly more for memberships to raise Saratoga polo to a world-class level. ``We're hoping to attract the best teams in the country, as well as from abroad,'' said polo pioneer William Ylvisaker, former chairman of the U.S. Polo Association. By DENNIS YUSKO.  COMMENTARY (``k'' category)  MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ If you're of a certain age, you probably remember your first flight on an airliner as fondly as I do. Getting there was more than half the fun, and unlike ocean liners, you got there quickly with no boring shuffleboard. By ROB MORSE.  SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ The subject has replaced all others in my circle of friends and acquaintances. Finances, kids, spouses, partners, religion and politics all take a backseat to Topic A: Forgetting. By STEPHANIE SALTER.  TOBACCO-DEATH (San Francisco) _ On Friday, a Miami jury gave its verdict in a class action suit against the tobacco industry, the first to go to trial: a $145 billion judgment for the plaintiffs. At last I'd have someone to blame for my father's youthful death three decades ago. By LYSSA FRIEDMAN.  LITERARY-WARS (San Francisco) _ In the art of betrayal, writers have it made. Instead of going to jail for assault and battery, they get to splatter blood all over the page, which then becomes the hot item of the week to read, followed by TV appearances which enhance the stature of the writer. Best of all, the writer gets paid for the hit job.

GRIZZLY-WARS _ If wildlife advocates and federal biologists have their way, Ol' Silvertip -- the grizzly bear -- will soon start a slow march through the Bitterroot Mountains, jump-started by a proposed government program to inject captured bears back into this former home range. That prospect puts many area residents on the battlements of yet another campaign in the ongoing Western war over endangered species. Photos, graphic. About 2,300  DRUGCO-DISTRUST _ To an extent, the heated rhetoric labeling drug makers as price gougers and profiteers reflects election-year politics. But politicians, consumer advocates and health-care experts say growing distrust of pharmaceutical companies may keep them on the defensive well beyond the November elections. Drug makers say they are misunderstood.

COMMENTARY  A NATION OF ERIN BROCKOVICH WANNABES: CORPORATE LIABILITY IN USA  LAWSUIT-CRAZY-USA-ECONOMIST  Most Americans say they hate lawyers. In America, even some lawyers say they hate lawyers. But everybody prefers lawyers to evil blood-sucking corporations. This love-hate relationship is a national obsession, but using the law to bash business can get out of hand. At its best, America's corporate-liability regime encourages companies to serve the public better. At its worst, though, it fails to spur good conduct and merely transfers wealth from taxpayers and consumers to lawyers, and often resembles legalized extortion.  (ATTN: Commentary Editors)  (800 words)  NATO INFIGHTING: HEY, THE ENEMY'S OUT THERE, BOYS  NATO-IMPLODES-ECONOMIST  If there could ever be a good moment for Europeans and Americans to relish another Balkan imbroglio, the current fighting by ethnic-Albanians attempting to destabilize Macedonia is not it. Even if they squeeze safely past this new Balkan danger, will the EU's ambitions to carry more weight in the world, and George W. Bush's ambivalence about matters abroad, help Europe and America pull together, or pull apart?  (ATTN: Commentary Editors)  (950 words)  IS THE WORLD HEADING FOR ITS FIRST GLOBAL RECESSION?  GLOBAL-RECESSION?-ECONOMIST  Last year, the world economy enjoyed spectacular growth of almost 5 percent _ its fastest for 16 years. This year it looks much less buoyant. America and Japan, the two biggest economies, accounting for 46 percent of world output, are both teetering on the brink of recession. Stock markets almost everywhere are tumbling. Is the world heading into recession?  (ATTN: Commentary Editors)  (1,025 words)  U.N. MEMBERS SHOULD CENSURE CHINA. EU HYPOCRITES WON'T  SPINELESS-EU-CHINA-ECONOMIST  Those who prefer quiet diplomacy to the megaphone kind often argue that shouting at the Chinese government about the way it treats its people is counterproductive. Far better, they argue, to work with the Chinese, not against them. The trouble with this approach is that it does not seem to be working. So the Americans have this year, at last, tabled a motion of censure at the annual meeting of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. And once again, Europe has chosen the spineless option.  (ATTN: Commentary Editors)  (700 words)  CAN CAVALLO LOOSEN ARGENTINA'S ECONOMIC STRAITJACKET?  DEBT-FRETS-ARGENTINA-ECONOMIST  It is fitting that Domingo Cavallo should have been drafted this week as Argentina's new economy minister _ the third person to hold that job this month. He is now seen as the only man capable of maintaining the currency-board system that he set up a decade ago. Not only has the device killed hyperinflation; for much of the 1990s, it delivered strong growth. But Argentina's economy has now been locked in a recession for almost three years; the currency board has become a straightjacket. So what can Cavallo do?  (ATTN: Commentary Editors)  (775 words)  INDIA'S SCANDAL PROVES INTERNET IS CHANGING POLITICS  CYBER-WHISTLEBLOWERS-ECONOMIST  Bangaru Laxman, the president of the main party in India's ruling coalition, made several mistakes. One was to accept some money that looked very much like a bribe. Another was to take it without checking the credentials of those who offered it. But Laxman also had bad luck. His temptation took place in the Internet age, when not all journalists are constrained by lumbering technology and nervous proprietors. Clearly, the Internet is opening up government everywhere to scrutiny on a scale that has never been seen before.  (ATTN: Commentary Editors)  (675 words)  USA  SEATTLE: BOEING, BOEING...GONE  BOEING-BYEBYE-SE-ECONOMIST  SEATTLE _ Despite the arrival of Microsoft, Amazon and Starbucks, Seattle is inextricably linked with one company: Boeing. With 80,000 employees in the area and one of the best-known names in the world (to Seattle, Coca-Cola is merely a giveaway refreshment on a 747), Boeing has given the city an economic engine and civic identity. So the announcement on March 21 by Boeing's boss that the company was moving its corporate headquarters out of Seattle was a shock far more devastating than the real earthquake that struck three weeks ago.  (ATTN: SEATTLE...and Commentary Editors)  (500 words)  FOOT-IN-MOUTH DISEASE STRIKES BUSH'S FINANCE TEAM  (UNDATED) _ In Washington, it is never too early to start claiming credit or apportioning blame. Under Bill Clinton, the Democrats said that they had built ``a new economy'' long before the numbers hinted that one might actually exist. Now the two political parties are blaming one another for a recession that hasn't arrived yet. The cynical ``who lost the economy?'' debate might be written off as just another political game. But it matters, not least because it raises early questions about President Bush and his economic team.  (ATTN: Commentary Editors)  (1,050 words)  `ROMANCE IN A BOTTLE' HAS SOUTHERN BELLES SWOONING  EROTIC-TONIC-ECONOMIST  LITTLE ROCK _ Something strange has been happening in Little Rock. Women from around the South have been descending on Arkansas's state capital and making their way to the Wycoff Coffee House. The reason is Niagara _ a blue fizzy Swedish tonic, for which the Wycoff's owner, Lari Williams, is the sole American distributor. It is not unusual for her to find a line of frenzied Southern belles lined up outside the glass door of the Wycoff to buy the herbal drink. Why? Because it is ``romance in a bottle'' _ a passion potion that reportedly possesses an erotic recipe to make women's _ and some men's _ libidos soar to new heights.  (ATTN: Little Rock, Ark....and Southern Editors)  (450 words)  USS GREENEVILLE RAISES QUESTIONS OF MILITARY ACCOUNTABILITY  GREENEVILLE-GUILT-ECONOMIST  WASHINGTON _ The United States may increasingly have to live with the prospect of non-American authorities becoming involved when its troops are accused of wrongdoing in far-flung parts of the world. But some sensitive test-cases could arise if the United States sticks by Bill Clinton's commitment to join an international criminal court. Under the proposed ICC rules, countries will be safe from prosecution by the court if, and only if, they are seen to be conducting their own investigation into alleged atrocities by their troops. But what if America's armed forces were ever accused of failing to investigate their own misdeeds in a convincing way? Should that happen, America might find itself hauled before the ICC for war crimes.  (ATTN: Commentary Editors)  (825 words)  EUROPE  FROM MILOSEVIC TO MONARCHY?  SERB-MONARCHY?-ECONOMIST  CACAK, SERBIA _ ``A modern monarchy for a modern Serbia.'' It is in those rather paradoxical terms that Velimir Ilic, the burly provincial mayor who masterminded last year's uprising against Slobodan Milosevic, imagines the future of his country. For the majority of Serbs struggling to scrape a living and fretting about the violence on their country's southern fringe, the restoration of the Karadjordjevic dynasty, deposed after the Second World War, is not the most urgent priority. But not so in the town of Cacak, whose mayor and citizens spearheaded the storming of the Belgrade parliament last October. If they have their way, Serbia will go from a Milosevic autocracy to a constitutional monarchy.  (400 words)  INTERNATIONAL  SINCE CIVIL WAR, SUDAN'S NUBA HAVE GONE BACK IN TIME  `STONE-AGE'-SUDAN-ECONOMIST  IUWIRI, SUDAN _ Since the civil war began 17 years ago, the Nuba Mountains in central Sudan have been going back in time. Even ``back to the Stone Age,'' says Daniel Kodi, a Nuba native and founding member of the rebel Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA). When the Nuba threw their lot with the SPLA in 1985, the government imposed a stifling blockade. Despite the largest humanitarian airlift in history, little aid now gets to the Nuba. The government does not let food into areas it is trying to capture from the rebels _ and the Nuba Mountains is one such area.  (525 words)  ASIA  DOING BUSINESS IN DANANG  VIETNAM-BIZ-LIFE-ECONOMIST  DANANG _ If you go to Cong's pavement cafe in Danang, you may have to hang on tightly to your seat. The police, you see, come by almost every other day to enforce their ban against street cafes _ by taking whatever furniture they can lay their hands on. When Cong sees them coming, he simply throws all his plastic chairs and tables into the river, which runs alongside. Later he jumps in to retrieve them. ``The police are afraid to go in,'' he laughs. Such is business life in Vietnam. But as the state continues to reduce its role in the economy, people are gaining more latitude to do as they please, even in areas far removed from the hustle and bustle around Ho Chi Minh City.  (525 words)  BUSINESS  COMING SOON TO A SCREEN NEAR YOU: A REVAMPED PC OPERATING SYSTEM  REVAMPED-PC-SYSTEMS-ECONOMIST  (UNDATED) _ Coming soon to a screen near you: a revamp for your computer's operating system. Microsoft's new Windows XP, announced in February, will come as standard on almost all new PCs by the second half of the year. Yet although it has 92 percent of the market, Windows does not quite rule the desktop. On March 24, Apple launches the latest version of its operating system for Macintosh computers, Mac OS X (pronounced ``oh-ess-ten''), which it hopes will boost the Mac's market share above its current measly 4 percent. Both firms hope that their new operating systems will boost sales of new computers, and breathe some life into the ailing PC industry.  (800 words)  `I'M READY FOR MY PICKET LINE, MR. DEMILLE'  STRIKES-TINSELTOWN-ECONOMIST  LOS ANGELES _ Hollywood is in its most self-congratulatory mood at Oscar time. But after the awards have been handed out on March 25 and the champagne corks have stopped popping, Tinseltown has to roll up its sleeves quickly and get back to business. A series of strikes threatened by writers and actors could shut down most of the movie-making industry. It could be a long, bitter and crippling battle, the effects of which could last far longer than any strike. Indeed, if a strike did drag on, the only Oscar to be awarded in 2002 could be for ``Best Foreign Film.''  (TIMELY for Sunday's Academy Awards, March 25!)

"89384"	"they"	"argue"	" In some of the studies of America, Finke and Stark treated Catholics differently from followers of other faiths. Critics have called this statistical sleight of hand. But the pair said that as a tightly knit, often persecuted minority _ at least in the 19th century _ Catholics did not take part in the same economic market as Protestants. Finke and Stark often focus on 19th-century America because the important issue, they argue, is whether having one, two or three churches makes a difference. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200103.gz"
"89609"	"they"	"argue"	" But there is a minority of economists who think that the economy will fall into a recession. They argue that the recent surge in company layoffs is a sign that the fallout from the economic slowdown is beginning to reach workers, after having already cut sharply into corporate earnings. As more workers are laid off, they argue, consumer spending will shrink and the economy will slow further. And this means corporate earnings could continue declining in the third and fourth quarters, a fact, they say, that is not reflected in current stock prices. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200103.gz"
"89744"	"they"	"argue"	" The stability of southeastern Europe, which includes the economically and politically precarious Macedonia, is largely dependent on a rebound in Yugoslavia, administration officials assert.

"91789"	"they"	"argue"	" For the Stitzes, though, it was neither quick nor inexpensive nor, they argue, fair. They have exerted more energy challenging the arbitration process itself than making their legal case, they say, at a cost of more than $100,000.

Times Week in Review for Sunday, June 3, moved Saturday.  (Editors: All clients receive all budgets, but only full-service clients receive all stories. Please check your level of service to determine which stories you will receive.)  On the dress page:  RACE-CENSUS-REVIEW (Washington) _ The apportionment of political power on the basis of population, the use of race in the drawing of legislative districts and racial bloc voting have prompted people to inflate their numbers. Or at least fear their dilution. That was why several civil rights groups and the Congressional Black Caucus opposed allowing people to choose more than one race on the 2000 census. But when the politics of racial numbers ran headlong into the desire of interracial couples to not have their children be forced to choose one race, the result was a Solomonic decision that may give a distorted picture of the nation's racial landscape. By Steven A. Holmes. (Moved in the `a' category)  RACE-PROFILING-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ The growing national crusade against racial profiling is being called the civil rights movement of this generation. Polls have shown that a majority of Americans believe profiling is widespread, and an even greater majority disapprove of it. Yet throughout the country, the evidence for its existence is largely anecdotal. For that reason, the first wave of legislation and public policy initiatives designed to address the problem focus on the collection of data intended to substantiate allegations of racial bias in policing. By Gregory Rodriguez. (Moved in the `a' category)  BRITAIN-RACE-REVIEW (Oldham, England) _ Two things were striking about the aftermath of the race riots that raged through Oldham in the British Midlands last week in the midst of a national election campaign. First, none of the party leaders _ not Tony Blair, the Labor prime minister, nor William Hague, the Conservative leader, nor Charles Kennedy, leader of the Liberal Democrats _ found it convenient to visit Oldham and speak to the people there. Second, nobody even seemed to notice. By Sarah Lyall. (Moved in the `i' category)  _ Also moved in the `a' category:  GUNMAKERS-DIVERSIFY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Political battles over gun ownership may rage, but there's a consensus that guns are not a growth industry. Production for domestic and overseas handgun sales declined 52 percent between 1993 and 1999. The number of licensed gun dealers has fallen to 104,000 from a high of 284,000 in 1992. Twenty years ago, 1 in 14 Americans was a licensed hunter. Today, it's 1 in 18. Gun companies are, above all else, companies, and the buzzword of the moment is diversification. Smith &AMP; Wesson, for instance, has opened retail stores where customers can buy the gun maker's logo on jewelry, gym bags, mountain bikes _ even teddy bears. By Simon Romero.  BUGS-BUNNY-BIAS-REVIEW (Undated) _ After Cartoon Network acquired the rights to all Bugs Bunny cartoons, it announced it would hold a marathon 49-hour broadcast of the entire Bugs oeuvre _ the first complete airing ever. Then the network blinked. Twelve cartoons would not be aired because they contained racially offensive material, the network said. The decision raises questions about popular culture and about how media corporations like AOL Time Warner and Disney, which control the historical record of cartoons, will preserve or erase objectionable chapters of their past. By John Leland.  SHAME-PENALTIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Modern America may seem far removed from Puritan New England, but the idea that punishment should be based on public humiliation has never disappeared. If anything, it seems to be resurgent, especially for offenses deemed to involve morality, such as sex crimes, drunk driving, prostitution and wife beating. Bringing morality into the courts in this way could have far-reaching implications for how America administers and regards justice. Some of the most serious concerns center on the separation of church and state and whether shaming is actually religion-in-the-courtroom in disguise. By Dean E. Murphy.  POWER-PRICE-CAPS-REVIEW (Undated) _ President Bush says price controls on electricity would do nothing to increase supply, but 10 prominent economists have sent a letter to the president calling for the federal government to clamp down on wholesale energy prices. Nostrums suitable to the textbook world of perfect competition, they argue, do not fit the messy facts of electricity markets. It might seem like a man-bites-dog story, but the idea of economists calling for price controls isn't nearly as zany as it appears. Electricity prices skyrocketed in California in part for standard supply-and-demand reasons. By Michael Weinstein.  SCOTUS-DISABILITY-REVIEW (Washington) _ The Supreme Court's ruling in PGA v. Martin defined the issue as one principally about the nature of golf _ and not about what constitutes a disability, and was therefore not a difficult case, as the 7-2 margin indicates. The hard decisions lie ahead. Eleven years after passage of what was arguably the most important civil rights law of the past quarter-century, the essential concepts of the Americans With Disabilities Act remain undefined. In many cases brought under the act, the question of whether there is a disability _ and whether the act therefore applies at all _ is in dispute. By Linda Greenhouse.  NY-SOCIETY-REVIEW (New York) _ Fluidity has always defined New York society, ever since the Dutch settlers opened their gates to the more-moneyed English. New York was always more fluid socially than Boston and Philadelphia, for example. In Philadelphia, it has been said, society is defined by who a person is; in Boston it is by what a person knows. But in New York, it is by how much he or she is worth. The currency of New York's fluidity is cash, and the society of cash is fashion. In fact, we talk about money much the same way we talk about fashion. By William Norwich.  AIDS-1981-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Twenty years ago, the disease now known as AIDS was a puzzle. The virus that causes it was already present in many victims, but the symptoms that define it were just beginning to emerge. The step-by-step arrival of awareness becomes clear in excerpted newspaper reports, bulletins and medical journals from that time.  BUSH-DAUGHTERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A brief look at the media attention to the Bush twins' run-in with the law over alcohol. Reporters have been desperate for a White House scandal since Bill Clinton left office, and perhaps they also could not help but recall that a younger George W. Bush displayed a wild streak similar to his daughters' today. By Frank Bruni.  PEARL-HYPE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Interesting and amusing factoids concerning ``Pearl Harbor'' and the hoopla surrounding it. By Janet Maslin.  THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.  _ Also moved in the `i' category:  CHINA-ECON-REVIEW (Shanghai) _ For the first time since China's private sector began to reappear in the late 1970s, private businesses have access to public capital. And with it, they should grow and eventually eclipse the state-owned enterprises and government-controlled collectives that still dominate the economy. As the private sector grows, it will become a powerful political constituency, and the interests of at least some businessmen will deviate from those of the Communist Party. Why then are China's leaders willing to unshackle private businesses? They recognize that a capital-backed private sector may be China's best hope for economic survival. By Craig S. Smith.  IRAN-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Iran's presidential election is part of a continuing guerrilla war between conservatives who are determined to preserve a strict interpretation of Islamic rule and reformers who have coalesced around President Mohammed Khatami's calls for more political openness and greater personal freedom. Tthe battle has been so closely drawn over the last four years that the election itself is not expected to usher in dramatic new initiatives or climactic change; rather it will be read as an indicator of the reformers' strength or weakness as the fight continues.

"93645"	"they"	"argue"	" ``Everyone is so far apart in terms of their approach to the problem, it's going to take a great deal of effort to bring the parties together,'' said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney. Prosecutors across the state are the most powerful backers of the present drug laws. Very few low-level dealers and addicts are sentenced to long prison terms, they argue, and many of them have past felonies. The prosecutors say they are best equipped to decide who should go into treatment, and they have spent the last several months cautioning lawmakers against making drastic changes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"

"95628"	"they"	"argue"	" Some Russian media have chastised Putin for giving up Russia's hard line opposition to NMD without a fight, but many experts argue that the Russian president has actually made the most of a poor hand. Rather than complain about a plan that he can't stop, they argue, Putin wants to find a solution and cast himself as a key player on a crucial global issue. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"
"95659"	"they"	"argue"	" Those who oppose the bill maintain that Mexican trucks will already have to meet safety requirements.

"95716"	"they"	"argue"	" In the end, cable operators believe consumers will be clamoring for digital whether they're bothered by addressable advertising or not.

"96033"	"they"	"argue"	" Bush's political calculation, they argue, may backfire since many Latinos favor the Democrats on such non-immigration issues as health care, Social Security reform and school spending.

"96392"	"they"	"argue"	" Some in the administration would prefer to focus the campaign more narrowly, concentrating on the operations of Osama bin Laden, the main suspect in the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11.

"97209"	"they"	"argue"	" While the nation is better prepared than it was even three or four years ago, they argue, it is nowhere near ready to cope with a bioterrorist attack. For instance, the United States has only 7 to 15 million doses of smallpox vaccine on hand _ estimates vary _ while experts estimate that at least 40 million would be needed to combat a serious epidemic. Under a government contract, a company in Cambridge, Mass., is testing a new vaccine, but it will not be available until 2004 at the earliest. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"
"97212"	"they"	"argue"	" If the bomber is bin Laden, the United States must share the blame, said people here. It was the U.S. presence in Saudi Arabia in the Persian Gulf War, they argue, that created bin Laden. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"
"98120"	"they"	"argue"	" Although these groups have widely different political agendas, they agree that use of soldiers in a law enforcement role, no matter how minor the job or how subordinate the troops to existing police agencies, increases the risk of an abuse of power or violent confrontation. Most military personnel, they argue, aren't trained to act as cops. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"98752"	"they"	"argue"	" Details that don't come up or receive cursory treatment in conference  calls, they argue, can be deemed bits of material information and off  limits in individual follow-up conversations.

"99356"	"they"	"argue"	" Deliveries from Pakistan have continued without disruption so far, but retailers that are skipping orders for the spring season say they worry even more about the future risks.

"100157"	"they"	"argue"	" The museum, known informally as The Tech, brings a Silicon Valley spin to the notion of a public science institute.

"100775"	"they"	"argue"	" Conservatives might detect a little liberal opportunism masquerading as patriotism in that position. Which is one of the things that lead many to wonder whether the current truce in Hollywood-Washington bickering might be a brief respite rather than a fundamental shift in thinking. More likely, they argue, this is simply one more issue that has been overshadowed by more important concerns. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"101864"	"they"	"argue"	" And for all those who say they want to leave, there is at least an equal number of families who proclaim that they have never been more determined to remain in the United States.

"102192"	"they"	"argue"	" But inside and outside the White House, many advisers to Bush have urged him to use that political capital to declare victory sooner rather than later and to emphasize efforts to fix the economy.

"102866"	"they"	"argue"	" But opponents say the ADOT plan will reach far beyond the road itself. A wider road will bring more traffic, they argue, and with it the possibility of sound walls. The ADOT plan envisions some retaining walls to hold back loose rock. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"102914"	"they"	"argue"	" Critics, even those who find the White House religious celebrations a moving expression of American pluralism, say the festivities nonetheless disturb the foundation of a nation that separates church and state. Religions, they argue, are now playing the role of interest groups. ``The United States is a country that has the support of godless people as well,'' said Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor of the New Republic and the author of ``Kaddish,'' a memoir in part about the Jewish rituals of mourning. ``American multiculturalism shouldn't degenerate into a serial celebration of American religion.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"103714"	"they"	"argue"	" While Mallaby and other neo-imperialists do not foresee a return to the British Raj, they do see a world in which readiness to send troops to distant parts of the world to maintain or re-establish order becomes increasingly common. In some sense, they argue, this has already begun to happen, in Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan. ``In Sierra Leone, the local population welcomed the arrival of British troops,'' he said, as did people in Afghanistan. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"104452"	"they"	"argue"	" However, the United States, Japan and many other governments prefer to give aid directly, so they can have more control over where their money goes and, they argue, have a greater impact. They also could then take credit for building certain roads or hospitals, for example. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"104942"	"they"	"argue"	" Despite her assurances however, Reno's health has been a concern of Democrats who had already wished that Reno not enter the race. Her opponents say that Reno entered the campaign with too much political baggage from her years in the Clinton administration. Her health, they argue, is just one more issue that distracts from defeating Republican Gov. Jeb Bush. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"105459"	"they"	"argue"	" Backed by studies by biologists and historians showing that wolves once roamed throughout much of California, wolf advocates insist the animals are good for the environment: Wolves create balance in the ecosystem by, for example, dispatching coyotes and aging elk. Additionally, they argue, wolves would be a natural magnet, as they have been at Yellowstone National Park, for eco- tourists hoping at least to hear an authentic wolf howl or two. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"106981"	"they"	"argue"	" Zittrain and others argue that the Constitution gave Congress the power to grant copyrights only ``to promote the progress of science and useful arts.''

But when Milosevic, the former Serb strongman, finally landed in the dock at the U.N. court in The Hague last February, he, like Arendt, charged the court with essentially holding a show trial. The concept of a show trial is anathema to the traditional Western belief in a neutral justice system that objectively applies the letter of the law. Yet a small but growing number of legal theorists are making the unsettling argument that a ``show trial'' is precisely what a war crimes proceeding should be.

"132505"	"they"	"argue"	" Proponents of deregulation say that the average household has access to so much information in so many different forms that no single company could ever exert undue influence over consumers.

"134000"	"they"	"argue"	" Supporters of the administration insist that certain forms of tax relief favored by the White House would have a big stimulative effect.

On the Cover  POLAND-LOCKHEED (Undated) _ When Aleksander Kwasniewski, the president of Poland, visits with President Bush at the White House on Jan. 14, talk will inevitably turn to the F-16 fighter jet. Over the Christmas holiday, almost unnoticed, Poland announced it was accepting a $3.8 billion loan from Congress, the largest military loan in memory, to buy 48 of those Fighting Falcons. The scheduled lunch between the two leaders will cap a campaign by the Lockheed Martin Corp. that began six years ago and swung into high gear under Bush. By Leslie Wayne.  With graphic.  COMPANY-FOUNDERS-OPTIONS (Undated) _ It's one thing to dole out giant-sized stock options to executives hired to run a big company. But handing the same sweet deal seems particularly illogical and unnecessary to many watchdog groups when the corporation is still run by its founding family. After all, they argue, a founding chief executive is not likely to quit for a better-paid job elsewhere. And such executives typically own so much company stock that they already are in the same boat as public shareholders before a single stock option has been granted. By Diana B. Henriques.  With graphic.  AMERICA-WEST (Undated) _ America West, the first airline to get a loan guarantee after 9/11, is turning out to be the guinea pig for the industry in other ways, too _ it's trying out a new fare structure and charging for meals. It was the first to charge for paper tickets, and has become a big provocateur in the industry, one of the chief lobbyists against the proposed code-share alliance between Northwest-Continental-Delta _ accusing them of anti-competitive pricing. By Edward Wong.  With graphic.  Commentary  MARKET-WATCH (Undated) _ Financial commentary: To the architects who build them, integrated financial services empires have the allure of immense profits. But for the customers of these one-stop financial entities, perils often result. The laws separating commercial banks from investment firms have only recently been undone, so clients of financial services behemoths are just beginning to see how the inherent conflicts can affect them. By Gretchen Morgenson.  With graphic.  ECON-COLUMN (Undated) _ Economic View: The holiday shopping season was not all that bad. By Tom Redburn.  With graphic.

But when it comes to selling cars, the trade remains overwhelmingly dominated by men. We look at why, and what the auto makers have done to change it. By Christina Le Beau.  With photos, NYT4-5, and a graphic.  CENTAM-TRADE (Undated) _ Five Questions for Peter Hakim, president of Inter-American Dialogue, a policy research center on Western Hemisphere affairs, on the implications of a free-trade agreement with five Central American countries, which the Bush administration is hoping will lead to a hemispheric-wide free-trade zone. By Elizabeth Becker.  With photo, NYT6.  BIZ-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Short items on business.

INVESTING-WITH-MOSAIC (Undated) _ Investing with Jay R. Sekelsky, manager, Mosaic Investors fund. By Carole Gould.  With graphic.  Autos  AUTO-SHOW (Detroit) _ Concept cars are the dream machines of auto shows, unattainable flashes of show-biz glamour among vehicles that come with easy-payment plans, extended warranties and Scotchguard fabric protection. Concept cars are not for sale, and they may say more about the state of mind of the industry than about the state of the art of engineering. At this year's Detroit show, which opens Jan. 11 after a week of previews and media events, gee-whiz future technologies are less in evidence than powerful but wistful visions of big American cars, like prewar limousines and the full-size sedan that until recently was almost written off as extinct.

"136725"	"they"	"argue"	" Abortion opponents, preparing to rally Wednesday, say the answer is simple: the culture is gradually moving their way on abortion, they argue, and the incremental steps now being pushed by their movement, like a ban on the procedure they call ``partial birth abortion,'' have broad support. Plus, said Ken Connor, president of the anti-abortion Family Research Council, of Bush: ``He's not scary. No one can dismiss him as being hyperbolic in his rhetoric, exaggerated in his tone.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136895"	"I"	"argue"	" ``Flower Drum Song'' often is considered a repository for lesser R&amp;H music; not so, I argue, it's merely underappreciated.

"137081"	"they"	"argue"	" Broadway producers are seeking to eliminate the minimums as an outdated guarantee that, they argue, costs them dearly and appropriates decision-making that they feel belongs to the creative team. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200303.gz"
"137132"	"they"	"argue"	" Merrill's moves to become a financial superstore may well improve the firm's profitability, making it less vulnerable to the unrelenting bear market. But some of the new offerings are having the opposite effect on some clients. At least two dozen people who have used the loan services that Merrill began offering several years ago are now bringing arbitration cases against it. The melding of brokerage and banking services, they argue, left$txgm with bigger losses than they would have incurred had they simply used traditional brokerage accounts. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200303.gz"
"137142"	"they"	"argue"	" If Washington is serious about its democracy initiative, they argue, it should begin in Lebanon, both by helping to reverse the slide away from democracy and by using it as a case study to understand the forces _ good and bad _ that might emerge in a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq. ``For all its faults, Lebanon is the only country where you don't have to start from scratch,'' said Farid el Khazen, chairman of the political science department at the American University of Beirut. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200303.gz"
"137165"	"they"	"argue"	" But Gandolfini's side noted that ``The Sopranos'' takes nine months to film only 13 episodes, whereas other television shows make as many as 24 episodes.

"137310"	"they"	"argue"	" It was understood last autumn, they argue, that 1441 did not contain an automatic trigger for war, a point conceded by John Negroponte, America's UN ambassador, in the Security Council at the time it was passed, as well as by Britain's legal analysis. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200303.gz"
"137521"	"they"	"argue"	" The Hawza's party line has been conciliatory: Iraq's government must be based on Islam, they argue, but needn't be a religious government.

"138164"	"they"	"argue"	" Palestinians argue that far more of them _ 2,103, according to B'Tselem _ have been killed by Israeli soldiers in the last three years. Moreover, they argue, the Palestinians do not have an army _ the reason many Palestinians defend their own terror attacks while deploring the same acts by Israelis. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200308.gz"
"138275"	"they"	"argue"	" But piecemeal reforms may not be enough of a cure, Big Board critics say.

"138537"	"they"	"argue"	" Others, though, say the shift represents a significant risk for Bush. The decision-making, they argue, is now even closer to the Oval Office, with no one but the president to blame when things go badly. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200310.gz"

"139166"	"they"	"argue"	" A more independent national intelligence chief, they argue, would control the budgets and day-to-day operations of the Pentagon's intelligence agencies, and could do a better job of redeploying them to address more pressing concerns like terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear weapons instead of the military and its preoccupation with enemy armies. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200402.gz"
"139279"	"they"	"argue"	" Israelis counter that the real aim of the right of return is to suffocate their state by flooding it with hostile Arabs _ a sort of Trojan horse. Moreover, they argue, there is no historic sin that requires expiation because there was no Zionist plan to expel the Palestinians. They say that Zionist leaders urged the Palestinians to stay put, but that Arab leaders instructed them to leave so Arab armies would have a clear field. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200402.gz"
"139433"	"they"	"argue"	" It's not just a question of numbers, although Hudson and den Boer declare that societies with young adult sex ratios of about 120 men to 100 women are inherently unstable. They also draw on studies showing that countries with few marriageable women tend to develop authoritarian political systems and be more violent toward women. And they examine historical evidence. In China, they argue, the Nien Rebellion in 1851 and the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 are some examples of gangs of bare branches using force to get what they wanted. They also looked at case histories in Taiwan, India and Portugal. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"139661"	"they"	"argue"	" Reider's position is seen as a bit too puritanical by others, who argue that there is a great burden on small, little-known colleges to make their names recognizable. Though the theater or a professional sporting event may not bear any direct relevance to what goes on at the university, they argue, treating counselors to such events showcases the community and is hardly likely to stimulate a big rush of applications by itself. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"141537"	"they"	"argue"	" There are those, of course, who argue that at least some of the attempts to hem in the press represent a long-overdue correction.

"142206"	"they"	"argue"	" And many women, they argue, don't find that identifying with other women is empowering -- instead, it reinforces a particular script about being a woman. Is it useful for women to look for reflections of their own experience in the stories of the ancients? Or might we learn more by looking at the critical differences between then and now? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"142277"	"they"	"argue"	" Politicians and analysts from the Midwest insist that it has not. States like Ohio and Michigan are perfect microcosms of the nation, they argue, with liberal cities and conservative Bible belts, diverse immigrant communities alongside all-white suburbs, clean high-tech industries replacing belching smokestacks. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"142575"	"they"	"argue"	" Margaret S. Livingstone and Bevil R. Conway, neurobiologists at Harvard Medical School, say Rembrandt's many self-portraits reveal that his eyes are focused in slightly different directions, depriving him of the stereo effect that makes vision three-dimensional. As a result, they argue, Rembrandt would have struggled with depth perception - though he may never have known he had a vision defect. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"

"143289"	"they"	"argue"	" It once built great railroads, conquered the Arctic, and had the world's fourth largest armed forces at the end of World War II, pioneering peacekeeping in distant trouble spots.

"143363"	"they"	"argue"	" The soul-searching over Salem's public image has angered some residents; they say the city should not forsake the witch theme, which helps attract more than 1 million visitors each year.

"143637"	"they"	"argue"	" The willingness of whites to acknowledge black contributions to Southern food diminished during the civil rights movement, Miller said, when African-Americans began to assert their claim on Southern cuisine. The term soul food, for example, gained currency in the late 1960s and early 1970s as part of that effort. Some black chefs and food historians now say the term is limiting because it marginalizes the black version of Southern food, which, they argue, is mostly black food to begin with. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"144580"	"they"	"argue"	" But independent nuclear experts have expressed concern about what they describe as Brazil's history of deceit and obfuscation in the strategic arms field, including secret dealings with rogue states like Iraq and Libya. That, they argue, explains some of the skepticism among scientists and diplomats that has greeted Brazil's claims of purely innocent, energy-related intentions. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"144658"	"they"	"argue"	" Some brokers said the commission payments from insurers are such a routine business practice that they don't influence their hiring decisions since they're going to collect a fee regardless of which insurance company they select. The fees, they argue, simply reflect the volume of business that a broker sends to any one company over time. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"

"145669"	"they"	"argue"	" E-COMMERCE-COLUMN (Undated) -- At the height of the dot-com boom, DoubleClick made itself the object of scorn among privacy advocates by trying to track Internet users individually and show them ads related to their surfing habits. Now advertisers are circling back to the idea, but in a way that, they argue, will spare them the privacy-related outcry. Tacoda, an online marketing company based in New York, will announce Monday the creation of a network of 60 Web sites that allow its members to display ads based on how people surf through the network. But Tacoda's service, called AudienceMatch, will not know who those surfers are, just where they visit. By Bob Tedeschi. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"

"146164"	"they"	"argue"	" Many musicians say peace of mind is important to good performance, and that limits on their playing are important to their health, when blasting brass can cause hearing loss and constant minute movements of fingers can cause repetitive-stress injuries. Rehearsal and concert time, they argue, is only one part of a daily routine that includes practicing and teaching. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"146219"	"they"	"argue"	" But many analysts think that the dollar, which is down 2.7 percent this year against a broad index including the United States' trading partners and much more against some individual currencies, will fall sharply in the months ahead.

Scott McClellan, President Bush's press secretary, said it was a very thorough vetting process that looked at all the issues relating to his public, financial and personal background. But they insisted there had been no way to discover -- without Kerik volunteering the information -- that his family's nanny was most likely an illegal alien, or that he had failed to pay the proper taxes related to her employment. It was that issue alone, they argue, that terminated his nomination. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"

It's Social Security itself, they argue, that depresses American savings, and in two ways: First, there's the payroll tax that supports the program, which means, as Kotlikoff puts it, the government is taking money from [people] that they then can't save. Then there are the benefits, which, according to William A.

SCI-WIRED-ENVIRON (Undated) -- In the wilds of California's San Jacinto Mountains, along a steep canyon, scientists are turning 30 acres of pines and hardwoods into a futuristic vision of environmental study. They are linking up more than 100 tiny sensors, robots, cameras and computers that are beginning to paint an unusually detailed portrait of this lush world, home to more than 30 rare and endangered species. Scientists call it a new science -- real-time visualization over a large area. And it is spreading coast to coast, with more than $1 billion in networks of sensors planned not only for the land but places like the Hudson River and the deep Pacific. The rapid miniaturization of technologies behind cameras, cellphones and wireless computers is allowing the scientists to build innovative networks of small sensors that they say will produce a new era of ecological insight and, in time, will help save the planet.and, in time, will help save the planet.  With photo and graphic.  SCI-VANISHING-TWINS (Undated) -- Last month, when champion American cyclist Tyler Hamilton was accused of blood doping, or transfusing himself with another person's blood to increase his oxygen-carrying red cells, he offered a surprising defense: The small amount of extra blood found mixed in with his own must have come from a vanishing twin. In other words, his scientific expert argued, Hamilton had a twin that died in utero but, before dying, contributed some blood cells to him during fetal life. And those cells remained in his body, producing blood that matched the dead twin and not Hamilton. Researchers say they have no idea whether Hamilton is guilty of blood doping, but these notions of vanishing twins and chimerism now appear to be real, and common. By Gina Kolata.  With photo.  SCI-KIDS-PITCHING (Undated) -- Hey, parents -- throw that ball to your little one faster, not slower: a new study shows toddlers can't hit a change-up. By John Schwartz.  SCI-BOYD-ANTHROPOLOGY (Undated) -- A Conversation With feature on Robert Boyd, a theoretical biological anthropologist who uses mathematics and deduction to develop ideas about how Homo sapiens became earth's dominant species. He shares his views on the culture and evolution. Only humans can accumulate knowledge over long periods of time and transfer it so that the next generation can improve on it, he says. It's this trick that has allowed people to be as successful as we are. By Claudia Dreifus.  With photo.  SCI-Q&amp;A (Undated) -- A science question answered: When you see oil gushing from oil wells in old movies, why is the oil under such pressure? By C. Claiborne Ray.  SCI-GAZZANIGA-NEUROSCIENCE (Undated) -- A Scientist at Work profile on Michael Gazzaniga, director of cognitive neuroscience at Dartmouth. By Carl Zimmer.  With photo.  SCI-SALMONELLA-PETS (Undated) -- Last June, a 4-year-old boy in South Carolina was hospitalized for five days with a fever of 105, watery diarrhea and abdominal cramping. Doctors quickly found the cause: Salmonella typhimirium, a bacteria commonly found in undercooked chicken. But the culprit here was the boy's pet hamster -- the first document cases of a person infected with salmonella from a pet rodent. By Nicholas Bakalar.  SCI-WATCH (Undated) -- Science news and notes: Preening as well as eating seems to have shaped the beaks of the Galapagos finches; the far-reaching effects of shearing icebergs in Antarctica; Korea has a new salamander. By Henry Fountain.  With  SCI-MOON-ORIGINS (Undated) -- There are two kinds of moons in the solar system: those that formed when their parent planet did, and those that were made elsewhere and captured later. It now seems that Saturn's moon Phoebe is the made-elsewhere kind. A short by Henry Fountain.  SCI-PLATONIC-PUZZLE (Undated) -- The Greeks called them cosmic figures, five perfectly regular forms -- the tetrahedron, the cube, the octahedron, the dodecahedron and the icosahedron. Kepler once thought he could solve the mystery of the planets by finding a way to nest the solids. Now, a physicist has designed an interlocking wooden puzzle that is a complete set of Platonic solids. By Margaret Wertheim.  With a graphic.  SCI-PATIENT-RESPONSIBILITY (Undated) -- Current healthcare etiquette requires that a patient be viewed as a consumer, a knowledgeable care partner who is equipped and ready to take charge. The notion makes some sense; after all, who cares more about your health than you do? But in this global therapeutic village where the customer is king, a simple question remains unanswered: What happens if something goes awry, if a decision shared or even directed by a patient turns out to be the wrong one? On whose desk does that buck stop? By Kent Sepkowitz.  SCI-BEAST-INSIDE (Undated) -- The little old lady with the fine white hair and the sky-blue raincoat was there every day, sitting on a couch in the lobby of our apartment building. Then one day the beast appeared, the first sign of a degenerating mind. By Judith Groch.  SCI-METABOLIC-SYNDROME (Undated) -- As many as 55 million Americans meet the diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome, a cluster of risk factors that include mild hypertension, elevated glucose levels, high triglycerides and low levels of HDL cholesterol. But scientists still disagree about what causes the syndrome, how to diagnose it, how to treat patients who have it and even what it should be called. By Laurie Tarkan.  With photo.  SCI-REALLY (Undated) -- The claim: Oysters are aphrodisiacs. The facts: .... By Anahad O'Connor.  SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) -- News and notes on health and medicine:  -- Screening: Public services advertisements by celebrities urging people to get various cancer screening tests may be admirable, but are they desirable? Maybe not, researchers argue in a new study. They report on a survey finding that the ads are widely seen, and that many people say they are more likely to be tested as a result. The problem, the researchers said, is that many of those people should not be tested, which can lead to unneeded treatment. It would be more useful, they argue, for celebrities to make ads urging people not to do dangerous things like drinking and driving.  -- Reactions: Highly unsaturated vegetable oils, generally regarded as healthy for people who want to avoid heart disease, produce a toxic compound when heated to frying temperatures for half an hour or more. The compound, HNE, has been associated with several illnesses, including cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's. The findings highlight the risk of repeatedly reusing these oils, the researchers say.  -- Behavior: Men who associate alcohol with sexual activity become sexually stimulated if they are subliminally shown words related to alcohol use, a new study suggests. Researchers found that when words like keg were flashed on a computer screen without the men's knowledge, they were more likely to say that women shown in a series of photographs were attractive.  -- Patterns: Regular use of acetaminophen, better known as Tylenol, appears to be linked with an increased rate of asthma and other lung problems.  SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) -- The Personal Health column: With the surgeon general urging Americans to do at least 30 minutes a day of moderately vigorous exercise to improve their health, and with some 60 percent of adults doing little or none, a program attractive enough to prompt millions of otherwise sedentary women to get out and just do it certainly seems worthy of praise. Considering the rapid growth of Curves, a privately owned no-frills fitness company that has more than 8,000 franchises here and abroad, the concept is a winner. But how well does it work? By Jane E. Brody.  SCI-COCAINE-RISK (Undated) -- Cocaine use quadruples the risk of aneurysm, a new study shows. By Lawrence K. Altman.  With photo.

Lynndie England's guilty plea in a military courtroom in Texas last week was her equally bizarre and unraveled relationship with Spc. Charles Graner, who just weeks ago married another defendant from the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison. The reservists' entanglements with one other and their treatment of Iraqi prisoners have produced a dark soap opera. By Kate Zernike.  DIVING-FOR-ABALONE (Pointe Arena, Calif.) -- Call it extreme dining. It is abalone season, and divers flock to the Mendocino coast, one of the last bastions of this prized delicacy, which is legally off-limits to commercial fishermen. To protect the abalone's deep-water habitat, no breathing apparatus is allowed, and strict limits are enforced, three abalone a day. But divers, often 50-something men with desk jobs, encounter very dangerous conditions. Because of tidal surges, murky waters and forests of kelp, nearly every abalone season brings with it reports of drownings. Last year, a renowned surgeon lost his life while diving for abalone. By Patricia Leigh Brown.  WTC-MEMORIAL (New York) -- As questions fly about the future of the Freedom Tower and commercial buildings at ground zero, quieter battles are raging over the future of the memorial to the lives lost there. The memorial's architect, Michael Arad, is at odds with the memorial's landscape architect, Peter Walker. The families of the dead are at odds with Arad. What is this thing going to look like, in the end? By Robin Pogrebin.  FINANCIAL  (Coded f)  COMPUTER-THEFT (San Francisco) -- The incident seemed alarming enough: a breach of a Cisco Systems network in which an intruder seized programming instructions for many of the computers that control the flow of the Internet. Now federal officials and computer security investigators have acknowledged that the Cisco break-in last year was only part of a more extensive operation -- involving a single intruder or a small band, apparently based in Europe -- in which thousands of computer systems were penetrated. Investigators in the United States and Europe say they spent almost a year pursuing the case as the attacks continued, breaching computer systems serving the military, NASA and prominent research laboratories. The case illustrates not only the ease with which sensitive Internet-connected computers can be penetrated but also the difficulty in tracing those responsible. And at a time when millions of consumers are discovering that their personal information has been stolen from commercial databases, the case shows that the guardians of the most sophisticated corporate and government networks are vulnerable as well. By John Markoff and Lowell Bergman.  With photo.  CENTAM-TRADE (Washington) -- Social Security is not the administration's only economic initiative that is in trouble in Congress. The current centerpiece of President Bush's trade agenda, the Central American Free Trade Agreement, is facing unusually united Democratic opposition as well as serious problems in overcoming well-entrenched special interest groups like sugar producers and much of the textile industry. With record trade deficits, concerns about lost jobs and an overarching fear that the United States is losing out in the accelerated pace of global changes, the sentiment in Congress is shifting away from approving new free trade agreements. By Elizabeth Becker.  (This story was sent and held on Friday, May 6, with the slug CONGRESS-TRADE)  ELITE-FLYERS (Undated) -- Even as hot-shot corporate executives join the chorus of protest at their devalued miles, members of a super-elite platinum loyalty program are smirking with satisfaction as they are chauffeured to the airport and met at the other end by their personal concierges. By Stuart Elliott.  BASEBALL-AD-COLUMN (Undated) -- Five weeks into the major league baseball season, attendance is up and fans are chanting MVP for their favorite players. But parts of Madison Avenue have picked up a different mantra, one that plays off the steroid debate. By Nat Ives.  BOX-TV-SPORTS (Undated) -- An On TV Sports column contrasting the real thing -- the great lightweight title fight on Saturday night between Corrales and Castillo -- and the contrived stuff offered on The Contender. By Richard Sandomir.  WTC-MEMORIAL (New York ) -- As questions fly about the future of the Freedom Tower and commercial buildings at ground zero, quieter battles are raging over the future of the memorial to the lives lost there. The memorial's architect, Michael Arad, is at odds with the memorial's landscape architect, Peter Walker. The families of the dead are at odds with Arad. What is this thing going to look like, in the end? By Robin Pogrebin.  MOVIES-BOX-OFFICE (Los Angeles) -- Now Hollywood is starting to get worried. The poor box-office performance last weekend of the first major film of the summer, Kingdom of Heaven, released by 20th Century Fox, made for 11 weeks in a row of declining movie attendance and revenue compared with last year, adding up to the longest slump since 2000 and raising an uncomfortable question: Are people turning away from lackluster movies, or turning their backs on the whole business of going to theaters? By Sharon Waxman.  THEM-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) -- Them: A Memoir of Parents, by Francine du Plessix Gray (Penguin). Reviewed by Michiko Kakutani.  MILLER-MEMORIAL (New York) -- A memorial service for the playwright Arthur Miller at a Broadway theater. Miller died on Feb. 10 at the age of 89. By Jason Zinoman.  JFK-INAUGURAL (Undated) -- A new book documents that Kennedy didn't write his inaugural address; Sorenson, Galbraith and Adlai Stevenson all had a hand in it. That is exactly the opposite conclusion reached by a similar book published last year. How two authors looked at the same evidence and saw opposing truths, and why it matters 40 years later. By Edward Wyatt.  PINAULT-MUSEUM (Paris) -- Francois Pinault, a billionaire who is France's wealthiest art lover, announced Monday that he was abandoning plans to build a $195 million contemporary art museum on the outskirts of Paris and would instead present part of his vast collection in the Palazzo Grassi, an elegant exhibition space on Venice's Grand Canal that he recently acquired. Pinault, whose corporate empire includes Christie's, Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and three chains of department and media stores, said he was reluctantly giving up the museum project because it was already five years behind schedule because of delays caused by municipal authorities in the Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt. By Alan Riding.  CRASH-FILM (Los Angeles) -- Los Angeles is in love with the idea of its own self-destruction; it's hard to think of another American city so similarly possessed. It is a curious form of romantic self-aggrandizement, one familiar from untold numbers of novels, short stories, films and songs. Now it has spread to video games, including the forthcoming 187 Ride or Die, about a street racing thug, and the film in Crash, which opened on Friday, the latest in apocalypse entertainment about Los Angeles. A Critic's Notebook by Manohla Dargis.  TV-ASYLUM-REVIEW (Undated) -- An enormously disturbing Frontline report profiles the enormously disturbed. This documentary, The New Asylums, which will be presented on Tuesday night, explains that the mentally ill, in the decades after a mass release from mental hospitals, have often wound up in less forgiving confines. Reviewed by Ned Martel.  DVD-RELEASES (Undated) -- The weekly DVD column. By Dave Kehr.  ARTS-BRIEFLY (Undated) -- News and notes on culture and entertainment.  SCIENCE  (Coded a)  SMELL-SEX-PREFERENCE (Undated) -- Using a brain imaging technique, Swedish researchers have shown that men and women respond differently to two odors that may be involved in sexual arousal, and that homosexual men respond in the same way as women. The new research may open the way to studying the chemistry of human sexual attraction. By Nicholas Wade.  SCI-WIRED-ENVIRON (Undated) -- In the wilds of California's San Jacinto Mountains, along a steep canyon, scientists are turning 30 acres of pines and hardwoods into a futuristic vision of environmental study.

"156647"	"they"	"argue"	" In a nutshell, atheists believe in reason alone, in those things that can be arrived at through intellect and the scientific method. Concrete evidence for God, they argue, simply doesn't exist. They don't cotton to leaps of faith or anything that involves a supernatural being reaching into human lives. They believe you can live a happy, respectable life based on human ethics that were derived not from God handing down a tablet but from a code of rules that emerged naturally through an evolutionary process in which humans learned how to live together successfully. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"

"159324"	"they"	"argue"	" Bush's aides portray themselves as victims in this case, battered by conflicting intelligence and ill served by the head of the CIA at the time, George J. Tenet. Tenet, they argue, did not convey to the White House doubts he had about the validity of the charge. But Tenet's doubts were deep enough that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, in an interview in 2003, said that he had never believed the uranium story and that he was mystified why the White House thought it legitimate. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
"159426"	"they"	"argue"	" In addition to increasing the jihadi threat by invading Iraq, the authors write, the Bush administration also squandered the post-9/11 years by failing to beef up homeland security sufficiently: In overemphasizing the offensive side of the war on terror, they argue, the White House has been diverted from the imperative of a sound defense. The authors enumerate the many familiar targets that have not been secured (from railroads to seaports to chemical plants), and they also point to the reasons for these failures, including bureaucratic infighting; bungling at the FBI (which has spent $581 million and is still not close to having a functioning computer system); delays in making key political appointments (in some cases, they write, over concerns about the political loyalties of the individuals); and a failure to look at tactical decisions within a larger strategic picture. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"159465"	"they"	"argue"	" Wine-shipping advocates say the concerns of underage drinkers are overblown. Convenience stores, they argue, are a far bigger target for teens than a delayed buy from the Internet. And they call the tax issue a smokescreen. Florida loses far more in sales tax collections from Internet sellers of books and electronics, furniture and clothing. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"159550"	"they"	"argue"	" In the view of some Proposition 71 supporters, the royalty issue is a distraction. Regardless of whether the state receives royalties, they argue, California has an opportunity to advance medical research, possibly finding treatments for diabetes, spinal cord injuries and many other diseases. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"160366"	"they"	"argue"	" Mercosur negotiators dismiss concerns that Chavez could disrupt the bloc's agenda, which includes further reducing trade barriers within the group and negotiating agreements with the world. While member states are expected to give Venezuela the right to take part in Mercosur meetings, full voting membership, they argue, would be granted only after a months-long process that requires Venezuela to adopt existing policies. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"160668"	"they"	"argue"	" Google is fighting the proposal, along with other large Internet companies including Amazon.com Inc. and eBay Inc. They fear they may have to pay telecoms millions of dollars to gain access to customers who use the premium Internet services. In addition, they argue, many small Internet start-ups would be unable to pay the fees, which could reduce consumer choice. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"161577"	"they"	"argue"	" The war has raised the cost of Army recruiting, they argue, and has subtracted from income the wages given up by thousands of reservists who left civilian jobs to fight in Iraq at lower pay. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"162008"	"they"	"argue"	" The dispute between the state and municipalities is over the projects already on the waiting list. Many mayors say state officials promised that those projects would not be affected by the new law. Because the Department of Education last updated the reimbursement rate in June 2004, they argue, the School Building Authority should raise it again to reflect higher construction costs. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"162140"	"they"	"argue"	" The university presidents also want state approval to collect more for activity, health and athletic fees. The flexibility, they argue, would allow each university to take on new projects that benefit students. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"162708"	"they"	"argue"	" To a few experts on juries, such statements are troubling. That juries are full of turtle people, they argue, suggests that, 135 years after Twain's bitter diagnosis, lawyers and judges still confuse an ignorant jury with an impartial one. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"162912"	"they"	"argue"	" Whatever the reason, analysts say that inverted yields typically hurt banks, which borrow short and lend long. A prolonged inversion could hurt bank lending, they argue, and that, in turn, could lead to slower growth. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"163240"	"they"	"argue"	" Hamas, they argue, has held to the 1 ?-year-old cease-fire brokered by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, and since August 2004 Hamas hasn't launched a suicide attack - something that Fatah-linked militias can't claim. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"163272"	"they"	"argue"	" In addition, they argue, if the court were to uphold the developers' position, the result would be to upend a decades-old regulatory system. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"163690"	"they"	"argue"	" Another possibility, critics say, is that smaller Web sites would be crowded out. A big company like Apple, they argue, has the money to pay network providers for faster access and absorb the cost. But mom-and-pop online Web sites might not. If they were unable to compete with bigger, faster sites, the result could be less diversity of content on the Internet. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164745"	"they"	"argue"	" In addition, they argue, conspiracy, with which Hamdan has been charged, is not a war crime and is therefore not subject to trial by military commission. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164991"	"they"	"argue"	" The action played well on Capitol Hill, where some Democrats and Republicans have ratcheted up attacks against China and its policy of keeping its currency, the yuan, tightly linked to the dollar. That peg, they argue, gives Chinese products an unfair edge over American rivals and contributes to America's $202 billion bilateral trade deficit. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"165921"	"they"	"argue"	" There are 9,000 judges in Egypt, and an estimated 7,000 have joined forces to press the government for a new law that, they argue, will allow them to be independent. Those leading the fight, including some of Egypt's most senior jurists, have been pressing the government since 1991 to ensure that judges are free from government pressure. They say the minister of justice, who is appointed by Mubarak, can threaten, intimidate and punish those who challenge the will of the government -- a accusation that government officials deny. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"166446"	"they"	"argue"	" As the authorities sought to restore order and pursue those believed to have been responsible, residents and security experts criticized police officials and Sao Paulo's state government, which, they argue, was unprepared to manage the crisis and turned away help to avoid political embarrassment. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"166703"	"they"	"argue"	" Supporters of the latest measure say that in an unequal society, only explicit set-asides can open doors. Where there are no mandatory quotas, in the private sector for instance, or in the news media, they argue, upper castes continue to dominate. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"167064"	"they"	"argue"	" Last week a prestigious journal published two reports from scientists who have discovered how to achieve the same effect without breaking the laws of physics. Invisibility, they argue, is a matter of diverting light around an object so all the light continues on its way instead of reflecting off the object. The reports suggest using a thick shell of high-tech transparent material to do this. Even when looking directly at the object, an observer would see only what was behind it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"167207"	"they"	"argue"	" Jobs and the promise of more jobs can make for strange bedfellows, with some U.S. politicians willing to overlook the fact that EADS is a French-German company that owns Airbus, Boeing's bitter rival. In a global economy, they argue, such geographic distinctions no longer matter, especially in the defense industry where companies, including Boeing, have key suppliers all over the world. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"168036"	"they"	"argue"	" But it's a different story, they argue, on the issue of pesticides. Charles Benbrook is the lead scientist at the Organic Center, an organization set up by the organic industry to study and publicize the benefits of organic food. According to him, the most widely accepted benefit of organics is the absence of all synthetic pesticides, and the corresponding reduction in the risk of cancer and neurological disorders. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"168664"	"they"	"argue"	" Their lawyers argue that Internet service providers have revolutionized the way people buy and sell goods, make friends, locate services, find housing and make connections.

ARTS &amp; LEISURE  VIDEO-GAMES-PEACEMAKER (Undated) -- Video games have long entertained users by immersing them in fantasy worlds full of dragons or spaceships. But Peacemaker is part of a new generation: Games that immerse people in the real world, full of real-time political crises. And the games' designers aren't just selling a voyeuristic thrill. Games, they argue, can be more than just mindless fun: They can be a medium for change. By Clive Thompson.  COLLAPSING-CASBAH (Algiers) -- It has stood for centuries, a slope of gleaming white houses climbing in steps from the sea like a construction of sugar cubes. It gave this Mediterranean port the nickname la Blanche, the white one. But despite the romance surrounding the old quarter, known as the Casbah and once home to pirates and freedom fighters, it is literally imploding from neglect. By Craig S. Smith.  THEATER-CARRADINE (Undated) -- Keith Carradine, who is going into Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, speaks about his own life as a reformed scoundrel. By Joyce Wadler.  FILM-REILLY (Undated) -- Audiences have watched John C. Reilly in dozens of films. One of these days they may remember his name. By Jacques Steinberg.  FILM-BRAZIL-SAND (Undated) -- Larry Rohter previews the beautiful Brazilian film House of Sand, about three generations of women trapped in the remote Brazilian desert.  TV-UGLY-BETTY (Undated) -- Matthew Fogel tells how a modest Colombian telenovela about a pitifully ugly woman trying to navigate the shallow waters of the fashion industry became one of the world's most popular television shows. By Matthew Fogel.  COMICS-PRODIGY (Shutesbury, Mass.) -- Alexa Kitchen, who turned 9 last month, has been a sensation in the comic book world since she was 6, when her parents first showed her work at the art festival that the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art in New York puts on every spring. Her draftsmanship is a little primitive, but her drawings powerfully express some of what it feels like to be a kid, from the raging war between boys and girls to the bummer of being too young to baby-sit.

NOTEWORTHY-PAPERBACKS (Undated) -- Short summaries of other paperbacks.  TRAVEL-SPAIN-PARADORS (Undated) -- Many of Spain's historic paradors are getting makeovers to appeal to travelers who want spas and Wi-Fi access along with palatial surroundings and 16th-century friezes. By Sarah Wildman.  With:  TRAVEL-PARADORS-TOUR (Undated) -- A five-parador tour through Northern Spain. By Fred A. Bernstein.  TRAVEL-ITALY-GENOA (Undated) -- In most of Italy's villages and towns, restaurants serve the same dishes they've been serving for a hundred years or more. These vary from one town to the next, even if the distances traveled are tiny, and the locals usually insist that the food in the last town you visited is inferior to what you're about to taste. About half the time they're right. In the cities, though, you find more regional food, and even food from other parts of Italy, giving you a taste of more varied cuisines. Genoa, in the heart of Liguria, is one of the best cities for this sort of pan-Italian eating, at least in part because the region is among Europe's culinary highlights; it remains difficult to eat any way but well here. By Mark Bittmann.  TRAVEL-FRANCE-VERSAILLES (Undated) -- With its Hall of Mirrors, formal gardens and imposing works of art, the chateau of Versailles is a manly sort of place, the ultimate symbol of kingly power in France. Not far away is what might be called the anti-Versailles, a smaller, messier, more feminine site where Marie Antoinette, the last queen of France's Ancien Regime, sought refuge. The 86-acre Domaine of Marie Antoinette lacks the visibility and aura of the Versailles chateau. The estate attracts only about 300,000 visitors a year; Versailles draws more than 4 million. But the director of Versailles, Christine Albanel, is determined to redress that imbalance. By Elaine Sciolino.  TRAVEL-EUROPE-HARBORS (Undated) -- There was a time when a harbor was the heart of its city, bustling with fish markets and sailors and ships laden with hopeful immigrants, world travelers and exotic cargo. But with the advent of supersized cargo vessels and direct container shipping about 50 years ago, many once-busy ports began to languish, often becoming seedy urban eyesores. In Europe, though, many old harbors are being reinvented as architecturally experimental areas with modern residential buildings, hotels, art spaces and artificial beaches. By Gisela Williams.  Regular Features  PRACTICAL-TRAVELER (Undated) -- Rental car insurance: Paying for coverage you may not need. By Matt Villano.  TRAVEL-BRIEFS (Undated) -- News and notes on travel. By Michelle Higgins.  TRAVEL-Q&amp;A (Undated) -- Travel questions answered. By Roger Collis.

, he said,	 You don't have to be a political genius to realize that once you have the moral high ground, you should use it, said Ari Shavit, a columnist for the daily Haaretz. And then if we had to act, we would have more legitimacy to act and prove how serious we are about our borders.

, he said,	 Gallois earned a reputation for diplomacy in negotiating with unions and politicians at the French railway. The problems at EADS, he said, have little to do with its management structure, but run deep in the organization. In the six years since it was founded, EADS has had co-chief executives -- and we've been extremely successful for five of those years, he said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he said,	 Now, though, the company must repair its troubled product line. To do so, he said, will require looking at how its planes are produced -- not just what they look like. Perhaps it was a problem for EADS that problems weren't put on the table at the right time, Gallois said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he said,	 Enders, however, cautioned against reading too much into it. EADS, he said, is sticking to its position that Airbus will not give up launch aid until Boeing gives up research money from the Pentagon and NASA.

, he said,	 Cell phones, refrigerators, color TVs, they didn't start off by making a low-end product for masses, he said. They were relatively expensive, for people who could afford it. The companies that sold those products at first, he said, did so not because they were stupid and they thought the real market was at the high end of the market, but because that was how to get production started.

, he said,	 Kelley added that the number of challenges Gonzales said Bush had issued, 110 to 125, is close to the number of bills to which Bush has attached signing statements. However, focusing on the number of bills is misleading, he said, because Congress often lumps many statutes together and passes them together as a single bill. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz

, he said,	 Giora Eiland, until recently Israel's national security adviser, said an international force is not in Israel's interest if it acts only as a buffer. It can only be effective, he said, if the other side does not want any provocation and wants to maintain quiet and if there's a credible address on the other side with control over Lebanon. Israel should, he said, insist that any international force make it possible for Lebanon to do what it has to do and not be a buffer between us and them, which would reduce the Lebanese government's responsibility. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he said,	 Any solution to the crisis, he said, should include Israel's withdrawal from the disputed Shebaa Farms area of the border, the release of Lebanese detainees in Israeli jails, and a return to the terms of the 1949 armistice between the two countries. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz

, he added,	 Even some of the most seasoned analysts of Iran's backing for Hezbollah are restrained in their conclusions of Iran's role in the recent crisis. Iran will certainly benefit from Hezbollah strikes, Cordesman wrote in his analysis. But, he added, Until there are hard facts, Iran's role in all this is a matter of speculation, and conspiracy theories are not facts or news. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060718.0249 type=story > <HEADLINE> ISRAEL'S STRATEGIC AIMS IN FLUX </HEADLINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he said,	 Oren says Israel must stop Hezbollah at its source - its main financial backer, Iran, and its logistical and political supporter, Syria. Israel can't take on Iran alone, he said, but taking out 500 Syrian tanks might convince Syrian President Bashar Assad that there's a price to pay for supporting Hezbollah. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he said,	 Nicholas Roybal, a 20-year-old theater major at Connecticut College, spent last summer at home in Los Angeles, sharing a one-bedroom apartment and a car with his mother, a legal secretary. Without his own car, he said, it was hard to find work, and he could not afford to live elsewhere. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he said,	 But this summer has shaped up differently. He has a summer internship in New York with an off-Broadway theater group, the Culture Project, and is working as an assistant stage manager for one of its shows. The internship is unpaid, but Roybal could afford to take it because Connecticut College gave him a $3,000 stipend as part of its summer program subsidizing internships for juniors. If not for the stipend, he said, he would be waiting tables at home. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz

Some students even effectively end up paying tuition to do unpaid internships because some companies, concerned about labor laws, require students to receive academic credit for the experience. And so college administrators nationwide have become more concerned about access to internships at all socioeconomic levels.

, we know,	 Having lived in Pennsylvania for many years, we know, and indeed have set foot in, the town of Bellefonte, not Bellafonte or Bellafante, as Sullivan alternately calls it here. We'd hold this little glitch against him if it weren't for the fact that we've taken a few road trips ourselves, and know how loopy he must have been when he crossed the town line. He had driven Interstate 80 across Pennsylvania, and before that on the Ohio turnpike, and before that on other highways over several days all the way from Oregon, with his wife beside him clutching a TripTik, his kids sagging in the back seat and his so-tired-of-driving heart full of gratitude just because they were all still alive. This is the book to read if you're mourning the road trip you can't afford this summer. Sullivan (Rats) is funny and congenial, and he writes his travelogue in short sections that make your snack breaks and pit stops easy to plan. A veteran of many cross-country road trips (with varying combinations of children and possessions in tow), he's a great guide to the scenery outside the car and the melodrama within.

Its position regarding the demand that it suspend enrichment remains a determined no. On Saturday, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made a provocative, if symbolic, gesture by formally inaugurating a heavy-water plant. By Michael Slackman.  IRAQ (Baghdad, Iraq) -- Developments. By Damien Cave.  IRAQ-TROOPS-ENTERTAIN (Washington) -- A look at the military's efforts to bring entertainment to the troops in the form of a Vegas-type dance review. By Michael R. Gordon.  CHECHNYA-ABDUCTION (Grozny, Russia) -- The hurried effort to free Elina Ersenoyeva, who was abducted by masked men on the main street of Chechnya's capital on Aug. 17, began like many others. An account of her disappearance was compiled and circulated. Human rights groups and civil society organizations urged Russia to investigate, find her captors and work to secure her release. But the story has taken a surprising turn, even by the bizarre standards of violence, organized crime and brutal police activity that have accompanied Chechnya's lingering war. Ersenoveva, it turns out, was a secret bride of Shamil Basayev, the notorious Chechen terrorist leader who died in an explosion on July 11.  ITALY-FOREIGN-MINISTER (Rome) -- Interview with the Italian foreign minister, Massimo D'Alema. By Ian Fisher.  BOSNIA-POLITICS (Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina) -- A series of incidents that have raised ethnic tensions have been accompanied by a sharp increase in nationalist rhetoric that is worrying international officials here as the country prepares for parliamentary and presidential election on Oct. 1. By Nicholas Wood.  TURKEY-CALVINIST-ISLAM (Kayseri, Turkey) -- Many Europeans and secular Turks have dismissed this Anatolia as the other Turkey, a non-European backwater where women in head scarves are more prevalent than businessmen in pinstripes. Islam, they argue, never went through its own Reformation and so is not receptive to capitalism and innovation. Yet Kayseri and surrounding towns like Hacilar have produced so many successful Muslim entrepreneurs that the area has earned the title of Anatolian tiger. The region's mix of Muslim values, hard work and raging capitalism has even prompted sociologists to coin a new term to describe the phenomenon: Calvinist Islam. By Dan Bilefsky.  VENEZUELA-U.S. (Caracas, Venezuela) -- Washington formally protested Friday against Venezuela's seizure of cargo from a U.S. Embassy convoy. Venezuela defended the action, saying they had halted smuggling that flagrantly violated diplomatic protocol. (Summary from wires.) By Simon Romero  KATRINA-BODIES (New Orleans) -- Hurricane Katrina scattered bodies over hundreds of square miles, where water, heat and time distorted what many of the dead looked like in life. The system hastily conceived to collect, identify and release for burial hundreds of bodies was ill equipped to deal with wholesale catastrophe. Many families waited far too long for the release of identified bodies, delaying burial, prolonging grief. Working like wartime MASH units, pathologists, investigators and counselors eventually attached names to nearly 900 of the bodies they examined. But some 50 victims remain unknown to the world still, a year later. By Dan Barry.  The Katrina Year, the fifth article in a five-day series on the lasting effects of Hurricane Katrina a year after it hit New Orleans and the Gulf Coast.  With photos and graphic.  KATRINA-ORLEANS-FUTURE (New Orleans) -- At one edge of this city's future are the extravagant visions of its boosters. Awash in federal cash, the New Orleans they dream of will be an arts-infused mecca for youthful risk-takers, a boomtown where entrepreneurs can repair to cool French Quarter bars in ancient buildings after a hard day of deal making. At the other extreme are the gloomy predictions of the pessimists. New Orleans will be Detroit, they say, a sickly urban wasteland abandoned by the middle class. A moldering core will be surrounded by miles of vacant houses, with wide-open neighborhoods roamed by drug dealers and other criminals. The new New Orleans will be merely a grim amplification of its present unpromising self, the pessimists say. Somewhere between these unrealistic visions lies a glimpse of the city's real future a year after Hurricane Katrina, say many planners, demographers and others here who have been deeply involved in rebuilding. Like a half-completed drawing in a child's coloring book, the picture is starting to fill in. There are shadows and firmer outlines, a few promising, some of them menacing. By Adam Nossiter.  The Katrina Year, the sixth and final article in a five-day series on the lasting effects of Hurricane Katrina a year after it hit New Orleans and the Gulf Coast.  SUSPICIOUS-TRADING (Undated) -- The boom in corporate mergers is creating concern that illicit trading ahead of deal announcements is becoming a systemic problem. It is against the law to trade on inside information about an imminent merger, of course. But an analysis of the nation's biggest mergers over the last 12 months indicates that the securities of 41 percent of the companies receiving buyout bids exhibited abnormal and suspicious trading in the days and weeks before those deals became public. For those who bought shares during these periods of unusual trading, quick gains of as much as 40 percent were possible. By Gretchen Morgenson.  SCHOOLS-ENROLLMENT (Sterling, Va.) -- Some 55 million youngsters are enrolling for classes in the nation's schools this fall, making this the largest group of students in America's history and, in ethnic terms, the most dazzlingly diverse since waves of European immigrants washed through the public schools a century ago. By Sam Dillon.  TEAMSTERS-ELECTION (Washington) -- Tom Leedham, head of a Teamsters local in Oregon, is taking on the biggest name in labor: Hoffa. Leedham is seeking to unseat James P. Hoffa, the president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the son of the nation's most famous -- some would say infamous -- union leader, Jimmy Hoffa, who disappeared in 1975 outside a restaurant in Detroit. By Steven Greenhouse.  FLA-ROBBERIES (West Palm Beach, Fla.) -- Robberies of illegal immigrants have become a serious problem here in recent years, and the victims, mostly from Guatemala, often avoid reporting the crimes, fearing deportation. By Riki Altman and Terry Aguayo.  WEST-WILDFIRES (Denver) -- The wildfires of 2006 have been just about everywhere, from the plains of Texas and Nebraska to the high northern Rockies of Montana to the Nevada desert. The damage has been incremental and dispersed, but cumulatively no less devastating, with at least 7.1 million acres burned as of late this week, more than in any comparable period in 10 years, federal figures indicate. By Kirk Johnson.  CALIF-POLLUTION-FEE (Lathrop, Calif.) -- Developers and air quality regulators are locked in a legal battle over new construction fees for the California Central Valley intended to reduce the region's chronic smog problem. The fees, which went into effect in March in eight counties in this fast-growing valley, are the most far-reaching in the country in their effort to link development and air pollution. A legal campaign to have them thrown out is being watched closely in other parts of the state, including Southern California and the San Francisco Bay area, where officials say they hope to impose similar fees. By Carolyn Marshall.  RICH-COLUMN (Undated) -- The president brings the love to New Orleans. By Frank Rich.  BROOKS-COLUMN (Washington) -- In Tattoo Nation, everyone's a rebel. By David Brooks.  PUBLIC-EDITOR-COLUMN (Undated) -- Precisely false vs. approximately right. By Jack Rosenthal.
