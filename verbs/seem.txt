"27358"	"they"	"seem"	" For the the play's second act, in which Mom and Dad visit the garret apartment of their son's girlfriend (who is also Dad's mistress), the prodigiously talented Stephen Brimson Lewis has designed a 30-foot spiral staircase that reflects the domestic limbo in which all of the characters, for the moment, are lost.
