The ``real agenda'' of those favoring demolition, she asserts, is to boost real estate values and get rid of a black ghetto that would be an embarrassment when the Olympic Games are held here in 2000. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"86752"	"he"	"asserts"	" In general, he asserts, the experience of power has been a sobering one for Israelis who have seen that their swords cut two ways, both at the enemy and at themselves. This has led to the growth of some individualist culture and the desire to share the land and find a political solution with the Arabs. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"92435"	"he"	"asserts"	" For the competition this year, Rodzinski has grappled with the issue of ranking. For the first time, the top three winners will each receive the same cash prize, $20,000, as well as two years of tours and management provided by the foundation. Rodzinski is also touting a new evaluation system involving a computer program, which, he asserts, will better reflect the nuanced assessments of the individual judges and may correct the tendency of the judging process to settle on a play-it-down-the-middle winner, someone who generates the fewest objections rather than eliciting passionate and, inevitably, divided reactions. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"
"94305"	"he"	"asserts"	" ``When this religious war began in western Ukraine, it caused great moral damage,'' said Kurpita. ``Many people's faith was not that strong and, psychologically, they could not stand the pressure and so they left the church,'' although, he asserts, some are now returning. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"97756"	"he"	"asserts"	" In proportion to population size, the Palestinian death toll of 700 in the past year's conflict with Israel ``is equivalent to nine times the number killed in the terrorist attack in the United States,'' said Mustafa Barghouthi, president of the Union of Palestinian Medical Relief Committees. The majority of the dead, he asserts, were innocent civilians _ like those at the World Trade Center _ ``killed when going about their daily business: at home, at work, at school, walking the streets, in their cars.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"100064"	"he"	"asserts"	" But while unwilling to select a specific wine, Melka readily reveals what he looks for in a wine: personality, character, finesse and elegance _ qualities, he asserts, found in virtually every wine-growing region of the world. That includes California, where he and his American-born wife, Cherie, laboratory manager at Silver Oak Cellars, have made their home since 1994. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"103956"	"he"	"asserts"	" What is certain, he asserts, is that Japan's defeat and the democratizing occupation by the United States brought about changes ``that are profound and rapid as those found in any revolutionary epoch in modern world history.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"110896"	"she"	"asserts"	" The floodgates open when Erika unexpectedly finds herself ardently pursued by a handsome, worshipful younger student, Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel), who idolizes her musicianship and imagines he is in love. But when he declares his passion in the conservatory's bathroom, Erika refuses to have sex. The two embark on an erotic journey to which Erika, in her infinite perversity, applies the same perfectionist standards she brings to her teaching of Schubert. That composer's dynamics, she asserts, range (like her own temperament) from ``scream to whisper, not loud to soft.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"114393"	"she"	"asserts"	" The stress, she asserts, forced her to take three medical leaves that have, together, kept her out of the classroom for three years. In the fascinating, chatty personal chronology she has posted on her Web site (www.adrianpiper.com) she describes herself collapsing from physical exhaustion at the end of fall and spring semesters, year after year. She writes about suffering from a rare spine condition that could only be improved by long sessions of yoga she no longer has the strength to continue.  A legacy of racism </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"114515"	"he"	"asserts"	" The United States, he asserts, is ``a leading terrorist state,'' basing his opinion on actions like its interventions in Central America, its imposition of sanctions on Iraq, its support for General Suharto in Indonesia and its backing of what he calls ``Israeli atrocities'' in the occupied territories. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"114654"	"he"	"asserts"	" Lugar, the only congressional negotiator who did not sign the compromise farm bill developed by a committee of House and Senate conferees, is expected to lead the Republican side of the debate, maintaining that the new bill will provide subsidies mostly to large agribusiness rather than family farms. And, he asserts, it will add to the federal budget deficit. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"116450"	"she"	"asserts"	" This critic, at any rate, persisted, partly because, as Ronell points out, stupidity is familiar but not familiarly understood. It has, she asserts, ``largely escaped the screening systems of philosophical inquiry.'' The Greeks thought of it as something that disqualified one from public life and citizenship. Flaubert called it ``something unshakeable.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"119641"	"he"	"asserts"	" For Chris Howell, winemaker and general manager for Cain Vineyard&AMP;Winery, the issue of when a vintage is assessed begs a larger question. ``Do great wines taste great from day one?'' he asks. History, he asserts, suggests otherwise. Numerous vintages rated average at first have been subsequently proven better than first predicted. The opposite happens too. Howell cites the 1985 vintage of Bordeaux, rated above average to excellent by several critics, but today a vintage that, many say, hasn't held up. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"

MARKET-WATCH (Undated) _ The Market Watch column with subject to come. By Alex Berenson.  OTHER FEATURES  McKINSEY-BACKLASH (Undated) _ Management consultants, who in the late 1990s had experienced annual double-digit growth in revenue, are suffering the aftereffects of the bursting of the technology stock bubble and the recession. The collapse of Enron made matters even worse, especially for McKinsey, which had praised Enron in internal publications as a company of the future. Interviews with current and former McKinsey partners and associates suggest that the much-vaunted industry leader is still trying to figure out how to cope. By Jonathan D. Glater. (2,100 words)  RECRUITING-DIRECTORS (Undated) _ A recent survey of the chief executives of Fortune 500 companies shows corporations are eager to strengthen their boards: 43 percent planned to replace or add at least two directors this year and 92 percent no longer wanted to fill board seats with friends or close associates, but were seeking to create a board that would ``push back.'' By Susan Stellin. (1,000 words)  FOOD-FUSION (New York) _ Judging by some recent business reports, licensing agreements and mergers are inspiring the linking of nonfood brand names with packaged foods. Already on supermarket shelves is the successful synergy of Jack Daniels Grilling Sauces. How tame. Where are the marketers' creative juices? Mimi Sheraton offers some ideas for companies eager to jump on this bandwagon. For example, Prada Pasta, an all-black pasta in fashionable shapes such as navels and nipples, and Enron Eat-All-You-Want-Diet-Meals with overstated nutrients and underreported calories. (700 words)  STUDENT-DEBT (Undated) _ On July 1, interest rates on federal Stafford loans, the most common type of education loan, will drop by nearly two percentage points, to 4.06 percent from 5.99 percent, the lowest rate in the program's 37-year history. Many recent graduates will be able to refinance their loans and lock in the low rates, but there are other ways they can cut their debt. By Beth Kobliner. (1,500 words)  INVESTING  INVEST-RISK (Undated) _ A new study by Moody's Investors Service notes a sobering truth: the stock market is very risky. It has been so volatile, in fact, that when swings in market prices are factored in, between Jan., 1, 1990 and the end of May, corporate bonds outperformed stocks on a risk-adjusted basis. By Abby Schultz. (1,300 words)  INVEST-HEINZ (Undated) _ By spinning off lagging brands, H.J. Heinz says it will build a revitalized, high-growth company on a foundation of ketchup and frozen foods. But investors are divided on whether Heinz can increase earnings per share fast enough to justify a cut in the steady dividend yield that had been one of the stock's chief attractions. Many analysts are withholding a verdict until Heinz can provide proof. By Sherri Day. (900 words)  COLUMNS  STRATEGIES-COLUMN (Undated) _ More than 30 percent of diversified equity mutual funds now have deferred loads, the commissions are charged when the funds are sold, not when they are bought. The popularity of deferred loads, however, is a mystery. By Mark Hulbert. (700 words)  ECON-COLUMN (Undated) _ One might easily conclude that the estate tax discourages both working and saving, by taking away a portion of whatever is left over from those activities at the time of death. Douglas J. Holtz-Eakin, the chief economist at the president's Council of Economic Advisers, takes the argument a step further. By discouraging saving, he asserts, the tax hurts investment in the economy and leads to lower real wages. Yet the scientific evidence is far from clear. By Daniel Altman. (800 words)  MARKET-INSIGHT (Undated) _ The Market Insight Q&AMP;A with subject to come. By Kenneth L. Gilpin.  SHORTS  GOLF-CHEATING (Undated) _ A new survey finds that all is not always fair on the fairways. Eighty-two percent of the 401 senior executives questioned last spring, nearly all of whom played golf, admitted to cheating during a game, including moving the ball or taking a mulligan without asking. And 87 percent say they have played with someone who cheated on their golf score. But only 20 percent of the executives said they would let a client win if they thought it would help get business.  AUTOS  AUTOS-HUMMERS (Tijuana, Mexico) _ Rod Hall, who has participated in each of the Baja 1000 offroad desert races, this year tested the course in what is arguably the world's most formidable off-highway vehicle: the Hummer H2. The conclusion: For the most serious off-road adventures the H1 is still the ticket. With the H2, however, on-road comfort is balanced with off-pavement capability; it is easier to drive and it costs $50,000 less. For most people, it won't be a difficult choice. By Cheryl Jensen. (1,600 words)  With photo and graphic.  AUTOS-HUMMER-COMPARE (Undated) _ H1 lovers will probably look at the H2 and say, ``But that's not a REAL Hummer.'' H2 buyers could counter by saying: ``Why would I WANT a real Hummer? I'm not going to attack Iraq and I'd rather be comfortable.'' There are tradeoffs: the H2 has six inches less ground clearance than the H1 and can also ford only 20 inches of water, compared to the H1's 30 inches. By Cheryl Jensen. (320 words)  With photo.

(Coded `f')  COVER STORIES  WORLDCOM (Undated) _ When Worldcom revealed its accounting fraud this week, it inadvertently showed why other telecom companies were having such a hard time measuring up _ how could they match margins that weren't real? By Seth Schiesel. 2500 words.  With graphic.  PARAMOUNT (Hollywood) _ ``The Sum of All Fears'' from Paramount Pictures, is approaching a respectable but not spectacular $100 million after four weeks. It lacks box-office sizzle, but it is a well-planned, well-executed _ and, above all, reliable _ summer hit. That is just what Hollywood has come to expect from Paramount under the unusually long-lived management team of Sherry Lansing and Jonathan Dolgen. By Geraldine Fabrikant. 2500 words.  With photo and graphic.  INSIDER-TRADING (Undated) _ They're back. Insider-trading investigations, which haunted Wall Street nearly a generation ago as prosecutors pursued Ivan F. Boesky and others, have returned to center stage. Suddenly, SEC officials are avidly combing through piles of trading records involving huge numbers of stock sales by executives and others privy to confidential information. In particular, they are looking for cases against executives tied to the accounting and disclosure problems that have tainted a growing number of the nation's largest corporations.

ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS  (Coded `e')  COVER STORIES  THEATER-HARLEM-SONG (New York) _ The Apollo Theater is the house that Ella built. And the Duke and the Count and Sarah Vaughan and Pearl Bailey and Moms Mabley and James Brown and Stevie Wonder. Now, George C. Wolfe, who is also producer of the Joseph Papp Public Theater, is in the house on a mission: to write and direct ``Harlem Song,'' an original musical about Harlem, in Harlem, a show that would give the Apollo a Broadway swagger and a vast new audience. By Peter Marks. (2,000 words)  With photos NYT 20,21 send on June 26.  MUSIC-MINORITY-REPORT (Undated) _ John Williams' spare, moody, dark and thoroughly modern score for ``Minority Report'' is interlaced with striking snippets of lush masterworks: the second theme from Schubert's ``Unfinished'' Symphony; the Bach chorale known as ``Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring''; the lopsided Waltz in Tchaikovsky's ``Pathetique'' Symphony; and the Minuet from a Haydn string quartet. Even by the cautious standards of modern-day classical programming these examples from the 18th and 19th centuries are a staid lot and seem especially odd in the context of a glossy action film set in 2054. By James Oestreich. (1,700 words)  With photos NYT 22,23 of 6-26.  TV-ISRAEL (Tel Aviv, Israel) _ As suicide bombers detonate charges, ambulances ferry away the wounded and burial societies locate the shredded bodies of the dead, ``Only in Israel,'' a television show, is finding improbable yet cathartic humor in what Jews here call the ``matzav,'' the situation. By Samuel G. Freedman. (1,800 words)  With photos NYT 24, 25 of 6-26.  THEATER  THEATER-ROSEMARY-HARRIS (New York) _ In November, Rosemary Harris will celebrate her 50th anniversary on the New York stage, performing in works by Shakespeare, Noel Coward, Samuel Beckett, Neil Simon, Tennessee Williams and J.B. Priestley. On Broadway, she has had eight Tony nominations, including taking the best actress prize her first time out in 1966 for ``The Lion In Winter.'' Lest her resume seem too highfalutin, Harris is now on screen in ``Spider-Man,'' playing Aunt May, and has signed to do the sequel. ``If you drop your popcorn, you'll miss me,'' she said, while expressing delight that ``6-year-olds now are wanting my autograph.'' By Matt Wolf. (1,200 words)  With photo NYT26 of 6-26.  TELEVISION/RADIO  TV-INSOMNIAC (New York) _ In the normal order of things, television might have rewarded Dave Attell's razor wit with a sitcom, but two years ago, Attell came to Comedy Central with a better idea. The germ of it was that he doesn't sleep much. Attell envisioned a show in which the camera would follow him as he finished a gig on the road and descended into the town's night culture. By liberating Attell from his small stage, Comedy Central has helped create ``Insomniac,'' a robust hybrid genre: part reality TV, part travel and part comedy. By Joe Hooper.

TV-CHILDREN-UNDERGROUND (Undated) _ Other filmmakers have covered the plight of Romanian children in orphanages, but Edet Belzberg and Jonathan Oppenheim _ director and editor of ``Children Underground'' _ have gone beyond the orphanages to film the children who fled orphanages and abusive families for the safety of the streets. ``Children Underground,'' which was nominated for an Academy Award this year and will be shown on Cinemax on July 9, is the story of five children, ages 8 to 16, living in a subway station whose name, Victory Square, provided a grim commentary on Romanian society following the brutal regime of Nicolae Ceaucescu. The sad thing, Belzberg said, is the film is just a fraction of what the children endure and these ``are the best years of the children's lives.'' By Nancy Ramsey. (1,200 words)  FILM  FILM-READ-MY-LIPS (Paris) _ Carla, the heroine of Jacques Audiard's new film ``Read My Lips,'' is a 35-year-old partly-deaf secretary. She is lonely in her personal life and mocked by her male superiors at work until the day she meets Paul, an ex-con whom she hires as a trainee. Soon these outsiders discover that they can help each other. In giving him a job, Carla, played by Emmanuelle Devos, gives Paul (Vincent Cassel) outward respectability. Paul helps Carla to avenge her various slights through blackmail and intimidation. Meanwhile, she is drawn into helping him in a robbery by using her ability to read lips. The film, which opens in New York on Friday, won three Cesars, including the best actress award. By Laura Winters. (1,400 words)  With photos NYT31, 32 of 6-26.  FILM-POWERPUFF-GIRLS (Undated) _ The Powerpuff Girls are flying off television sets to invade movie matinees. High-minded Blossom, hot-tempered Buttercup and sweetie-pie Bubbles are sister supertots who fight crime in the cartoon metropolis Townsville. Round, bug-eyed and shin-height, they are unlikely to try low-slung jeans on their circular, op-art bodies. Instead, the Powerpuff Girls enjoy airborne antics, saving their city and then wrecking it again. By Virginia Heffernan. (700 words)  MUSIC  MUSIC-STROUSE (New York) _ Charles Strouse, best known as the composer of ``Bye, Bye Birdie,'' ``Golden Boy,'' ``Annie'' and other successful musicals, wrote his first piano concerto 50 years ago.

ART/ARCHITECTURE  EXHIBIT-PICASSO-MATISSE (London) _ From 1906, when Matisse and Picasso met in Paris, until Matisse's death in 1954, the artists watched each other closely and responded until eventually the Paris art world was polarized into Matisse-ites and Picasso-ites. An exhibit of 131 of their works at the Tate Modern has brought this friendship and rivalry into focus. As Matisse said of Picasso many years after they met, ``Nobody ever looked as closely at my work as he did, nor as closely at his work as I did.'' By John Russell. (1,080 words)  EXHIBIT-SONNABEND (Undated) _ While showing artists like Roy Lichtenstein, Jasper Johns, Robert Morris and Donald Judd in her galleries, Ileana Sonnabend was also buying their work for herself. No one, not even Sonnabend, 87, knows how many paintings, photographs and sculptures are in her private collection, which is largely in storage. Now 81 works by 54 artists are being shown in ``From Pop to Now: Selections From the Sonnabend Collection'' at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. Sonnabend's story began in 1957 when she and her first husband, Leo Castelli, founded the Castelli Gallery in their living room. The show's curator describes his job as simply ``to select the best of the best.'' By Ted Loos. (1,000 words).  With photo NYT35 of 6-26.  ARCHITECTURE-STONE-ECOTARIUM (Worcester, Mass.) _ To Michael Singer, the Vermont artist who redesigned Edward Durrell Stone's EcoTarium, the lessons learned say more about redemption than rehabilitation. According to Singer, the much-maligned building that opened in 1971 wasn't bad at all, just misunderstood and misused. In fact, it was ``a gem,'' he said. By Clifford A. Pearson. (1,400 words)  DANCE  DANCE-SUMMER-WORKSHOPS (Undated) _ Thousands of young dancers are spending summer vacations at the barre in programs like those at Jacob's Pillow, where there have been workshops since the 1930s, to one held for the first time by the Rockettes, at the University of Alabama. For the dancers the workshops are a chance to stay in shape, meet professionals and learn new techniques. By Iris Fanger. (1,350 words)  With photo NYT36 of 6-26.

U.S.-SUMMER-TRAVEL (Undated) _ For many Americans planning a summer vacation, the destination this year will probably be closer to home, and reached by car, offering some welcome news to parts of the United States where drive-in tourism came close to collapse after Sept. 11. From South Dakota, where state tourism officials are predicting a crush of visitors to Mount Rushmore, to the Green Mountains of Vermont, where inns are reporting a surge of reservations, there is relief over surveys showing that Americans are eager to travel again. By Philip Shenon and Susan Catto. (1,600 words)  With photo NYT6 of June 25.  PRACTICAL-TRAVELER (Undated) _ Cities across the country are creating promotions. There are two-for-one hotel and restaurant deals, hotel stays bundled with tickets to attractions, and coupons for discounts on everything from pretzels to balloon flights. The Internet simplifies researching these deals. By Martha Stevenson Olson. (1,700 words)  TRAVEL-RUSSIA-U.S. (Moscow) _ A decade after the collapse of the Soviet Union, visa requirements between the United States and Russia remain mired in Cold-War practices. Following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, the United States imposed restrictions on men between the ages of 16 and 45 applying for visas, regardless of nationality. Applicants must complete a questionnaire detailing education, work experience, travel in the past 10 years and military service. Russia retaliated by imposing the same restriction on American men of the same ages and using a strikingly similar form. By Steven Lee Myers. (890 words)  TRAVEL-WISCONSIN (Undated) _ Trailing candidates through the key primary states as a political correspondent many years ago, R.W. Apple Jr. decided that, California aside, he liked Wisconsin best. Recently he returned by car on backroads, stopping at restaurants like the Norske Nook in Osseo, which bakes three dozen kinds of pies from scratch daily, and witnessing the production of 18-pound wheels of Grand Cru Gruyere in Monroe. He still found time for a big city stop at the Milwaukee Art Museum. By R.W. Apple Jr. (1,800 words)  SHORT STORIES  TRAVEL-INDIAN-HOTELS (Undated) _ A series of hotels on Indian lands are opening. Among them, a 1,200-room hotel adjoining the Mohegan Sun casino, on Mohegan tribal land in Uncasville, Conn.; and the 500-room Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Resort and Spa on the Gila River Indian Community Reservation, southeast of the Phoenix airport. By Joseph Siano.

By Bob Tedeschi, Marjorie Connelly, Susan Catto and Fran Handman.

By Florence Stickney (1,100 words)  FINANCIAL  (Coded `f')  COVER STORIES  WORLDCOM (Undated) _ When WorldCom revealed its accounting fraud this week, it inadvertently showed why other telecom companies were having such a hard time measuring up _ how could they match margins that weren't real? By Seth Schiesel. 2500 words.  With graphic.  PARAMOUNT (Hollywood) _ ``The Sum of All Fears'' from Paramount Pictures is approaching a respectable but not spectacular $100 million after four weeks. It lacks box-office sizzle, but it is a well-planned, well-executed _ and, above all, reliable _ summer hit. That is just what Hollywood has come to expect from Paramount under the unusually long-lived management team of Sherry Lansing and Jonathan Dolgen. By Geraldine Fabrikant. 2500 words.  With photos NYT 7,8 of 6-28 and graphic.  INSIDER-TRADING (Undated) _ They're back. Insider-trading investigations, which haunted Wall Street nearly a generation ago as prosecutors pursued Ivan F. Boesky and others, have returned to center stage. Suddenly, SEC officials are avidly combing through piles of trading records involving huge numbers of stock sales by executives and others privy to confidential information. In particular, they are looking for cases against executives tied to the accounting and disclosure problems that have tainted a growing number of the nation's largest corporations. By Stephen Labaton and David Leonhardt. 2500 words.  With graphic.  MARKET-WATCH (Undated) _ The Market Watch column: Shares in Electronic Data Systems plunged last week, mainly on concerns over its relationship with the WorldCom. EDS manages computer systems for companies, including WorldCom, which paid EDS about $600 million last year under a contract set to run until 2010. Some short-sellers _ who profit when stocks fall _ say EDS' problems run deep, pointing to red flags in its most recent quarterly report to the Securities and Exchange Commission. By Alex Berenson.  With graphic.  OTHER FEATURES  McKINSEY-BACKLASH (Undated) _ Management consultants, who in the late 1990s had experienced annual double-digit growth in revenue, are suffering the aftereffects of the bursting of the technology stock bubble and the recession. The collapse of Enron made matters even worse, especially for McKinsey, which had praised Enron in internal publications as a company of the future. Interviews with current and former McKinsey partners and associates suggest that the much-vaunted industry leader is still trying to figure out how to cope. By Jonathan D. Glater.

RECRUITING-DIRECTORS (Undated) _ A recent survey of the chief executives of Fortune 500 companies shows corporations are eager to strengthen their boards: 43 percent planned to replace or add at least two directors this year and 92 percent no longer wanted to fill board seats with friends or close associates, but were seeking to create a board that would ``push back.'' By Susan Stellin. (1,000 words)  FOOD-FUSION (New York) _ Judging by some recent business reports, licensing agreements and mergers are inspiring the linking of nonfood brand names with packaged foods. Already on supermarket shelves is the successful synergy of Jack Daniels Grilling Sauces. How tame. Where are the marketers' creative juices? Mimi Sheraton offers some ideas for companies eager to jump on this bandwagon. For example, Prada Pasta, an all-black pasta in fashionable shapes such as navels and nipples, and Enron Eat-All-You-Want-Diet-Meals with overstated nutrients and underreported calories. (700 words)  STUDENT-DEBT (Undated) _ On July 1, interest rates on federal Stafford loans, the most common type of education loan, will drop by nearly two percentage points, to 4.06 percent from 5.99 percent, the lowest rate in the program's 37-year history. Many recent graduates will be able to refinance their loans and lock in the low rates, but there are other ways they can cut their debt. By Beth Kobliner. (1,500 words)  With graphic.  INVESTING  INVEST-RISK (Undated) _ A new study by Moody's Investors Service notes a sobering truth: the stock market is very risky. It has been so volatile, in fact, that when swings in market prices are factored in, between Jan. 1, 1990, and the end of May, corporate bonds outperformed stocks on a risk-adjusted basis. By Abby Schultz. (1,300 words)  With photo NYT 23 of 6-28 and graphic.  INVEST-HEINZ (Undated) _ By spinning off lagging brands, H.J. Heinz says it will build a revitalized, high-growth company on a foundation of ketchup and frozen foods. But investors are divided on whether Heinz can increase earnings per share fast enough to justify a cut in the steady dividend yield that had been one of the stock's chief attractions. Many analysts are withholding a verdict until Heinz can provide proof. By Sherri Day. (900 words)  With graphic.

COLUMNS  STRATEGIES-COLUMN (Undated) _ More than 30 percent of diversified equity mutual funds now have deferred loads, the commissions are charged when the funds are sold, not when they are bought. The popularity of deferred loads, however, is a mystery. By Mark Hulbert. (700 words)  With graphic.  ECON-COLUMN (Undated) _ One might easily conclude that the estate tax discourages both working and saving, by taking away a portion of whatever is left over from those activities at the time of death. Douglas J. Holtz-Eakin, the chief economist at the president's Council of Economic Advisers, takes the argument a step further. By discouraging saving, he asserts, the tax hurts investment in the economy and leads to lower real wages. Yet the scientific evidence is far from clear. By Daniel Altman. (800 words)  With graphic.  MOVING-EXPENSES (Undated) _ How to save money on your next move. (Hint: The lowest bid may not be the best choice.) By Sarah Milstein.  AUTOS  AUTOS-HUMMERS (Tijuana, Mexico) _ Rod Hall, who has participated in each of the Baja 1000 offroad desert races, this year tested the course in what is arguably the world's most formidable off-highway vehicle: the Hummer H2. The conclusion: For the most serious off-road adventures the H1 is still the ticket. With the H2, however, on-road comfort is balanced with off-pavement capability; it is easier to drive and it costs $50,000 less. For most people, it won't be a difficult choice. By Cheryl Jensen. (1,600 words)  With photo NYT 20 of 6-28 and graphic.  AUTOS-HUMMER-COMPARE (Undated) _ H1 lovers will probably look at the H2 and say, ``But that's not a REAL Hummer.'' H2 buyers could counter by saying: ``Why would I WANT a real Hummer? I'm not going to attack Iraq and I'd rather be comfortable.'' There are tradeoffs: the H2 has six inches less ground clearance than the H1 and can also ford only 20 inches of water, compared to the H1's 30 inches. By Cheryl Jensen. (320 words)  With photo.  STYLE  (Coded `L'  LUXURY-POLO (Pine Plains, N.Y.) _ On a hot summer Sunday, on an emerald polo field, under a sky of cerulean blue, a gentleman in a checkered sports coat was heard uttering to a woman in a black lacquered straw hat: ``So, he actually did it, went and married the mistress? I'm shocked. I mean, really, it never ends.'' ``This one will,'' the woman said flatly, and then bit into an hors d'oeuvre of broiled scallop topped with a dollop of creme fraiche. Up at the pinnacle of that 10 percent of Americans who possess 71 percent of the country's wealth exists an even smaller group of those rare people F. Scott Fitzgerald had in mind when he made the often-quoted observation that the very rich are different from you and me. By Guy Trebay.  MARTHA-BROKER (Undated) _ It was on the social treadmill that a certain slice of New York cannot imagine ever stepping off that Peter Bacanovic met Douglas Faneuil. Bacanovic was a Merrill Lynch broker with prominent friends such as Nan Kempner and Martha Stewart. Fanueil had come a long way from his high school days, when he worked in a pizza parlor in suburban Boston. The polish he had picked up in college at Bennington and Vassar, and then as a young guest at the kind of parties that turn up in the society columns of Women's Wear Daily, made him ideal for a job that mixes business with black-tie evenings. By Alex Kuczynski  OUTCAST-BEHAVIOR (Undated) _ It's a strange feature of the summer social season that the most talked-about invitations in town are not to parties on Lily Pond Lane in East Hampton but rather for meetings with investigators from Congress or the U.S. attorney's office. The sheer number of prominent people in hot water has created a new social conundrum: the need for a code of behavior that is outside the scope of all known etiquette manuals. According to seasoned hosts, friends of the scandalized and a few manners experts, there are no clear dos and don'ts. By Warren St. John.  With photos NYT 10,11 of 6-28.  MEN'S-FASHION (Undated) _ Men, too, engage in fantasies about the transformative impact of clothes but they are fantasies not all too frequently conjured even in some of the most stylish corners of the world's fashion capitals. It is now conventional wisdom that design underwent a process of democratization in the 1990s that made it possible for an individual of moderate means to own a piece of Michael Graves' creativity in the form, say, of a tea kettle purchased at Target. The movement also made it a requirement of the modern urban male that he possess a certain level of literacy on the subject of style. By Ginia Bellafante.

"123130"	"he"	"asserts"	" It could be a moment right out of an episode of HBO's ``Real Sports'' _ Jim Lampley interviewing a proud heavyweight champ who is sitting behind prison bars, stripped of his title after being convicted of rape. The boxer gives a couple of common-sense answers to questions: he refutes the contention that boxing is a sport. People play baseball, they don't play boxing, he asserts, and proclaims himself a gladiator. When asked about his guilt, he goes ballistic, and the interview is over. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"

"129881"	"he"	"asserts"	" By no means does Wilkinson turn his back on the concept of salvation by grace that is the bedrock of most of Christendom.

"139090"	"it"	"asserts"	" Further, it asserts, the firm ``failed to conduct independent audits on the 17 Parmalat subsidiaries which it was engaged to audit'' from 1999 to 2003, ``but rather participated in the falsification of audit confirmation documents.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200401.gz"
"144797"	"she"	"asserts"	" As they worked on the final contract, she asserts, Army officials met on Feb. 26, 2003, to discuss tasks and costs, and Kellogg Brown &amp; Root representatives were invited to attend. Eventually the discussions turned to matters that Ms. Greenhouse concluded were outside the scope of information K.B.R. should be privy to before the contract was fully defined, the letter stated. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"146838"	"he"	"asserts"	" Partly, he asserts, the growth of the California wine business is the result of a particularly American optimism that science and can-do willpower can accomplish anything. But the story of the last decade, Kramer says, is of how the wine business has been forced to confront the limitations of mere desire. The realization that winemakers cannot create greatness simply by improving their skills has led them to discover what the Europeans have known all along: Where you plant the grapevines is crucial. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"150776"	"he"	"asserts"	" In a barn next door, hundreds of cows munch on feed or roll in sand pits. Critics contend that the conditions are inhumane because the barns are crowded and the cows rarely go outside. But Assen, a friendly 23-year-old, says the Holsteins are perfectly happy. The size of the farm, he asserts, keeps prices low. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"151498"	"he"	"asserts"	" But his Arab heritage, he asserts, often makes the media's hero-making machinery grind to a halt. Meanwhile, he and his American wife live in what he sees as a lusher Promised Land, a horse farm in Tennessee. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"156960"	"he"	"asserts"	" His stepdaughter, he asserts, is not. And so he said he keeps her at arm's length, rejecting her demands for money, which he believes she will use to buy drugs, and ignoring her complaints about police officers. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"

"162709"	"he"	"asserts"	" Abramson himself goes further, suggesting that such concern undermines the very idea of a jury as deliberative body. Everyone has preconceptions, he says. I have preconceptions, but I'm capable of entering into a dialogue with someone else where I have my preconception challenged. That dialogue, he asserts, is what jury deliberations are all about. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"168770"	"he"	"asserts"	" Almost five years after he retired, Welch remains as confident and outspoken as ever, Fortune reports. I'm perfectly prepared to change, Welch told the magazine. Change is great. And, he asserts, he sees no reason to back away from the principles by which he and other star CEOs managed. Sorry, Jack, but we don't buy it, Fortune responds. Jack's Rules don't work anymore. Fortune proposed some new rules tailored to the current business environment. Today, being No. 1 or No. 2 in your market won't protect you; it's better to be agile and find a niche. ExxonMobil isn't the model, Apple is. And CEO charisma must take a back seat to CEO courage, the magazine says. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"
