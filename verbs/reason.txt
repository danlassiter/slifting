Times News Service  In the weeks since President Clinton announced the closing of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House, tourists and native Washingtonians have had to make numerous adjustments.  About 26,000 cars and trucks drove that part of Pennsylvania Avenue between 15th and 17th Streets every day. Now, traffic snakes out in all directions, clogging downtown streets and making drive-by tourism a thing of the past.  At the same time, recreationists have discovered nirvana. Blissfully peaceful and free from choking exhaust, the unencumbered expanse of the White House's front yard is an oasis of serenity. It has become one of the best Rollerblading runways in town. It provides commuting bicyclists a respite from the usual din, and the 5,000 tourists who visit the White House daily can gaze at the mansion without worrying about cars (or car bombers).  All this has occurred without changing a thing to prevent the kinds of assaults that have bedeviled the Secret Service. As evidenced shortly after the losing of Pennsylvania Avenue, a person can still scale the fence behind the White House. One can, presumably, even still walk up to the front and fire a rifle through the fence.  But closing the main drag may be only the first step in new security precautions. Meanwhile, the new space has inspired esthetes to dream of what might be. As long as part of Pennsylvania Avenue is closed, they reason, why not do something in an organized way, much as envisioned by Washington's original designer, Pierre L'Enfant? The broad expanse might be turned into a vast pedestrian mall with fountains, benches, restrooms and trees, an idea that President Clinton has recently endorsed. Some have suggested a national competition for a design, similar to the contest held in 1982 for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.  While these plans ferment, local traffic engineers are trying to cope in the here and now. The biggest of the proposed changes would be the redirection of traffic on nearby streets. The next street north of Pennsylvania, H Street, now two-way, would be made one-way going east; -I Street, now one-way east, would go one-way west. John Payne, the District of Columbia's traffic engineer, says this would untangle some of the downtown traffic because cars coming from feeder roads like New York Avenue could more naturally blend in and speed up the crosstown flow.  Pedestrians venturing in and out of the traffic-free area may find it difficult to cross streets because lots of drivers are sticking to their old patterns. Payne said that this should eventually sort itself out, with the help of $200,000 worth of new signal work, signing and pavement markings at the 50 intersections in the immediate area. (The federal government is to pay for the changes _ a good thing, since the District is broke.) Contrary to published reports, Payne said, parking meters in the vicinity will not be eliminated. In fact, he said, more will be installed.  There are always the tour buses, but those who plan to take a bus face other problems. Consider the situation faced by Old Town Trolley Tours, which runs two-hour sightseeing trips around town. ``A lot of people take our tour who don't have time to get off and visit,'' said Mark Berlin, the company's general manager. But the clogged traffic has slowed down the trip. ``Anything that increases time cuts into our efficiency in taking people around the city,'' he said.  Beyond that, he said, ``This effectively has eliminated a view of the White House,'' at least from the bus, a disappointment for those who are unable to get off and walk a couple of blocks.  The White House is the jewel in the crown of Washington tourist attractions, with most of the 15 million people who visit every year wanting to see it (although less than a tenth of them actually take the free tour of the interior).  The tour buses have arrangements with local hotels for picking up passengers, and Berlin said that it would be difficult to change their long-established tour routes because it would mean reprinting all of the brochures the company hands out on the ride. ``And we don't want to drop a hotel that's been supporting us,'' he said.  Not only does the new setup obliterate the White House from view, but it also obscures some of the other, quainter sites, like Blair House, the Old Executive Office Building and Lafayette Park, where demonstrators warn of the end of the world and such.  c. 1995 N.Y. Times News Service  The Philippines government has tightened airport security in recent months, resulting in delays for travelers passing through Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport. Filipino officials said that passengers should arrive at the airport about two hours before their outbound flights and also expect delays when they arrive.  The tighter security measures include metal detectors, baggage screening and frisking of passengers at various checkpoints (female and male security personnel will search passengers of the same sex).  Airport security in east Asia has been scrutinized more closely after several bomb threats in that region earlier this year. In December, an explosive device that went off aboard a Philippine Airlines flight killed a Japanese tourist and injured several others.  Filipino officials said many of the new measures, which have been phased in over several months, were recommended by United States Federal Aviation Administration officials in April.  The task of tightening security, however, has been made more difficult by a fact of life in the Philippines _ travelers, both arriving and departing, are typically accompanied or met by at least several well-wishers, overwhelming an already busy security staff.  The FAA monitors about 250 foreign airports that serve as final points of departure for flights into the United States. On occasion, it issues recommendations for changes, and then issues warnings _ backed up by threats of canceled access to airports in the United States within 90 days _ if they are not put into effect.  c. 1995 N.Y. Times News Service  In celebration of the 219 years since the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the Library of Congress will display the only surviving fragment of its earliest-known draft. The fragment is part of an exhibition, ``Declaring Independence: Drafting the Documents,'' that will be on display for five days, beginning this June 29.  The exhibition also includes Thomas Jefferson's original handwritten, four-page draft of the Declaration of Independence. The draft has 86 revisions inscribed by a committee consisting of Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Robert Livingston, Roger Sherman and the Continental Congress.

On June 29, June 30 and July 3, hours are 9:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.; on July 1 and July 4, 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.  c. 1995 N.Y. Times News Service  The cellars, holding rooms and tunnel entrances used as part of the Underground Railroad by slaves escaping to freedom will be on view in several Brandon, Vt., homes on July 2. Brandon was one of many stops along the Underground Railroad, a well-organized system in use from the mid-1840s through the end of the Civil War that smuggled slaves from the South into the Northern states and Canada.  Of the stations in the Underground Network, at least 17 were known to have been homes in Brandon.  Of those, six were connected by a tunnel that ran from Conant Square to Pearl Street. And three of those homes were built by members of the prominent Conant family; each had hiding places in the cellars and entrances to the tunnel that ultimately led to the home of Rodney V. Marsh. An abolitionist and lawyer, Marsh was best known as the chairman of the Dred Scott decision committee, which wrote the report that in 1858 became the law making Vermont the first state in the union to outlaw slavery. Built in 1853, the Marsh home consists of a maze of rooms, including more than 50 closets that were used for hiding, 8 escape stairways from various floor levels, and a tunnel connecting the cellar to the outdoors.  Visitors will receive a brochure guiding them through the route and detailing the history and architecture of each property. The walking tour takes about an hour and a half to complete and costs $5.  Brandon is between Rutland and Middlebury on U.S. Route 7, at the foothills of the Green Mountain National Forest. For information, call the Brandon Area Chamber of Commerce at (802)247-6401.  c. 1995 N.Y. Times News Service  Beginning this month, tourists visiting Britain's Canterbury Cathedral in Kent will be charged a $3.20 entry fee; $1.60 for children, based on $1.60 to the pound.  Canterbury is joining the ranks of other British cathedrals, including St. Paul's and Ely Cathedral, that charge admission to tourists in order to offset high operating costs. Cathedral officials say Canterbury costs over $11,000 a day to run, and the voluntary system that has been operating only netted about 20 cents per visitor.  Visitors who use the building for prayer will not be charged, nor will people attending early-morning services or evensong on Monday to Friday. There is no charge to visit the cathedral on Sunday.  Canterbury Cathedral dates back to the coming of the first archbishop, Augustine, from Rome in A.D. 597, but the earliest part of the present building is the great Romanesque crypt built circa 1100. The building is noteworthy for its medieval tombs, including those of King Henry IV and Edward the Black Prince. Information: (01-227) 762-862.  c. 1995 N.Y. Times News Service  Florida is cutting back on the 24-hour security at highway rest stops it instituted two years ago after the murder of a British tourist at a rest area about 30 miles from Tallahassee. As a result of government budget cuts, the armed security guards will patrol the welcome centers only from dusk to dawn beginning July 1.  Since the private security companies began staffing the service plazas, they report that guards spend most of their time assisting motorists, shooing off panhandlers or corralling drunken drivers.  Fearing for Florida's image after several tourist murders, Gov. Lawton Chiles ordered round-the-clock guards for the 72 service plazas on the Interstate and Florida's Turnpike at an annual cost of nearly $10 million.  ``From a crime prevention aspect, I don't think it was necessary. It was a multimillion-dollar response to one incident,'' said Gary Stogner from the Florida Division of Tourism. ``However, steps like that helped us regain confidence around the world.''  c. 1995 N.Y. Times News Service  When the Steamtown National Historic Site in Scranton, Pa., stages its grand opening July 1, visitors will have the chance to judge for themselves whether it belongs in the same National Parks system as Mount Rushmore and the St. Louis arch.  Steamtown, which occupies the former Scranton Yards of the Delaware, Lackawanna &AMP; Western Railroad, aims to tell the story of main-line steam railroading from 1850 through its demise a century later when the diesel engine supplanted the iron horse. The centerpiece of the 60-acre park, which was officially added to the parks system in 1986, is a working turntable and roundhouse. The five-year-old building and restoration project cost $66 million.  While some of the 16 original stalls have been restored and will be used for the comings and goings of steam engines, three are part of a new technology museum.  There is also a railroad history museum, a 250-seat theater for films and a new visitors' center. A scale model of the yard, circa 1937, will depict the heyday of steam; an observation platform will allow visitors to view the original switch yard and many of the park's 29 locomotives and some 85 steam-era cars.  A two-hour rail journey between Scranton and Moscow, Pa., in vintage rolling stock pulled by a coal-burning engine will cost $7, $3 for children (during the Fourth of July weekend, $8 and $6).  Admission to the park, open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily, is free. A fee of $6, $2 for children, will be charged for entry into the museum complex after the opening weekend, when museum entrance and all events are free.
