"105371"	"they"	"lost"	" Tony Eason was the starting quarterback for the New England Patriots the first time the team went to the Super Bowl, in 1986. Unlike their descendants on Sunday, they lost, 46-10, to the Chicago Bears, who sacked Eason three times.

, they said,	 Editors at the paper and the cartoonist, Klaus Stuttmann, said the cartoon was intended as a commentary on an ongoing debate in Germany about whether the army should be used as a security force when the World Cup is held here this summer.

, he said,	 Hans Nordby, research strategist at Property and Portfolio Research in Boston, said those numbers underreport the real level of speculation in those markets because many buyers disguise their intentions when they get their mortgages. As those speculators flood the market, he said, they will put pressure on other sellers to cut prices, too. A rising or sinking tide affects all boats, Nordby said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200602.gz
, he said,	 Still, a sell-off in speculative condos is unlikely to start a widespread housing crash because condos were more overbuilt than single-family homes during the recent boom, said Joseph Gyourko, professor of real estate and finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. But weakness in the condo market, he said, is a consistent indicator that the great boom has really ended. </P> 	nyt_eng_200602.gz
, he said,	 This is not the first time that condo markets have been influenced by investors. In the late 1980s, developers converted thousands of condo units in the Northeast and many of them were bought by speculators, said Karl E. Case, an economist at Wellesley College. Many of those investors, he said, ended up losing money when they sold in the early 1990s. It was ugly, he said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200602.gz
, he said,	 In Miami, where there appears to be a large overhang of investor properties, sellers are still making profits, said Ron Shuffield, president of Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell Realtors. But with the inventory of available condos having jumped from about 5,400 listings at the end of December 2004 to about 12,750 now, he said, asking prices have come down in the last three or four months. Shuffield said he was confident that there would eventually be takers for most of those condos because of the influx of buyers from Latin America and Europe as well as baby boomers from the Northeast. </P> 	nyt_eng_200602.gz

That one, they said, emerged around 100 million years ago -- long before Yurlunggur -- and may not have become extinct until 50,000 years ago. It could have overlapped with human history in Australia, they said, because the first aborigine people are believed to have reached Australia from the Asian continent sometime between 60,000 and 40,000 years ago. </P> 	nyt_eng_200602.gz

, it seems,	 Since losing the man whom Bill France Jr., then NASCAR's chairman and CEO, called our greatest driver, Earnhardt's greatest legacy, it seems, is the impact he had on the growth of a sport. At the time, NASCAR stood ready to skyrocket into the American mainstream with a lucrative new television deal with Fox Sports/FX and NBC Sports/TNT. But it was Earnhardt's death that put the sport on the front pages of newspapers across the country, at the top of all the network news shows, and brought the sport more recognition, it seemed, than Earnhardt ever did when he was alive. </P> 	nyt_eng_200602.gz
