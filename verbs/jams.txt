Series stars are locked in, able to renegotiate only when the show itself succeeds. There's definitely no bump in terms of salary, groans Eric McCormack, who says his raises have come with the growing popularity of the show. No bump in viewership, either, if last year's best comedy winner, Arrested Development, is any example. Despite the Emmy, Development still couldn't get arrested. However, one good thing came out of it. It made it harder for Fox to just dump us on the side of the road, says AD's Jason Bateman. We're still around, I think, because it's really hard to kind of dump what's considered the best show of the year. . . .
