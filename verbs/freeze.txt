"77020"	"they"	"freeze"	" In 1977, LeDoux went to Cornell University Medical College to begin his rat studies and has continued them at New York University's Center for Neural Science since 1989. In the experiments, rats are exposed to a tone and mild electric shock at the same time. Later, at the sound of the tone by itself, they freeze, as if frightened. They have been conditioned to fear the noise. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"

"84786"	"they"	"freeze"	" Visibility fell to one-quarter of a mile in freezing fog at Juneau, Alaska, early Tuesday. Like Juneau's fog, many of the winter fogs that form at air temperatures below 32 degrees are comprised of tiny, freeze-resisting water drops. When cold fog drops come in contact with cold objects such as bridges, they freeze, glazing objects with ice. Cold fog is common in valleys in the Rockies, but can be dissipated when aircraft ``bomb'' the fog with pieces of dry ice (solid carbon dioxide at a temperature of -108 degrees). Fog drops then freeze onto dry ice and fall to earth as artificial snow. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19970121.0558 type=story > <HEADLINE> U.S. STOCKS REACH RECORDS ON CHRYSLER, EXXON PROFIT (UPDATE1) </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> New York, Jan. 21 (Bloomberg) (BC-US-STOCKS-CLOSE2-BLOOM) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
