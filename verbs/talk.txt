Humans don't mate through antiseptic exchanges of formal proposals, calculated to avoid the slightest risk of offense. They look, they talk, they flirt. Sometimes they get rejected; sometimes they miscalculate, and come across as vulgar or juvenile. ``Harassment''? Let's have some sense of proportion. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"

Michael Harris, president of Paragon Business Management, who manages entertainment clients like the reality show star Jesse James, said, If it's a fee for service, if you get this when you show up to do something, there would be taxable exposure.

How, he asks, can the system then punish them for its own inadequacies? In 2004, when the governor settled Williams v. California, a suit based on those inadequacies, the state promised to provide better resources, but that process -- getting enough books, repairing buildings, reducing multi-track programs in overcrowded buildings -- is barely under way.

, he said,	 Dr. Leonard Saltz, an oncologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, noted that Genentech had not tested Avastin at the dose level for colon cancer in large-scale trials of lung and breast cancer. As a result, no one really knows whether the lower dose might turn out to be equally effective in lung and breast cancer, he said. Besides costing less, he said, a lower dose might have fewer side effects. </P> 	nyt_eng_200602.gz
, she said,	 Desmond-Hellmann said that Genentech was assuming that some cancer doctors might, in fact, use Avastin at the lower dosage to treat breast and lung cancer. That is a reason the company does not want to lower Avastin's per-milligram price, she said, because doing so would cut too deeply into revenues if doctors do not prescribe the higher doses that were used in the breast and lung cancer trials. </P> 	nyt_eng_200602.gz
