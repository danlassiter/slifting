Includes a color slide of Richard Gere in a scene from ``First Knight'' By CINDY PEARLMAN Distributed by New York Times Special Features  There's plenty of good karma flowing as Richard Gere enters a Los Angeles hotel suite for an early-morning interview with a group of entertainment writers.  He has come to talk about his newest film, ``First Knight,'' which is scheduled to open nationwide July 7. But the first words out of his mouth have nothing to do with the movie.  In fact, his statement is a bit shocking in light of his recent breakup with Cindy Crawford.  ``I need a new model,'' Gere says, prompting surprised looks and a few snickers from reporters.  Then the actor explains himself. It seems that on one of his many trips to Tibet he somehow lost his tape recorder. Seeing one of the writer's recorders reminded him of this, which led to the comment about needing a new model.  ``What did you think I was saying?'' Gere asks with a smile.  This is a guy who is used to being misunderstood. Even the most mundane utterances sometimes explode in his face.  During this interview, for example, Gere is asked about playing Lancelot to Sean Connery's King Arthur and Julia Ormond's Guinevere in ``First Knight.''  The 45-year-old actor explains that the swashbuckling, horseback-riding role was a bit of a stretch because the character, as written, is only 22.  ``I knew I would have to be in the best shape of my life to do this thing and I was kind of enjoying middle age and putting on a little weight,'' he says good-naturedly.  A few hours later, during a conversation with another group of reporters, his words come back to haunt him.  A writer asks: ``So, Richard, how did you gear up to play Lancelot, since you had gained weight and were feeling so inactive?''  Gere looks upset. ``It's not like my body totally fell apart!'' he says. ``I gained two or three pounds!''  Perhaps that's how rumors get started. And the rumor mill is something with which Gere is quite familiar.  Just last month he met with Julia Roberts to discuss a sequel to their 1990 smash hit ``Pretty Woman.''  ``The next day I read that Julia and I are getting married,'' he says.  A beat passes.  ``Of course, it's true. I just wanted to clear that one up for you.''  Would he also like to clear up the rumor that he has gone from being an ``American Gigolo'' to living the life of a monk?  ``In many ways, I am a monk,'' Gere says without a trace of a smile. ``I'm not celibate. That's not my thing. I just believe in the monk practice of examining the mind.  ``One should work out the mind. That is the most important thing to me.''  Of course, that's not news to his soon-to-be ex-wife Crawford.  The two married in 1992 after Crawford gave him an ultimatum: Get hitched or get out of her life.  When they wed, Gere said, ``I realized that it would be a great loss if this person wasn't in my life. And anyway, I never felt particularly right being single.''  But Gere found no Camelot with Crawford. Perhaps the difference in their lifestyles was just too great.  He likes Tibet; she likes New York. He meditates; she struts her stuff. He hangs out with the Dalai Lama; she works out with Radu.  Crawford's friend, photographer Herb Ritts, has said, ``Cindy gave it a try, but she's not into eating yak butter.''  The only thing Gere will say about the breakup is: ``I don't want to talk about the drama.''  When asked about the institution of marriage itself, he muses, ``The illusion of security is nothing I ever craved.''  What does he crave?  ``Freedom. Always, freedom. I'm always trying for the adventure.''  He found that adventure in Wales where ``First Knight'' was filmed. The movie came along at the perfect time, he says, because he needed something to take his mind off his troubled marriage.  ``It was so wonderful to be doing a physical film. I could just blow out energy.  ``I was on that horse, riding at maximum speed, just letting the tension go. I was riding as fast as I could and losing myself.  ``It was beautiful countryside, green and lush. Who could ask for anything more?''  Actually, Gere got a bit more than he asked for. One day, as he was riding, he noticed a strange lump in the field.  ``A bunch of England's finest tabloid writers had dug a trench the night before and covered themselves with dirt and grass to hide out and wait for me to ride by,'' he says.  Had they camped out so they'd be able to pop up and ask, ``What's the deal with Cindy Crawford?''  Gere just shrugs and runs a hand through his short silver hair.  Then he is reminded of the swords he was carrying for the scene.  ``Good thing I'm a gentle man,'' Gere says with a laugh.  Actually, this gentle man got pretty roughed up during the making of ``Knight.''  He cut his hands, chipped a tooth and needed stitches to close a slash near his eye.  ``Don't forget my concussion,'' he says. ``One day I was in three different hospitals for three different injuries.''  All that sword play was apparently too realistic.  ``We would miss each other by only half an inch,'' Gere explains. ``It was almost destiny that you would get hurt.''  To learn the art of sword-fighting, Gere studied with a 70-year-old master.  ``At first I used the sword like a club,'' he says. ``It was a real caveman kind of thing. I just couldn't get the flow.  ``Then one morning it was just there. And the sword started to move on its own. I was able to do spins and move very quickly. I got kind of flashy with it.''  That's probably the only time Gere has gotten flashy in his life.  The actor grew up in ``a very normal middle-class family'' in Syracuse, N.Y. In high school, he was a member of the band, the glee club and the choir. He was also vice president of the student council.  Sure, he had his strange moments. There was the club he started: The Royal Order of Mystic Carp.  ``We wore fish-bone necklaces to school and got in big trouble,'' he says.  After landing a lead in the school play his senior year, Gere fell in love with acting.  He later dropped out of the University of Massachusetts to take a job with a repertory-theater company. In the late '70s, he made it to Broadway in ``Grease.''  Then came a great disappointment: He failed to land one of the leads in the 1974 movie ``The Lords of Flatbush.''  To get over the trauma, Gere reportedly spent three days in bed. He emerged talking about transcendental meditation.  His new deep-thinking ways combined with his cocky, unpredictable attitude helped him go on to land roles in such films as ``Looking for Mr. Goodbar'' (1977), ``Days of Heaven'' (1978), ``American Gigolo'' (1980) and ``An Officer and a Gentleman'' (1982).  ``I just always wanted to be creative, whether it was acting or hitting a baseball or writing a poem,'' he says.  Becoming a major movie star or sex symbol was never his goal, he says.  ``It's nice to know that people think I look OK, but I'm not really aware of it on a daily basis.''  What he's more aware of is his need to expand his mind. Gere says he is selling his homes in Los Angeles so he can spend more time in India ``doing internal work and working on the content of my mind.''  When in Tibet, Gere has a very un-celebritylike existence.  ``I live in a simple room with a bathroom I share with others,'' he says. ``There's a limited supply of hot water. I am grateful on the days when I have hot water. That's the luxury.''  Which creature comforts does he miss most?  ``There's nothing. Honestly, there's nothing.''  Television?  ``Oh, not at all.''  Movies?  ``I don't need them.''  Air conditioning?  ``When you're doing internal work, you need nothing. It's all about emotional encounters which then have an enormous effect on the universe.''  The encounter that has had the greatest effect on Gere's own life has been his relationship with the Dalai Lama.  ``He is one of the major figures of our time or anytime,'' Gere explains. ``No one meets His Holiness without it changing his life. He has told me things that have changed my heart.''  Such as?  ``That's for my heart to know,'' he says with a calm smile.  And just what is it that helps Gere maintain that sense of calm? What keeps the actor on track these days?  ``Right now I feel lucky that I'm not being assaulted,'' he says. ``I want to be in generous situations. We can have a conversation and come out of it feeling a little better.''  And how can we feel good more of the time? Gere's advice is quite simple.  ``A little smile and a little kindness transforms universes,'' he says.  And then, with a kind smile, he walks out of the room. c.1995 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.) ------------------------------------------------- (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448; fax: 816-822-1444.)

Includes a 200-word sidebar By MARY REINHOLZ c.1995 McCall's magazine (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Of course, you'd never think of stealing from a store. But what if no one was looking? And what if the object of your desire was so small you could just slip it into your purse? And what if you'd already spent so much money that month that you felt the stores practically owed you something?  Well, maybe you'd still do the right thing and pay up. But a lot of people wouldn't. Shoplifting is one of America's most prevalent crimes, committed by as many as one in 12 shoppers.  Unlike most crimes, shoplifting claims just as many females as males among its offenders. While a small percentage are kleptomaniacs _ individuals who suffer from a rare mental disorder in which they cannot control their impulse to steal _ experts say most shoplift in reaction to some other problem in their life. WHY WOMEN STOOP TO SENSELESS THEFT  Hostility is frequently at the root of the crime. ``Women who steal often have an inability to recognize anger in themselves, to express anger appropriately and to assert themselves in an acceptable way,'' says Katherine DiFrancesca, a psychologist in San Diego.  Their ire often stems from relationships _ with their spouse, friends, kids, boss _ that aren't going well. Rather than confront her feelings, the shoplifter subliminally expresses her anger by stealing. ``Shoplifting is really a lashing out,'' DiFrancesca says.  Experts say that almost any change in a woman's life can be enough to push her to steal, even when anger isn't a factor. ``Circumstances that heighten a woman's sense of distress or agitation will make her more at risk for shoplifting,'' says Jeff Gottlieb, a psychologist in Minneapolis. ``This includes events such as physical illness, entering or leaving the work force and depression.''  There's also an element of vanity involved. According to experts, women sometimes steal because they want to look good. ``A lot of women shoplift to get things that are in style,'' says Lloyd W. Klemke, a sociology professor at Oregon State University, Corvallis, and author of ``The Sociology of Shoplifting: Boosters and Snitches Today'' (Praeger, 1992).  ``Females are driven by standards of beauty, style and fashion. They are also not as well-off in terms of income and financial assets as men. When you combine these two (factors), there is a greater temptation to shoplift. Think of how many women in the work force are expected to dress stylishly on secretarial or clerk's wages.''  Indeed, some blame society's ``look good, feel good'' motto and the unrealistic standards of beauty imposed by the media for practically driving women to break the law.  ``Women grow up in this society expected to look a certain way,'' says Sandra Green, a clinical social worker and psychoanalyst in New York City. ``There's a lot of pressure to care about being glamorous.''  Even in these circumstances, however, the motive can be more than skin deep. Alluding to the dissatisfaction and anger that drive many women to steal, Green says, ``Women think if they could have more clothes, more makeup, then maybe they'll get what they really need in life, that they'll be able to fix whatever deeper problem is actually driving them to steal. But of course, it doesn't work that way. It's a myth.''  This is something that Terry Keller (+) has learned the hard way. The remarried mother of three began shoplifting when she separated from her first husband. ``He left me with a big house and a baby and I was angry,'' she says. ``Plus, I had to start dating again and I wanted to look good so people would like me.''  She began swiping $10 hair sprays at top department stores and gradually moved on to silk blouses and designer clothes. Arrested seven times, Keller once spent 22 days in jail. She's now awaiting sentencing for another episode and is seeing a psychologist as well as attending support-group meetings to help curb her theft. GOTCHA! THE TERROR OF GETTING CAUGHT RED-HANDED  As brazen as shoplifters are, their confidence often crumbles when they're caught. (Fewer than 1 percent are apprehended, however.) Shame and fear can quickly set in.  Sandra Davids (+) has never been arrested but has been caught many times. She was once surrounded by a group of security guards in a parking lot after she stole a $2 pair of athletic socks from Sears.  Hustled to an office inside the store, where she was interrogated by security personnel, her ``temples were pounding,'' she recalls. ``I was in a state of anxiety and I gave them what I had taken. I wondered, `I did this for a $2 pair of socks?'''  Perhaps even more loathsome to her is the prospect of being caught by friends and family. Davids' house is overflowing with boxes of clothing, books and knickknacks she has stolen from local stores. Terrified that her neighbors and adult children will discover her vice, she refuses to allow them to visit her at home. THE KEY TO THE CURE  Shoplifting can be a tough habit to kick because of the intense feelings of pleasure it induces.  ``The elation that shoplifters get from stealing is almost like an addictive drug,'' says Randy J. Lorah, a facilitator at the Corrective Behavior Institute, a San Diego-based non-profit organization that counsels people recovering from inappropriate and recidivist social behaviors.  Keller experienced just that. ``It can give you a feeling of euphoria, like you're on cocaine,'' she says.  How do most women break the habit? Not by being apprehended. ``Getting caught does not act as a deterrent in the long term,'' DiFrancesca says, ``especially if they haven't dealt with the problem that is compelling them to steal.''  Instead, experts say, women who shoplift need organized help: support groups, therapy, even a chaperone who shops with them and encourages them to wear clothing without pockets.  ``For a lot of women, their therapy has been to go shopping,'' DiFrancesca says. ``You have to get them to make themselves feel good in some other way. Some women might not need immediate help because their shoplifting may be a short-term thing. But for most, they need to talk to somebody _ a therapist or social worker _ to try to figure out what's going on.''  The question these women need to ask themselves, DiFrancesca says, is one that is simple but so easy to turn a blind eye to: ``What need in my life is not being met?'' -0- SIDEBAR: SNEAKY WAYS STORES STOP CRIMES  Have you ever walked away from a rack of suits because they were fastened to the display stand with locks and chains? You're not alone.  Nowadays many customers feel as if they're entering a war zone when they set foot in a store. If the security guard isn't staring at you while you shop, a closed-circuit TV camera concealed in a ceiling dome is.  Or Annie Droids _ mannequins that have cameras hidden behind their glass eyes _ are monitoring your every move.  Stores are pulling out all the stops when it comes to catching shoplifters in the '90s, says Thomas A. Nicolette, president and chief executive officer of Knogo North America Inc., a security firm based in Hauppauge, N.Y.  One of the newest and most effective security measures: invisible magnetic strips, which are embedded in merchandise and sound an alarm when a shoplifter walks through a monitored exit.  This is a variation on the far more cumbersome electronic-article surveillance tags typically attached to clothing. Another version of the tags releases an indelible ink that spreads over the garment when a thief attempts to remove the tag.

By JERRY SHINE c.1994 Sky magazine (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Strapped into a flight simulator at the Wright Patterson Air Force Base, David Tumey stares at the video screen. The task before him is simple: to keep his ``plane'' on an even keel.  As the port side begins to dip, he raises it until it's level again. He does the same with the starboard side. It's like a video game, really, not unlike any other flight simulator. Except for one thing: Tumey isn't touching any controls.  In fact, the only thing connecting him to the machine is a set of electrodes attached to the back of his head. So how is he able to guide the plane through its simulated flight? Easy. With his brain waves.  Hold on to your hats, because brain-actuated control, as it's known, exists here and now. It may sound like the stuff of science fiction, but in labs across the world, people have successfully turned lights and televisions on and off, operated typewriters, activated electrical muscle stimulators and moved cursors across video screens _ all without touching them.  In other words, the phrase, ``Look, Ma, no hands'' may be about to take on a whole new meaning.  Surprisingly, the methodology behind the technology is fairly straightforward. The electrodes attached to the head key in on specific brain waves and monitor them for voltage changes, which are then interpreted as simple computer commands.  Let's say, for example, you wanted to turn on a light bulb. Electrodes would be attached to your head, while an electroencephalogram (EEG) graphically showed you the voltage of the particular brain wave being monitored.  Your job would be to think of something, anything, that would cause that voltage to increase. It would take some trial and error and a few stabs in the dark, but eventually you would come up with something, such as the memory of your mother's chocolate-chip cookies, that would cause the voltage of the brain wave in question to rise.  When it reached a certain level, the computer would take that as a command to turn the bulb on, and voila _ light. Future attempts would be easier because you would already know what to think about.  Of course, this description makes it sound much easier than it really is. Consider for a moment the immense complexity of the human brain. At any given instant, tens of trillions of neurons are firing away, allowing you to form opinions, weigh options, process sensory input and remember everything from the date of your spouse's birthday to the last place you left your slippers.  Your brain is positively bursting with chemical and electrical activity, making it a very noisy place. For researchers to pick out a single wave and monitor it is a mighty task, indeed, fraught with a multitude of questions: Where should the electrodes be attached, how many should be used, which brain waves should be monitored and how can the noise from all of the other brain activity be filtered out?  Luckily, a good deal of information was known about the brain's activities before brain-actuated control ever became a possibility, making the first steps far easier than they might otherwise have been.  Researchers had long known that certain areas of the brain regulate specific psychological and physiological functions. Some types of brain waves had also been matched with their particular roles. And biofeedback studies had shown that people could definitely exert a degree of control over their physical and mental states.  But when a new generation of powerful computers made the on-line analysis of brain waves feasible, all that was needed was one final push to set the wheels in motion.  That came in the early 1980s, when researchers at the Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, tried to develop a set of measurements to assess the mental states of people working in stressful environments. They relied on a technique known as evoked response, in which a certain part of the brain is stimulated by a continuous external event in order to produce a steady brain-wave pattern.  To do this, they placed a pair of flickering lights in front of people to stimulate their visual cortexes _ the part of the brain that reacts to visual input. They then used the resulting brain-wave pattern as a baseline to see how quickly their subjects were reacting to other visual stimuli, providing the researchers with a measure of their subjects' mental alertness.  What the Wright Patterson researchers soon realized, however, was that people were able to exert a degree of control over their neuronal response to the lights. This didn't negate the test's usefulness, but it did open up a whole new world of possibilities _ namely, brain-actuated control.  Because of lack of funds, the project lay dormant for a time, but was revived in the late 1980s. ``I became convinced that this was something we should pursue,'' says Grant McMillan, head of the Alternative Control Technology Lab at Wright Patterson. ``It seemed clear that there were near-term applications for it in the rehabilitation of disabled people, and perhaps longer-term applications in the military.''  After reconfiguring the equipment so that test subjects could see their EEGs and thus try to manipulate them, the researchers hooked them up to the flight simulators. It wasn't long before most of the subjects were banking their simulated planes left and right. Currently there are 15 different test subjects with various degrees of competency, ranging from beginner to expert.  ``No one is capable yet of flying a plane, even a small one, completely with brain-actuated control,'' McMillan says. ``But I'm sure that some of our people could exercise a similar degree of control over a real plane as they do in the simulator. That is, they could control its roll or pitch angle.''  McMillan and his team have since broadened the scope of their work to include the possibility of using brain-actuated control for medical rehabilitation, a role that researchers at the New York State Department of Health's Wadsworth Center for Laboratories and Research in Albany have been investigating since the late 1980s.  ``With the advent of advanced life-support systems, there are people who are totally paralyzed and yet still survive,'' says Dr. Jonathan Wolpaw of Wadsworth. ``These people are essentially locked into their bodies. Their brains are intact and they're thinking and seeing and feeling a full range of emotions, but they're not capable of any kind of output. They can't communicate.''  Wolpaw believes brain-actuated control could provide that means. Unlike the Wright Patterson researchers, he and his colleagues monitor the natural brain waves of their subjects without the use of flickering lights.  They concentrate on a particular pattern known as ``mu rhythms,'' which are part of the normal channel through which most physical actions are carried out and which previous studies have shown to be controllable.  The task they've devised for their subjects is simple: Use brain-actuated control to move a cursor from one end of a video screen toward a target located on the other.  In their first study, five people were given two months of training, after which time four had gained what Wolpaw describes as ``impressive'' control over their mu rhythms and their ability to hit the target, with success rates ranging from 80 percent to 95 percent.  Wolpaw and his colleagues have since moved on to the question of whether or not people can exert two-dimensional control over a cursor _ that is, move it left and right as well as up and down. ``We've had some success with that,'' Wolpaw says. ``Not a lot, but some.''  If they're able to work out the kinks, such an ability would give users mouselike control with a computer, making it a viable means of communication for people who are completely paralyzed. It would also increase the likelihood that people could someday perform two separate brain-actuated-control tasks at the same time.  But advances have been slow in coming. All the researchers stress that it will be a while before any of their systems reach the point of being commercially viable. ``We're really just getting started here,'' McMillan says. ``This is kind of a pre-Wright Brothers stage.''  But breakthroughs are being made and, for people who have participated in the various studies, the thrill of watching their brain waves take control of a computer is tremendous.  ``When it works, it's great,'' says Andrew Junker, who originated the program at Wright Patterson. ``Then it's just like putting your head inside the machine and making it do what you want.''

Includes a color slide of Hugh Grant with Julianne Moore in a scene from ``Nine Months.'' By CINDY PEARLMAN Distributed by New York Times Special Features  What's the matter with Hugh Grant?  A lot of people are asking that question now, but last Saturday, when the 34-year-old British actor strolled cheerfully into a suite at Los Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel for an early-morning interview, nothing seemed amiss.  After plopping down in a chair and ordering a dignified cup of tea, Grant admitted to feeling a bit jet-lagged. But that didn't detract from his overall happy mood.  ``I'm not really complaining,'' Grant insisted. ``I'm a guy who is on top of the world. Things are so rosy.''  And it was true.  His first American film, ``Nine Months'' (scheduled to be released July 14), had been getting good advance notices.  His longtime girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley had recently been signed as the new Estee Lauder spokesmodel, and photos of the two of them looking head over heels in love had been splashed across American newspapers and magazines.  Grant even laughed about how the tabloids always seemed to be after him.  ``It's not like they ever find anything,'' he said. ``I'm really the most boring guy alive.''  But just three days later his life didn't seem so boring after all. Grant was arrested early that morning in Los Angeles for allegedly committing a lewd act with a prostitute.  Suddenly, his mug shot was being shown on television's tabloidy ``Hard Copy'' and ``Inside Edition.'' And the quips _ like ``The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill, but Came Down a Felon'' _ were flowing.  In response, Grant released the following statement: ``Last night I did something completely insane. I have hurt people I love and embarrassed people I work with. For both things I am more sorry than I can ever possibly say.''  One of those people he hurt is Hurley.  Strangely enough, in the interview on Saturday, Grant had joked about their relationship.  ``She knows I'm a very ratty human being,'' Grant said. ``I'm very unpleasant to my girlfriend these days, but she's thoroughly unpleasant to me.''  He also took a few shots at himself, teasingly implying that the star status he'd attained through his role in last year's hit ``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' had gone to his head.  ``I'm completely unpleasant now,'' he said. ``I won't talk to any of my friends and my feet are off the ground.''  Wearing a dark-blue business suit and a toothy smile, Grant had come to the hotel to promote his newest film, ``Nine Months,'' in which he plays a confirmed bachelor whose life is turned upside-down when his girlfriend announces she is pregnant.  ``He is not a happy man,'' Grant said of the character.  Naturally, reporters wanted to know how much Grant had in common with the guy he portrays on screen. Again and again the actor was asked how he could do a movie featuring adorable babies and not want one himself.  Grant laughed. He feigned shock. He stammered.  ``This is a movie,'' he said. ``I'm saying to the world in this movie that a baby will solve all your problems. But I'm certainly not going to have one! Not in the immediate future. Not on purpose, anyway.''  In addition to being Grant's first American film, ``Nine Months'' is his first real big-budget project. This makes him a bit nervous, he said.  ``I keep saying, `What happens if it flops? Do I go halfway back to the beginning? Do I do a BBC radio drama immediately?  ``Some people say, `You're here to stay, Hugh.' That scares me to death.''  Now, of course, with his arrest making headlines worldwide, Grant has reason to be worried about the fate of his career.  Perhaps the incident with the prostitute got so much press because it seemed so out of character for Grant, a guy who, by his own admission, lived a very ordinary life.  He was born in London to a middle-class family. His father was a carpet salesman, his mother a teacher.  ``The worst thing that happened to me as a child was my goldfish dying and the Dachshund next door eating it after the family burial,'' he said.  Grant went on to attend Oxford and then, ``as a lark,'' made his professional debut at a local playhouse ``playing a tree swaying in the wind.''  ``The notices were excellent,'' he said.  After that Hughie (as his friends called him) was asked to join a local comedy troupe called the Jockeys of Norfolk.  A typical sketch? ``We did the Nativity in the style of a really bad English film,'' Grant recalled. ``It was Angel Gabriel coming down and saying, in a thick English accent, `Look here, I've got something veddy impawtant to tell yaw.'''  After graduating from college, Grant settled into a sales career at London's famous Harrods department store.  ``I worked in the paper-doily department. I was very good,'' he said. ``Anything you want to know about doilies, I can help you out with.''  Though his doily career seemed promising, Grant eventually ditched it for a position in advertising, then acting.  In 1987 he nabbed a role in the British film ``Maurice'' and went on to play Chopin in 1991's ``Impromptu.'' In between, he did several ``awful B-movies and miniseries.''  Grant met Hurley while both were making a Spanish film that Grant has dubbed ``Rowing with the Wind.''  ``I played Byron and she was my love interest, Claire Clairmont.''  He joked that Hurley was attracted to him only because of his costume.  ``It was never the same when I got back in my jeans after the Spanish movie,'' he said. ``She still has a soft spot for anybody in britches.''  Grant's acting career didn't heat up until two years ago, when he landed back-to-back roles in ``Remains of the Day'' (1993), ``Sirens'' (1994) and ``Four Weddings.''  Just recently he and Hurley made a deal with the Castle Rock film studio to form their own production company.  ``We're calling it Simian Films, which means pertaining to apes,'' he said.  The company has not yet produced any projects _ but maybe that's because Grant has been so busy acting.  Earlier this year he appeared in ``The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill but Came Down a Mountain.'' He also has a cameo role in the period piece ``Restoration,'' which is scheduled to be released this fall, and a starring role in ``An Awfully Big Adventure,'' which was directed by ``Four Weddings''' Mike Newell. It is scheduled to open nationwide July 21.  When asked about his ``Adventure'' character, Grant gave one of the somewhat amusing, somewhat self-deprecating responses he has become known for during this past year of fame.  ``(I play) this nasty, vicious, tyrannical theater director,'' he said. ``I'm very screwed-up and frustrated. Mike Newell says it's the real me.''  Now one can only wonder whether Newell was joking. c.1995 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Richard Gere in a scene from ``First Knight'' By CINDY PEARLMAN Distributed by New York Times Special Features  There's plenty of good karma flowing as Richard Gere enters a Los Angeles hotel suite for an early-morning interview with a group of entertainment writers.  He has come to talk about his newest film, ``First Knight,'' which is scheduled to open nationwide July 7. But the first words out of his mouth have nothing to do with the movie.  In fact, his statement is a bit shocking in light of his recent breakup with Cindy Crawford.  ``I need a new model,'' Gere says, prompting surprised looks and a few snickers from reporters.  Then the actor explains himself. It seems that on one of his many trips to Tibet he somehow lost his tape recorder. Seeing one of the writer's recorders reminded him of this, which led to the comment about needing a new model.  ``What did you think I was saying?'' Gere asks with a smile.  This is a guy who is used to being misunderstood. Even the most mundane utterances sometimes explode in his face.  During this interview, for example, Gere is asked about playing Lancelot to Sean Connery's King Arthur and Julia Ormond's Guinevere in ``First Knight.''  The 45-year-old actor explains that the swashbuckling, horseback-riding role was a bit of a stretch because the character, as written, is only 22.  ``I knew I would have to be in the best shape of my life to do this thing and I was kind of enjoying middle age and putting on a little weight,'' he says good-naturedly.  A few hours later, during a conversation with another group of reporters, his words come back to haunt him.  A writer asks: ``So, Richard, how did you gear up to play Lancelot, since you had gained weight and were feeling so inactive?''  Gere looks upset. ``It's not like my body totally fell apart!'' he says. ``I gained two or three pounds!''  Perhaps that's how rumors get started. And the rumor mill is something with which Gere is quite familiar.  Just last month he met with Julia Roberts to discuss a sequel to their 1990 smash hit ``Pretty Woman.''  ``The next day I read that Julia and I are getting married,'' he says.  A beat passes.  ``Of course, it's true. I just wanted to clear that one up for you.''  Would he also like to clear up the rumor that he has gone from being an ``American Gigolo'' to living the life of a monk?  ``In many ways, I am a monk,'' Gere says without a trace of a smile. ``I'm not celibate. That's not my thing. I just believe in the monk practice of examining the mind.  ``One should work out the mind. That is the most important thing to me.''  Of course, that's not news to his soon-to-be ex-wife Crawford.  The two married in 1992 after Crawford gave him an ultimatum: Get hitched or get out of her life.  When they wed, Gere said, ``I realized that it would be a great loss if this person wasn't in my life. And anyway, I never felt particularly right being single.''  But Gere found no Camelot with Crawford. Perhaps the difference in their lifestyles was just too great.  He likes Tibet; she likes New York. He meditates; she struts her stuff. He hangs out with the Dalai Lama; she works out with Radu.  Crawford's friend, photographer Herb Ritts, has said, ``Cindy gave it a try, but she's not into eating yak butter.''  The only thing Gere will say about the breakup is: ``I don't want to talk about the drama.''  When asked about the institution of marriage itself, he muses, ``The illusion of security is nothing I ever craved.''  What does he crave?  ``Freedom. Always, freedom. I'm always trying for the adventure.''  He found that adventure in Wales where ``First Knight'' was filmed. The movie came along at the perfect time, he says, because he needed something to take his mind off his troubled marriage.  ``It was so wonderful to be doing a physical film. I could just blow out energy.  ``I was on that horse, riding at maximum speed, just letting the tension go. I was riding as fast as I could and losing myself.  ``It was beautiful countryside, green and lush. Who could ask for anything more?''  Actually, Gere got a bit more than he asked for. One day, as he was riding, he noticed a strange lump in the field.  ``A bunch of England's finest tabloid writers had dug a trench the night before and covered themselves with dirt and grass to hide out and wait for me to ride by,'' he says.  Had they camped out so they'd be able to pop up and ask, ``What's the deal with Cindy Crawford?''  Gere just shrugs and runs a hand through his short silver hair.  Then he is reminded of the swords he was carrying for the scene.  ``Good thing I'm a gentle man,'' Gere says with a laugh.  Actually, this gentle man got pretty roughed up during the making of ``Knight.''  He cut his hands, chipped a tooth and needed stitches to close a slash near his eye.  ``Don't forget my concussion,'' he says. ``One day I was in three different hospitals for three different injuries.''  All that sword play was apparently too realistic.  ``We would miss each other by only half an inch,'' Gere explains. ``It was almost destiny that you would get hurt.''  To learn the art of sword-fighting, Gere studied with a 70-year-old master.  ``At first I used the sword like a club,'' he says. ``It was a real caveman kind of thing. I just couldn't get the flow.  ``Then one morning it was just there. And the sword started to move on its own. I was able to do spins and move very quickly. I got kind of flashy with it.''  That's probably the only time Gere has gotten flashy in his life.  The actor grew up in ``a very normal middle-class family'' in Syracuse, N.Y. In high school, he was a member of the band, the glee club and the choir. He was also vice president of the student council.  Sure, he had his strange moments. There was the club he started: The Royal Order of Mystic Carp.  ``We wore fish-bone necklaces to school and got in big trouble,'' he says.  After landing a lead in the school play his senior year, Gere fell in love with acting.  He later dropped out of the University of Massachusetts to take a job with a repertory-theater company. In the late '70s, he made it to Broadway in ``Grease.''  Then came a great disappointment: He failed to land one of the leads in the 1974 movie ``The Lords of Flatbush.''  To get over the trauma, Gere reportedly spent three days in bed. He emerged talking about transcendental meditation.  His new deep-thinking ways combined with his cocky, unpredictable attitude helped him go on to land roles in such films as ``Looking for Mr. Goodbar'' (1977), ``Days of Heaven'' (1978), ``American Gigolo'' (1980) and ``An Officer and a Gentleman'' (1982).  ``I just always wanted to be creative, whether it was acting or hitting a baseball or writing a poem,'' he says.  Becoming a major movie star or sex symbol was never his goal, he says.  ``It's nice to know that people think I look OK, but I'm not really aware of it on a daily basis.''  What he's more aware of is his need to expand his mind. Gere says he is selling his homes in Los Angeles so he can spend more time in India ``doing internal work and working on the content of my mind.''  When in Tibet, Gere has a very un-celebritylike existence.  ``I live in a simple room with a bathroom I share with others,'' he says. ``There's a limited supply of hot water. I am grateful on the days when I have hot water. That's the luxury.''  Which creature comforts does he miss most?  ``There's nothing. Honestly, there's nothing.''  Television?  ``Oh, not at all.''  Movies?  ``I don't need them.''  Air conditioning?  ``When you're doing internal work, you need nothing. It's all about emotional encounters which then have an enormous effect on the universe.''  The encounter that has had the greatest effect on Gere's own life has been his relationship with the Dalai Lama.  ``He is one of the major figures of our time or anytime,'' Gere explains. ``No one meets His Holiness without it changing his life. He has told me things that have changed my heart.''  Such as?  ``That's for my heart to know,'' he says with a calm smile.  And just what is it that helps Gere maintain that sense of calm? What keeps the actor on track these days?  ``Right now I feel lucky that I'm not being assaulted,'' he says. ``I want to be in generous situations. We can have a conversation and come out of it feeling a little better.''  And how can we feel good more of the time? Gere's advice is quite simple.  ``A little smile and a little kindness transforms universes,'' he says.  And then, with a kind smile, he walks out of the room. c.1995 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.) ------------------------------------------------- (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448; fax: 816-822-1444.)

By MARJORIE INGALL From Diversion magazine c.1996 Marjorie Ingall (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.) EDITORS: Please note ``(T)'' in the computer address below equates to a tilde (the tilde character, in many instances, cannot be transmitted into newspaper computer systems).  Thanks to the recent explosive growth of the World Wide Web, you can now search vast recipe archives, read reviews of four-star restaurants in distant countries and solicit advice from fellow cooks who are happy to theorize about why your egg whites stubbornly refuse to form stiff peaks.  In some cities you can even input your grocery list or pizza order and have the goods delivered to your door 15 minutes later.  Of course, the major commercial services can satisfy some of your cravings: America Online offers recipes from Woman's Day and the San Jose Mercury News, Prodigy has an online version of the Zagat Surveys, CompuServe has a recipe archives and all three services have food-related discussion areas and ``malls'' in which you can buy products and cooking equipment.  But for the best graphics and the widest range of food information, the Web's the place to be.  Unfortunately, though, not all sites are worth perusing. Most are slow, disorganized, poorly written, advertiser driven or so heavy with graphics they're unreadable.  How do you find the few worth clicking onto? Here's a list of the food sites that should enhance your gustatory enjoyment. GENERAL STORES  Foodplex (http://www.gigaplex.com/wow/food/index.htm) is the brainchild of Los Angeles restaurant critic Merrill Shindler.  Quirky, opinionated and funny, Shindler conducts his own taste test of dog biscuits, checks the distribution of animal breeds in a box of animal crackers and provides recipes for a four-course all-popcorn dinner.  He also offers his favorite ``recipes for the totally inept'' (including avocado soup and Greek eggplant dip, both delicious).  A word to the wise: Shindler's West Coast restaurant recommendations are far more trustworthy than his East Coast ones.  Godiva chocolate (http://www.godiva.com/). The most seductive commercial spot on the Web, the Godiva Web Site includes sumptuous photos and recipes for chocolate-hazelnut-mascarpone torte with raspberries, fudge truffle cheesecake and a white chocolate-black pepper mousse napoleon.  There's also chocolate history, chocolate trivia (did you know that chocolate can be lethal to dogs?) and, of course, an order form for Godiva goodies.  Many of the recipes may be too challenging for home cooks, but the site is a big heart-shaped box of fun.  CheeseNet (http://exclamation.com/cheesenet). These people really like cheese.  You can learn how cheese is made, study ``cheese language'' (which rivals wine language in its specificity _ cheese can be ``earthy,'' ``open,'' ``mushroomy'' or ``supple''), find cheese vendors, download recipes, read the famous Monty Python ``Cheese Shop'' sketch and ponder cheese poetry (including an ode to aerosol-canned cheese in perfect 14-line sonnet form).  Epicurious (http://www.epicurious.com/) is the Web's most famous food site, but I have some problems with it. It's the online version of Bon Appetit and Gourmet magazines, so the recipes are mouthwatering and the articles (by such terrific food writers as Joan Nathan and Jeffrey Steingarten) are entertaining. But the site is ungainly.  There's no database for the restaurants mentioned, so you can't conduct a search. And it's really designed for fast modems _  the text-only version provided for 14.4-baud-or-slower modems isn't engaging to look at. BEVERAGES  Over the Coffee (http://www.cappuccino.com/) will fulfill all your caffeine-laden needs.  There's information on different blends and roasts, candid opinions on various espresso machines, a bunch of biscotti recipes (including a nut-free cardamom version) and more.  Virtual Vineyards (http://www.virtualvin.com/) lets you read detailed assessments of various wines, then order them.  The Web Site is run by Peter Granoff, (a.k.a. the Cork Dork), a professional wine buyer, teacher and restaurant consultant. Granoff describes wines elegantly yet unpretentiously, and even though the featured vineyards are advertisers, the site maintains a sense of editorial integrity.  It's fun and useful; the co-owner of Storybook Mountain Vineyards provides an easy, delicious-sounding recipe for zinfandel risotto.  And any site featuring Bonny Doon, a winery whose owner is the quirkiest wine maker in the country, is worth checking out. RECIPES  Amy Gale (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/(T)mjw/recipes/) is a New Zealander who has amassed a huge no-graphics, no-nonsense collection of recipes from net denizens all over the world.  The dishes vary widely in quality _ if you're an experienced cook who can scan a list of ingredients and quickly decide yea or nay, you'll do fine.  Veggies Unite! (http://www.honors.indiana.edu/(T)veggie/recipes.cgi/) is the best-structured recipe site.  This is an easily browsable collection of more than 2,000 vegetarian recipes, listed both alphabetically and by category, along with an interactive weekly menu planner and shopping list.  A lot of the recipes are a bit earthy-crunchy, but others are divine, such as kaoneaw mamong (Thai sweet rice with mangoes) and a bread pudding with whiskey sauce.  This site also loads quickly, even with a slow modem.  The Mole Page (http://www.slip.net/(T)bobnemo/mole.html) is a tribute to the savory Mexican sauce. The site explains where the word ``mole'' comes from: the Aztec word ``molli,'' meaning ``concoction.''  You can browse the small repository (21, at last count) of recipes, including green pumpkin-seed mole with chicken breasts, yellow pork mole with dumplings and mole con dos chiles (mole with two kinds of chiles).  Kosher Express (http://www.marketnet.com/mktnet/kosher/recipes.html) is a wonderful source of kosher recipes, especially for the Jewish holidays.  Among those that I thought to be particularly good were SaraBeth's Cream Cheese Brownies and acorn squash with apple stuffing.  Cookin' on the Net (http://www.cooknet.org/index.html) combines hedonism and philanthropy.  Five heralded American chefs _ from Campanile in Los Angeles, Union Square Cafe in New York, Stars in San Francisco, Rialto in Boston and Charlie Trotter's in Chicago _ have contributed recipes ranging from a goat cheese-and-caramelized-onion tart to salmon paillard with black-bean sauce.  For $12 (payable by check or credit card), you get the recipes as well as a chance to win CDs and cookbooks. The money goes to five nonprofit programs that teach disadvantaged kids about computers and technology. RESTAURANT GUIDES  Digital Restaurant Guide to San Francisco (http://www.sf.net/lantern) is astounding. More than 3,000 restaurants are reviewed, and the listings are savvy and comprehensive, offering hours, prices and ratings for food, atmosphere and service.  You can search the database by neighborhood, ranking or type of cuisine, and there's even a cute map for each restaurant's vicinity.  What's more, there are currently plans to expand to other cities, so stay tuned.  Dining Out on the Web (http://www.ird.net/diningout.html) is a mammoth collection of links to restaurant reviews and listings all over the country. There's also a form for adding your own opinion.  The reviews aren't nearly as trustworthy as the Digital Restaurant Guide's, but they do cover more territory. I especially liked the frozen-custard-flavor forecasts for Milwaukee. JUST FOR FUN  T.W.I.N.K.I.E.S. (Tests With Inorganic Noxious Kakes In Extreme Situations) Project (http://www.rice.edu/(T)gouge/twinkies.html) consists of various science experiments conducted by two Rice University students on the little Hostess sponge logs.  The results, as well as the mock-academic tone, are truly hilarious.  Burrito Page (http://www.infobahn.com/pages/rito.html) enables you to input your favorite burrito ingredients and receive an instant analysis of your character, learn some burrito lore and pick up a few new ingredient ideas.

By SUSAN INCE c.1996 Child (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  Cozy, soft and warm. That's the popular image of a child-friendly home. But for the one in five children who has allergies, the air in that carpeted, toy-filled house is a particle-filled cloud that sends the immune system into miserable overdrive.  The result? Runny noses, irritated eyes and, for many children, life-threatening asthma and lung inflammation.  ``We have a precious picture of our daughter, Brittany, at 2 months, surrounded by a mountain of stuffed animals. We didn't know then that those cuddly toys were making her sick,'' says Dianne Williams of Coral Springs, Fla.  Her daughter, now 8, was diagnosed at 2 with severe asthma. Allergy tests revealed that a host of household items _ including nearly everything in her picturesque bedroom _ could trigger her attacks.  Genetics may determine whether a child is susceptible to allergies, but a baby isn't born allergic to anything in particular. What a child is exposed to determines what she will become allergic to _ and the more allergens in a child's environment the more risk that a serious allergy or asthma will develop.  ``We don't know if we can prevent asthma, but we think the window of opportunity to avoid allergies is the first 12 months of life, when the immune system has not yet matured,'' says Vancouver, Canada, asthma specialist Moira Chan-Yeung.  Allergist Rebecca Bascom, associate professor of medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, now thinks it makes sense to bring all newborns with a family history of allergies home to low-allergen houses to prevent potential problems.  Whether you want to reduce the symptoms and the need for medication of an allergy sufferer in your family, or you want to lessen the risk that your newborn will develop allergies, the following strategies can help. While some of them may sound drastic, you will soon find they're worth it if your child is truly suffering.  Dust Mites  The problem: Most dust-sensitive people are actually allergic to dust mites _ microscopic, eight-legged creatures that feed on water absorbed from the air and dead skin cells _ and their excrement.  These critters are the major trigger for asthma in many parts of the world.  Trouble spots: Dust mites cause problems anywhere it's humid but cause little trouble in dry and high altitude areas such as the Southwest.  At home, mites like fiber, padding, dust and darkness. Carpets and mattresses are favorite spots.  The solution: Remove or clean dust collecting items and, if possible, wall-to-wall carpet. Allergists suggest having bare wood or linoleum floors, especially in bedrooms. You can liven things up with throw rugs that can be washed weekly in hot water (at least 130 F).  ``People are reluctant to take away the carpet and soft, fuzzy things in their children's bedrooms, but getting rid of them is the most important thing you can do to control dust mites,'' says Linda B. Ford, an allergist in Omaha, Neb.  Other suggestions for controlling dust:  _ Use bright, washable curtains or wipable shades instead of dust-collecting heavy drapes or slatted blinds.  _ Remove pictures and wall hangings. Stencil designs on walls instead.  _ Put mite-tight covers (see sidebar) on pillows and mattresses. Follow manufacturers' washing instructions.  _ Use synthetic pillows instead of feather pillows and wash them weekly.  _ Wash sheets and blankets weekly in hot water. Polyester/cotton blends are better than lint-producing all-cotton.  _ Keep closet doors shut and pack away out-of-season clothes.  _ Put toys in plastic storage bins, in closed closets or on shelves with doors. Dust books on shelves frequently with a damp cloth.  _ Keep stuffed animals that aren't constant companions in a closet, storage bin or another room.  Treat inseparable pals with a weekly wash _ wrap them in a pillow case with a rubber band to protect them in the washing machine. If they won't survive another wash, try freezing them until they get crusty, Ford suggests. The cold will kill the mites.  _ Treat carpets that you can't remove and upholstered furniture with chemicals to kill or reduce mites. Acarosan (a moist powder) kills mites for three to six months and binds their feces into large enough pieces to be vacuumed up.  Acarosan is harmful to children and pets, so keep them off the carpet until the area is thoroughly vacuumed.  Another chemical, tannic acid, also helps reduce allergic reactions to mites, but it can stain light carpets and furniture, so test a small section first.  _ Dust with a damp, not dry, cloth to pick up dust mites while cleaning.  _ Vacuum often, and consider investing in an anti-allergen machine (see sidebar) that traps microscopic particles.  _ Keep the humidity low in your house (35 percent to 50 percent is ideal). Mites thrive when humidity tops 50 percent. You can check the levels with a humidity gauge from the hardware store.  Central air conditioning is the most effective way to control humidity, though window units also work, provided you clean the filters monthly.  Dehumidifiers are also good, but their reservoirs must be cleaned daily to prevent fungi and bacteria growth.  Mold  The problem: Many kids are allergic to fungi and mold _ microscopic organisms that flourish in damp environments. Up to 30 percent of kids with asthma may be mold-sensitive.  Trouble spots: Humid and flood-prone regions are the most mold-friendly. Many homes have hidden sources of mold that can cause chronic allergies.  Sources include: damp basements, dirty humidifiers or air conditioners, carpeting (especially when installed over concrete or in bathrooms or kitchens), indoor plants (especially those requiring frequent watering), garbage cans, water-damaged walls or flooring, window sills, damp firewood, wallpaper, shower stalls, wicker baskets, cardboard boxes or newspapers, crawl spaces, stored clothing and shoes, refrigerators, mattresses, pillows and blankets that haven't been aired out for a while and dried flowers.  The solution: On hard surfaces, mold can be cleaned with a solution of 1 part chlorine bleach to 20 parts water. To prevent the growth of mold:  _ Use bathroom paint labeled ``mildew proof,'' or mix a mildew- or mold-inhibiting additive into paint. ~  _ Use a dehumidifier. ~  _ Store shoes and clothes in plastic containers, not in cardboard boxes.  _ Install and use exhaust fans in bathrooms and kitchens.  _ Keep plants that require little water, such as cacti.  _ Wash walls and counters frequently. Use mold-inhibiting cleaners to prevent the growth of mold.  _ Don't use carpet or wallpaper in rooms prone to dampness.  Pets  The problem: One in 43 people is allergic to cat dander _ skin cells cats shed that float in the air. Cat allergens are notorious for causing asthma attacks.  An equal number of people are sensitive to dog dander, but dog allergens seem to cause fewer symptoms.  Hamsters, mice, gerbils and guinea pigs can also be allergenic, but with rodents, the culprit is the urine.  Trouble spots: Homes or classrooms with animals cause problems.  The solution: If a child is severely allergic to cats, doctors recommend giving the animal up for adoption or to a neighbor so your child can visit. Once a cat is removed, it takes five months of cleaning to rid the house of dander.  If your family can't part with Kitty, these strategies can cut the dander:  _ Keep the cat out of bedrooms and confined to a few noncarpeted rooms.  _ Wash dander off the cat weekly by gently pouring 2 quarts of water over the animal.  _ Vacuum regularly and use a high-efficiency room cleaner (see sidebar) to trap airborne dander.  Because rodent urine causes allergies, you may be able to keep the cage in the basement and bring the animal out to play.  ``However, in a highly allergic child, a bite can kill,'' warns Dr. Thomas Platts-Mills, head of Allergy and Clinical Immunology at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.  If you're picking a new pet, forget fur and feathers and think fish.  Cockroaches  The problem: Every part of a cockroach is allergenic. In cities, cockroaches are thought to play a major role in kids' allergies and asthma, according to Dr. Myron J. Zitt, co-chairman of the Asthma Zero Mortality Coalition based in New York City.  Trouble spots: Homes in cities are particularly susceptible to cockroaches.  The solution: Professional exterminating is the best way to get rid of roaches. Kids and pets should be kept out of the house during treatment and for a few hours afterward.  You can also control roaches by setting traps, sealing cracks with caulk and keeping food in airtight containers. -0- SIDEBAR: ALLERGY-PROOFING PRODUCTS  Air cleaners  What they do: Remove mold spores, pollen, dander and smoke (but not dust mites or cockroach allergens) from air.  Shopping hints: Look for units with HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) or ULPA (ultra-low penetration air) filters.  A first step: Rent a cleaner from a medical supply store.  Air filters  What they do: Attach to a furnace and trap airborne allergens.  Shopping hints: Electrostatic cleaners are best.  A first step: Cover air vents with several layers of cheesecloth.  Mite-tight pillow and mattress covers  What they do: Keep allergens in mattresses and pillows away from sleeping children.  Shopping hints: For a softer feel and fewer rips, look for vinyl that's flexible. Vinyl-lined fabric covers are even better.  A first step: Wash pillows weekly in hot water (at least 130 F).  Allergy vacuums  What they do: Trap microscopic particles such as dust mites, cockroach allergens and animal dander. Most vacuums just stir them up.  Shopping hints: Look for HEPA filters and double-thickness bags.  A first step: Use a double-thickness bag on a regular vacuum cleaner. -0- SIDEBAR: FOR MORE INFORMATION  Asthma &AMP; Allergy Foundation of America: Call (800) 7ASTHMA for brochures and a list of allergy product companies.

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Michael Keaton in a scene from ``Multiplicity.'' By JEANNE WOLF (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Michael Keaton can identify with the guy he plays in ``Multiplicity'' _ a hard-driving construction-company boss who's struggling to find enough time to be a husband and father as well as get ahead in his career.  Keaton's character, Doug Kinney, thinks he's solved the problem when he agrees to let a world-renowned geneticist clone him so there will be enough Dougs to handle all the demands he faces.  But Keaton insists he wouldn't go that far in real life _ even if it seems tempting.  ``I would never want to be cloned,'' he says, ``but I do wish there was more than one of me.''  Keaton struggles to combine Hollywood stardom with his role as a devoted single father _ and part-time baseball coach _ to his teen-age son, Sean.  ``I can't seem to keep up with everything,'' he admits with a shake of his head. ``I'm not a good manager of my time. I find myself saying, `Alright, this is too much, I'm cutting back!' And I don't mean just in my personal life. I'm also talking about my career, where there are a lot of decisions to be made.''  In 1994, one of those decisions grabbed headlines as Keaton walked away from a reported $30 million-plus salary to continue in the title role in ``Batman Forever'' (1995). Keaton then signed on for the latest Farrelly Brothers gross-out comedy, ``Kingpin,'' and then once again changed his mind, giving up another fat paycheck.  ``I'm not necessarily motivated by money,'' he says with a shrug. ``Which is not to say I don't like making it. I'm not one of those people who whines, `I'm an artist, money isn't important.'  ``Actually, I get a bigger kick out of making money in investments and stuff that I do on my own instead of the salary I collect for a movie. Anyway, I knew the next `Batman' would be a money machine _ but after I read the script I didn't think it offered me a chance to reach a new potential. It didn't interest me and I have no regrets about not doing it.''  What did grab Keaton's attention was ``Multiplicity,'' which offered the daunting challenge of playing four different roles _ Doug Kinney and the three clones who become a part of his life.  ``From the moment I agreed to do it until we wrapped the film,'' Keaton says, ``I kept asking, `Why am I putting myself through this?' I was having fun but it was overwhelming.''  The problem was that the four characters are identical only in appearance. ``Doug 2'' is a sexy macho man, ``Doug 3'' a sensitive, gentle homebody and ``Doug 4'' an out-of-control fool who provides slapstick comedy relief.  ``I know you want to know which one is most like me,'' Keaton says. ``I guess the real Doug is closest. But I think I have some of 3, the gentle guy, in me and, I hate to say it, but also No. 4, who provides most of the physical comedy.  ``It was much more difficult to play these four roles than totally different characters,'' Keaton says. ``I was portraying subtle differences in each of the clones because they all came from Doug. Each new version of Doug, except maybe 4 _ the bad copy who was over the top _ had to be something like him.''  To pull it off, Keaton faced a daily struggle to differentiate the clones, as he changed in and out of various wardrobes and personas.  ``I might do Doug 4, and then I'd be in a scene as Doug 2,''' he says. ``It was all shot out of sequence and I was constantly trying to figure out where to look, since the other characters in the scene would be added later with computerized effects.''  But of course this sort of challenge is exactly why he accepted the role, Keaton admits.  ``I guess I have a low boredom factor,'' he says. ``I've been in movies where I say to myself, `This is so boring I can't believe I'm doing this scene.' Then the challenge is to psyche myself up to get through it.  ``I know there are a lot of actors who've built their careers on doing the same thing _ playing a version of themselves in every movie. That doesn't mean they're not good actors. I just haven't been able to learn to settle for that.''  Keaton compares the rush of nailing a scene to an athlete's exhilaration.  ``You get in the zone,'' he says. ``It's about as good as anything in the world. I'm sure that's what Michael Jordan is experiencing when he's ripping up the court.  ``Sometimes I get self-conscious before a scene, and I'd like to be more like Michael _ just projecting that sense that `I can do it and I'm going to do it and it's going to be unbelievable.'  ``But I admit I still get nervous,'' he adds. ``I'm saying to myself, `God, I hope they like it.' But hopefully I don't get obnoxiously neurotic about it.''  The only other thing in life which gives him a similar charge is riding, he says. He is devoted to rodeo cutting-horse competitions:  ``You ride for 2 1/2 minutes, and if for 30 seconds of that time you've got the horse down and doing it, it's the best.  ``I haven't had time to ride lately,'' he continues. ``Recently, I went out twice and I realized how much I'd missed it. I felt like a reformed heroin addict who suddenly gets a fix. I thought, `Well, if I had a clone then I'd have more time to be up on a horse.'''  Keaton always makes time for his 13-year-old son Sean, from his marriage to actress Catherine McWilliams. Sean lives with him at his home near the beach in Los Angeles, and Keaton often sounds like a real-life Mr. Mom as he details running errands, driving his son to and from school and baseball practice.  But Keaton doesn't think his kid has paid a big price to have a movie star for a dad.  ``It's been totally cool,'' he says. ``When I did the first `Batman' he came over and sat in the Batmobile. He loves those classic heroes and it was a big thrill.  ``But I don't want him to become an asterisk,'' he adds. ``You know, `Sean, that movie star's kid.'  ``He's going to camp this summer. He's going far away for the first time and it's a big deal. I decided not to take him. There will be kids from all over the country and I just didn't want anyone saying, `Hey, I didn't know your dad was Michael Keaton.'  ``He's just who he is. And he's totally, totally cool about it. He digs it, loves what I do and loves his own life.''  Next up for Keaton is a searing drama, ``Desperate Measures,'' in which he plays a convict serving a life term who becomes an organ donor to the son of a detective.  ``I'm looking forward to it,'' he says. ``I think I'll be happy doing it, just like making `Multiplicity' made me happy. If I'd done `Batman' I wouldn't have been happy. I don't want to give up several months of my life to something I don't care about. I'm 43 and I feel the clock ticking. I feel that clock of life.  ``I hate to bring up Michael Jordan again,'' he says, smiling, ``but I admire his style. He plays every game like he's trying to make the team. He gives it everything.  ``I want to keep some of that in my own life. I'm not going to hold back anymore.

By CINDY PEARLMAN World rights except Chicago (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  The next time an exasperated director yells, ``Oh, brother!'' he may mean it literally.  Lately the director's chair is a family affair. On July 27, brothers Peter and Bobby Farrelly (directors of 1994's ``Dumb and Dumber'') will release their co-directed bowling comedy ``Kingpin.''  Larry and Andy Wachowski directed the mob thriller ``Bound,'' which was the toast of the recent Sundance Film Festival and will be released in October.  Joel and Ethan Coen's recent ``Fargo'' is still playing in major cities.  Allen and Albert Hughes are mulling over their next project, following the successful ``Menace II Society'' (1993) and ``Dead Presidents'' (1995).  The various Wayans brothers are always busy with projects such as the recent ``Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Juice in the Hood,'' co-written and starring Marlon and Shawn, produced by Keenen Ivory.  Meanwhile, some established brother teams are taking a break. David Zucker is going solo to produce this fall's ``High School High,'' a parody of secondary education starring Jon Lovitz.  The Hudlin brothers (of 1990's ``House Party'') are also looking into branching out on their own. Reginald directed this spring's ``Great White Hype,'' and his brother Warrington is looking to produce and write his own films.  Imagine two Spielbergs. Two Hitchcocks. Two Scorseses. It's hard to picture, but no harder than imagining one Coen without his sibling.  ``The No. 1 question I get is `Why work with your brother?''' Keenen Ivory Wayans says. ``Some people can't stand being in the room with their brother for more than 10 minutes, so I can understand why people think it's strange.''  But for these directing brothers, it seems that brotherhood outweighs sibling rivalry.  ``It's a funny thing,'' says Bobby Farrelly. ``We worked together 10 years ago on a paper route. Alone, when we had separate routes, we were terrible. We couldn't get up on time. Together we were better.  ``When you're directing there are so many decisions to make,'' he continues. ``You have to decide everything from the color of the drapes to what to do with actors who are not coming out of their trailers. If you halve the number of decisions, it saves brain power.''  ``You get to the point where you've made so many decisions that you actually become indecisive,'' Peter agrees. ``I'll look at my brother and he'll nod. Then I'm just so much more sure. It's like being a single parent _ that's fine, but it's easier with two.''  In theory, Joel Coen directs and Ethan Coen produces. In reality, they share most of the work, especially the screenwriting.  ``We just let Joel have the title of director because he's older,'' Ethan quips.  ``There seems to be a confusion that you have to be similar to each other to direct together,'' Joel says. ``We're not similar. Because we make movies together doesn't mean we're identical or our point of views are identical or our taste is the same. All it means is the movies we end up making are a reflection of the points in which our tastes and ideas coincide.''  And when they don't agree?  ``The movies we disagree on don't get made,'' Ethan says.  A movie set is a complex mechanism, with tens of millions of dollars riding on the director's decisions. Obviously, whenever and wherever co-directors disagree, it can't be on the set.  But all the brother acts report that the actual directing goes very smoothly.  ``We work side by side,'' Peter Farrelly says. ``Bobby's at the monitor. I watch the actors up close. After a shot, we confer. I speak to the actors. We feel we should speak in one voice.''  Though having two directors might seem an actor's worst nightmare, the celebrated Paul Newman was eager to work with the Coens, though ``The Hudsucker Proxy'' (1994) didn't succeed at the box office.  ``I was looking to work with one young director and I got two. It was a bargain deal,'' Newman says. ``At first, I thought they would never agree and it would be a mess. I was shocked at how it worked like a machine. The brothers were one voice in two people.''  But no two people can agree all the time, which can pose problems on a movie set, where the director is traditionally the final authority.  ``We have to fight it out even if it gets bloody,'' Reginald Hudlin says. ``And believe me, we don't always agree. Yet there are times to stir it up. There are times to go for it. It's better for the creative process.''  ``We also collaborate with other people, and nobody asks us if we have fights with our director of photography,'' Joel Coen says grumpily, ``and we've worked with him on three movies. All anyone asks us about is if we fight.''  All right, do the Coen brothers ever fight with their director of photography?  In unison they announce, ``We hate him!''  The Coens can joke about it, but being a team can help in dealing with outsiders, Larry Wachowski says.  ``Let's say we work with a big, troubled movie star in the future. There's two of us, one of them. I can say to the Troubled One, `I don't know what's going on here. My brother is crazy. Just do it to make him happy.'''  Brothers will always be brothers, but that doesn't mean they're co-directors forever. David and Jerry Zucker, along with their friend Jim Abrahams, were the creative force behind hits such as ``Airplane'' (1980), ``Ruthless People'' (1986) and ``Naked Gun'' (1988), producing, directing and writing in various combinations and grossing hundreds of millions of dollars.  But last summer, the brothers parted ways _ at least for now. David produced the magical-realist romance ``A Walk in the Clouds'' (1995). Jerry, who had won acclaim for his solo direction of the box-office hit ``Ghost'' (1990), directed and produced the far less successful ``First Knight'' (1995).  ``There are only so many hours in a day and so many years you have to do the stuff you want to do,'' David Zucker says. ``Sometimes you don't want to do what your brother wants to do, so instead of spending two years of your life on a movie, it's best to find your own project.  ``Sometimes it's good to see just your name. And then you can always go back to being one of the brothers.''  The Hudlins have had a similar cordial split.  ``My brother Warrington did not work on `Great White Hype' because he's actually courting other projects he is going to be directing solo. I did get to a point where I said I want to make movies myself,'' Reginald says.  ``We're still looking out for each other's work, but we're concentrating on individual growth for now. That way we can get more projects going in every medium.  ``You need a chance to grow and work on an even bigger canvas,'' he continues. ``We want to try something fresh and new. We didn't want to be doing `House Party 6,' `Garden Party,' `Old Age Home Party' forever.''  For now, the Farrellys have no intention of following suit. After all, it took them a long time to get to where they are now, including 15 separate films that never got made.  ``I was ready to cash it in. My brother told me to give it one more year,'' Bobby says. ``At the time, it was too hard to explain what we were doing for a living. Our parents thought we were bookies.''  After ``Kingpin,'' the duo is developing ``The Three Stooges'' for the big screen. It will be co-directed, of course.  ``I can't imagine doing this any other way than with my brother,'' Joel Coen says. ``We've been doing this for so long. You're a prisoner of your own routine.''  According to Larry Wachowski, there's one extra bonus to being a brother act that solo work could never bring:  ``Your mother is very happy,'' Larry says. ``My mom would wander into the shops at Sundance and people would be talking about the movie. She would say, `My sons did that. Both of them. Together.'''  As for the future, he muses, ``You know, we do have a couple of sisters.  ``Maybe they can get together and make a movie.'' c.1996 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.)

By MICHAEL CASTLEMAN From Sierra magazine c.1995 Michael Castleman (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  Environmentalists are generally the last people to douse themselves with chemicals bearing tongue-twister names. But for summertime outings, there's one chemical even the most toxics-conscious tend to slather.  It's N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide, a chemical better known as ``deet,'' the active ingredient in Cutter's, Deep Woods Off!, Tick Garde and most other commercial insect repellents.  Developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the 1950s, deet is the most effective insect repellent currently available. Some 200 million people apply it worldwide each year, and adverse reactions are rare.  But deet is not hazard-free. The chemical penetrates the skin and enters the bloodstream readily. Since 1961, when the New England Journal of Medicine published the first report of brain damage apparently related to the use of deet, several case studies have suggested that deet should be used cautiously.  After being liberally treated with deet for several weeks, six girls under the age of nine developed toxic encephalopathy and suffered convulsions. One died. Brief deet exposures have also been blamed for seizures in several other children.  In adults, the chemical has been linked to less severe neurological problems, most often irritability, confusion and insomnia.  Concerns about deet have increased since the late 1980s, when worries about ticks spreading Lyme disease spurred the public to apply bug repellents more frequently and liberally.  In recent years, the health departments of New York, New Jersey and Utah, as well as the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have all issued warnings about the possible hazards of overzealous application of deet.  So what's an outdoorsperson to do?  One approach is to wear lightweight, longsleeved shirts and long pants, and spray deet on your clothing instead of on your skin. That way little, if any, deet has a chance to get into your bloodstream.  Another strategy is to select a deet product with a modest concentration of the chemical. While you'll find plenty of potions on the shelves with deet concentrations as high as 95 or 100 percent, several state public-health departments recommend formulations with no more than 30 percent.  The American Academy of Pediatrics goes further, recommending that children use repellents that have 10 percent or less deet, such as Off! Skintastic (7.1 percent), or Skedaddle! (9.5 percent), even though such products are considerably less effective.  Doubts about deet have led to the development of several plant-based insect repellents.  Because plants have neither arms to brush off insects nor legs to flee them, some have evolved aromatic oils to thwart predators: Anise, basil, catnip, eucalyptus, garlic, pennyroyal and tansy have all long been used as insect repellents. (Pennyroyal oil is often the active ingredient in herbal flea collars and similar natural pet-care products.)  Most commercial plant-based insect repellents, however, use the oil of citronella, a lemon-scented Asian grass now cultivated in the tropics worldwide. The main problem experienced with citronella oil is that it evaporates rapidly, allowing the bugs it repels to quickly return.  One company, Biopharm Labs, claims to have solved that problem by using a modified version of the oil in a glycerine-based lotion called Treo. Unlike most natural insect repellents, Treo is registered with the Environmental Protection Agency, meaning that the manufacturer has supplied the government with required safety and efficacy data.  In this case, Biopharm contracted with University of Utah entomologists specializing in ticks and other biting insects to test Treo head-to-head against deet. They found it as effective as Cutter's and Deep Woods Off! in repelling mosquitoes and biting flies, and as effective as Tick Garde in repelling ticks.  It should be noted, however, that Consumer Reports magazine says even the best deet products deter ticks only 75 percent to 87 percent of the time, and the Lyme Disease Foundation cautions not to rely on repellent alone.  The Treo formula is also found in Avon's Skin-So-Soft Moisturizing Suncare Plus, a product developed after the company's Skin-So-Soft bath oil had acquired a largely unwarranted word-of-mouth reputation as an effective non-deet insect repellent.  Whether you rub on a plant-based repellent or just wrap yourself in comfortable clothing, you don't have to choose between deet and an armful of mosquito bites. For people seeking a chemical-free walk in the woods, that idea is a natural.

By MARJORIE INGALL From Diversion magazine c.1996 Marjorie Ingall (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.) EDITORS: Please note ``(T)'' in the computer address below equates to a tilde (the tilde character, in many instances, cannot be transmitted into newspaper computer systems).  Thanks to the recent explosive growth of the World Wide Web, you can now search vast recipe archives, read reviews of four-star restaurants in distant countries and solicit advice from fellow cooks who are happy to theorize about why your egg whites stubbornly refuse to form stiff peaks.  In some cities you can even input your grocery list or pizza order and have the goods delivered to your door 15 minutes later.  Of course, the major commercial services can satisfy some of your cravings: America Online offers recipes from Woman's Day and the San Jose Mercury News, Prodigy has an online version of the Zagat Surveys, CompuServe has a recipe archives and all three services have food-related discussion areas and ``malls'' in which you can buy products and cooking equipment.  But for the best graphics and the widest range of food information, the Web's the place to be.  Unfortunately, though, not all sites are worth perusing. Most are slow, disorganized, poorly written, advertiser driven or so heavy with graphics they're unreadable.  How do you find the few worth clicking onto? Here's a list of the food sites that should enhance your gustatory enjoyment. GENERAL STORES  Foodplex (http://www.gigaplex.com/wow/food/index.htm) is the brainchild of Los Angeles restaurant critic Merrill Shindler.  Quirky, opinionated and funny, Shindler conducts his own taste test of dog biscuits, checks the distribution of animal breeds in a box of animal crackers and provides recipes for a four-course all-popcorn dinner.  He also offers his favorite ``recipes for the totally inept'' (including avocado soup and Greek eggplant dip, both delicious).  A word to the wise: Shindler's West Coast restaurant recommendations are far more trustworthy than his East Coast ones.  Godiva chocolate (http://www.godiva.com/). The most seductive commercial spot on the Web, the Godiva Web Site includes sumptuous photos and recipes for chocolate-hazelnut-mascarpone torte with raspberries, fudge truffle cheesecake and a white chocolate-black pepper mousse napoleon.  There's also chocolate history, chocolate trivia (did you know that chocolate can be lethal to dogs?) and, of course, an order form for Godiva goodies.  Many of the recipes may be too challenging for home cooks, but the site is a big heart-shaped box of fun.  CheeseNet (http://exclamation.com/cheesenet). These people really like cheese.  You can learn how cheese is made, study ``cheese language'' (which rivals wine language in its specificity _ cheese can be ``earthy,'' ``open,'' ``mushroomy'' or ``supple''), find cheese vendors, download recipes, read the famous Monty Python ``Cheese Shop'' sketch and ponder cheese poetry (including an ode to aerosol-canned cheese in perfect 14-line sonnet form).  Epicurious (http://www.epicurious.com/) is the Web's most famous food site, but I have some problems with it. It's the online version of Bon Appetit and Gourmet magazines, so the recipes are mouthwatering and the articles (by such terrific food writers as Joan Nathan and Jeffrey Steingarten) are entertaining. But the site is ungainly.  There's no database for the restaurants mentioned, so you can't conduct a search. And it's really designed for fast modems _  the text-only version provided for 14.4-baud-or-slower modems isn't engaging to look at. BEVERAGES  Over the Coffee (http://www.cappuccino.com/) will fulfill all your caffeine-laden needs.  There's information on different blends and roasts, candid opinions on various espresso machines, a bunch of biscotti recipes (including a nut-free cardamom version) and more.  Virtual Vineyards (http://www.virtualvin.com/) lets you read detailed assessments of various wines, then order them.  The Web Site is run by Peter Granoff, (a.k.a. the Cork Dork), a professional wine buyer, teacher and restaurant consultant. Granoff describes wines elegantly yet unpretentiously, and even though the featured vineyards are advertisers, the site maintains a sense of editorial integrity.  It's fun and useful; the co-owner of Storybook Mountain Vineyards provides an easy, delicious-sounding recipe for zinfandel risotto.  And any site featuring Bonny Doon, a winery whose owner is the quirkiest wine maker in the country, is worth checking out. RECIPES  Amy Gale (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/(T)mjw/recipes/) is a New Zealander who has amassed a huge no-graphics, no-nonsense collection of recipes from net denizens all over the world.  The dishes vary widely in quality _ if you're an experienced cook who can scan a list of ingredients and quickly decide yea or nay, you'll do fine.  Veggies Unite! (http://www.honors.indiana.edu/(T)veggie/recipes.cgi/) is the best-structured recipe site.  This is an easily browsable collection of more than 2,000 vegetarian recipes, listed both alphabetically and by category, along with an interactive weekly menu planner and shopping list.  A lot of the recipes are a bit earthy-crunchy, but others are divine, such as kaoneaw mamong (Thai sweet rice with mangoes) and a bread pudding with whiskey sauce.  This site also loads quickly, even with a slow modem.  The Mole Page (http://www.slip.net/(T)bobnemo/mole.html) is a tribute to the savory Mexican sauce. The site explains where the word ``mole'' comes from: the Aztec word ``molli,'' meaning ``concoction.''  You can browse the small repository (21, at last count) of recipes, including green pumpkin-seed mole with chicken breasts, yellow pork mole with dumplings and mole con dos chiles (mole with two kinds of chiles).  Kosher Express (http://www.marketnet.com/mktnet/kosher/recipes.html) is a wonderful source of kosher recipes, especially for the Jewish holidays.  Among those that I thought to be particularly good were SaraBeth's Cream Cheese Brownies and acorn squash with apple stuffing.  Cookin' on the Net (http://www.cooknet.org/index.html) combines hedonism and philanthropy.  Five heralded American chefs _ from Campanile in Los Angeles, Union Square Cafe in New York, Stars in San Francisco, Rialto in Boston and Charlie Trotter's in Chicago _ have contributed recipes ranging from a goat cheese-and-caramelized-onion tart to salmon paillard with black-bean sauce.  For $12 (payable by check or credit card), you get the recipes as well as a chance to win CDs and cookbooks. The money goes to five nonprofit programs that teach disadvantaged kids about computers and technology. RESTAURANT GUIDES  Digital Restaurant Guide to San Francisco (http://www.sf.net/lantern) is astounding. More than 3,000 restaurants are reviewed, and the listings are savvy and comprehensive, offering hours, prices and ratings for food, atmosphere and service.  You can search the database by neighborhood, ranking or type of cuisine, and there's even a cute map for each restaurant's vicinity.  What's more, there are currently plans to expand to other cities, so stay tuned.  Dining Out on the Web (http://www.ird.net/diningout.html) is a mammoth collection of links to restaurant reviews and listings all over the country. There's also a form for adding your own opinion.  The reviews aren't nearly as trustworthy as the Digital Restaurant Guide's, but they do cover more territory. I especially liked the frozen-custard-flavor forecasts for Milwaukee. JUST FOR FUN  T.W.I.N.K.I.E.S. (Tests With Inorganic Noxious Kakes In Extreme Situations) Project (http://www.rice.edu/(T)gouge/twinkies.html) consists of various science experiments conducted by two Rice University students on the little Hostess sponge logs.  The results, as well as the mock-academic tone, are truly hilarious.  Burrito Page (http://www.infobahn.com/pages/rito.html) enables you to input your favorite burrito ingredients and receive an instant analysis of your character, learn some burrito lore and pick up a few new ingredient ideas.

By SUSAN INCE c.1996 Child (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  Cozy, soft and warm. That's the popular image of a child-friendly home. But for the one in five children who has allergies, the air in that carpeted, toy-filled house is a particle-filled cloud that sends the immune system into miserable overdrive.  The result? Runny noses, irritated eyes and, for many children, life-threatening asthma and lung inflammation.  ``We have a precious picture of our daughter, Brittany, at 2 months, surrounded by a mountain of stuffed animals. We didn't know then that those cuddly toys were making her sick,'' says Dianne Williams of Coral Springs, Fla.  Her daughter, now 8, was diagnosed at 2 with severe asthma. Allergy tests revealed that a host of household items _ including nearly everything in her picturesque bedroom _ could trigger her attacks.  Genetics may determine whether a child is susceptible to allergies, but a baby isn't born allergic to anything in particular. What a child is exposed to determines what she will become allergic to _ and the more allergens in a child's environment the more risk that a serious allergy or asthma will develop.  ``We don't know if we can prevent asthma, but we think the window of opportunity to avoid allergies is the first 12 months of life, when the immune system has not yet matured,'' says Vancouver, Canada, asthma specialist Moira Chan-Yeung.  Allergist Rebecca Bascom, associate professor of medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, now thinks it makes sense to bring all newborns with a family history of allergies home to low-allergen houses to prevent potential problems.  Whether you want to reduce the symptoms and the need for medication of an allergy sufferer in your family, or you want to lessen the risk that your newborn will develop allergies, the following strategies can help. While some of them may sound drastic, you will soon find they're worth it if your child is truly suffering.  Dust Mites  The problem: Most dust-sensitive people are actually allergic to dust mites _ microscopic, eight-legged creatures that feed on water absorbed from the air and dead skin cells _ and their excrement.  These critters are the major trigger for asthma in many parts of the world.  Trouble spots: Dust mites cause problems anywhere it's humid but cause little trouble in dry and high altitude areas such as the Southwest.  At home, mites like fiber, padding, dust and darkness. Carpets and mattresses are favorite spots.  The solution: Remove or clean dust collecting items and, if possible, wall-to-wall carpet. Allergists suggest having bare wood or linoleum floors, especially in bedrooms. You can liven things up with throw rugs that can be washed weekly in hot water (at least 130 F).  ``People are reluctant to take away the carpet and soft, fuzzy things in their children's bedrooms, but getting rid of them is the most important thing you can do to control dust mites,'' says Linda B. Ford, an allergist in Omaha, Neb.  Other suggestions for controlling dust:  _ Use bright, washable curtains or wipable shades instead of dust-collecting heavy drapes or slatted blinds.  _ Remove pictures and wall hangings. Stencil designs on walls instead.  _ Put mite-tight covers (see sidebar) on pillows and mattresses. Follow manufacturers' washing instructions.  _ Use synthetic pillows instead of feather pillows and wash them weekly.  _ Wash sheets and blankets weekly in hot water. Polyester/cotton blends are better than lint-producing all-cotton.  _ Keep closet doors shut and pack away out-of-season clothes.  _ Put toys in plastic storage bins, in closed closets or on shelves with doors. Dust books on shelves frequently with a damp cloth.  _ Keep stuffed animals that aren't constant companions in a closet, storage bin or another room.  Treat inseparable pals with a weekly wash _ wrap them in a pillow case with a rubber band to protect them in the washing machine. If they won't survive another wash, try freezing them until they get crusty, Ford suggests. The cold will kill the mites.  _ Treat carpets that you can't remove and upholstered furniture with chemicals to kill or reduce mites. Acarosan (a moist powder) kills mites for three to six months and binds their feces into large enough pieces to be vacuumed up.  Acarosan is harmful to children and pets, so keep them off the carpet until the area is thoroughly vacuumed.  Another chemical, tannic acid, also helps reduce allergic reactions to mites, but it can stain light carpets and furniture, so test a small section first.  _ Dust with a damp, not dry, cloth to pick up dust mites while cleaning.  _ Vacuum often, and consider investing in an anti-allergen machine (see sidebar) that traps microscopic particles.  _ Keep the humidity low in your house (35 percent to 50 percent is ideal). Mites thrive when humidity tops 50 percent. You can check the levels with a humidity gauge from the hardware store.  Central air conditioning is the most effective way to control humidity, though window units also work, provided you clean the filters monthly.  Dehumidifiers are also good, but their reservoirs must be cleaned daily to prevent fungi and bacteria growth.  Mold  The problem: Many kids are allergic to fungi and mold _ microscopic organisms that flourish in damp environments. Up to 30 percent of kids with asthma may be mold-sensitive.  Trouble spots: Humid and flood-prone regions are the most mold-friendly. Many homes have hidden sources of mold that can cause chronic allergies.  Sources include: damp basements, dirty humidifiers or air conditioners, carpeting (especially when installed over concrete or in bathrooms or kitchens), indoor plants (especially those requiring frequent watering), garbage cans, water-damaged walls or flooring, window sills, damp firewood, wallpaper, shower stalls, wicker baskets, cardboard boxes or newspapers, crawl spaces, stored clothing and shoes, refrigerators, mattresses, pillows and blankets that haven't been aired out for a while and dried flowers.  The solution: On hard surfaces, mold can be cleaned with a solution of 1 part chlorine bleach to 20 parts water. To prevent the growth of mold:  _ Use bathroom paint labeled ``mildew proof,'' or mix a mildew- or mold-inhibiting additive into paint. ~  _ Use a dehumidifier. ~  _ Store shoes and clothes in plastic containers, not in cardboard boxes.  _ Install and use exhaust fans in bathrooms and kitchens.  _ Keep plants that require little water, such as cacti.  _ Wash walls and counters frequently. Use mold-inhibiting cleaners to prevent the growth of mold.  _ Don't use carpet or wallpaper in rooms prone to dampness.  Pets  The problem: One in 43 people is allergic to cat dander _ skin cells cats shed that float in the air. Cat allergens are notorious for causing asthma attacks.  An equal number of people are sensitive to dog dander, but dog allergens seem to cause fewer symptoms.  Hamsters, mice, gerbils and guinea pigs can also be allergenic, but with rodents, the culprit is the urine.  Trouble spots: Homes or classrooms with animals cause problems.  The solution: If a child is severely allergic to cats, doctors recommend giving the animal up for adoption or to a neighbor so your child can visit. Once a cat is removed, it takes five months of cleaning to rid the house of dander.  If your family can't part with Kitty, these strategies can cut the dander:  _ Keep the cat out of bedrooms and confined to a few noncarpeted rooms.  _ Wash dander off the cat weekly by gently pouring 2 quarts of water over the animal.  _ Vacuum regularly and use a high-efficiency room cleaner (see sidebar) to trap airborne dander.  Because rodent urine causes allergies, you may be able to keep the cage in the basement and bring the animal out to play.  ``However, in a highly allergic child, a bite can kill,'' warns Dr. Thomas Platts-Mills, head of Allergy and Clinical Immunology at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.  If you're picking a new pet, forget fur and feathers and think fish.  Cockroaches  The problem: Every part of a cockroach is allergenic. In cities, cockroaches are thought to play a major role in kids' allergies and asthma, according to Dr. Myron J. Zitt, co-chairman of the Asthma Zero Mortality Coalition based in New York City.  Trouble spots: Homes in cities are particularly susceptible to cockroaches.  The solution: Professional exterminating is the best way to get rid of roaches. Kids and pets should be kept out of the house during treatment and for a few hours afterward.  You can also control roaches by setting traps, sealing cracks with caulk and keeping food in airtight containers. -0- SIDEBAR: ALLERGY-PROOFING PRODUCTS  Air cleaners  What they do: Remove mold spores, pollen, dander and smoke (but not dust mites or cockroach allergens) from air.  Shopping hints: Look for units with HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) or ULPA (ultra-low penetration air) filters.  A first step: Rent a cleaner from a medical supply store.  Air filters  What they do: Attach to a furnace and trap airborne allergens.  Shopping hints: Electrostatic cleaners are best.  A first step: Cover air vents with several layers of cheesecloth.  Mite-tight pillow and mattress covers  What they do: Keep allergens in mattresses and pillows away from sleeping children.  Shopping hints: For a softer feel and fewer rips, look for vinyl that's flexible. Vinyl-lined fabric covers are even better.  A first step: Wash pillows weekly in hot water (at least 130 F).  Allergy vacuums  What they do: Trap microscopic particles such as dust mites, cockroach allergens and animal dander. Most vacuums just stir them up.  Shopping hints: Look for HEPA filters and double-thickness bags.  A first step: Use a double-thickness bag on a regular vacuum cleaner. -0- SIDEBAR: FOR MORE INFORMATION  Asthma &AMP; Allergy Foundation of America: Call (800) 7ASTHMA for brochures and a list of allergy product companies.

By JEANNE WOLF (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Michael Keaton can identify with the guy he plays in ``Multiplicity'' _ a hard-driving construction-company boss who's struggling to find enough time to be a husband and father as well as get ahead in his career.  Keaton's character, Doug Kinney, thinks he's solved the problem when he agrees to let a world-renowned geneticist clone him so there will be enough Dougs to handle all the demands he faces.  But Keaton insists he wouldn't go that far in real life _ even if it seems tempting.  ``I would never want to be cloned,'' he says, ``but I do wish there was more than one of me.''  Keaton struggles to combine Hollywood stardom with his role as a devoted single father _ and part-time baseball coach _ to his teen-age son, Sean.  ``I can't seem to keep up with everything,'' he admits with a shake of his head. ``I'm not a good manager of my time. I find myself saying, `Alright, this is too much, I'm cutting back!' And I don't mean just in my personal life. I'm also talking about my career, where there are a lot of decisions to be made.''  In 1994, one of those decisions grabbed headlines as Keaton walked away from a reported $30 million-plus salary to continue in the title role in ``Batman Forever'' (1995). Keaton then signed on for the latest Farrelly Brothers gross-out comedy, ``Kingpin,'' and then once again changed his mind, giving up another fat paycheck.  ``I'm not necessarily motivated by money,'' he says with a shrug. ``Which is not to say I don't like making it. I'm not one of those people who whines, `I'm an artist, money isn't important.'  ``Actually, I get a bigger kick out of making money in investments and stuff that I do on my own instead of the salary I collect for a movie. Anyway, I knew the next `Batman' would be a money machine _ but after I read the script I didn't think it offered me a chance to reach a new potential. It didn't interest me and I have no regrets about not doing it.''  What did grab Keaton's attention was ``Multiplicity,'' which offered the daunting challenge of playing four different roles _ Doug Kinney and the three clones who become a part of his life.  ``From the moment I agreed to do it until we wrapped the film,'' Keaton says, ``I kept asking, `Why am I putting myself through this?' I was having fun but it was overwhelming.''  The problem was that the four characters are identical only in appearance. ``Doug 2'' is a sexy macho man, ``Doug 3'' a sensitive, gentle homebody and ``Doug 4'' an out-of-control fool who provides slapstick comedy relief.  ``I know you want to know which one is most like me,'' Keaton says. ``I guess the real Doug is closest. But I think I have some of 3, the gentle guy, in me and, I hate to say it, but also No. 4, who provides most of the physical comedy.  ``It was much more difficult to play these four roles than totally different characters,'' Keaton says. ``I was portraying subtle differences in each of the clones because they all came from Doug. Each new version of Doug, except maybe 4 _ the bad copy who was over the top _ had to be something like him.''  To pull it off, Keaton faced a daily struggle to differentiate the clones, as he changed in and out of various wardrobes and personas.  ``I might do Doug 4, and then I'd be in a scene as Doug 2,''' he says. ``It was all shot out of sequence and I was constantly trying to figure out where to look, since the other characters in the scene would be added later with computerized effects.''  But of course this sort of challenge is exactly why he accepted the role, Keaton admits.  ``I guess I have a low boredom factor,'' he says. ``I've been in movies where I say to myself, `This is so boring I can't believe I'm doing this scene.' Then the challenge is to psyche myself up to get through it.  ``I know there are a lot of actors who've built their careers on doing the same thing _ playing a version of themselves in every movie. That doesn't mean they're not good actors. I just haven't been able to learn to settle for that.''  Keaton compares the rush of nailing a scene to an athlete's exhilaration.  ``You get in the zone,'' he says. ``It's about as good as anything in the world. I'm sure that's what Michael Jordan is experiencing when he's ripping up the court.  ``Sometimes I get self-conscious before a scene, and I'd like to be more like Michael _ just projecting that sense that `I can do it and I'm going to do it and it's going to be unbelievable.'  ``But I admit I still get nervous,'' he adds. ``I'm saying to myself, `God, I hope they like it.' But hopefully I don't get obnoxiously neurotic about it.''  The only other thing in life which gives him a similar charge is riding, he says. He is devoted to rodeo cutting-horse competitions:  ``You ride for 2 1/2 minutes, and if for 30 seconds of that time you've got the horse down and doing it, it's the best.  ``I haven't had time to ride lately,'' he continues. ``Recently, I went out twice and I realized how much I'd missed it. I felt like a reformed heroin addict who suddenly gets a fix. I thought, `Well, if I had a clone then I'd have more time to be up on a horse.'''  Keaton always makes time for his 13-year-old son Sean, from his marriage to actress Catherine McWilliams. Sean lives with him at his home near the beach in Los Angeles, and Keaton often sounds like a real-life Mr. Mom as he details running errands, driving his son to and from school and baseball practice.  But Keaton doesn't think his kid has paid a big price to have a movie star for a dad.  ``It's been totally cool,'' he says. ``When I did the first `Batman' he came over and sat in the Batmobile. He loves those classic heroes and it was a big thrill.  ``But I don't want him to become an asterisk,'' he adds. ``You know, `Sean, that movie star's kid.'  ``He's going to camp this summer. He's going far away for the first time and it's a big deal. I decided not to take him. There will be kids from all over the country and I just didn't want anyone saying, `Hey, I didn't know your dad was Michael Keaton.'  ``He's just who he is. And he's totally, totally cool about it. He digs it, loves what I do and loves his own life.''  Next up for Keaton is a searing drama, ``Desperate Measures,'' in which he plays a convict serving a life term who becomes an organ donor to the son of a detective.  ``I'm looking forward to it,'' he says. ``I think I'll be happy doing it, just like making `Multiplicity' made me happy. If I'd done `Batman' I wouldn't have been happy. I don't want to give up several months of my life to something I don't care about. I'm 43 and I feel the clock ticking. I feel that clock of life.  ``I hate to bring up Michael Jordan again,'' he says, smiling, ``but I admire his style. He plays every game like he's trying to make the team. He gives it everything.  ``I want to keep some of that in my own life. I'm not going to hold back anymore. I'm just going to turn it up!'' c.1996 Pentacom Productions  (Jeanne Wolf, who is based in Hollywood, reports on the entertainment industry for television, radio and print outlets.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Joel and Ethan Coen on the set of ``Fargo.'' By CINDY PEARLMAN World rights except Chicago (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  The next time an exasperated director yells, ``Oh, brother!'' he may mean it literally.  Lately the director's chair is a family affair. On July 27, brothers Peter and Bobby Farrelly (directors of 1994's ``Dumb and Dumber'') will release their co-directed bowling comedy ``Kingpin.''  Larry and Andy Wachowski directed the mob thriller ``Bound,'' which was the toast of the recent Sundance Film Festival and will be released in October.  Joel and Ethan Coen's recent ``Fargo'' is still playing in major cities.  Allen and Albert Hughes are mulling over their next project, following the successful ``Menace II Society'' (1993) and ``Dead Presidents'' (1995).  The various Wayans brothers are always busy with projects such as the recent ``Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Juice in the Hood,'' co-written and starring Marlon and Shawn, produced by Keenen Ivory.  Meanwhile, some established brother teams are taking a break. David Zucker is going solo to produce this fall's ``High School High,'' a parody of secondary education starring Jon Lovitz.  The Hudlin brothers (of 1990's ``House Party'') are also looking into branching out on their own. Reginald directed this spring's ``Great White Hype,'' and his brother Warrington is looking to produce and write his own films.  Imagine two Spielbergs. Two Hitchcocks. Two Scorseses. It's hard to picture, but no harder than imagining one Coen without his sibling.  ``The No. 1 question I get is `Why work with your brother?''' Keenen Ivory Wayans says. ``Some people can't stand being in the room with their brother for more than 10 minutes, so I can understand why people think it's strange.''  But for these directing brothers, it seems that brotherhood outweighs sibling rivalry.  ``It's a funny thing,'' says Bobby Farrelly. ``We worked together 10 years ago on a paper route. Alone, when we had separate routes, we were terrible. We couldn't get up on time. Together we were better.  ``When you're directing there are so many decisions to make,'' he continues. ``You have to decide everything from the color of the drapes to what to do with actors who are not coming out of their trailers. If you halve the number of decisions, it saves brain power.''  ``You get to the point where you've made so many decisions that you actually become indecisive,'' Peter agrees. ``I'll look at my brother and he'll nod. Then I'm just so much more sure. It's like being a single parent _ that's fine, but it's easier with two.''  In theory, Joel Coen directs and Ethan Coen produces. In reality, they share most of the work, especially the screenwriting.  ``We just let Joel have the title of director because he's older,'' Ethan quips.  ``There seems to be a confusion that you have to be similar to each other to direct together,'' Joel says. ``We're not similar. Because we make movies together doesn't mean we're identical or our point of views are identical or our taste is the same. All it means is the movies we end up making are a reflection of the points in which our tastes and ideas coincide.''  And when they don't agree?  ``The movies we disagree on don't get made,'' Ethan says.  A movie set is a complex mechanism, with tens of millions of dollars riding on the director's decisions. Obviously, whenever and wherever co-directors disagree, it can't be on the set.  But all the brother acts report that the actual directing goes very smoothly.  ``We work side by side,'' Peter Farrelly says. ``Bobby's at the monitor. I watch the actors up close. After a shot, we confer. I speak to the actors. We feel we should speak in one voice.''  Though having two directors might seem an actor's worst nightmare, the celebrated Paul Newman was eager to work with the Coens, though ``The Hudsucker Proxy'' (1994) didn't succeed at the box office.  ``I was looking to work with one young director and I got two. It was a bargain deal,'' Newman says. ``At first, I thought they would never agree and it would be a mess. I was shocked at how it worked like a machine. The brothers were one voice in two people.''  But no two people can agree all the time, which can pose problems on a movie set, where the director is traditionally the final authority.  ``We have to fight it out even if it gets bloody,'' Reginald Hudlin says. ``And believe me, we don't always agree. Yet there are times to stir it up. There are times to go for it. It's better for the creative process.''  ``We also collaborate with other people, and nobody asks us if we have fights with our director of photography,'' Joel Coen says grumpily, ``and we've worked with him on three movies. All anyone asks us about is if we fight.''  All right, do the Coen brothers ever fight with their director of photography?  In unison they announce, ``We hate him!''  The Coens can joke about it, but being a team can help in dealing with outsiders, Larry Wachowski says.  ``Let's say we work with a big, troubled movie star in the future. There's two of us, one of them. I can say to the Troubled One, `I don't know what's going on here. My brother is crazy. Just do it to make him happy.'''  Brothers will always be brothers, but that doesn't mean they're co-directors forever. David and Jerry Zucker, along with their friend Jim Abrahams, were the creative force behind hits such as ``Airplane'' (1980), ``Ruthless People'' (1986) and ``Naked Gun'' (1988), producing, directing and writing in various combinations and grossing hundreds of millions of dollars.  But last summer, the brothers parted ways _ at least for now. David produced the magical-realist romance ``A Walk in the Clouds'' (1995). Jerry, who had won acclaim for his solo direction of the box-office hit ``Ghost'' (1990), directed and produced the far less successful ``First Knight'' (1995).  ``There are only so many hours in a day and so many years you have to do the stuff you want to do,'' David Zucker says. ``Sometimes you don't want to do what your brother wants to do, so instead of spending two years of your life on a movie, it's best to find your own project.  ``Sometimes it's good to see just your name. And then you can always go back to being one of the brothers.''  The Hudlins have had a similar cordial split.  ``My brother Warrington did not work on `Great White Hype' because he's actually courting other projects he is going to be directing solo. I did get to a point where I said I want to make movies myself,'' Reginald says.  ``We're still looking out for each other's work, but we're concentrating on individual growth for now. That way we can get more projects going in every medium.  ``You need a chance to grow and work on an even bigger canvas,'' he continues. ``We want to try something fresh and new. We didn't want to be doing `House Party 6,' `Garden Party,' `Old Age Home Party' forever.''  For now, the Farrellys have no intention of following suit. After all, it took them a long time to get to where they are now, including 15 separate films that never got made.  ``I was ready to cash it in. My brother told me to give it one more year,'' Bobby says. ``At the time, it was too hard to explain what we were doing for a living. Our parents thought we were bookies.''  After ``Kingpin,'' the duo is developing ``The Three Stooges'' for the big screen. It will be co-directed, of course.  ``I can't imagine doing this any other way than with my brother,'' Joel Coen says. ``We've been doing this for so long. You're a prisoner of your own routine.''  According to Larry Wachowski, there's one extra bonus to being a brother act that solo work could never bring:  ``Your mother is very happy,'' Larry says. ``My mom would wander into the shops at Sundance and people would be talking about the movie. She would say, `My sons did that. Both of them. Together.'''  As for the future, he muses, ``You know, we do have a couple of sisters.  ``Maybe they can get together and make a movie.'' c.1996 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.)

By MICHAEL CASTLEMAN From Sierra magazine c.1995 Michael Castleman (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  Environmentalists are generally the last people to douse themselves with chemicals bearing tongue-twister names. But for summertime outings, there's one chemical even the most toxics-conscious tend to slather.  It's N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide, a chemical better known as ``deet,'' the active ingredient in Cutter's, Deep Woods Off!, Tick Garde and most other commercial insect repellents.  Developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the 1950s, deet is the most effective insect repellent currently available. Some 200 million people apply it worldwide each year, and adverse reactions are rare.  But deet is not hazard-free. The chemical penetrates the skin and enters the bloodstream readily. Since 1961, when the New England Journal of Medicine published the first report of brain damage apparently related to the use of deet, several case studies have suggested that deet should be used cautiously.  After being liberally treated with deet for several weeks, six girls under the age of nine developed toxic encephalopathy and suffered convulsions. One died. Brief deet exposures have also been blamed for seizures in several other children.  In adults, the chemical has been linked to less severe neurological problems, most often irritability, confusion and insomnia.  Concerns about deet have increased since the late 1980s, when worries about ticks spreading Lyme disease spurred the public to apply bug repellents more frequently and liberally.  In recent years, the health departments of New York, New Jersey and Utah, as well as the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have all issued warnings about the possible hazards of overzealous application of deet.  So what's an outdoorsperson to do?  One approach is to wear lightweight, longsleeved shirts and long pants, and spray deet on your clothing instead of on your skin. That way little, if any, deet has a chance to get into your bloodstream.  Another strategy is to select a deet product with a modest concentration of the chemical. While you'll find plenty of potions on the shelves with deet concentrations as high as 95 or 100 percent, several state public-health departments recommend formulations with no more than 30 percent.  The American Academy of Pediatrics goes further, recommending that children use repellents that have 10 percent or less deet, such as Off! Skintastic (7.1 percent), or Skedaddle! (9.5 percent), even though such products are considerably less effective.  Doubts about deet have led to the development of several plant-based insect repellents.  Because plants have neither arms to brush off insects nor legs to flee them, some have evolved aromatic oils to thwart predators: Anise, basil, catnip, eucalyptus, garlic, pennyroyal and tansy have all long been used as insect repellents. (Pennyroyal oil is often the active ingredient in herbal flea collars and similar natural pet-care products.)  Most commercial plant-based insect repellents, however, use the oil of citronella, a lemon-scented Asian grass now cultivated in the tropics worldwide. The main problem experienced with citronella oil is that it evaporates rapidly, allowing the bugs it repels to quickly return.  One company, Biopharm Labs, claims to have solved that problem by using a modified version of the oil in a glycerine-based lotion called Treo. Unlike most natural insect repellents, Treo is registered with the Environmental Protection Agency, meaning that the manufacturer has supplied the government with required safety and efficacy data.  In this case, Biopharm contracted with University of Utah entomologists specializing in ticks and other biting insects to test Treo head-to-head against deet. They found it as effective as Cutter's and Deep Woods Off! in repelling mosquitoes and biting flies, and as effective as Tick Garde in repelling ticks.  It should be noted, however, that Consumer Reports magazine says even the best deet products deter ticks only 75 percent to 87 percent of the time, and the Lyme Disease Foundation cautions not to rely on repellent alone.  The Treo formula is also found in Avon's Skin-So-Soft Moisturizing Suncare Plus, a product developed after the company's Skin-So-Soft bath oil had acquired a largely unwarranted word-of-mouth reputation as an effective non-deet insect repellent.  Whether you rub on a plant-based repellent or just wrap yourself in comfortable clothing, you don't have to choose between deet and an armful of mosquito bites. For people seeking a chemical-free walk in the woods, that idea is a natural.

Quirky, opinionated and funny, Shindler conducts his own taste test of dog biscuits, checks the distribution of animal breeds in a box of animal crackers and provides recipes for a four-course all-popcorn dinner.  He also offers his favorite ``recipes for the totally inept'' (including avocado soup and Greek eggplant dip, both delicious).  A word to the wise: Shindler's West Coast restaurant recommendations are far more trustworthy than his East Coast ones.  Godiva chocolate (http://www.godiva.com/). The most seductive commercial spot on the Web, the Godiva Web Site includes sumptuous photos and recipes for chocolate-hazelnut-mascarpone torte with raspberries, fudge truffle cheesecake and a white chocolate-black pepper mousse napoleon.  There's also chocolate history, chocolate trivia (did you know that chocolate can be lethal to dogs?) and, of course, an order form for Godiva goodies.  Many of the recipes may be too challenging for home cooks, but the site is a big heart-shaped box of fun.  CheeseNet (http://exclamation.com/cheesenet). These people really like cheese.  You can learn how cheese is made, study ``cheese language'' (which rivals wine language in its specificity _ cheese can be ``earthy,'' ``open,'' ``mushroomy'' or ``supple''), find cheese vendors, download recipes, read the famous Monty Python ``Cheese Shop'' sketch and ponder cheese poetry (including an ode to aerosol-canned cheese in perfect 14-line sonnet form).  Epicurious (http://www.epicurious.com/) is the Web's most famous food site, but I have some problems with it. It's the online version of Bon Appetit and Gourmet magazines, so the recipes are mouthwatering and the articles (by such terrific food writers as Joan Nathan and Jeffrey Steingarten) are entertaining. But the site is ungainly.  There's no database for the restaurants mentioned, so you can't conduct a search. And it's really designed for fast modems _  the text-only version provided for 14.4-baud-or-slower modems isn't engaging to look at. BEVERAGES  Over the Coffee (http://www.cappuccino.com/) will fulfill all your caffeine-laden needs.  There's information on different blends and roasts, candid opinions on various espresso machines, a bunch of biscotti recipes (including a nut-free cardamom version) and more.  Virtual Vineyards (http://www.virtualvin.com/) lets you read detailed assessments of various wines, then order them.  The Web Site is run by Peter Granoff, (a.k.a. the Cork Dork), a professional wine buyer, teacher and restaurant consultant. Granoff describes wines elegantly yet unpretentiously, and even though the featured vineyards are advertisers, the site maintains a sense of editorial integrity.  It's fun and useful; the co-owner of Storybook Mountain Vineyards provides an easy, delicious-sounding recipe for zinfandel risotto.  And any site featuring Bonny Doon, a winery whose owner is the quirkiest wine maker in the country, is worth checking out. RECIPES  Amy Gale (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/(T)mjw/recipes/) is a New Zealander who has amassed a huge no-graphics, no-nonsense collection of recipes from net denizens all over the world.  The dishes vary widely in quality _ if you're an experienced cook who can scan a list of ingredients and quickly decide yea or nay, you'll do fine.  Veggies Unite! (http://www.honors.indiana.edu/(T)veggie/recipes.cgi/) is the best-structured recipe site.  This is an easily browsable collection of more than 2,000 vegetarian recipes, listed both alphabetically and by category, along with an interactive weekly menu planner and shopping list.  A lot of the recipes are a bit earthy-crunchy, but others are divine, such as kaoneaw mamong (Thai sweet rice with mangoes) and a bread pudding with whiskey sauce.  This site also loads quickly, even with a slow modem.  The Mole Page (http://www.slip.net/(T)bobnemo/mole.html) is a tribute to the savory Mexican sauce. The site explains where the word ``mole'' comes from: the Aztec word ``molli,'' meaning ``concoction.''  You can browse the small repository (21, at last count) of recipes, including green pumpkin-seed mole with chicken breasts, yellow pork mole with dumplings and mole con dos chiles (mole with two kinds of chiles).  Kosher Express (http://www.marketnet.com/mktnet/kosher/recipes.html) is a wonderful source of kosher recipes, especially for the Jewish holidays.  Among those that I thought to be particularly good were SaraBeth's Cream Cheese Brownies and acorn squash with apple stuffing.  Cookin' on the Net (http://www.cooknet.org/index.html) combines hedonism and philanthropy.  Five heralded American chefs _ from Campanile in Los Angeles, Union Square Cafe in New York, Stars in San Francisco, Rialto in Boston and Charlie Trotter's in Chicago _ have contributed recipes ranging from a goat cheese-and-caramelized-onion tart to salmon paillard with black-bean sauce.  For $12 (payable by check or credit card), you get the recipes as well as a chance to win CDs and cookbooks. The money goes to five nonprofit programs that teach disadvantaged kids about computers and technology. RESTAURANT GUIDES  Digital Restaurant Guide to San Francisco (http://www.sf.net/lantern) is astounding. More than 3,000 restaurants are reviewed, and the listings are savvy and comprehensive, offering hours, prices and ratings for food, atmosphere and service.  You can search the database by neighborhood, ranking or type of cuisine, and there's even a cute map for each restaurant's vicinity.  What's more, there are currently plans to expand to other cities, so stay tuned.  Dining Out on the Web (http://www.ird.net/diningout.html) is a mammoth collection of links to restaurant reviews and listings all over the country. There's also a form for adding your own opinion.  The reviews aren't nearly as trustworthy as the Digital Restaurant Guide's, but they do cover more territory. I especially liked the frozen-custard-flavor forecasts for Milwaukee. JUST FOR FUN  T.W.I.N.K.I.E.S. (Tests With Inorganic Noxious Kakes In Extreme Situations) Project (http://www.rice.edu/(T)gouge/twinkies.html) consists of various science experiments conducted by two Rice University students on the little Hostess sponge logs.  The results, as well as the mock-academic tone, are truly hilarious.  Burrito Page (http://www.infobahn.com/pages/rito.html) enables you to input your favorite burrito ingredients and receive an instant analysis of your character, learn some burrito lore and pick up a few new ingredient ideas.

By MARIANNE JACOBBI c.1996 Family Circle (North American rights only.) (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.) Editor's note: Theresa Frank is not the subject's real name.  Andy Bogenholm, a 20-year-old restaurant manager in Minnesota, and 70-year-old Theresa Frank, a New Jersey resident, don't seem to have much in common. But they share an addiction that experts say is prevalent among both teenagers and senior citizens.  Here's how gambling nearly cost Andy his future and Theresa her life. GETTING HOOKED  To look at Bogenholm today, you'd never guess that 1 1/2 years ago he was serving jail time for credit-card fraud and burglary, crimes he committed to support his habit.  Polite, clean-cut, from a solid family, Andy had never made a bet until the night of March 16, 1993, his 18th birthday, when he went with two buddies to the Mystic Lake Casino, near his home in St. Paul.  Then a high-school senior and star athlete, Bogenholm soon became a regular at the casino's blackjack table. He gambled four or five times a week, sometimes skipping school to do so. He bet his allowance, and when that wasn't enough, he stole from his parents' bank account.  ``I took their ATM card and, over a period of months, withdrew $1,000 in cash,'' he says.  When Steve and Geri Bogenholm found out Andy was stealing from them, they were stunned. They had noticed other dramatic changes, too _ his grades had plummeted, and he'd lost interest in football.  When his parents confronted him, Bogenholm denied he was gambling.  ``I didn't think I had a problem,'' he says. ``I thought I could stop whenever I wanted to.''  As Bogenholm's need for money grew more desperate, he began to steal credit cards and burglarize homes. When Steve and Geri found stolen goods in their attic, they took action.  ``We consulted a counselor,'' Steve says, ``who advised to turn Andy in to the police.''  It was the hardest thing they'd ever had to do, ``But our kid had gone from Mr. Wonderful to Mr. Criminal,'' Steve says. ``We feared it would escalate if we didn't get him help.''  Gambling was just as destructive for Theresa Frank, who lives alone in an apartment near Newark.  Frank had led a busy life raising four children and managing a family-owned business. When her husband became ill 11 years ago, she started casino-hopping.  ``I needed an escape,'' she says,``and that was it.''  Several nights a week Frank drove the two hours to Atlantic City alone and played the night away at the casino slot machines and crap tables.  She worked as a practical nurse, and after her husband died in 1990, she began risking her entire paycheck. She charged the maximum on her credit cards and ``sold the rings off my finger to get money.''  When her property taxes came due, she had to ask one of her sons to bail her out.  By January 1993 Frank had begun to see how sharply her debts were mounting. She saw no way out.  ``I thought of driving into a wall,'' she admits.  These stories are not unique. People staffing the nation's gambling hotlines, as well as teachers and counselors across the country, say that more and more teens and seniors are becoming addicted to betting. MOVING ON TO HIGHER STAKES  ``One million juveniles in this country have serious gambling-related problems,'' estimates Durand Jacobs, clinical professor of psychiatry at Loma Linda University Medical School in California and a leading authority on teen gambling.  He says that more than half of teenagers have wagered in the past year, and 4 percent to 6 percent fit the profile of a pathological gambler _ three times the rate for adults.  Experts attribute the alarming rise in teen betting to the ever-increasing availability of legalized gaming. Today's teenagers, like no generation before, have grown up in a culture that promotes such activities. Thirty-seven states sponsor lotteries, 21 have casino or riverboat gambling and every state except Utah and Hawaii offers some form of wagering _ from bingo to offtrack betting.  In 1993 Americans spent $394 billion on legalized gambling, according to International Gaming &AMP; Wagering Business magazine.  Henry Lesieur, editor of the Journal of Gambling Studies and a professor of criminal justice at Illinois State University, points out that New Jersey, which legalized casino gaming in 1978, has more problems with teenage bettors than Oklahoma, where few opportunities are available.  ``The more access teens have to gambling, the more they will do,'' Lesieur says.  Why do teenagers gamble?  ``They do it for the sense of excitement,'' Jacobs says, ``and also in response to peer pressure. Gambling makes them appear older, `with it,' cool.''  Studies also show the highest risk among teens whose parents are problem gamblers or have drug or alcohol dependencies. (Bogenholm's father Steve is a recovering alcoholic who hasn't had a drink in 11 years.)  Teachers, hotline counselors and researchers point to these disturbing trends among adolescents:  _ Teens are gambling at a younger age. The majority of these youngsters start betting before age 15.  _ Lottery playing is widespread among teens. Although 18 is the legal age in most states, researchers have found that this is not well policed. Kids as young as 14 routinely buy tickets.  ``Young people are introduced to gambling via the lottery,'' says Howard Shaffer, associate director of the Division on Addictions at Harvard Medical School and author of a groundbreaking 1994 study on teens and the lottery.  ``It's promoted and state condoned; it's a sanctioned part of American society.''  _ Casino gaming is changing the way teens gamble. Although legally you're supposed to be ``of age,'' millions of teens play every year, using false ID's.  ``Casino gambling is attractive to teens,'' Lesieur says. ``The lights, the sounds, the fact that it's forbidden fruit.''  A survey of an Atlantic City high school found that 64 percent of students had gambled at the casinos.  _ Up to 13 percent of teens who gamble have stolen to pay their debts, according to Jacobs's research. This shows that gambling is leading many kids into crime. GAMBLING IN THE GOLDEN YEARS  Though no national study has yet been done on gambling among the elderly, hotline counselors report that it's on the rise. In Florida, New Jersey, Connecticut and Texas, four states that keep track of the older citizens who call gambling hotlines, this trend has been confirmed.  Pat Fowler, executive director of the Florida Council on Compulsive Gambling and a leading authority on gambling among the elderly, says she gets more than 100 calls for help a month from seniors who have lost their life savings _ money they need for food, rent and medications.  ``It used to be that gambling declined with age,'' she says, ``but now more seniors are doing it. They're bored, time on their hands and money in their pockets.''  The gaming industry also works hard to attract them. ``Casinos run specials _ free bus trips, low-cost buffets and money for the slot machines _ often at the first of the month when seniors get their pension checks,'' Fowler says.  From the busloads pulling up to the casinos, it seems that seniors are falling for these enticements. Some older people bet for the same reasons teens do: the excitement and being among their peers. Others do it as an escape from loneliness and depression.  Unfortunately for the elderly, they're more vulnerable than younger gamblers for these reasons:  _ They come to it late in life. Not having gambled before, they're unaware of the potential dangers.  _ They're unable to recoup. If they do lose their savings, they don't get a second chance.  _ They often get hooked on the fast-paced, quickly addicting video gambling games. Experts call these the ``crack cocaine'' of gambling. BREAKING THE ADDICTION  As many as 12 million Americans are problem or compulsive gamblers, according to the National Council on Problem Gambling, Inc.  ``Compulsive gambling is an illness. Despite the negative consequences, compulsive gamblers are unable to stop on their own,'' says Jean Falzon, executive director of that organization.  They need counseling and ongoing support, as Andy Bogenholm got after his release from jail. Now he's helping others by going to schools to talk to students about the risks of gambling and his own experience with it.  When Theresa Frank began contemplating suicide, she called Gamblers Anonymous (GA); she has attended weekly meetings ever since. Except for one brief relapse, she has not set foot in a casino. -0- SIDEBAR: WHERE TO GET HELP  Problem gamblers send out signals. They neglect their responsibilities, friendships and home life; go to extremes to get money and often deny that they have a problem.  If you're worried that a child or parent may be hooked, call the National Council on Problem Gambling, Inc.'s toll-free number: (800) 522-4700 (Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. through 5 p.m. Eastern Standard Time).

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Michael Keaton in a scene from ``Multiplicity.'' By JEANNE WOLF (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Michael Keaton can identify with the guy he plays in ``Multiplicity'' _ a hard-driving construction-company boss who's struggling to find enough time to be a husband and father as well as get ahead in his career.  Keaton's character, Doug Kinney, thinks he's solved the problem when he agrees to let a world-renowned geneticist clone him so there will be enough Dougs to handle all the demands he faces.  But Keaton insists he wouldn't go that far in real life _ even if it seems tempting.  ``I would never want to be cloned,'' he says, ``but I do wish there was more than one of me.''  Keaton struggles to combine Hollywood stardom with his role as a devoted single father _ and part-time baseball coach _ to his teen-age son, Sean.  ``I can't seem to keep up with everything,'' he admits with a shake of his head. ``I'm not a good manager of my time. I find myself saying, `Alright, this is too much, I'm cutting back!' And I don't mean just in my personal life. I'm also talking about my career, where there are a lot of decisions to be made.''  In 1994, one of those decisions grabbed headlines as Keaton walked away from a reported $30 million-plus salary to continue in the title role in ``Batman Forever'' (1995). Keaton then signed on for the latest Farrelly Brothers gross-out comedy, ``Kingpin,'' and then once again changed his mind, giving up another fat paycheck.  ``I'm not necessarily motivated by money,'' he says with a shrug. ``Which is not to say I don't like making it. I'm not one of those people who whines, `I'm an artist, money isn't important.'  ``Actually, I get a bigger kick out of making money in investments and stuff that I do on my own instead of the salary I collect for a movie. Anyway, I knew the next `Batman' would be a money machine _ but after I read the script I didn't think it offered me a chance to reach a new potential. It didn't interest me and I have no regrets about not doing it.''  What did grab Keaton's attention was ``Multiplicity,'' which offered the daunting challenge of playing four different roles _ Doug Kinney and the three clones who become a part of his life.  ``From the moment I agreed to do it until we wrapped the film,'' Keaton says, ``I kept asking, `Why am I putting myself through this?' I was having fun but it was overwhelming.''  The problem was that the four characters are identical only in appearance. ``Doug 2'' is a sexy macho man, ``Doug 3'' a sensitive, gentle homebody and ``Doug 4'' an out-of-control fool who provides slapstick comedy relief.  ``I know you want to know which one is most like me,'' Keaton says. ``I guess the real Doug is closest. But I think I have some of 3, the gentle guy, in me and, I hate to say it, but also No. 4, who provides most of the physical comedy.  ``It was much more difficult to play these four roles than totally different characters,'' Keaton says. ``I was portraying subtle differences in each of the clones because they all came from Doug. Each new version of Doug, except maybe 4 _ the bad copy who was over the top _ had to be something like him.''  To pull it off, Keaton faced a daily struggle to differentiate the clones, as he changed in and out of various wardrobes and personas.  ``I might do Doug 4, and then I'd be in a scene as Doug 2,''' he says. ``It was all shot out of sequence and I was constantly trying to figure out where to look, since the other characters in the scene would be added later with computerized effects.''  But of course this sort of challenge is exactly why he accepted the role, Keaton admits.  ``I guess I have a low boredom factor,'' he says. ``I've been in movies where I say to myself, `This is so boring I can't believe I'm doing this scene.' Then the challenge is to psyche myself up to get through it.  ``I know there are a lot of actors who've built their careers on doing the same thing _ playing a version of themselves in every movie. That doesn't mean they're not good actors. I just haven't been able to learn to settle for that.''  Keaton compares the rush of nailing a scene to an athlete's exhilaration.  ``You get in the zone,'' he says. ``It's about as good as anything in the world. I'm sure that's what Michael Jordan is experiencing when he's ripping up the court.  ``Sometimes I get self-conscious before a scene, and I'd like to be more like Michael _ just projecting that sense that `I can do it and I'm going to do it and it's going to be unbelievable.'  ``But I admit I still get nervous,'' he adds. ``I'm saying to myself, `God, I hope they like it.' But hopefully I don't get obnoxiously neurotic about it.''  The only other thing in life which gives him a similar charge is riding, he says. He is devoted to rodeo cutting-horse competitions:  ``You ride for 2 1/2 minutes, and if for 30 seconds of that time you've got the horse down and doing it, it's the best.  ``I haven't had time to ride lately,'' he continues. ``Recently, I went out twice and I realized how much I'd missed it. I felt like a reformed heroin addict who suddenly gets a fix. I thought, `Well, if I had a clone then I'd have more time to be up on a horse.'''  Keaton always makes time for his 13-year-old son Sean, from his marriage to actress Catherine McWilliams. Sean lives with him at his home near the beach in Los Angeles, and Keaton often sounds like a real-life Mr. Mom as he details running errands, driving his son to and from school and baseball practice.  But Keaton doesn't think his kid has paid a big price to have a movie star for a dad.  ``It's been totally cool,'' he says. ``When I did the first `Batman' he came over and sat in the Batmobile. He loves those classic heroes and it was a big thrill.  ``But I don't want him to become an asterisk,'' he adds. ``You know, `Sean, that movie star's kid.'  ``He's going to camp this summer. He's going far away for the first time and it's a big deal. I decided not to take him. There will be kids from all over the country and I just didn't want anyone saying, `Hey, I didn't know your dad was Michael Keaton.'  ``He's just who he is. And he's totally, totally cool about it. He digs it, loves what I do and loves his own life.''  Next up for Keaton is a searing drama, ``Desperate Measures,'' in which he plays a convict serving a life term who becomes an organ donor to the son of a detective.  ``I'm looking forward to it,'' he says. ``I think I'll be happy doing it, just like making `Multiplicity' made me happy. If I'd done `Batman' I wouldn't have been happy. I don't want to give up several months of my life to something I don't care about. I'm 43 and I feel the clock ticking. I feel that clock of life.  ``I hate to bring up Michael Jordan again,'' he says, smiling, ``but I admire his style. He plays every game like he's trying to make the team. He gives it everything.  ``I want to keep some of that in my own life. I'm not going to hold back anymore. I'm just going to turn it up!'' c.1996 Pentacom Productions  (Jeanne Wolf, who is based in Hollywood, reports on the entertainment industry for television, radio and print outlets.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Joel and Ethan Coen on the set of ``Fargo.'' By CINDY PEARLMAN World rights except Chicago (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  The next time an exasperated director yells, ``Oh, brother!'' he may mean it literally.  Lately the director's chair is a family affair. On July 27, brothers Peter and Bobby Farrelly (directors of 1994's ``Dumb and Dumber'') will release their co-directed bowling comedy ``Kingpin.''  Larry and Andy Wachowski directed the mob thriller ``Bound,'' which was the toast of the recent Sundance Film Festival and will be released in October.  Joel and Ethan Coen's recent ``Fargo'' is still playing in major cities.  Allen and Albert Hughes are mulling over their next project, following the successful ``Menace II Society'' (1993) and ``Dead Presidents'' (1995).  The various Wayans brothers are always busy with projects such as the recent ``Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Juice in the Hood,'' co-written and starring Marlon and Shawn, produced by Keenen Ivory.  Meanwhile, some established brother teams are taking a break. David Zucker is going solo to produce this fall's ``High School High,'' a parody of secondary education starring Jon Lovitz.  The Hudlin brothers (of 1990's ``House Party'') are also looking into branching out on their own. Reginald directed this spring's ``Great White Hype,'' and his brother Warrington is looking to produce and write his own films.  Imagine two Spielbergs. Two Hitchcocks. Two Scorseses. It's hard to picture, but no harder than imagining one Coen without his sibling.  ``The No. 1 question I get is `Why work with your brother?''' Keenen Ivory Wayans says. ``Some people can't stand being in the room with their brother for more than 10 minutes, so I can understand why people think it's strange.''  But for these directing brothers, it seems that brotherhood outweighs sibling rivalry.  ``It's a funny thing,'' says Bobby Farrelly. ``We worked together 10 years ago on a paper route. Alone, when we had separate routes, we were terrible. We couldn't get up on time. Together we were better.  ``When you're directing there are so many decisions to make,'' he continues. ``You have to decide everything from the color of the drapes to what to do with actors who are not coming out of their trailers. If you halve the number of decisions, it saves brain power.''  ``You get to the point where you've made so many decisions that you actually become indecisive,'' Peter agrees. ``I'll look at my brother and he'll nod. Then I'm just so much more sure. It's like being a single parent _ that's fine, but it's easier with two.''  In theory, Joel Coen directs and Ethan Coen produces. In reality, they share most of the work, especially the screenwriting.  ``We just let Joel have the title of director because he's older,'' Ethan quips.  ``There seems to be a confusion that you have to be similar to each other to direct together,'' Joel says. ``We're not similar. Because we make movies together doesn't mean we're identical or our point of views are identical or our taste is the same. All it means is the movies we end up making are a reflection of the points in which our tastes and ideas coincide.''  And when they don't agree?  ``The movies we disagree on don't get made,'' Ethan says.  A movie set is a complex mechanism, with tens of millions of dollars riding on the director's decisions. Obviously, whenever and wherever co-directors disagree, it can't be on the set.  But all the brother acts report that the actual directing goes very smoothly.  ``We work side by side,'' Peter Farrelly says. ``Bobby's at the monitor. I watch the actors up close. After a shot, we confer. I speak to the actors. We feel we should speak in one voice.''  Though having two directors might seem an actor's worst nightmare, the celebrated Paul Newman was eager to work with the Coens, though ``The Hudsucker Proxy'' (1994) didn't succeed at the box office.  ``I was looking to work with one young director and I got two. It was a bargain deal,'' Newman says. ``At first, I thought they would never agree and it would be a mess. I was shocked at how it worked like a machine. The brothers were one voice in two people.''  But no two people can agree all the time, which can pose problems on a movie set, where the director is traditionally the final authority.  ``We have to fight it out even if it gets bloody,'' Reginald Hudlin says. ``And believe me, we don't always agree. Yet there are times to stir it up. There are times to go for it. It's better for the creative process.''  ``We also collaborate with other people, and nobody asks us if we have fights with our director of photography,'' Joel Coen says grumpily, ``and we've worked with him on three movies. All anyone asks us about is if we fight.''  All right, do the Coen brothers ever fight with their director of photography?  In unison they announce, ``We hate him!''  The Coens can joke about it, but being a team can help in dealing with outsiders, Larry Wachowski says.  ``Let's say we work with a big, troubled movie star in the future. There's two of us, one of them. I can say to the Troubled One, `I don't know what's going on here. My brother is crazy. Just do it to make him happy.'''  Brothers will always be brothers, but that doesn't mean they're co-directors forever. David and Jerry Zucker, along with their friend Jim Abrahams, were the creative force behind hits such as ``Airplane'' (1980), ``Ruthless People'' (1986) and ``Naked Gun'' (1988), producing, directing and writing in various combinations and grossing hundreds of millions of dollars.  But last summer, the brothers parted ways _ at least for now. David produced the magical-realist romance ``A Walk in the Clouds'' (1995). Jerry, who had won acclaim for his solo direction of the box-office hit ``Ghost'' (1990), directed and produced the far less successful ``First Knight'' (1995).  ``There are only so many hours in a day and so many years you have to do the stuff you want to do,'' David Zucker says. ``Sometimes you don't want to do what your brother wants to do, so instead of spending two years of your life on a movie, it's best to find your own project.  ``Sometimes it's good to see just your name. And then you can always go back to being one of the brothers.''  The Hudlins have had a similar cordial split.  ``My brother Warrington did not work on `Great White Hype' because he's actually courting other projects he is going to be directing solo. I did get to a point where I said I want to make movies myself,'' Reginald says.  ``We're still looking out for each other's work, but we're concentrating on individual growth for now. That way we can get more projects going in every medium.  ``You need a chance to grow and work on an even bigger canvas,'' he continues. ``We want to try something fresh and new. We didn't want to be doing `House Party 6,' `Garden Party,' `Old Age Home Party' forever.''  For now, the Farrellys have no intention of following suit. After all, it took them a long time to get to where they are now, including 15 separate films that never got made.  ``I was ready to cash it in. My brother told me to give it one more year,'' Bobby says. ``At the time, it was too hard to explain what we were doing for a living. Our parents thought we were bookies.''  After ``Kingpin,'' the duo is developing ``The Three Stooges'' for the big screen. It will be co-directed, of course.  ``I can't imagine doing this any other way than with my brother,'' Joel Coen says. ``We've been doing this for so long. You're a prisoner of your own routine.''  According to Larry Wachowski, there's one extra bonus to being a brother act that solo work could never bring:  ``Your mother is very happy,'' Larry says. ``My mom would wander into the shops at Sundance and people would be talking about the movie. She would say, `My sons did that. Both of them. Together.'''  As for the future, he muses, ``You know, we do have a couple of sisters.  ``Maybe they can get together and make a movie.'' c.1996 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.)

By MICHAEL CASTLEMAN From Sierra magazine c.1995 Michael Castleman (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  Environmentalists are generally the last people to douse themselves with chemicals bearing tongue-twister names. But for summertime outings, there's one chemical even the most toxics-conscious tend to slather.  It's N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide, a chemical better known as ``deet,'' the active ingredient in Cutter's, Deep Woods Off!, Tick Garde and most other commercial insect repellents.  Developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the 1950s, deet is the most effective insect repellent currently available. Some 200 million people apply it worldwide each year, and adverse reactions are rare.  But deet is not hazard-free. The chemical penetrates the skin and enters the bloodstream readily. Since 1961, when the New England Journal of Medicine published the first report of brain damage apparently related to the use of deet, several case studies have suggested that deet should be used cautiously.  After being liberally treated with deet for several weeks, six girls under the age of nine developed toxic encephalopathy and suffered convulsions. One died. Brief deet exposures have also been blamed for seizures in several other children.  In adults, the chemical has been linked to less severe neurological problems, most often irritability, confusion and insomnia.  Concerns about deet have increased since the late 1980s, when worries about ticks spreading Lyme disease spurred the public to apply bug repellents more frequently and liberally.  In recent years, the health departments of New York, New Jersey and Utah, as well as the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have all issued warnings about the possible hazards of overzealous application of deet.  So what's an outdoorsperson to do?  One approach is to wear lightweight, longsleeved shirts and long pants, and spray deet on your clothing instead of on your skin. That way little, if any, deet has a chance to get into your bloodstream.  Another strategy is to select a deet product with a modest concentration of the chemical. While you'll find plenty of potions on the shelves with deet concentrations as high as 95 or 100 percent, several state public-health departments recommend formulations with no more than 30 percent.  The American Academy of Pediatrics goes further, recommending that children use repellents that have 10 percent or less deet, such as Off! Skintastic (7.1 percent), or Skedaddle! (9.5 percent), even though such products are considerably less effective.  Doubts about deet have led to the development of several plant-based insect repellents.  Because plants have neither arms to brush off insects nor legs to flee them, some have evolved aromatic oils to thwart predators: Anise, basil, catnip, eucalyptus, garlic, pennyroyal and tansy have all long been used as insect repellents. (Pennyroyal oil is often the active ingredient in herbal flea collars and similar natural pet-care products.)  Most commercial plant-based insect repellents, however, use the oil of citronella, a lemon-scented Asian grass now cultivated in the tropics worldwide. The main problem experienced with citronella oil is that it evaporates rapidly, allowing the bugs it repels to quickly return.  One company, Biopharm Labs, claims to have solved that problem by using a modified version of the oil in a glycerine-based lotion called Treo. Unlike most natural insect repellents, Treo is registered with the Environmental Protection Agency, meaning that the manufacturer has supplied the government with required safety and efficacy data.  In this case, Biopharm contracted with University of Utah entomologists specializing in ticks and other biting insects to test Treo head-to-head against deet. They found it as effective as Cutter's and Deep Woods Off! in repelling mosquitoes and biting flies, and as effective as Tick Garde in repelling ticks.  It should be noted, however, that Consumer Reports magazine says even the best deet products deter ticks only 75 percent to 87 percent of the time, and the Lyme Disease Foundation cautions not to rely on repellent alone.  The Treo formula is also found in Avon's Skin-So-Soft Moisturizing Suncare Plus, a product developed after the company's Skin-So-Soft bath oil had acquired a largely unwarranted word-of-mouth reputation as an effective non-deet insect repellent.  Whether you rub on a plant-based repellent or just wrap yourself in comfortable clothing, you don't have to choose between deet and an armful of mosquito bites. For people seeking a chemical-free walk in the woods, that idea is a natural.

"94868"	"he"	"muses"	" Juicy interview: Reading Pat Jordan's interview with O.J. Simpson in The New Yorker ($3.50) is as fascinating _ and horrifying _ as watching a train wreck. Jordan spent 15 hours with Simpson on and off the golf course in Pinecrest, Fla. Riding around in a Lincoln Navigator SUV, Simpson bemoaned his lack of money and his unfair treatment by the media. ``O.J. is the most misunderstood person on the planet,'' says his lawyer, Yale Galanter. Simpson tells Jordan that ex-wife Nicole ``wanted to come back to me after the divorce. She stalked me!'' At another point in the interview, he muses, ``I wonder if I've run into this person who killed Nicole.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"

"109427"	"she"	"muses"	" Indeed, Meier says project-learning is all but eliminated in her school.

A good project might be just the thing.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"139115"	"she"	"muses"	" ``Five Mown appendix with a bottle of Jack and a dull spoon.'' That's what one of the five old boyfriends of the title wrote to Shapiro when she asked to see him again. The other four were not so wise. Between the ages of 13 and 35, Shapiro tells us, ``I'd plunged, heart-first, five times. . . . I was a serial monogamist love junkie, a romantic extremist with no sense of irony.'' Now, facing her 40th birthday, her fifth wedding anniversary and infertility, she decides to look up those men and rehash each relationship and its demise. The result is this ``memoir,'' which exposes the details of her sexual past as well as her current dissatisfaction with her husband's low sperm count (maybe, she muses, her plot to see her previous loves is a way of ``revisiting the potent sperm that got away''). Some readers will think her book is a funny, candid look at modern romance. Others will think Shapiro just likes to talk about herself, and doesn't deserve the tolerant man who married her.
