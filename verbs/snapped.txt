Believing that deterrence is the best weapon a%ainst the United States, North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, is believed to be in a sprint for a nuclear arsenal.  But North Korea's talk m#y prove scarier than its technology. In the last two weeks, North Korea tested land-to-sea missiles that failed to hit their targets. Now, U.S. intelligence analysts believe that North Korea is having trouble kick-starting a nuclear-reprocessing installation that was closed under international controls for almost a decade. One American nuclear expert said that the North Koreans are working with 1950s technology, vacuum tubes and all.  Then, when four MiG jet fighters intercepted a U.S. reconnaissance plane, the American pilot ignored their signals to land in North Korea and flew home.  The mercurial Kim apparently wants to use Washington's preoccupation with Iraq to make a power play that would force the United States into talks, or that would force the world to recognize North Korea as a nuclear power.  He knows he is working against a deadline. Last month, with the invasion of Iraq still a question mark, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain came under hostile questioning in Parliament. Asked what country would be next for regime change after Iraq, he snapped, ``North Korea.''  _ By JAMES BROOKE  LEARNING THE ECONOMICS OF THIS WAR )$  War is not always good for the economy, but it seemed that way last week.  As U.S. and British troops swept into Ir#q, oil prices plunged and stocks soared. The Dow Jones industrial average gained more than 660 points, or 8.4 percent _ its best week in 20 years.  The rally proves a favorite Wall Street maxim: The market hates uncertainty. For months, investors worried about what might happen after war began. Would protests shake Arab and Muslim countries friendly to the United States? Would al-Qaida attack American soil? Would Iraq destroy its oil wells?  ``There was a lot of uncertainty up to this week _ concerns about the war, worst-case-scenario situations,'' said Gary Thayer, the chief economist at A.G. Edwards, a brokerage firm, on Friday.  In fact, in Wall Street's judgment through Friday, the war was going well, with few Iraqi oil wells destroyed. As a result, the price of a barrel of oil fell 24 percent for the week, closing at $26.91, down $8.47, the biggest weekly drop since the first Gulf War.  Lower oil prices will free cash for consumers to spend and businesses to invest, Thayer said.  Richard J. DeKaser, chief economist at the National City Bank in Cleveland, said the U.S. economy began to sputter in August, when the White House first signaled it0rlanned to confront Iraq. Businesses cut back on capital investment and laid off workers. Now, he said, they will probably start hiring.  But Jeffrey E. Garten, dean of the Yale School of Managemeot, wqrned tlqt At the same time, Garten argued, a successful war might worsen the deficit by increasing the odds that Congress will pass President Bush's $726 billion plan to cut taxes. On Friday, the House passed a budget plan with the cut, while the Senate rejected efforts to shrink it to $350 billion.  Garten said that the tax cuts might be approved before the White House has outlined how much it plans to spend on the war and rebuilding Iraq. ``There are too many uncertaiNtius ahead, and tOomany risks on the downside,'' he said, ``to be even the slightest bit complacent.''  _ By ALEX BERENSON  CREATOR OF `SHOCK AND AWE'  The Pentagon's ``shock and awe'' strategy of quickly overwhelming Iraq was the inspiration of a military analyst guided by the 2,500-year-old writings of Sun Tzu, the Chinese strategist; Pizarro's defeat of the Incas in the 16th century; the German blitzkrieg of World War II; and the atomic bombing of Japan.  In 1996, Harlan K. Ullman, a former Navy commander, helped write ``Shock and Awe: Achieving Rapid Dominance'' for the National Defense University. He argued that precise, overwhelming attacks would destroy an adversary's will, prompt quick capitulation and reduce casualties.  Concerned that the U.S. military relied too much on ``the slow destruction of enemy forces,'' he argued instead: ``We want them to quit, not to fight, so that you have this simultaneous effect _ rather like the nuclear weapons at Hiroshima _ not taking days or weeks but minutes.''  FIGHTING BEGINS  This was the war that started early. After President Bush on Monday gave Saddam Hussein 48 hours to get out of Iraq, Washington and its allies thought they knew what would happen: Saddam would refuse, and by Friday night, ``shock and awe'' would begin. But Wednesday, hours before the deadline, the CIA informed Bush it had intelligence about where the Iraqi leadership would be meeting. Bush ordered a jump-the-gun bombing raid, and the house was destroyed.  But Saddam soon showed up on television. By Thursday, the ground war began, and on Friday Saddam's palaces were incinerated, live on television. But Bush warned the country that despite the quick progress, this could be a hard, costly slog.  NEW SERBIAN LEADER  Zoran Zivkovic, an ally of the assassinated Serbian leader Zoran Djindjic, took over as prime minister, while the police questioned more than 1,000 suspects from the Belgrade underworld about the murder.  FREED IN EGYPT  Saad Eddin Ibrahim, a prominent sociologist convicted of harming Egypt's image with his research on vote fraud and human rights, was cleared of all charges by the country's highest court. International rights groups hailed the ruling as a sign that Egypt's civilian judiciary can resist political pressure.  VIRUS TRACKED  The World Health Organization said it was closing in on a previously unknown virus, called SARS for severe acute respiratory syndrome, and was developing a test to detect infections in humans.  KIDNAPPERS CHARGED  Salt Lake City prosecutors charged the two drifters found with Elizabeth Smart with six felony counts each of burglary, kidnapping and sexual assault. The county district attorney described the pair, David B. Mitchell, 49, and his wife, Wanda E. Barzee, 57, as ``predatory sex offenders'' who had raped Elizabeth at least once during her nine-month captivity.  UNTRAMMELED NATURE  For more than 20 years, Alaska has pressed Washington to allow oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and this year the Bush administration thought it had the votes to push the measure through Congress. But in the Senate, eight Republicans jound James C. Kopp, an anti-abortion extremist who in 1998 shot an obstetrician who performed abortions, guilty of second-degree murder. Kopp killed Dr. Barnett A. Slepian with a single bullet from an assault rifle. After a worldwide manhunt that lasted nearly three years, Kopp was arrested in France and extradited to the United States.  GRAY WOLF RETURNS  Once nearly extinct, gray wolves have recovered enough to be taken off the endangered species list, the U.S. Fish and WildlideService declared. That means wildlife officials _ and in some cases the public _ can kill the predators if they threaten livestock and pets. While ranchers applauded the action, conservationists complained that it came too soon, beforebthe gray wolf was restored to more areas where it once thrived. The action applies everywhere but the Southwest. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20030322.0023 type=story > <HEADLINE> WEATHER </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 03-22-03 13:27:00EST (BC-WEATHER-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200303.gz"
