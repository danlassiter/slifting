"131243"	"it"	"screams"	" --True, only the first two years of the four-year deal are committed to TPC Boston, ``but I don't think that's a reflection of the course or the market,'' said PGA Tour player Olin Browne. Instead, Browne and others see it as the Tour maintaining flexibility. Said one source close to the TPC Boston project: ``It's good business sense. They just want to see how well it works, how well it's received.'' But golf officials know that the US Senior Open at Salem CC in Peabody in 2001 sold out quickly and that corporate support for the 1999 Ryder Cup at The Country Club was unprecedented, so continuing the tournament at TPC Boston beyond 2004 is a real possibility. The PGA Tour, as majority owner of the course, plays there rent-free, thus saving hundreds of thousands of dollars. That means more money for all parties, including the Tiger Woods Foundation, and ``money doesn't talk, it screams,'' said the source. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
