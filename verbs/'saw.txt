"33216"	"we"	"'saw"	" Our take: We came, we 'Saw, we reported it, we try to exit gracefully. You know, for 14 years of his streak, Cal Ripken had to see the rear end of the Orioles pitcher for half a game. It's part of the game. But when it comes to radio, we can't deal with this any more. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"47434"	"he"	"'saw"	" 1. Lee Hamilton, XTRA afternoons: He came, he 'Saw, he crashed and burned. Hamilton (or whatever name he's using this week) continues on the road toward Slanderville, taking himself much too seriously for his own good. Heavy into S&AMP;M (smoke and mirrors), Hamilton's medicine show so lacks in credibility that even in this format it's easily exposed. Last year: 1 (bottom five). </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"
