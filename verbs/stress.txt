"40093"	"they"	"stress"	" Deficit hawks like Lawrence Kotlikoff of Boston University are not impressed. The bottom line, they stress, is not the trend in the savings rate, but whether savings are adequate to keep the economy growing fast enough to pay for the retirement of the baby boomers. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"

"41849"	"we"	"stress"	" Interpreting s1452(b) as fully in sync with s1447(d) on the nonreviewability of remand orders, we stress, secures the uniform treatment of all remands, regardless of the party initiating the removal or the court from which the case is removed. Cf. Pacor, Inc. v. Higgins, 743 F. 2d 984, 991-992 (CA3 1984) (refusing to apply s1447(d) in bankruptcy cases because, i.a., removals under ss1441-1447 may be initiated only by defendants and are from state courts only, while s1452 authorizes removals by ``a party'' and applies to cases originally filed in federal as well as state tribunals). A restrictive definition of what is ``equitable'' could invite wasteful controversy over the reviewability of bankruptcy case remand orders that are not reached by s1447 and rest on grounds a common-law pleader might type ``legal.'' It would show little respect for the legislature were courts to suppose that the lawmakers meant to enact an irrational scheme. Cf. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Harris Trust and Sav. Bank, 510 U. S. , (1993) (slip op., at 7) (Court's examination of statutory language is ``guided not by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look(s) to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy.'') (internal quotations omitted) (quoting Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 51 (1987)); Deal v. United States, 508 U. S. , (1993) (slip op., at 3) (It is a ``fundamental principle of statutory construction (and, indeed, of language itself) that the meaning of a word cannot be determined in isolation, but must be drawn from the context in which it is used.''). </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
"45661"	"we"	"stress"	" As in Coit and Wolens, we find no secure signal here that Congress intended to assign to the Federal Reserve Board responsibility for the adjudication of private claims. The EFA Act's civil liability section, 12 U. S. C. s4010, does not explicitly confer adjudicatory authority on the Board, nor ``set forth the relevant procedures'' for resolution of private disputes. See Coit, 489 U. S., at 574. (footnote 3) Section 4010, we stress, contrasts conspicuously with statutes in which Congress has given the Board adjudicatory authority. See, e.g., Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, 12 U. S. C. s1843(c)(8) (authorizing Board to determine whether bank holding company may acquire shares in nonbanking entity); s1848 (providing for judicial review of such determinations); cf. Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U. S. C. s18 (specifying detailed procedures governing adjudication of private disputes by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission). </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"

"78695"	"I"	"stress"	" Working with Randy Kornfield's screenplay, Brian Levant directs this material with an amusing sense of hyperbole. The humor, I stress, is simple and big. Much of it is bounced off the increasingly lowering depths to which nice-guy Howard descends to score one of these toys. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"
"132372"	"I"	"stress"	" ``My administration is protecting our farmers, helping them become more efficient and ensuring that they have equal conditions _ and, I stress, equal conditions _ as those of our major competitors,'' Fox said at a ceremony announcing the program, which must be approved by Mexico's Congress. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
