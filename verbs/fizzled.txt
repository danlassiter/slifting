"151340"	"they"	"fizzled"	" Hundreds of opposition supporters marched in Harare, the capital, to protest what they called the fraudulent victory of President Robert G. Mugabe's party in Thursday's parliamentary elections. There were conflicting reports over whether the police broke up the protest or whether the marchers fled before they could be arrested. It was the largest of a handful of sporadic protests since Mugabe's party swept the elections. A spokesmen for the opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, said he had ruled out a court challenge, which in the past have proven fruitless. The question of whether to call for national demonstrations is a difficult one for the opposition. The last time Tsvangirai called for major protests, in 2002, they fizzled, and he was charged with treason. This time, Mugabe has promised to crush any demonstrations, and it is not clear that Zimbabweans, who depend on the government for food, would risk their stipends. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
