ITEM: RESTAURANT NAMED FOR A SOCIETY COLUMNIST BEFORE FIRES, `ALFIE' CHASED FINANCIER (ll) By  c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  Rarely do print journalists see their names emblazoned on anything but a newspaper, a magazine, perhaps a book.  Winsor Brown French II, a bon vivant and society columnist in Cleveland from 1931 to 1968, mostly for The Cleveland Press, would no doubt be pleased to see where his name is imprinted: on a restaurant.  Winsor's, the restaurant named for French, who died in 1982, is in the new $27.6 million Wyndham Cleveland Play House Square Hotel on Euclid Avenue, which opened Saturday with considerable fanfare.  ``He was one of the bright young things of Cleveland in the 1930s and 1940s, part of the cafe society people,'' Fayette Hickox, a nephew of French's, said the other day. ``His column was mostly about himself and his friends.''  No run-of-the-mill friends, though, they included, Hickox said, Noel Coward, Cole Porter, Marlene Dietrich, Gertrude Lawrence, Randolph Churchill, Clark Gable, W. Somerset Maugham and Tallulah Bankhead.  Clearly French, who traveled to his newspaper office in a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce, cast his social net further afield than Cleveland.  ``He spent a lot of time in London, Paris and Venice, so his byline was as likely to come from Paris as from Cleveland,'' Hickox said. ``After World War II, he told his editor he was going to do updates on life in Europe, but that rather than write about the Marshall Plan and people living on rations, he would report on what Noel Coward said last night at dinner.''  c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  NEW YORK _ The city's fire commissioner, Howard Safir, has more in common with his boss, Mayor RudolphGiuliani, than just politics.  Like the mayor, he has a rich past trying to bust criminals, but he told The New Yorker that one prey he never caught was the elusive financier Robert Vesco.  Safir was chief of operations for the U.S. Marshal's Service during the 1980s, when Vesco was believed to be hiding out in Cuba. An informer came to Safir with a deal: he could lead them to Vesco in return for a break on a drug charge against him.  Safir played along, agreeing to pose as Alfie, a criminal who wanted to use Vesco's talents. Twice the fugitive financier agreed to meet with ``Alfie'' outside Cuba, but both times the meeting failed to occur, as Vesco's Cuban handler had cold feet, Safir said.  In May, Vesco was arrested by Cuban authorities, who have so far not complied with requests by the United States that he be returned to this country to face drug charges. Safir says that's just as well, as a Cuban jail is probably harsher than anything Vesco would face in the United States. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950709.0133 type=story > <HEADLINE> HDTV _ THE HIGH-TECH WONDER THAT MAY NEVER BE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WASHINGTON (BC-DIGITAL-TV-875-(2TAKES)-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"

ASYLUM-APPEAL (San Francisco) _ How reasonable are Alla Pitcherskaia's fears of persecution in her native Russia, where she was arrested a dozen times and forced into psychiatric treatment because she is a lesbian?

WELFARE-WORK (San Francisco) _ Ex-welfare mom Nyisha Gleaves realized she was smart enough to keep her job the day she walked into her boss's office with a spreadsheet report that weeks before seemed close to impossible.

CAMBODIA-RETURN (Moraga, Cambodia) _ For Tito Hen, Cambodia is the faint memory of lying on a haystack, his tiny body wracked by the agony of thirst and hunger. Hen revisits his native land this week. By SUSAN FERRIS.  BUSINESS &AMP; FINANCIAL NEWS (``f'' category)  ODWALLA (San Francisco) _ A trade association for apple juice and sauce manufacturers has accused Half Moon Bay-based Odwalla of besmirching the apple industry while struggling to recover from negative publicity after its fresh apple juice was associated with bacterial infection. By GEORGE RAINE.  POINTCAST _ (San Francisco) _ PointCast Inc. of Cupertino will build its Internet-based news delivery service directly into the next version of Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Explorer, putting the company in Microsoft's camp in an impending battle against an alliance of Silicon Valley firms led by Sun Microsystems Inc. and Netscape Communications Corp. By TOM ABATE.  ATM-FEES (San Francisco) _ It's greedy price-gouging by big banks, consumer advocates cry. It's convenient for customers, bank executives retort. Either way, the fight over bank fees for automated teller machines and other commercial bank services won't vanish soon. By EDWARD IWATA.  CABLE-INTERNET (Anaheim, Calif.) _ The lagging cable TV business is hitching its hopes on the rising star of the Internet. By LOUIS TRAGER.  ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)  CLOONEY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Singer Rosemary Clooney forever will be connected with the Christmas holiday because she co-starred with Bing Crosby in a movie, ``White Christmas'' that will be on TV and VCRs every Yuletide until the sun's fires play out. By FERNANDO DOVALINA.  LIFESTYLE (``l'' category)  KIDS-BOOKS (Undated) _ Two people sat side by side on a Scottish hillside staring at the lake. They waited, hoping Nessie would surface. ``I have to see it to believe it,'' said the man. ``Oh, no,'' said the tiny Irish lass beside him. ``You have to believe it to see it.`` The little girl captured the soul of good children's literature. By JANE P. MARSHALL.  GEMINID-SHOWER (Albany, N.Y.) _ ``Shooting stars'' are expected to flash through the sky by the thousands this month as the Geminid meteor shower puts on its annual show. It's expected to peak Friday night and could continue through Monday. By DARRYL CAMPAGNA.  COMMENTARY (``k'' category)  SALTER (San Francisco) _ Imagine, in this amoral, market-driven economy of ours, that your job is to ``sell'' God's love. Worse, imagine selling it in Hollywood.

GENERAL  PROFILE-GLENDON-BOS (Undated) _ In June of last year the Vatican turned to Harvard _ an odd (and unholy) alliance if ever there was one. The telephone rang in the office of law professor Mary Ann Glendon, and it was the Vatican, asking: Would Glendon lead the Holy See's delegation to the international women's conference in Beijing? ``I'll have to ask my dean,'' Glendon recalls replying, smiling now at the token nod to protocol, for Harvard University officials quickly granted her the chance to become the first woman to head a papal delegation. By Dick Lehr. W/photo. Moved 12-11.  KENNEDY-COX (West Palm Beach, Fla.) _ The big winner in the William Kennedy Smith case? That's an easy one _ Roy Black, the criminal defense lawyer with the bedside mannerisms of a kindly country doctor and the heart of an assassin. Black the Knife. He didn't only get the fame, the cash, and a new career as a courtroom pundit-for-hire. He landed a wife, too. Juror No. 1. By Frank Cerabino. Moved 12-11.  FIREMEN-CALENDAR-PROFILE-NYT (New York) _ Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. This year, for the very first time, the New York Fire Department has given the city that perfect something for Christmas: the Firehouse Hunks 1997 Calendar. Those lips, those eyes, those pecs. By Alex Witchel. W/photo. Moved 12-10.  POET-LAUREATE-NYT (Washington) _ Sometimes he hits upon a lyrical scrap of haiku amid the hum of the crosstown subway. But essentially the poet laureate of the United States has put aside consulting his Muse in favor of proselytizing Rotarians. By Francis X. Clines. W/photo. Moved 12-08.  O'HAIR-MONEY-HNS (Austin, Texas) _ Did America's most famous atheist take the money and run? And is Madalyn Murray O'Hair, whose federal lawsuit in 1963 removed prayer and bible reading from American public schools, now enjoying a South Pacific exile? By John MacCormack. Moved 12-09.  NEA-ALEXANDER-NYT (Washington) _ If there is a limit to the political attacks and budget cuts that Jane Alexander is willing to endure on behalf of the National Endowment for the Arts, she is not yet ready to admit it. By Jane Fritsch. W/photo. Moved 12-09.  JAPAN-PRINCESS-NYT (Tokyo) _ In her first solo news conference with Japanese reporters, which was made public on Monday, Crown Princess Masako spoke vaguely about searching for a balance between her own identity and the traditional role of a crown princess. Then, like presidential spin masters, officials of the Imperial Household Agency went into action. The agency, with more than 1,000 bureaucrats, clerks, and assistants, manages the public persona of the imperial family, and it is fiercely traditional and conservative. By Sheryl WuDunn. Moved 12-09.  BOSTON-RITTS-PHOTOS-NYT (Boston) _ Herbert Ritts Jr., a 44-year-old photographer known for commercial layouts, celebrity portraits and pop videos, could hardly have had a better reception for his first major museum exhibition. But it didn't start out that way. ``Herb Ritts: Work,'' an offering of 245 black-and-white photographs that range in size from 11-by-14 inches to 8-by-31 feet, opened at the Museum of Fine Arts here on Oct. 21. That day, it drew the chiding of a leading art critic for beautiful but superficial commercialism; the review used words like ``stylish,'' ``slick'' and ``fluff.'' By Susan Diesenhouse.Moved 12-11.  MOVIES  FILM-MACLAINE-$ADV15-SFCHRON (San Francisco) _ Her wide blue eyes take in the hotel suite, stopping at the love seat that's sitting in for a serious sofa. ``This room is so small,'' Shirley MacLaine complains with the air of someone who has stayed at grand hotels and feels entitled to all their amenities. By Ruthe Stein. Moved 12-10 for release 12-15.  MOVIE-SHINE-BOS (Undated) _ Interview with Lynn Redgrave, who has a small but important role in a celebrated Australian movie called ``Shine,'' a hit at this year's Sundance Film Festival. By Matthew Gilbert. Moved 12-09.  RICH-COLUMN-NYT (Undated) _ I asked Kal Ruttenstein, the fashion director of Bloomingdales, exactly what the appeal of Evita fashions is to Americans. No one, he included, knows if the movie is any good, and Madonna has yet to carry any movie to the box-office stratosphere. Coronation and tango dresses are unlikely to play well at the office or on the sidelines of the kids' soccer field. Do Americans even know who Evita is? Could Eva Braun ready-to-wear be far behind? What's it all about? By Frank Rich. Moved 12-10.  VONNEGUT-FILM-HNS (Undated) _ Interview with Kurt Vonnegut, author of `Mother Night.' By Louis B. Parks. Moved 12-11.  RENE-MOVIE-LADN (Los Angeles) _ It's all happening pretty fast for Rene Zellweger. The Texas native, a strawberry blonde with a whisper-soft voice who projects a kind of bubbling sweetness and a winning sincerity, was doing fast-food commercials not long ago to pay her way through college. Then she was landing roles in little-seen independent films. Then she was meeting with Tom Cruise. By Amy Dawes. Moved 12-11.  BOOKS  KINKYFRIEDMAN-TEX (Fort Worth, Texas) _ To use a line from a Kris Kristofferson tune, the whole sardonic ``persona'' that Kinky Friedman presents to the world is ``partly truth and partly fiction.'' Where one stops and the other starts, few know for certain, possibly including the Kinkster. By Jeff Guinn. W/KINKYFRIEDMAN-QUIZ-TEX (Fort Worth, Texas) _ Kinky Friedman's mystery novels can't, as a body, be ranked with the career works of America's finest literary author/humorists, but each Friedman book contains some examples of superior wordplay. By Jeff Guinn. Moved 12-11.  QUEEN-OF-ROMANCE-NYT (New York) _ Kathryn Falk, the self-styled Queen of Romance, looked decidedly unromantic on a recent morning in Brooklyn Heights, swigging cough syrup from the bottle and padding about her romance-magazine offices in Kmart slippers. She gave a visitor a quick tour of Romantic Times, from her display of erotic Chinese silk shoes _ a few inches long, for bound feet _ to an adjoining room in which editors were bent over computer screens. By Barbara Stewart. W/photo. Moved 12-09.  TV-BOOKCLUB-BOS (Undated) _ In the next few weeks (the exact date remains a secret), when Oprah Winfrey announces her latest book club selection, a number of things will occur: People who have not picked up a book since they skimmed the Cliff Notes for ``Wuthering Heights'' in high school will dash off to their local bookstore. An obscure or overlooked book will suddenly take root on the best-seller list, laying more familiar titles and authors to waste. And publishers, literary agents and writers will again genuflect to Winfrey, founder of the world's largest book club with membership in the millions. By Renee Graham. Moved 12-06.  MUSIC  IRIS-MUSIC-LADN (Los Angeles) _ Iris DeMent's speaking voice, which still retains the soft, Southern drawl of her Arkansas roots, belies a strength clearly present in the way she makes music. It's a power that comes from a lot of things, she says, but mostly from the conviction of knowing you're doing what you know you were meant to do. By Elizabeth M. Cosin. Moved 12-11.  NORRINGTON-MUSIC-LADN (Los Angeles) _ Roger Norrington has long feet. You can tell because he has doffed his shoes and is wandering around in sky-blue socks, which isn't the typical drill for a world-renowned classical conductor giving an interview. By Reed Johnson. Moved 12-11.  JOHN-ALER-MUSIC-$ADV15-NYT (Undated) _ The tenor John Aler can measure his success by many yardsticks: some 50 recordings (including 3 Grammy winners), ranging from Handel to Stravinsky; lots of frequent-flier miles, and a packed calendar that has just swept him from Santiago, Chile, by way of Sydney, Australia, and Tokyo to Alice Tully Hall for a recital Sunday afternoon. By Cori Ellison. W/photo. Moved 12-10 for release 12-15.  DUNCAN-MUSIC-LADN (Los Angeles) _ These days Duncan Sheik is breathing easier. Mere months ago, this Southern singer and songwriter was just a budding talent, playing and living in Los Angeles, the holder of an indie-label record deal and going nowhere fast. Now Sheik has found himself on the other coast, newly heralded as pop's latest darling-to-be. He's got a hit single, ``Barely Breathing,'' and a self-titled major-label debut that's been widely lauded by critics. By Elizabeth M. Cosin. Moved 12-09.  THEATER  MARY-RODGERS-THEATER-ART-$ADV15-NYT (Undated) _ The nation may not have royalty, but Broadway sure does, and Mary Rodgers, eldest of Richard Rodgers's two daughters, is a member in good standing. By William Wright. W/photo. Moved 12-10 for release 12-15.  PLUMMER-BARRYMORE-COX (Manalapan, Fla.) _ Talent and looks are frequent comparisons between Christopehr Plummer and John Barrymore, especially now that Plummer is playing his childhood idol in William Luce's one-man play, ``Barrymore''. It opened this week at the Royal Poinciana Playhouse in Palm Beach, on a course for Broadway in March. By Hap Epstein. Moved 12-06.  STAGE-TAYMOR-BOS (Undated) _ You might say Julie Taymor is on a bit of a roll. The theater visionary just finished restaging her 1988 masterpiece ``Juan Darien'' at New York's Lincoln Center, and her glorious masks and costumes can be seen in the revival of ``The King Stag.'' Not bad for a month's work. That's not all. She's also been tapped by Disney to direct the Broadway adaptation of ``The Lion King,'' which happens to be the most successful animated film in history.

Coronation and tango dresses are unlikely to play well at the office or on the sidelines of the kids' soccer field. Do Americans even know who Evita is? Could Eva Braun ready-to-wear be far behind? What's it all about? By Frank Rich. Moved 12-10.  VONNEGUT-FILM-HNS (Undated) _ Interview with Kurt Vonnegut, author of `Mother Night.' By Louis B. Parks. Moved 12-11.  RENE-MOVIE-LADN (Los Angeles) _ It's all happening pretty fast for Rene Zellweger. The Texas native, a strawberry blonde with a whisper-soft voice who projects a kind of bubbling sweetness and a winning sincerity, was doing fast-food commercials not long ago to pay her way through college. Then she was landing roles in little-seen independent films. Then she was meeting with Tom Cruise. By Amy Dawes. Moved 12-11.  BOOKS  KINKYFRIEDMAN-TEX (Fort Worth, Texas) _ To use a line from a Kris Kristofferson tune, the whole sardonic ``persona'' that Kinky Friedman presents to the world is ``partly truth and partly fiction.'' Where one stops and the other starts, few know for certain, possibly including the Kinkster. By Jeff Guinn. W/KINKYFRIEDMAN-QUIZ-TEX (Fort Worth, Texas) _ Kinky Friedman's mystery novels can't, as a body, be ranked with the career works of America's finest literary author/humorists, but each Friedman book contains some examples of superior wordplay. By Jeff Guinn. Moved 12-11.  QUEEN-OF-ROMANCE-NYT (New York) _ Kathryn Falk, the self-styled Queen of Romance, looked decidedly unromantic on a recent morning in Brooklyn Heights, swigging cough syrup from the bottle and padding about her romance-magazine offices in Kmart slippers. She gave a visitor a quick tour of Romantic Times, from her display of erotic Chinese silk shoes _ a few inches long, for bound feet _ to an adjoining room in which editors were bent over computer screens. By Barbara Stewart. W/photo. Moved 12-09.  TV-BOOKCLUB-BOS (Undated) _ In the next few weeks (the exact date remains a secret), when Oprah Winfrey announces her latest book club selection, a number of things will occur: People who have not picked up a book since they skimmed the Cliff Notes for ``Wuthering Heights'' in high school will dash off to their local bookstore. An obscure or overlooked book will suddenly take root on the best-seller list, laying more familiar titles and authors to waste. And publishers, literary agents and writers will again genuflect to Winfrey, founder of the world's largest book club with membership in the millions. By Renee Graham. Moved 12-06.  MUSIC  IRIS-MUSIC-LADN (Los Angeles) _ Iris DeMent's speaking voice, which still retains the soft, Southern drawl of her Arkansas roots, belies a strength clearly present in the way she makes music. It's a power that comes from a lot of things, she says, but mostly from the conviction of knowing you're doing what you know you were meant to do. By Elizabeth M. Cosin. Moved 12-11.  NORRINGTON-MUSIC-LADN (Los Angeles) _ Roger Norrington has long feet. You can tell because he has doffed his shoes and is wandering around in sky-blue socks, which isn't the typical drill for a world-renowned classical conductor giving an interview. By Reed Johnson. Moved 12-11.  JOHN-ALER-MUSIC-$ADV15-NYT (Undated) _ The tenor John Aler can measure his success by many yardsticks: some 50 recordings (including 3 Grammy winners), ranging from Handel to Stravinsky; lots of frequent-flier miles, and a packed calendar that has just swept him from Santiago, Chile, by way of Sydney, Australia, and Tokyo to Alice Tully Hall for a recital Sunday afternoon. By Cori Ellison. W/photo. Moved 12-10 for release 12-15.  DUNCAN-MUSIC-LADN (Los Angeles) _ These days Duncan Sheik is breathing easier. Mere months ago, this Southern singer and songwriter was just a budding talent, playing and living in Los Angeles, the holder of an indie-label record deal and going nowhere fast. Now Sheik has found himself on the other coast, newly heralded as pop's latest darling-to-be. He's got a hit single, ``Barely Breathing,'' and a self-titled major-label debut that's been widely lauded by critics. By Elizabeth M. Cosin. Moved 12-09.  THEATER  MARY-RODGERS-THEATER-ART-$ADV15-NYT (Undated) _ The nation may not have royalty, but Broadway sure does, and Mary Rodgers, eldest of Richard Rodgers's two daughters, is a member in good standing. By William Wright. W/photo. Moved 12-10 for release 12-15.  PLUMMER-BARRYMORE-COX (Manalapan, Fla.) _ Talent and looks are frequent comparisons between Christopehr Plummer and John Barrymore, especially now that Plummer is playing his childhood idol in William Luce's one-man play, ``Barrymore''. It opened this week at the Royal Poinciana Playhouse in Palm Beach, on a course for Broadway in March. By Hap Epstein. Moved 12-06.  STAGE-TAYMOR-BOS (Undated) _ You might say Julie Taymor is on a bit of a roll. The theater visionary just finished restaging her 1988 masterpiece ``Juan Darien'' at New York's Lincoln Center, and her glorious masks and costumes can be seen in the revival of ``The King Stag.'' Not bad for a month's work. That's not all. She's also been tapped by Disney to direct the Broadway adaptation of ``The Lion King,'' which happens to be the most successful animated film in history.

GENERAL  PROFILE-GLENDON-BOS (Undated) _ In June of last year the Vatican turned to Harvard _ an odd (and unholy) alliance if ever there was one. The telephone rang in the office of law professor Mary Ann Glendon, and it was the Vatican, asking: Would Glendon lead the Holy See's delegation to the international women's conference in Beijing? ``I'll have to ask my dean,'' Glendon recalls replying, smiling now at the token nod to protocol, for Harvard University officials quickly granted her the chance to become the first woman to head a papal delegation.

That's an easy one _ Roy Black, the criminal defense lawyer with the bedside mannerisms of a kindly country doctor and the heart of an assassin. Black the Knife. He didn't only get the fame, the cash, and a new career as a courtroom pundit-for-hire. He landed a wife, too. Juror No. 1. By Frank Cerabino. Moved 12-11.  FIREMEN-CALENDAR-PROFILE-NYT (New York) _ Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. This year, for the very first time, the New York Fire Department has given the city that perfect something for Christmas: the Firehouse Hunks 1997 Calendar. Those lips, those eyes, those pecs. By Alex Witchel. W/photo. Moved 12-10.  POET-LAUREATE-NYT (Washington) _ Sometimes he hits upon a lyrical scrap of haiku amid the hum of the crosstown subway. But essentially the poet laureate of the United States has put aside consulting his Muse in favor of proselytizing Rotarians. By Francis X. Clines. W/photo. Moved 12-08.  O'HAIR-MONEY-HNS (Austin, Texas) _ Did America's most famous atheist take the money and run? And is Madalyn Murray O'Hair, whose federal lawsuit in 1963 removed prayer and bible reading from American public schools, now enjoying a South Pacific exile? By John MacCormack. Moved 12-09.  NEA-ALEXANDER-NYT (Washington) _ If there is a limit to the political attacks and budget cuts that Jane Alexander is willing to endure on behalf of the National Endowment for the Arts, she is not yet ready to admit it. By Jane Fritsch. W/photo. Moved 12-09.  JAPAN-PRINCESS-NYT (Tokyo) _ In her first solo news conference with Japanese reporters, which was made public on Monday, Crown Princess Masako spoke vaguely about searching for a balance between her own identity and the traditional role of a crown princess. Then, like presidential spin masters, officials of the Imperial Household Agency went into action. The agency, with more than 1,000 bureaucrats, clerks, and assistants, manages the public persona of the imperial family, and it is fiercely traditional and conservative. By Sheryl WuDunn. Moved 12-09.  BOSTON-RITTS-PHOTOS-NYT (Boston) _ Herbert Ritts Jr., a 44-year-old photographer known for commercial layouts, celebrity portraits and pop videos, could hardly have had a better reception for his first major museum exhibition. But it didn't start out that way. ``Herb Ritts: Work,'' an offering of 245 black-and-white photographs that range in size from 11-by-14 inches to 8-by-31 feet, opened at the Museum of Fine Arts here on Oct. 21. That day, it drew the chiding of a leading art critic for beautiful but superficial commercialism; the review used words like ``stylish,'' ``slick'' and ``fluff.'' By Susan Diesenhouse.Moved 12-11.  MOVIES  FILM-MACLAINE-$ADV15-SFCHRON (San Francisco) _ Her wide blue eyes take in the hotel suite, stopping at the love seat that's sitting in for a serious sofa. ``This room is so small,'' Shirley MacLaine complains with the air of someone who has stayed at grand hotels and feels entitled to all their amenities. By Ruthe Stein. Moved 12-10 for release 12-15.
