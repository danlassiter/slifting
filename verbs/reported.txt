You have a refrigerator? Well see if it fits in the freezer then. What about dry ice?'' He put down the phone to speak eloquently about the scientific benefit gained by studying the brains of Elisabetta's family. He sincerely regretted the family's distress. ``The good thing,'' he told me, ``is that research on prion diseases doesn't have to be targeted to FFI to work for FFI.'' One of his teams, he reported, is working on a CJD vaccine. In another interesting finding, Gambetti's research team has shown that variants of the same prion protein gene can produce both FFI and a form of CJD. I got to look at Silvano's scarred thalamus under a microscope and, wearing gloves and a mask, saw mice in whom Gambetti's team have inserted the human FFI gene. If they can figure out how to start and stop the process by which prions convert other prions, they would not only cure FFI and CJD, they would also perhaps point to treatments for Alzheimer's.

In his place Snicket sends Daniel Handler, a cherubic, neatly groomed man of 34 who explains to the children in morbid detail the reason Snicket can't be there himself. Once, at a Long Island Barnes &amp; Noble, Handler passed around a box containing an enormous bug that was, he reported, responsible for Snicket's absence, having bitten the author in the armpit at a picnic the previous day. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
