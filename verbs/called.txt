"10807"	"I"	"called"	" In previous years, the Judith Lieber bag had been ``too nice to use,'' and the extravagant floral silk scarf from Paris was ``hard to handle.'' This year, I delivered and packed Mom's carry-on jewelry, extra eyeglasses and book on Jackie in the unassuming suitcase and watched her practice-pull it down the hall by its telescopic handle. She had a lilt to her step I hadn't seen in quite some time. Later, I called, waiting for the inevitable glitch on the trip south. But Mom sounded young and self-sufficient: ``The suitcase made my trip. It's a wonderful thing; it's perfect. Thank you.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"

"55126"	"I"	"called"	" I ordered tickets through the official World Wide Web site on March 24. After having received no confirmation by March 27, I called, waited 20 minutes on hold long distance, and was told ``we're way behind,'' and to expect confirmation in a couple of days. Now it's nine days later, still nothing. I called again and was told ``we never received your order, it must have been a system malfunction.'' By this time four of the eight sessions I ordered were sold out. The ticket rep said they'd see about getting me tickets to the sold-out sessions. ``You should hear from someone within a couple of days.'' I'd better not hold my breath waiting. This goes way beyond a minor inconvenience. I have spent months planning my Olympic trip and I am not about to have it screwed up by the high-tech equivalent of ``my dog ate my homework.'' This is nothing short of gross incompetence on the part of ACOG to install a ticket system that was obviously massively overloaded, and at least in my case, completely unreliable.

"74916"	"she"	"called"	" ``They were discussing what she did for a living, and he told her the place of his mother's employer, she called, and they said that they hadn't seen her since Friday,'' Evans said.

"167447"	"he"	"called"	" The night before he had the surgery, he called, said Dr. Bob Rotella, a well-known sports psychologist who works with a number of professional golfers. He talked about how scared he was. This was a guy who went from being a great player to a guy who couldn't play anymore. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, you know,	 I used to think he had the same competitive spirit as me, but, you know, back then I was a complete power pitcher, very aggressive, very intense, and El Duque was more finesse. He once threw very hard, I guess. Now we're very similar. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz

, I have,	 The exiled reporters formed their own Tent City, so to speak, converging at an intersection a block and a half down the road, hoping to get someone to chat. Brown accommodated them three times. The (for now) Knicks coach told reporters last week that he felt like a dead man walking and has not heard a word from Thomas about all the palace intrigue. As many questions as you have, I have, Brown said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, I wondered,	 An admission: I wrote a column four years ago tweaking the soccer loyalists, and I learned one thing: If you suggest that a person is a soccer zealot, he will spare no effort in proving you correct. Even though I pointed out in the column that I liked soccer, I was informed that, no, I did not. Gee, I wondered, do I still like broccoli? </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, it seems,	 Sometimes, however, the supporting e-mail you get is more frightening than the criticism. There are people, it seems, who live to make fun of soccer fans. That's strange. I know a man who is a huge pole vault fan, simply huge. And no one says a word to him about it. We live in a nation where people like weightlifting or Arena football or, for goodness' sake, poker tournaments on ESPN, and it's fine. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz

, he wrote,	 But in a letter sent to the New York congressional delegation Friday night, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff noted that New York City has received far more money under the program in question, the Urban Areas Security Initiative, than any other city. The cut between this year and last year, he wrote, was the result of an unusually high appropriation for the program in 2005, itself meant to offset an unusually low appropriation in 2004. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he added,	 Knocke said that the department's analysis had included roughly 7,000 critical sites in the five boroughs. The actual grant allocation for the city, he added, would not have changed at all if these monuments or stadiums had been listed as icons and monuments. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he acknowledged,	 Harville downplayed the effects of a big inning, but he'll be dealing with the consequences longer than anyone. In one-third of an inning, his ERA rose from 2.89 to 6.52. That, he acknowledged, is not a good thing. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz

, he says,	 One early buyer is Nathaniel Pusey, an executive with J.P. Morgan Chase who relocated with his partner, Ronald Schnorbus, to Chicago two years ago from Wilmington, Del. The Aqua, he says, is an architectural event. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, she said,	 Brown said she was blown away to find herself singled out. After all, she said, her sales averaged little more than $2,000 a month. Even so, she paid $300 for the license and an additional $250 for a surety bond the licensing board required. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, she said,	 Brown has yet to make a single sale as a trading assistant (I don't want to sell people's old clothing, she said) and says she would rather not have to have a license. But, she said, she also enjoys the extra credential that a license gives her. Further, she said, she believes that her transactions on eBay are, in fact, auctions. My opinion is that eBay is the one doing the auctioning, she said. They're in control. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz

, he said,	 Mike Taylor, deputy BLM director for resources in Arizona, said that in concept, the trades seemed like a good idea. There were some concerns with the land the developers wanted, he said, but the trades still could have happened. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, we cannot,	 Much as we might like to withdraw, we cannot, not for years, not without greatly compounding what is already the single biggest foreign policy blunder in U.S. history. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, I dunno,	 Why Trump should hire him: Sean is a natural-born charmer who could peddle ice to Eskimos. And that charm would work wonders on the ladies. If The Donald makes Sean president of, oh, I dunno, Finding Profitable Business Ventures With Female Entrepreneurs Inc., The Trumpster's earnings would skyrocket higher than one of his buildings. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 Many people, he said, wanted their own university. As long as it's not a dirty word, I'll put it on a shirt, he said. Unfortunately, for good or for bad, it's an 'all-about-me' society. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, it seems,	 But Black -- a champion of print for whom, it seems, the glass is not half-full but overflowing -- said the company was constantly looking at ways to introduce and extend brands. It's got to be something that parts the waters, she said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, I think,	 I'm less concerned about a statement to the world, he said. I'm more concerned about a statement to my colleagues.

, I think,	 the prototype for what became the first search engine for the wireless Internet, for the cell phones, for the mobile Internet space, which is obviously the space that we're operating in today. You've got, I think, to look back at that point in time, where everyone didn't have the Internet, much less cell phones. In fact, when we were at the School of Science and Math, you weren't even allowed to have a cell phone. When I visit the campus now, every kid has a cell phone, which is pretty amazing. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, I think,	 project and had visions of heading off to college. Taylor was going to head to N.C. State. I had gotten a scholarship to go to Stanford University. We were more focused on our applications and trying to get a prom date than necessarily thinking about all these different elements, but I think we had this passion. We wanted to look like a business even though we were seniors in high school. We got an address in New York City, and we were using that, and we got a fax machine and a phone number that was sort of a virtual phone over the Internet, so we were doing all these things that were a little bit more creative, I think, and ultimately we were able to raise a decent amount of funding to get going. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, I thought,	 work and I was hemming sheets, I thought, I'm going home and rip every sheet off of my bed, because production work, it's hard. I went from, oh dear, I would say from manually hemming fitted sheets to automatically hemming fitted sheets. And that in itself is a big difference. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, I thought,	 vacation and I got a letter through the mail stating they were closing down. Anybody who loses their job, it bothers them. I had all the faith in the world that everything was going to be OK. When they told me I had lost my job, I thought, You pray about this thing, Betty. That's the first thing you do. We had taught our children: You do the best you can, you live for the Lord the best you can, and he's going to give you the desire of your heart. And my desire was to go back to school. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 Unless it happens right in front of you, you can't make a picture of it, said Hondros, who has been to Iraq seven times and is currently in the United States working on a story about returning soldiers. Other than waiting 72 hours for families to be notified, he said, there are no restrictions on putting images of American dead on the wire. (Whether they get used or not is another matter.) </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 Nouri al-Maliki, who leads the Shiite majority of Iraq's parliament, complained bitterly Thursday about U.S. troops' alleged atrocities and abuses against Iraqi civilians. They don't respect citizens, he said, smashing civilian cars and killing on a suspicion or a hunch. It's unacceptable. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, she said,	 Dutt said that while she would miss their collective experience, seven of their jobs will be filled by younger staff members. Moreover, she said, the department, which will have about 60 people when the buyouts are over, will still be about 30 percent bigger than it was in 1998 when Dutt began in the section. We had grown by 45 percent since 1998, she said. So this isn't Armageddon. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
