"26958"	"they"	"overreacted"	" Phoenix, which stole Wesley Person with the No. 23 pick in last year's draft, believes it might have done it again with Michael Finley at No. 21 and Mario Bennett at No. 27. Bennett slipped because of a history of knee problems, while Finley scared some off with his 37 percent shooting in his senior year at Wisconsin. However, the Suns point out, Finley took more than 200 3-pointers (hitting only 28 percent) ... Should we be calling Proviso East High School in Illinois the Dunbar of the Midwest? Finley, Sherrell Ford (No. 26) and Donnie Boyce (No. 42) went to school there together ... For those of you wondering why Isiah Thomas drafted point guard Damon Stoudamire when he has B.J. Armstrong,be advised Armstrong already has been traded to Golden State for Victor Alexander,forward Carlos Rogers (the Warriors are ecstatic to be rid of him) and three second-round selections. The premise is obvious: While Armstrong is a front-line player, he brings numerous warm bodies, which is what every expansion team needs ... Word is Thomas will bring in William Gates of Marquette and ``Hoop Dreams'' fame for a tryout ... Another trade that is not yet official but will be when the salary cap numbers are established: Brian Williams will go to the Clippers and Elmore Spencer to Denver to complete the draft-day deal that sent Rodney Rogers and the rights to Brent Barry to the Clippers for Randy Woods and the rights to Antonio McDyess. Again, the multiple warm body theory is the premise here, but the Clips have blown it again. McDyess was the player coach Bill Fitch was talking about a few weeks ago when he said if a bright young star came in and turned the franchise around, he'd be ``immortal.'' Guess owner Donald Sterling wants to be the only immortal in the franchise ... The so-called ``heart problem'' of Cherokee Parks is a classic case of how the NBA rumor mill can spew out misinformation. One of the routine tests at the Chicago predraft camp showed Parks had a dilated, or enlarged, aorta. Subsequent tests at Duke's medical center showed his heart to be normal. To be doubly sure, Parks had a magnetic resonance imaging done, and that was normal. But by draft day, he was tabbed as having a ``heart condition'' and slipped to Dallas at No. 12. ``I don't know if anyone passed on Cherokee because of health concerns, but if they did, they overreacted,'' said Parks' attorney, Lon Babby. ``He's going to have a long and healthy career.'' Babby said part of the confusion stems from the fact that what is considered a ``normal variant'' is based on the general population, not a highly skilled group of 7-footers. The real danger here, however, was by the time Wednesday night rolled around, there were reports Parks had a procedure done to insert a special valve in his heart so he could play, reports that were completely false. ``In the end, maybe it did us a favor,'' said Babby. ``Cherokee is thrilled to be with a growing young team like Dallas, and they are thrilled to have him.'' ... Eric Williams may or may not be a star, but he already has accomplished something amazing: he brought positive press to the Celtics. In light of the events of the past year, that in itself should earn him a lucrative multiyear contract. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"27152"	"he"	"overreacted"	" ``I've known Jeff since we were little kids in Southern California,'' Sampras said, ``but I didn't agree with what he did. You don't just leave the court at Wimbledon in what he admitted was the match of his life. He lost his cool, he overreacted, and now he's paying the price. I thought what he did was pretty embarrassing.'' </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950704.0026 type=story > <HEADLINE> BURNS PHILP, PHILIPPINES' PILMICO FORM YEAST JOINT VENTURE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> Sydney, July 4 (Bloomberg) (BC-BURNS-PHILP-PHILIPPINES-BLOOM) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
