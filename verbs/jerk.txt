"100743"	"you"	"jerk"	" Nearly all the album's tracks are new, but one gripping exception is  ``There Must Have Been Magic,'' a holdover tune conceived with Linda  McCartney in mind. It's about their first meeting in London, when she  was at a club with  the Animals, one of the rock bands of that era whom  she was photographing.  McCartney suddenly walked in and was smitten.  ``I always used to say to our kids, `You know, if I hadn't have stood up  and said, hi, my name is Paul, you fancy coming to another club?' then  they wouldn't have been born. If she had said, `No, sit down, you jerk,'  or `No thank you,' then the kids wouldn't have been there. So there was  magic in the air that night.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
