Corimon, the only Venezuelan company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, said that in spite of its efforts to fund Standard Brands, the company was forced to seek protection from its creditors.  Corimon, a maker of paints, coatings and other chemicals, Zbought a 77 percent interest in Standard Brands in May for $18 million. That stake has since been reduced to 55 percent because of the conversion of preferred shares into common stock.  El Segundo, California-based Standard Brands said its inability to meet its operating requirements and other obligations forced the bankruptcy filing, its second in four years. Standard Brands emerged from its first bout with bankruptcy in June 1993.  Caracas (Bloomberg) -- Venezuela plans to sell a regional development bank, part of its remaining shares in the national telephone company and several hotels in the first quarter of 1996, officials from the Venezuelan Investment Fund said.  Officials at the fund, the agency in charge of the sale of state assets, said Banco de Fomento Los Andes will be the first state enterprise to be sold in 1996.  ``Investors will have until Feb. 15 to register for the sale,'' said Fund President Alberto Poletto. ``We hope to have everything finished by March.''  The government holds 99.94 percent of Banfoandes shares. Bidders will be allowed to buy 79.95 percent of the shares in the bank, while the remainder will be sold to the bank's employees.  Buenos Aires (Bloomberg) -- YPF SA and Perez Companc SA, Argentina's two leading oil companies, may be joining forces to build and operate a urea plant.  The two companies would have equal stakes in the venture, YPF said, without adding details.  Recent press reports have said the plant would cost $400 million and produce between 600,000 and 800,000 metric tons of urea annually. Urea, which is produced from natural gas, is used as a fertilizer.  Argentina's consumption of urea is expected to rise to 1 million tons by 2000 from 500,000 at present. The only producer is Perez Companc's PASA unit, which produces 100,000 tons a year. Argentina's Canale Buys Brazil Pasta Maker  Buenos Aires (Bloomberg) -- Canale SA, an Argentine foods company, said it bought 80 percent of Brazilian pasta maker Pastificio Basilar Ltda.  Canale didn't disclose the purchase price of the stake.  Basilar, based in Jaboticabal in Sao Paulo state, has capacity to produce 55,000 metric tons of dry pasta annually. The company controls 6 percent of the total Brazilian market and 31 percent of the market in central-north Sao Paulo and southern Minas Gerais.  Basilar's sales next year are expected to total $35 million, Canale said.  Mexico City (Bloomberg) -- Mexico's Commerce Ministry said it will levy dumping tariffs on cold-rolled sheet manufactured in Germany, Brazil and Venezuela, as well as on steel plate produced in Brazil, Canada and Venezuela.  The government's decision comes after a two-and-a-half-year investigation into allegations that foreign companies were selling cold-rolled sheet and steel plate at below-market prices in Mexico.  German companies selling cold-rolled sheet in Mexico will have to pay a dumping tariff of 185.76 percent, while punitive tariffs on the Brazilian-made product will range from 17.36 percent to 31.57 percent. Venezuelan-made cold-rolled sheet will pay a dumping tariff of 55.75 percent.  Sao Paulo (Bloomberg) -- Brazil lowered tariffs on imported cars to 35 percent from 70 percent for automakers already established in Brazil, the government said.  Foreign automakers with operations in Brazil include Volkswagen AG of Germany, Italy's Fiat SpA, General Motors Corp. and the Ford Motor Co.  The tariff change is part of a policy to establish rules for Brazil's automobile industry through 1999, when production is expected to double to about 2.5 million units a year. Tariffs were raised to 70 percent earlier to spur foreign investment in Brazil, which is expected to produce 1.65 million vehicles in 1995.  Automakers also will be allowed to import up to half their capital goods at tariffs of about 2 percent, the Industry, Commerce and Tourism Ministry said.  Mexico City (Bloomberg) -- Mexico's hard-currency reserves rose 10.3 percent during the week ended Dec. 22 to $16.06 billion from $14.56 billion on Dec. 15, Banco de Mexico said in a report.  The $1.5 billion increase in Mexico's hard-currency reserves came after the central bank received $1.63 billion of the U.S. currency from the International Monetary Fund. Banco de Mexico, the country's central bank, also received $55 million from state-owned companies, mainly the oil giant Petroleos Mexicanos.  At the same time, the central bank used $60 million to redeem dollar-indexed bonds, or tesobonos. It paid back $71 million of its debts with the IMF and sold $56 million to the government, which used the resources to service its foreign debt.  Using an exchange rate of 7.5500 pesos to the dollar, Mexico's hard-currency reserves amounted to 121.22 billion pesos on Dec. 22, up from 113.46 billion a week before. Venezuela to Let Cos Have Overseas Accounts  Caracas (Bloomberg) -- Venezuela said it will allow companies with export earnings to maintain overseas bank accounts in a move to stimulate foreign investment.  The new decree, which was approved yesterday by the government, replaces a previous ruling that required companies with exports to exchange their foreign currency with the Central Bank at the official exchange rate.  To qualify for an overseas account, companies must have fixed assets of at least $50 million, and foreign share ownership of 40 percent, said officials from the finance ministry.  In addition, companies must use 35 percent national goods in their production and must export 40 percent of their goods. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19951228.0404 type=story > <HEADLINE> THE NOISE OF THIS RITUAL IS MUSIC </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> NEW YORK (BC-NY-NEWYEAR'S-MUSIC-6TAKES-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"

BRECHER c.1996 Smartkid (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  What did you do in the war, Daddy?  In the 1950s, a kid would pause one day from rerouting his Lionel trains or diapering her Betsy Wetsy to pose the question. And Daddy then might talk about a place called the Bulge, an outfit called the Flying Tigers or a job called KP.  In the '90s, a kid is likely to pause one day from slaughtering his Mortal Kombat enemies or preening her Baywatch Barbie and query the boomer parent: What did you do in the '60s?  ``Well ... drugs,'' is what you might say if you were honest about it. You'd talk about a place called Woodstock, a man named Timothy Leary or a concept known as free love.  But that's a big ``if'' for Boomer parents, who'd sooner relive the Nixon presidency than admit to their kids that they ever got high. According to The Partnership for a Drug Free America, 4 million Americans tried drugs by 1962. By 1985, the number had risen to 75 million.  Brian and Margie, late-30's ad executives from Southern California, are among those drug-dabbling millions. And as parents of an 8-year-old, they say drugs are ``the only thing we're ever going to lie to her about.''  Ask them why and they squirm.  ``I think that in our day, drugs were fairly natural,'' Margie says, ``and we know that if you smoke a few joints, it's not going to kill you. But our parents thought if you did that, you were addicted.''  Still, they worry that Nicole might interpret their confessions as an endorsement, which is the last message they want to send during an age when drugs seem to be getting less ``natural'' and more dangerous all the time.  And it seems much harder for Boomer parents to face their own Prozac-popping generation's contradictions on the subject of drugs than it was for '50s parents to preach the evils of tobacco while blowing Pall Mall fumes in their kids' faces. After all, what were the '60s about, if not rebelling against hypocrisy?  Granted, the Boomers' progression from LSD to MBA belies the scare tactics of the just-say-no shock troops. Their relative sanity and success is living proof that some drugs, at least, don't turn your brain into a fried egg. But the world has changed, and so have drugs (the '60s were not about crack).  Certain household and automotive products have given new meaning to the term ``mind-altering substance.'' Kids are ``huffing'' Freon, gasoline and other chemicals that have about the same effect on the cerebral cortex as the ebola virus. It's estimated that one-third of all American adolescents will use alcohol or illegal substances at least once this year.  A recent University of Michigan study says the use of marijuana by eighth graders zoomed from 6 percent in 1991 to 16 percent in 1995. Fifteen percent of 10th-graders were smoking pot in 1992; today it's 29 percent.  Now add these scary statistics from a Partnership for a Drug Free America print ad: ``135,000 guns go to school every day. Violence takes the lives of nine teenagers a day. AIDS among teenagers increased 214 percent last year. Sixty percent of all rape victims are under 18. The '90s are not the '60s. There's no such thing as a harmless drug in a world this dangerous.''  Indeed, you'd be downright irresponsible as a parent not to take it all seriously. Even Boomers who still enjoy an occasional joint realize that.  ``I think it's right to emphasize the dangers of truly dangerous drugs,'' says Annette, an office manager from Tucson, Ariz., ``but don't lump pot in with them.''  She and her husband, Ron, an antiques dealer, still smoke, and their daughters, who are 12 and 16, know it.  ``I'll sneak outside for a puff, wash my hands, eat a Certs, and my daughter will still bust me. But it's not a big deal anymore,'' Ron says.  ``They've been brainwashed through school about how horrible pot is. They were concerned that their family unity was in jeopardy. We told them pot is probably not as bad as alcohol, but as a kid you shouldn't do either. I told them it's hyped up probably for good reason: to discourage kids, because it confuses you and is not conducive to school work.''  Annette adds: ``If they came home stoned, I'd punish them on the basis of them being too young to experiment. A lot of our friends are horrified that we don't care if our kids know we smoke pot. It's best to come clean.''  There may even be a psychological advantage to fessing up, because kids are likely to discover at some point if you've been lying, says Fort Lauderdale public defender Howard Finkelstein.  He should know. Before he became a local celebrity as O.J. Simpson-trial on-air analyst for a South Florida television station, Finkelstein earned another kind of notoriety: He was busted in 1987 for using crack and received probation.  Daughters Sarai, 8, and Shayna, 3, don't know about that. Yet. ``I fell very low and very hard,'' admits Finkelstein, 43. ``I can show them a booking photo and newspaper articles, wherein their father lost almost everything.''  The fundamental issue for most parents ``is whether they're absolute on the question of no use,'' says Mathea Falco. A member of the Harvard University Board of Overseers, she runs an organization called Drug Strategies, which issues a consumer guide to drug education programs and promotes more-effective strategies to the drug problem.  She and husband Peter Tarnoff, undersecretary of state for political affairs, have a 10-year-old son. They have staked out an absolutist position: no drugs, no alcohol.  ``Even parents who didn't do drugs are ambivalent,'' Falco says. ``They are very reluctant to take clear stands. It has to do with the larger questions of values, and are we willing to stand up for what is right and wrong, and you need to know the difference.''  Hysteria won't be any more effective on your kids than Reefer Madness was on you. ```Just say no' oversimplifies reality,'' says Rick Evans, executive director of the National Family Partnership, a St. Louis-based nonprofit substance-abuse education/prevention network. ``Just say something.''  At the very least, point out that drugs are against the law.  ``If you're asked, `Why was it okay for you, but it isn't okay for me?' you can say it was unwise, and `I wish now I hadn't done it,''' Evans advises.  The issue is not whether children will drink or do drugs to occasional excess, write Stanton Peele and Archie Brodsky in ``The Truth About Addiction and Recovery'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1991), but ``whether their lives are about something more than that.'' Most children who use drugs do so casually, they write, ``and ultimately reject drug experimentation, simply because they grow up and have better ways to spend time, and because they have more to lose than to gain from drug use.''  You hardly have to wait for a personal crisis to bring up the subject.  ``Something happens in school and they bring the (sniffer) dogs in, or you see something on TV, or Jerry Garcia dies. There are a million ways to talk about it. It doesn't need to be a big lecture kind of thing,'' Evans notes.  Studies show that many kids don't want to do drugs, he adds, ``and when their parents set the standard, it gives them an excuse not to.  ``A child can say, `If I smoke pot, I'll be grounded till I'm 40.'' -0- SIDEBAR: EXPERT ADVICE  There's plenty of help and sound advice out there for parents who need tips on how to approach the subject of drugs with their kids. It's really up to you and that includes setting the example.  Experts say: ``Communication needs to be on a regular basis. It can't be treated as an inoculation, something you do on an as-need basis. Neither sex nor drugs is like that. The message needs constant reinforcement. They need to hear it as children, teenagers and young adults.' _ Doug Hall, vice president of the National Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education (PRIDE).  ``Positive peer pressure works. It's not hip and all kids are not doing it. It's a big misconception that they all are ... Give them decision-making skills, conflict-resolution skills, so when they have to make that decision, they feel comfortable saying no.'' _ Phil Clark, program director, Greenville County, S.C., Leaders Against Drugs.  ``However you get into the subject, it's important to state exactly how you feel about it. Not in threatening tones, but in matter-of-fact, unmistakably clear language ... Don't do all the talking ... Don't threaten. Don't badger. Don't put your kid on the spot by asking directly if he or she has ever tried drugs. They'll probably lie, which undermines your whole conversation.'' _ Partnership for a Drug Free America.  ``What do you tell your kids when they ask about your own drug- taking activities? If they don't ask, don't tell them ... As your children's most important role models, you gain nothing by volunteering the information that you were a drug freak in college.  ``If they do ask, there is certainly no need to elaborate ... If you tried marijuana, you can simply say that, even if you smoked it every day.'' _ Dr. Victor Strasburger in ``Getting Your Kids to Say `No' in the '90s When You Said `Yes' in the '60s'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1993). -0- SIDEBAR: RESOURCES  _ Drug Strategies, 2445 M St. N.W.

Until about 20 years ago, most doctors and nutrition experts believed that, except for true food allergies that provoked immediate reactions, as long as food items were part of a balanced diet, they couldn't be harmful.  But, as Jonathan Brostoff, director of the Allergy Clinic at Middlesex Hospital in London and co-author (with Linda Gamlin) of ``The Complete Guide to Food Allergy and Intolerance'' (Crown, 1989), notes, ``We must remember that no one designed foods for human consumption.''  ``Our foods come from a pool of wild plants and animals that were domesticated by early farmers only 5,000 to 10,000 years ago, a blink of the eye in evolutionary terms,'' he says.  In general, common foods _ wheat, milk, corn and eggs _ are the most problematic. In recent years, as Asian foods and vegetarianism have become more popular, an increasing number of people are turning up with reactions to soy.  Many people still use the term food allergy to describe these reactions, but increasingly, these problems are called food intolerances or sensitivities. No one knows how many people have food intolerances, but Brostoff estimates about 10 percent.  Initially, symptoms tend to be minor, but they grow more severe as time passes and may be provoked by an increasing number of foods.  Often people don't even notice their symptoms for several years. Over time, they simply experience a slow decline in health and vitality and report vague, nonspecific symptoms that some mainstream physicians dismiss as ``neurotic.''  Possible symptoms of food intolerance include indigestion, mouth sores, diarrhea, constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, bloating, flatulence, muscle and/or joint pain, headaches, mental fogginess and fatigue.  Some people with food sensitivities find they must eliminate the offending items completely to remain symptom-free. Others find that after six months or so, they can eat foods to which they are sensitive occasionally without ill effects or with minor effects.  And some people find that they can keep their symptoms under control by using a ``rotation diet,'' eating any given food item only once every four or five days.  Here are some elimination diet suggestions for common food sensitivities. ELIMINATION DIET FOR LACTOSE INTOLERANCE  Lactose is the milk sugar found in all dairy products. People with lactose intolerance have difficulty digesting it and experience stomach upset, diarrhea, gas and abdominal cramps.  Nursing mammals produce an enzyme _ lactase _ that allows them to digest mothers' milk. After weaning, most mammals never drink milk again, and they lose the ability to produce lactase. Many humans also stop making lactase but continue to drink milk and consume dairy products throughout life. The result is lactose intolerance.  ``Lactose intolerance is most common among African Americans and Asians, but many adolescents and adults of all races experience some degree of this problem, which usually remains unsuspected, undiagnosed and untreated,'' says Anne Simons, assistant clinical professor of family and community medicine at the University of California's San Francisco Medical Center.  In addition to milk, yogurt, cheeses and ice cream, avoid milk solids and whey. (You'll have to read food labels carefully.) If you feel noticeably better, chances are you're lactose intolerant. Doctors can also test for lactose intolerance.  If you're sensitive to lactose, you have several choices.  _ You can refrain completely from eating dairy foods.  _ You can try to eat yogurt, buttermilk and hard cheeses. Many people with lactose intolerance can consume these cultured-milk products without triggering symptoms.  _ You can buy milk and dairy products with added lactase. These products have become more widely available as lactose intolerance has been publicized. You can add your own lactase to milk using the over-the-counter lactase supplement Lactaid, which is available at pharmacies.  _ You can use soy milk instead of cow's milk. Just don't try to use goat's milk; it also contains lactose, so it won't help the problem.  If you eliminate dairy products, be sure to get enough calcium by eating lots of low-fat cultured-milk dairy products and other foods rich in calcium: canned salmon, green leafy vegetables and tofu. You might also take a calcium supplement. ELIMINATION DIET FOR MSG INTOLERANCE  In 1968, a letter to the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine reported the occurrence of ``two hours of numbness, weakness and heart palpitations'' after eating at a Chinese restaurant. The doctor-correspondent speculated that the cause was the food additive used in many Asian cuisines, monosodium glutamate (MSG).  The wire services picked up the story, and newspapers from coast to coast warned of ``Chinese restaurant syndrome.'' As medical reports of MSG reactions multiplied, new symptoms joined the list: headache, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, depression, insomnia, rashes, rapid heartbeat, irregular heartbeat, mood swings, tremors and shortness of breath.  Some people react immediately, while others develop symptoms up to 48 hours after consuming MSG.  Today many Chinese restaurants advertise ``No MSG.'' ``But Chinese restaurants are just the tip of the MSG iceberg,'' says Dr. George R. Schwartz, a Santa Fe, N.M., specialist in emergency medicine and toxicology and author of ``In Bad Taste: The MSG Syndrome'' (HealthPress, 1988).  ``More than 250 supermarket items contain MSG: Ac'cent, Lawry's Seasoned Salt, many condiments and most soup mixes, TV dinners and prepared dishes. And you'd be hard-pressed to find an airplane or fast food meal without it.''  To avoid MSG reactions, eliminate it from your diet.  ``Unfortunately, that's easier said than done,'' Schwartz says. ``Food labels do not necessarily list it. Instead, they might list `textured protein,' `hydrolyzed protein,' `hydrolyzed vegetable protein,' `yeast food,' `sodium or calcium caseinate' or `natural flavors,' all of which contain significant amounts of MSG.  ``And watch out for any foods that come with `flavor packets.' They usually contain MSG.''  A study by Harvard researchers suggested that about 30 percent of Americans develop reactions to 5 grams of MSG, while 90 percent react to 10 grams. (One teaspoon of Ac'cent contains about 6 grams.)  If you're MSG-sensitive, you can avoid it by eating a diet based on whole grains and fresh fruits and vegetables. Read labels carefully and avoid processed foods and fast foods. When planning to dine at Asian restaurants, call first and ask if they use MSG.  Many people who react to MSG are also sensitive to aspartic acid, an ingredient in the artificial sweetener NutraSweet and in Equal, the sugar substitute that contains NutraSweet. Try eliminating NutraSweet and see how you feel. ELIMINATION DIET FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS  Until the mid-1980s, conventional medical wisdom held that diet had nothing to do with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the most crippling form of joint inflammation, which affects more than 2 million Americans. Then reports began appearing that dietary changes relieved some pain and swelling in some people with RA.  Researchers are not sure why dietary changes relieve the symptoms of RA _ and the more common osteoarthritis, which affects more than 16 million Americans. Some say that a high-fat diet increases levels of stimulatory prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that trigger inflammation.  Others contend that people with arthritis are sensitive to certain foods, specifically plants of the nightshade family: tomatoes, eggplant, white potatoes and peppers (except the spices black and white pepper).  And some assert that cooking robs foods of as-yet-undetermined constituents that protect the joints of sensitive individuals.  The debate over why dietary changes relieve arthritis symptoms will no doubt rage for years. But if you have arthritis, try reducing your fat intake. It might also help to cut out nightshade foods and eat more fresh, raw fruits and vegetables.  Other studies suggest that taking about a tablespoon a day of olive oil, fish oil (which contains omega-3 fatty acids) or evening primrose oil (gamma-linoleic acid) also helps relieve arthritis symptoms after a period of about six months.

Includes a color slide of an enormous explosion in a scene from ``Dante's Peak.'' By CINDY PEARLMAN World rights except Chicago (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Not since the days of Job has mankind been in such peril.  Record numbers of tornadoes, floods, fires, earthquakes, volcanoes and even plummeting asteroids are predicted in 1997, all at a theater near you.  Yes, once again Hollywood is flirting with disaster.  It was inevitable, once ``Twister'' (1996) sucked up $240 million at the box office. It was immediate, once ``Independence Day'' (1996), with its panoramas of mass devastation, fought back with a gross of $307 million.  Now, it's hard to keep track of them all.  + ``Dante's Peak,'' opening Feb. 7, stars Linda Hamilton and Pierce Brosnan. He's a hunky volcanologist, she's the mayor of a small Northwestern town who won't believe that a volcanic eruption is imminent. Three guesses who's right?  + ``Volcano,'' due sometime this spring, pits Tommy Lee Jones against another volcano, this one laying waste to Los Angeles.  + On the home screen, ABC will present the two-hour ``Volcano: Fire On the Mountain'' on Feb. 23, with Dan Cortese and Cynthia Gibb facing a long-dormant volcano that presumably won't stay that way, plus an earthquake for good measure.  + NBC's ``Asteroid,'' airing on Feb. 16 and 17, has Michael Biehn and Anne Marie Johnson keeping one eye skyward as they wonder what to do about an asteroid that threatens to crush Dallas.  + More space-borne threats loom in ``Deep Impact,'' Dreamworks SKG's comet movie now in production.  + The title of ``Flood,'' a May release starring Christian Slater and Morgan Freeman, is fairly self-explanatory. Think of it as ``Waterworld'' in street clothes.  + ``Firestorm,'' due this autumn, casts former football star Howie Long as a cop trapped with some convicts amid an enormous forest fire.  All in all, 1970s disaster king Irwin Allen would be proud. Things have gotten so busy that the Federal Emergency Management Agency recently hired a disaster-movie technical consultant.  ``We were getting so many requests from movie companies to come to their sets that it was getting ridiculous,'' says Morrie Goodman, the agency's director of communications and a consultant on ``Asteroid'' and ``Volcano.'' ``You know, we have real-life disasters that also need our attention.''  So why does on-screen disaster suddenly seem so lucrative?  ``We're all looking for a ride,'' says Sam Nicholson, visual-effects supervisor on ``Asteroid.'' ``These films are pure escapism.''  ``Our lives are so predictable and safe. We're bored,'' Northwestern University sociologist Bernard Beck says.  ``Look at the audience for these movies,'' he adds. ``It's mostly younger people and singles. These people live placid lives and they're looking for a thrill. And what can it hurt if someone sits through a disaster movie and thinks, `It's out there. This could really happen to me _ although it's unlikely. But it could happen.'''  Could it? Some of the disaster scenarios are more likely than others, Goodman says. ``Twister,'' for example, was fairly plausible if not entirely realistic.  ``Oh my gosh, yes,'' he says. ``There are conditions where dozens of tornadoes are sighted in one day. We flew a helicopter over Northern Florida once during a flood and saw one funnel cloud after another.''  The odds against alien invasions are hard to quantify, but ``Asteroid's'' scenario may be more likely.  ``The chances of dying from a meteor impact are six times greater than dying in a plane crash,'' a NASA spokesperson says. ``But, on the other hand, there is no record of any human who has died as the result of asteroid impact.''  What about volcanoes?  ``Dante's Peak reminds me of Mount St. Helen's. The movie is plausible because the plot is in the Pacific Northwest, where a large volcano is the backdrop for many a community,'' says Brantley Stevens, a public-information officer for the U.S. Geological Survey.  ``But `Volcano' is a different story. There is no volcanic activity in Los Angeles,'' he adds. ``Plus I saw a preview of `Volcano' where lava is flowing down major L.A. intersections. Lava does not travel terribly fast unless on a steep slope.  ``So I'd say downtown L.A. is safe,'' Stevens says with a chuckle. ``At least for a few million years.''  There are plenty of other hazards in California, however, and ``Independence Day'' producer/writer Dean Devlin thinks that this may explain the disaster-movie revival.  ``I think it's really just a reflection of what's going on in the world,'' he says. ``Los Angeles is like a real-life disaster zone with fires, earthquakes, floods and mudslides. It's like Hollywood has been taking notes for future scripts.''  ``Or it could be a solution to Hollywood's very real problem of finding a bad guy,'' ``Independence Day'' director Roland Emmerich suggests.  ``It's politically incorrect these days to use any kind of nationality or race as the face of evil,'' he explains. ``Mother Nature and aliens are bad and, face it, they don't offend anyone.''  The basic esthetic of disaster movies hasn't changed since the last disaster boom in the 1970s. They may cost more and flash slicker special effects, but the formula remains the same.  Take a high-concept disaster. Mix in state-of-the-art special effects. Add B-list stars such as ``Twister's'' Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton, ``Independence Day's'' Bill Pullman or ``Volcano's'' Anne Heche. Mix well, add publicity and _ hopefully _ count megadollar grosses.  In fact, the new disaster movies could almost be remakes of the old disaster movies. The recent ``Turbulence'' was a not-so-subtle spin on ``Airport'' (1970). James Cameron's upcoming ``Titanic'' is a historically authentic ``The Poseidon Adventure'' (1972). ``Volcano'' and ``Dante's Peak'' are riffs on Allen's ``When Time Ran Out'' (1980). ``Asteroid'' and ``Deep Impact'' sound suspiciously like ``Meteor'' (1979).  As for ``Flood,'' only the punctuation seems to set it apart from Allen's ``Flood!'' (1976).  Nor do disaster movies demand big bucks for scripts. In ``Twister,'' someone actually condemns the villain by gasping, ``He's in it for the money, not the science!''  In lieu of top actors or fresh dialogue, of course, the new disaster epics rely on special effects, with each film striving to top the last.  ``Every film has to be bigger and better,'' ``Twister'' director Jan DeBont says, ``which is code for more expensive,''  Today, amateurish miniature shots are out, and integrated computer imagery and robotics _ combined with new, high-tech miniatures, of course _ are in.  ``Independence Day'' cost $75 million to make, almost a bargain given its 500 visual-effects shots requiring 6,000 model and computer setups. ``Twister'' was a virtual steal at $45 million, because 22 minutes of the film _ including even the flying cow _ were done on computer.  By contrast, ``Dante's Peak'' cost between $100 million and $120 million, according to star Pierce Brosnan. ``Asteroid,'' at $19 million, would be cheap for a movie, but as television budgets go, it's staggering.  ``Volcano'' won't be cheap either. The filmmakers bought an old Hughes Aircraft airplane hangar, erected an exact, full-size replica of five square blocks of Los Angeles streets _ and then destroyed it.  Even volcanic ash isn't cheap, though someday it might have been even more expensive: The ash was created from surplus baseball cards, shredded and delivered in 100-ton packages.  ``The cards go quickly, because they're immediately placed in big pipes that blow the stuff and fire everywhere. It's quite a spectacle,'' Goodman says.  Aircraft hangars must be in demand. For ``Flood,'' one was purchased and outfitted with a 5-foot metal wall holding back 5 million gallons of water.  With budgets running so high, of course, the pressure is on to bring in the crowds. ``Flood's'' producers must be nervously eyeing returns from Sylvester Stallone's ``Daylight'' (1996), a similarly waterlogged film that took in a meager $29 million at the box office.  Now, in Hollywood, that's a real disaster. c.1997 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Amy Irving in a scene from ``Three Sisters.'' By JERRY TALLMER (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  The brief program bio for Amy Irving in ``Three Sisters,'' the classic Anton Chekhov play now running at Broadway's Roundabout Theatre, lists 15 movies she's been in.  They include her debut in ``Carrie'' (1976) and as 1/3 of a bigamous marriage with Dudley Moore and Ann Reinking in ``Micki &AMP; Maude'' (1984). And of course there's Barbra Streisand's ``Yentl'' (1983), in which she portrayed a girl who falls in love with disguised-as-a-boy Streisand, and earned an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress.  Even now, 13 years later, it's probably the role the public most associates her with _ that and the yuppie Jewish woman wooed by a tender pickle merchant in ``Crossing Delancey'' (1988).  In a less-known, more-against-type role, she provided the singing voice for the ultra-sexy Jessica Rabbit in ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'' (1988) _ an odd case of double-dubbing, since she was singing for Kathleen Turner, who provided Jessica's slinky speaking voice.  But though the world may see Irving as a just-under-the-first-rank movie star, it's not how she sees herself.  ``I don't think of myself as a movie actress,'' says the fine-lined beauty who plays Olga, the self-sacrificing schoolteacher, opposite two other actresses with solid Hollywood credentials _ Jeanne Tripplehorn as the tempestuous Masha, and Lili Taylor as idealistic, supersensitive Irina.  ``We're all theater-trained actresses,'' Irving says during an interview in her dressing room at the Roundabout, a couple of hours before a performance. ``For me, it's not the celebrity that's doing it here,'' she says. ``It's the talent in the room.''  She pauses. ``But it is a pretty interesting marquee,'' she admits with a smile.  Irving's stage credentials are certainly impeccable, beginning with her drama-school days at San Francisco's American Conservatory Theatre and at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.  Since then, she's appeared in numerous plays in New York and elsewhere, from Bernard Shaw's ``Heartbreak House'' to Arthur Miller's ``Broken Glass'' and Athol Fugard's ``The Road to Mecca.''  The latter two represented the works' New York premieres, and Irving's performance as a young Englishwoman in ``Road to Mecca'' earned her an Obie Award, Off-Broadway's equivalent of the Tony or Oscar.  Chekhov seems to fit right in with her past history of great playwrights such as Shaw, Miller and Fugard.  ``It takes a damn good playwright to bring me to New York,'' Irving says with a laugh, her blue eyes bright behind the smart new twin-headlight glasses she's recently acquired to remedy her newly diagnosed far-sightedness.  Actually, her Broadway engagement is particularly convenient for Irving, who now lives on Manhattan's Upper West Side with her second husband, director Bruno Baretto, and their two children _ 11-year-old Max Spielberg, her son by first husband Steven Spielberg, and Baretto's 6-year-old son, Gabriel.  ``I can walk to work,'' she says.  Previously, Irving lived in Los Angeles, a town not noted for its theatrical life. She did a lot of theater there, she says, but didn't much like it.  ``A long drive to the theater, a long drive home after the show,'' she recalls. ``There's no theater community out there, no people talking about theater all around you. None of the theatrical energy of New York.''  Irving met Baretto in 1993, when he directed her in ``Benefit of the Doubt.'' Like her first husband, the acclaimed director of ``E.T.'' and ``Schindler's List,'' the Brazilian Baretto is a respected director, most noted for his 1978 film, ``Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands'' and, more recently, ``Carried Away'' (1996), in which Irving co-starred with Dennis Hopper.  It's no accident that both her husbands have been directors, Irving admits.  ``I'm a textbook lover of directors,'' she says.  The first director in her life, and probably the most influential, was her father, Jules Irving. Founder of the San Francisco Actor's Workshop, he was also co-director of New York's Repertory Theatre of Lincoln Center for eight turbulent years starting in 1965, when Amy was 9.  Irving takes a framed oval photograph from her makeup shelf.  ``My parents in `The Playboy of the Western World' in San Francisco,'' she says.  It's a lovely photo _ Jules Irving and Priscilla Pointer, locked in one another's embrace, way back when. The man in the photo looks barely 16.  ``He always looked like a baby,'' his daughter says with a smile.  Jules Irving died in 1979, but Pointer, who has since married actor/director Robert Symonds, remains active. Currently, Irving says, her mother is in Los Angeles, ``rehearsing for some Israel Horowitz plays.'' Pointer can also be glimpsed as a visiting aunt in ``Carried Away.''  In fact, it was Pointer who provided Irving's first encounter with ``Three Sisters,'' which is being performed at the Roundabout in a new translation by Lanford Wilson.  ``I saw my mother play Masha when I was 6,'' Irving says. ``If she were here now, she'd be giving me notes. When I did Masha at Williamstown (Mass.) nine years ago, she gave me a lot of notes.''  Yes, Irving wasn't always Olga. In fact, she's also played Irina, back in her San Francisco days at ACT. Call it a Chekhovian hat trick.  ``Well, it's my favorite play,'' she says. ``When I heard they were doing `Three Sisters' at the Roundabout, I let them know I was interested, and they invited me.''  Near the picture of her parents on Irving's makeup table stands a framed passage about the play, from a piece by Russian author Maxim Gorki:  ``Next to her stands the sad figure of Olga from `Three Sisters.' She also loves deeply and submits without a murmur to the whims of the base, dissolute wife of her idle brother. She watches the lives of her sisters being destroyed before her eyes, and she weeps, unable to help anyone, totally incapable of a single living powerful word of protest.''  Irving finds the passage helpful in playing the role, she says.  ``It drops seeds into my body,'' she explains, ``helps me realize why I can't do certain things. It ties back the Amy in me and lets Olga come out,''  Next up for Irving, she says, is more Chekhov _ ``The Sea Gull,'' often considered the Russian playwright's greatest work.  ``Not that I'm only going to do Chekhov,'' she says.  Indeed, her next job will take her back onto the big screen. During an off day at the Roundabout, she plans to fly to California to shoot a bit part _ ``a tough FBI agent,'' she says _ in Baretto's next film, ``One Tough Cop.''  Already in the can is a small role in Woody Allen's next film, ``Deconstructing Henry.'' It's not a major part, she says wryly.  ``There's like 8,000 people in it,'' she explains. ``I play his third wife.''  In the meantime, though, it's Chekhov on Broadway. The noted light comedienne Amy Irving, seasoned veteran of Hollywood glamor, the woman who once married Barbra Streisand onscreen and Steven Spielberg offscreen, is doing angst-ridden Russian theater.  And she couldn't be happier. c.1997 Jerry Tallmer  (Jerry Tallmer is a New York-based free-lance writer.)

It wasn't long ago, after all, that oat bran was a magic bullet, beta-carotene was an all-purpose cancer fighter and Alar was the scourge of apple-eating children.  Then, just when we'd altered our habits to respond to the news, science changed its mind. The oat-bran data were suddenly unconvincing; a group of Finnish smokers who took beta-carotene supplements were found to have an increased lung-cancer risk; ingesting Alar turned out to be far less risky than driving longer distances to buy organic apples.  Fortunately, there are ways to separate the studies you should believe from those that aren't worth the paper they're printed on. Follow these guidelines and you'll know when to change your behavior in response to the latest findings _ and when not to give up something you love after all. SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH: EXAMINING IT UNDER A MICROSCOPE  What we know about lowering our risk for disease comes from different kinds of research. One type, animal studies, can hint at the biological reasons some substances are potential health hazards.  But animal biology doesn't always match human biology. For instance, while asbestos fibers wreak havoc in human lungs, they barely affect lung tissue in mice. So, in general, when you read that something produces illness in animals, don't automatically assume it's bad for you too.  In order to study health dangers in humans, experts turn to epidemiology, which looks at the incidence and distribution of disease within groups of people. Many attention-grabbing headlines are based on this kind of study.  Epidemiology has taught us important lessons over the years: that smoking drastically raises the risk of lung cancer; that a fatty diet promotes heart disease; that sun worship destroys skin.  But not all findings are equally clear. In fact, the science of epidemiology is riddled with problems. Take the phenomenon known as the confounding factor, a hidden cause and effect that explains a study's outcome.  One example: While some studies suggest a low-fat diet protects against cancer, the people who eat wholesome foods are also more apt than others to practice healthy behaviors, such as daily exercise. So maybe it's these factors, instead of a specific diet, that are responsible for the protection.  Certain epidemiological studies, particularly retrospective studies (which look back on habits and exposures of a diseased group and compare them with those of a healthy group), have another flaw: It's called the recall bias _ the perfectly human tendency to forget or fudge the facts.  Volunteers are notorious for not accurately reporting their eating habits. A study may also be biased if the group being tested is not representative. This is the complaint, of course, against the vast bulk of research, which has looked only at men.  Yet another problem with epidemiological studies is that they rarely point to a specific trigger for disease. For instance, while air pollution is clearly harmful, researchers aren't sure exactly which component in foul air hurts us.  One way to overcome these uncertainties is with very striking increases in risk. In the case of smoking, for instance, epidemiological studies have found that a daily pack of cigarettes boosts your risk of lung cancer about 1,000 to 2,000 percent. Put another way, a smoker's chances of getting lung cancer are about 10 to 20 times that of a nonsmoker!  However, most epidemiological studies result in less persuasive numbers. A 50 percent increased risk may sound like a lot, but what it means is that your odds of contracting a condition are 1.5 times what they would normally be if you hadn't had the exposure in question.  If your chances of getting a disease were only one in 1,000 to begin with, a 50 percent increase merely raises your risk to 1.5 in 1,000.  Epidemiologists say that any study showing less than a doubled increase in risk is unconvincing, unless the result has been borne out repeatedly before. It also helps if animal studies offer a biological explanation for the results and if there's a dose-response relationship, meaning greater exposure leads to higher risk. HOW TO MAKE SENSE OF THE NEWS  _ Remember that no single study is the final word. Science builds on itself bit by bit, disregarding certain ideas while reinforcing others. Think of individual studies as snapshots in scientific time, moments in an onslaught of facts and theories.  ``If it's a brand-new finding, wait and see what other people conclude,'' says Dr. Clark Heath, vice president for epidemiology and surveillance research at the American Cancer Society.  _ Place the study in context. Did it contradict a massive body of previous evidence? Did it look at just a small group of people? Were its findings weak (less than a doubling of risk)? Did it appear in a journal that failed to consult recognized experts in the field to evaluate the research? If so, don't rush to change your life based on its conclusions.  _ Beware of media hype. Newspaper editors jump on stories that make good headlines, and researchers may be guilty of ballyhooing the implications of their data.  ``If you can get recognition, it may help you acquire your next grant,'' says Dr. Matthew Longnecker of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.  Should you change your behavior based on an epidemiological study? That's tricky. When the risks are low and the potential benefits are great, making changes may be advisable.  Research consistently indicates, for instance, that vitamin E may help protect against heart attacks. It probably won't hurt to supplement your diet with the vitamin, because it has few side effects.  Above all, always try to put things in perspective. A number of studies have suggested, for example, a link between the weak electromagnetic fields emitted from high-voltage power lines and certain cancers. But the dangers (if any exist) are far less than the risk involved in, say, not wearing a seat belt.  ``People sometimes panic over risks that may be slight compared with the kind of risk they're taking driving their kids to the grocery store,'' says Sander Greenland, a professor of epidemiology at UCLA.  Take aim at the behaviors consistently shown to have the biggest impact on your health.  1. Don't smoke.  2. Eat a low-fat, primarily plant-based, high-fiber diet.  3. Stay trim, and exercise.  4. Try to avoid stress.  As Lynn Rosenberg, a professor of epidemiology at Boston University, puts it, ``The Greeks said `Moderation in all things.' They were probably right.'' -0- SIDEBAR: DOES REGULAR ASPIRIN USE REDUCE YOUR ODDS OF DEVELOPING COLON CANCER?  The study: An evaluation of 89,000 women, comparing rates of colorectal cancer in regular aspirin users with those of subjects who said they didn't use aspirin.  The results: Women who took four to six aspirin a week for at least 20 years had a significantly lower incidence of colon cancer than those who didn't.  The bottom line: The study is very convincing. It echoed a raft of other investigations, and research on rodents suggests that aspirin may inhibit an enzyme needed to synthesize chemicals that may stimulate tumor growth.  If you have a family history of colorectal cancer or polyps, or inflammatory-bowel disease, you may want to talk to your doctor about taking regular low doses of aspirin. -0- SIDEBAR: DOES A HIGH-FAT DIET INCREASE YOUR RISK OF BREAST CANCER?  The study: A review of seven studies that looked at the relationship between dietary fat and the odds of developing breast cancer among 338,000 mostly middle-aged women in four countries.  The results: The risk of breast cancer among the women with the leanest diets (with fat making up less than 20 percent of total calories) was no lower than the risk among those who splurged the most (with fat equal to or more than 45 percent of calories).  The bottom line: The connection between fat intake and breast cancer is unclear. On one hand, international studies comparing cultures with high- and low-fat diets indicate there is a connection.  Breast-cancer rates are low in Asian countries, for example, where diets are typically low in fat. But studies that evaluate the relationship between diet and breast cancer within cultures seem to contradict the idea.  So what should you conclude from the evidence so far? While fat consumption may not lead to breast cancer, you shouldn't take this study as license to indulge freely in rich foods.  Something researchers do know for sure is that a high-fat diet raises the risk of heart disease. -0- SIDEBAR: DOES LIGHT DRINKING HELP OR HURT YOUR HEALTH?  The study: An examination of alcohol consumption and mortality rates over 12 years in nearly 86,000 women, ages 34 to 59.  The result: Light to moderate drinkers (women who had less than half a drink to about two of them per day) as a group had a significantly lower death rate than those who drank heavily or not at all. The women who drank one to three drinks per week had the lowest death rate _ mostly because they suffered less cardiovascular disease. Those 50 or older benefited the most from light-to-moderate drinking, probably because they were at greater risk for heart problems.  Just a few weeks after the results of the first study were made public, however, a study of 16,000 women clouded the picture. It claimed that over a lifetime as little as one drink a day could raise a woman's risk of breast cancer by 40 percent, and two drinks a day could up the risk by 70 percent.  The bottom line: Light drinking appears to protect against heart disease but may raise your breast cancer risk.  According to Dr. Matthew Longnecker, an epidemiologist with the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, who conducted the breast-cancer study, if alcohol does play a role in causing breast cancer, it probably accounts for only 5 percent to 10 percent of all cases.  How should you balance alcohol's apparent ability to fight off heart disease with its possible increased risk for breast cancer? Your answer may hinge on your individual risk profile for each disease as well as on your vulnerability to alcoholism, which carries serious complications of its own.  Your physician can help you weigh all the risks and benefits.

Most couples occasionally experience sexual problems. And when things don't work in the bedroom, many women blame themselves or their relationships.  Yet sexual conundrums often have physical _ and treatable _ causes.  Two decades ago experts thought that up to 20 percent of sexual difficulties were physiological. Today most would put the figure at 40 percent to 50 percent,'' says Dr. Theresa Crenshaw, a San Diego sex therapist.  Unfortunately, embarrassment or fear may prevent some women from seeking help, and physical problems, if undiagnosed, can have psychological consequences.  ``It doesn't take long before an internal voice asks, `Am I going to have trouble?' whenever a woman has sex,'' says Dr. Judy Seifer, president of the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors and Therapists.  ``If her difficulties continue, she may avoid sex altogether.''  But this cycle can be prevented. The more a woman knows about sexual dysfunction, the less likely she will suffer in silence. Here's a look at the causes of some common problems and how they can be treated.  _ Medications.  ``Hundreds of prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs impair sexuality,'' notes Crenshaw, author of ``The Alchemy of Love and Lust'' (Putnam, 1996).  For example, most antidepressants, antianxiety and blood-pressure medications (particularly beta-blockers) can diminish sex drive. The antidepressant Prozac also delays sexual response time, making it difficult for many women to achieve an orgasm.  Birth-control pills that contain high levels of progesterone, which regulates the menstrual cycle, can depress desire and cause moodiness. In addition to clearing nasal passages, OTC antihistamines and decongestants may dry up vaginal secretions, making intercourse uncomfortable.  ``Luckily, there are alternatives for most of these drugs,'' Crenshaw says. Prozac can usually be replaced with bupropion or trazodone; an antianxiety drug with a lower dosage or a different medication; and a beta-blocker with an ACE inhibitor. The problem of a high-progesterone oral contraceptive can be solved by substituting a lower-dosage pill or another form of birth control.  A woman can stop using an antihistamine if possible, or try an OTC water soluble lubricant.  Before taking any medication, ask your doctor or pharmacist about its sexual side effects, or check the Physicians' Desk Reference (available at libraries).  Don't stop taking a prescription drug without consulting your doctor. You could trade one medical condition for another.  _ Hormones. Each month a woman's sexual responsiveness rises and falls depending on her hormonal levels.  Around ovulation many women may be more interested in sex due to a slight rise in testosterone, which fuels arousal. Following ovulation, progesterone levels increase and sex drive ebbs. Then, about two days before menstruation, progesterone production drops. Blood flow to the pelvic area increases, causing some women to feel more sexual.  After childbirth, fluctuating hormone levels can make sex uncomfortable or undermine desire. The stress of a new baby and the fatigue of midnight feedings, as well as conflicts a woman may have about her body, add to the problem.  Vaginal dryness may result when estrogen levels drop following delivery.  ``Because vaginal tissues are thinner and more delicate then, they get irritated or infected more frequently,'' Seifer says. An OTC lubricant can usually help.  If a woman nurses, the hormone prolactin, which stimulates milk secretion, inhibits estrogen and testosterone production.  ``Almost all new mothers experience reduced sex drive,'' Seifer says. ``But doctors rarely warn them. It's a tragedy, because if a woman talks to her husband about it beforehand, misunderstandings can be avoided.''  What many women don't realize, Crenshaw adds, is that having sex, even if they're not in the mood, may help.  ``This isn't just for your partner's sake,'' she says. ``You also benefit from touch and tenderness and bonding.  _ Discomfort.  ``Painful intercourse may be a symptom, and should be checked by a doctor,'' Seifer says.  Some women may develop vaginal irritation or burning because they have an allergic reaction to the latex or lubricants used in condoms or the chemicals found in spermicidal jellies. Symptoms are eased by using a different product.  Most women who undergo an episiotomy do not experience problems after the usual healing period of six weeks. With the resumption of sexual relations, though, many women may have tenderness due to vaginal dryness.  Consult your doctor if discomfort persists. In rare instances, scar tissue can form around an incision and may need to be surgically removed.  Other conditions that can cause discomfort include vaginal and urinary-tract infections; vaginismus (involuntary tightening of the vaginal walls); infections of the ovaries, fallopian tubes or cervix; fibroids (tumors of the uterus); endometriosis (inflammation of the uterine tissue) and vulvodynia (chronic burning of the vulva).  Proper treatment can help alleviate each problem.  _ Fatigue.  ``It's normal to be uninterested in sex when you are exhausted,'' says Dr. Domeena Renshaw, director of the Loyola Sex Therapy Clinic in Chicago.  Some causes of fatigue, such as middle-of-the-night feedings and juggling the demands of family and career, cannot be easily resolved. But you can try to reduce whatever stress these responsibilities trigger.  Renshaw, author of ``Seven Weeks to Better Sex'' (Random House, 1995), suggests that you schedule private time to relax and fantasize: Soak in a bath, practice meditation or yoga, take a nap when your kids do or close your office door for 10 minutes and put your feet up.  Regular exercise also helps. ``It tones you and improves your self-confidence and your body image, which makes you feel more sexual,'' Renshaw says.  Do some aerobic activity _ walking, jogging, swimming _ for at least 30 minutes a day, three or four times a week.  And yes, you've heard it before: Take time off as a couple. If you and your spouse can't vacation without the children, organize a baby sitting pool so you can slip out to a movie or take a long walk holding hands.  Through awareness, medical attention and communication with their partners, women can avoid any psychic damage that might be caused by sexual dysfunction.  ``If a woman deals with a physical problem before it becomes an emotional one,'' Seifer says, ``she's so much better off.''

BRECHER c.1996 Smartkid (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  What did you do in the war, Daddy?  In the 1950s, a kid would pause one day from rerouting his Lionel trains or diapering her Betsy Wetsy to pose the question. And Daddy then might talk about a place called the Bulge, an outfit called the Flying Tigers or a job called KP.  In the '90s, a kid is likely to pause one day from slaughtering his Mortal Kombat enemies or preening her Baywatch Barbie and query the boomer parent: What did you do in the '60s?  ``Well ... drugs,'' is what you might say if you were honest about it. You'd talk about a place called Woodstock, a man named Timothy Leary or a concept known as free love.  But that's a big ``if'' for Boomer parents, who'd sooner relive the Nixon presidency than admit to their kids that they ever got high. According to The Partnership for a Drug Free America, 4 million Americans tried drugs by 1962. By 1985, the number had risen to 75 million.  Brian and Margie, late-30's ad executives from Southern California, are among those drug-dabbling millions. And as parents of an 8-year-old, they say drugs are ``the only thing we're ever going to lie to her about.''  Ask them why and they squirm.  ``I think that in our day, drugs were fairly natural,'' Margie says, ``and we know that if you smoke a few joints, it's not going to kill you. But our parents thought if you did that, you were addicted.''  Still, they worry that Nicole might interpret their confessions as an endorsement, which is the last message they want to send during an age when drugs seem to be getting less ``natural'' and more dangerous all the time.  And it seems much harder for Boomer parents to face their own Prozac-popping generation's contradictions on the subject of drugs than it was for '50s parents to preach the evils of tobacco while blowing Pall Mall fumes in their kids' faces. After all, what were the '60s about, if not rebelling against hypocrisy?  Granted, the Boomers' progression from LSD to MBA belies the scare tactics of the just-say-no shock troops. Their relative sanity and success is living proof that some drugs, at least, don't turn your brain into a fried egg. But the world has changed, and so have drugs (the '60s were not about crack).  Certain household and automotive products have given new meaning to the term ``mind-altering substance.'' Kids are ``huffing'' Freon, gasoline and other chemicals that have about the same effect on the cerebral cortex as the ebola virus. It's estimated that one-third of all American adolescents will use alcohol or illegal substances at least once this year.  A recent University of Michigan study says the use of marijuana by eighth graders zoomed from 6 percent in 1991 to 16 percent in 1995. Fifteen percent of 10th-graders were smoking pot in 1992; today it's 29 percent.  Now add these scary statistics from a Partnership for a Drug Free America print ad: ``135,000 guns go to school every day. Violence takes the lives of nine teenagers a day. AIDS among teenagers increased 214 percent last year. Sixty percent of all rape victims are under 18. The '90s are not the '60s. There's no such thing as a harmless drug in a world this dangerous.''  Indeed, you'd be downright irresponsible as a parent not to take it all seriously. Even Boomers who still enjoy an occasional joint realize that.  ``I think it's right to emphasize the dangers of truly dangerous drugs,'' says Annette, an office manager from Tucson, Ariz., ``but don't lump pot in with them.''  She and her husband, Ron, an antiques dealer, still smoke, and their daughters, who are 12 and 16, know it.  ``I'll sneak outside for a puff, wash my hands, eat a Certs, and my daughter will still bust me. But it's not a big deal anymore,'' Ron says.  ``They've been brainwashed through school about how horrible pot is. They were concerned that their family unity was in jeopardy. We told them pot is probably not as bad as alcohol, but as a kid you shouldn't do either. I told them it's hyped up probably for good reason: to discourage kids, because it confuses you and is not conducive to school work.''  Annette adds: ``If they came home stoned, I'd punish them on the basis of them being too young to experiment. A lot of our friends are horrified that we don't care if our kids know we smoke pot. It's best to come clean.''  There may even be a psychological advantage to fessing up, because kids are likely to discover at some point if you've been lying, says Fort Lauderdale public defender Howard Finkelstein.  He should know. Before he became a local celebrity as O.J. Simpson-trial on-air analyst for a South Florida television station, Finkelstein earned another kind of notoriety: He was busted in 1987 for using crack and received probation.  Daughters Sarai, 8, and Shayna, 3, don't know about that. Yet. ``I fell very low and very hard,'' admits Finkelstein, 43. ``I can show them a booking photo and newspaper articles, wherein their father lost almost everything.''  The fundamental issue for most parents ``is whether they're absolute on the question of no use,'' says Mathea Falco. A member of the Harvard University Board of Overseers, she runs an organization called Drug Strategies, which issues a consumer guide to drug education programs and promotes more-effective strategies to the drug problem.  She and husband Peter Tarnoff, undersecretary of state for political affairs, have a 10-year-old son. They have staked out an absolutist position: no drugs, no alcohol.  ``Even parents who didn't do drugs are ambivalent,'' Falco says. ``They are very reluctant to take clear stands. It has to do with the larger questions of values, and are we willing to stand up for what is right and wrong, and you need to know the difference.''  Hysteria won't be any more effective on your kids than Reefer Madness was on you. ```Just say no' oversimplifies reality,'' says Rick Evans, executive director of the National Family Partnership, a St. Louis-based nonprofit substance-abuse education/prevention network. ``Just say something.''  At the very least, point out that drugs are against the law.  ``If you're asked, `Why was it okay for you, but it isn't okay for me?' you can say it was unwise, and `I wish now I hadn't done it,''' Evans advises.  The issue is not whether children will drink or do drugs to occasional excess, write Stanton Peele and Archie Brodsky in ``The Truth About Addiction and Recovery'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1991), but ``whether their lives are about something more than that.'' Most children who use drugs do so casually, they write, ``and ultimately reject drug experimentation, simply because they grow up and have better ways to spend time, and because they have more to lose than to gain from drug use.''  You hardly have to wait for a personal crisis to bring up the subject.  ``Something happens in school and they bring the (sniffer) dogs in, or you see something on TV, or Jerry Garcia dies. There are a million ways to talk about it. It doesn't need to be a big lecture kind of thing,'' Evans notes.  Studies show that many kids don't want to do drugs, he adds, ``and when their parents set the standard, it gives them an excuse not to.  ``A child can say, `If I smoke pot, I'll be grounded till I'm 40.'' -0- SIDEBAR: EXPERT ADVICE  There's plenty of help and sound advice out there for parents who need tips on how to approach the subject of drugs with their kids. It's really up to you and that includes setting the example.  Experts say: ``Communication needs to be on a regular basis. It can't be treated as an inoculation, something you do on an as-need basis. Neither sex nor drugs is like that. The message needs constant reinforcement. They need to hear it as children, teenagers and young adults.' _ Doug Hall, vice president of the National Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education (PRIDE).  ``Positive peer pressure works. It's not hip and all kids are not doing it. It's a big misconception that they all are ... Give them decision-making skills, conflict-resolution skills, so when they have to make that decision, they feel comfortable saying no.'' _ Phil Clark, program director, Greenville County, S.C., Leaders Against Drugs.  ``However you get into the subject, it's important to state exactly how you feel about it. Not in threatening tones, but in matter-of-fact, unmistakably clear language ... Don't do all the talking ... Don't threaten. Don't badger. Don't put your kid on the spot by asking directly if he or she has ever tried drugs. They'll probably lie, which undermines your whole conversation.'' _ Partnership for a Drug Free America.  ``What do you tell your kids when they ask about your own drug- taking activities? If they don't ask, don't tell them ... As your children's most important role models, you gain nothing by volunteering the information that you were a drug freak in college.  ``If they do ask, there is certainly no need to elaborate ... If you tried marijuana, you can simply say that, even if you smoked it every day.'' _ Dr. Victor Strasburger in ``Getting Your Kids to Say `No' in the '90s When You Said `Yes' in the '60s'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1993). -0- SIDEBAR: RESOURCES  _ Drug Strategies, 2445 M St. N.W.

Until about 20 years ago, most doctors and nutrition experts believed that, except for true food allergies that provoked immediate reactions, as long as food items were part of a balanced diet, they couldn't be harmful.  But, as Jonathan Brostoff, director of the Allergy Clinic at Middlesex Hospital in London and co-author (with Linda Gamlin) of ``The Complete Guide to Food Allergy and Intolerance'' (Crown, 1989), notes, ``We must remember that no one designed foods for human consumption.''  ``Our foods come from a pool of wild plants and animals that were domesticated by early farmers only 5,000 to 10,000 years ago, a blink of the eye in evolutionary terms,'' he says.  In general, common foods _ wheat, milk, corn and eggs _ are the most problematic. In recent years, as Asian foods and vegetarianism have become more popular, an increasing number of people are turning up with reactions to soy.  Many people still use the term food allergy to describe these reactions, but increasingly, these problems are called food intolerances or sensitivities. No one knows how many people have food intolerances, but Brostoff estimates about 10 percent.  Initially, symptoms tend to be minor, but they grow more severe as time passes and may be provoked by an increasing number of foods.  Often people don't even notice their symptoms for several years. Over time, they simply experience a slow decline in health and vitality and report vague, nonspecific symptoms that some mainstream physicians dismiss as ``neurotic.''  Possible symptoms of food intolerance include indigestion, mouth sores, diarrhea, constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, bloating, flatulence, muscle and/or joint pain, headaches, mental fogginess and fatigue.  Some people with food sensitivities find they must eliminate the offending items completely to remain symptom-free. Others find that after six months or so, they can eat foods to which they are sensitive occasionally without ill effects or with minor effects.  And some people find that they can keep their symptoms under control by using a ``rotation diet,'' eating any given food item only once every four or five days.  Here are some elimination diet suggestions for common food sensitivities. ELIMINATION DIET FOR LACTOSE INTOLERANCE  Lactose is the milk sugar found in all dairy products. People with lactose intolerance have difficulty digesting it and experience stomach upset, diarrhea, gas and abdominal cramps.  Nursing mammals produce an enzyme _ lactase _ that allows them to digest mothers' milk. After weaning, most mammals never drink milk again, and they lose the ability to produce lactase. Many humans also stop making lactase but continue to drink milk and consume dairy products throughout life. The result is lactose intolerance.  ``Lactose intolerance is most common among African Americans and Asians, but many adolescents and adults of all races experience some degree of this problem, which usually remains unsuspected, undiagnosed and untreated,'' says Anne Simons, assistant clinical professor of family and community medicine at the University of California's San Francisco Medical Center.  In addition to milk, yogurt, cheeses and ice cream, avoid milk solids and whey. (You'll have to read food labels carefully.) If you feel noticeably better, chances are you're lactose intolerant. Doctors can also test for lactose intolerance.  If you're sensitive to lactose, you have several choices.  _ You can refrain completely from eating dairy foods.  _ You can try to eat yogurt, buttermilk and hard cheeses. Many people with lactose intolerance can consume these cultured-milk products without triggering symptoms.  _ You can buy milk and dairy products with added lactase. These products have become more widely available as lactose intolerance has been publicized. You can add your own lactase to milk using the over-the-counter lactase supplement Lactaid, which is available at pharmacies.  _ You can use soy milk instead of cow's milk. Just don't try to use goat's milk; it also contains lactose, so it won't help the problem.  If you eliminate dairy products, be sure to get enough calcium by eating lots of low-fat cultured-milk dairy products and other foods rich in calcium: canned salmon, green leafy vegetables and tofu. You might also take a calcium supplement. ELIMINATION DIET FOR MSG INTOLERANCE  In 1968, a letter to the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine reported the occurrence of ``two hours of numbness, weakness and heart palpitations'' after eating at a Chinese restaurant. The doctor-correspondent speculated that the cause was the food additive used in many Asian cuisines, monosodium glutamate (MSG).  The wire services picked up the story, and newspapers from coast to coast warned of ``Chinese restaurant syndrome.'' As medical reports of MSG reactions multiplied, new symptoms joined the list: headache, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, depression, insomnia, rashes, rapid heartbeat, irregular heartbeat, mood swings, tremors and shortness of breath.  Some people react immediately, while others develop symptoms up to 48 hours after consuming MSG.  Today many Chinese restaurants advertise ``No MSG.'' ``But Chinese restaurants are just the tip of the MSG iceberg,'' says Dr. George R. Schwartz, a Santa Fe, N.M., specialist in emergency medicine and toxicology and author of ``In Bad Taste: The MSG Syndrome'' (HealthPress, 1988).  ``More than 250 supermarket items contain MSG: Ac'cent, Lawry's Seasoned Salt, many condiments and most soup mixes, TV dinners and prepared dishes. And you'd be hard-pressed to find an airplane or fast food meal without it.''  To avoid MSG reactions, eliminate it from your diet.  ``Unfortunately, that's easier said than done,'' Schwartz says. ``Food labels do not necessarily list it. Instead, they might list `textured protein,' `hydrolyzed protein,' `hydrolyzed vegetable protein,' `yeast food,' `sodium or calcium caseinate' or `natural flavors,' all of which contain significant amounts of MSG.  ``And watch out for any foods that come with `flavor packets.' They usually contain MSG.''  A study by Harvard researchers suggested that about 30 percent of Americans develop reactions to 5 grams of MSG, while 90 percent react to 10 grams. (One teaspoon of Ac'cent contains about 6 grams.)  If you're MSG-sensitive, you can avoid it by eating a diet based on whole grains and fresh fruits and vegetables. Read labels carefully and avoid processed foods and fast foods. When planning to dine at Asian restaurants, call first and ask if they use MSG.  Many people who react to MSG are also sensitive to aspartic acid, an ingredient in the artificial sweetener NutraSweet and in Equal, the sugar substitute that contains NutraSweet. Try eliminating NutraSweet and see how you feel. ELIMINATION DIET FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS  Until the mid-1980s, conventional medical wisdom held that diet had nothing to do with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the most crippling form of joint inflammation, which affects more than 2 million Americans. Then reports began appearing that dietary changes relieved some pain and swelling in some people with RA.  Researchers are not sure why dietary changes relieve the symptoms of RA _ and the more common osteoarthritis, which affects more than 16 million Americans. Some say that a high-fat diet increases levels of stimulatory prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that trigger inflammation.  Others contend that people with arthritis are sensitive to certain foods, specifically plants of the nightshade family: tomatoes, eggplant, white potatoes and peppers (except the spices black and white pepper).  And some assert that cooking robs foods of as-yet-undetermined constituents that protect the joints of sensitive individuals.  The debate over why dietary changes relieve arthritis symptoms will no doubt rage for years. But if you have arthritis, try reducing your fat intake. It might also help to cut out nightshade foods and eat more fresh, raw fruits and vegetables.  Other studies suggest that taking about a tablespoon a day of olive oil, fish oil (which contains omega-3 fatty acids) or evening primrose oil (gamma-linoleic acid) also helps relieve arthritis symptoms after a period of about six months.

Includes a color slide of an enormous explosion in a scene from ``Dante's Peak.'' By CINDY PEARLMAN World rights except Chicago (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Not since the days of Job has mankind been in such peril.  Record numbers of tornadoes, floods, fires, earthquakes, volcanoes and even plummeting asteroids are predicted in 1997, all at a theater near you.  Yes, once again Hollywood is flirting with disaster.  It was inevitable, once ``Twister'' (1996) sucked up $240 million at the box office. It was immediate, once ``Independence Day'' (1996), with its panoramas of mass devastation, fought back with a gross of $307 million.  Now, it's hard to keep track of them all.  + ``Dante's Peak,'' opening Feb. 7, stars Linda Hamilton and Pierce Brosnan. He's a hunky volcanologist, she's the mayor of a small Northwestern town who won't believe that a volcanic eruption is imminent. Three guesses who's right?  + ``Volcano,'' due sometime this spring, pits Tommy Lee Jones against another volcano, this one laying waste to Los Angeles.  + On the home screen, ABC will present the two-hour ``Volcano: Fire On the Mountain'' on Feb. 23, with Dan Cortese and Cynthia Gibb facing a long-dormant volcano that presumably won't stay that way, plus an earthquake for good measure.  + NBC's ``Asteroid,'' airing on Feb. 16 and 17, has Michael Biehn and Anne Marie Johnson keeping one eye skyward as they wonder what to do about an asteroid that threatens to crush Dallas.  + More space-borne threats loom in ``Deep Impact,'' Dreamworks SKG's comet movie now in production.  + The title of ``Flood,'' a May release starring Christian Slater and Morgan Freeman, is fairly self-explanatory. Think of it as ``Waterworld'' in street clothes.  + ``Firestorm,'' due this autumn, casts former football star Howie Long as a cop trapped with some convicts amid an enormous forest fire.  All in all, 1970s disaster king Irwin Allen would be proud. Things have gotten so busy that the Federal Emergency Management Agency recently hired a disaster-movie technical consultant.  ``We were getting so many requests from movie companies to come to their sets that it was getting ridiculous,'' says Morrie Goodman, the agency's director of communications and a consultant on ``Asteroid'' and ``Volcano.'' ``You know, we have real-life disasters that also need our attention.''  So why does on-screen disaster suddenly seem so lucrative?  ``We're all looking for a ride,'' says Sam Nicholson, visual-effects supervisor on ``Asteroid.'' ``These films are pure escapism.''  ``Our lives are so predictable and safe. We're bored,'' Northwestern University sociologist Bernard Beck says.  ``Look at the audience for these movies,'' he adds. ``It's mostly younger people and singles. These people live placid lives and they're looking for a thrill. And what can it hurt if someone sits through a disaster movie and thinks, `It's out there. This could really happen to me _ although it's unlikely. But it could happen.'''  Could it? Some of the disaster scenarios are more likely than others, Goodman says. ``Twister,'' for example, was fairly plausible if not entirely realistic.  ``Oh my gosh, yes,'' he says. ``There are conditions where dozens of tornadoes are sighted in one day. We flew a helicopter over Northern Florida once during a flood and saw one funnel cloud after another.''  The odds against alien invasions are hard to quantify, but ``Asteroid's'' scenario may be more likely.  ``The chances of dying from a meteor impact are six times greater than dying in a plane crash,'' a NASA spokesperson says. ``But, on the other hand, there is no record of any human who has died as the result of asteroid impact.''  What about volcanoes?  ``Dante's Peak reminds me of Mount St. Helen's. The movie is plausible because the plot is in the Pacific Northwest, where a large volcano is the backdrop for many a community,'' says Brantley Stevens, a public-information officer for the U.S. Geological Survey.  ``But `Volcano' is a different story. There is no volcanic activity in Los Angeles,'' he adds. ``Plus I saw a preview of `Volcano' where lava is flowing down major L.A. intersections. Lava does not travel terribly fast unless on a steep slope.  ``So I'd say downtown L.A. is safe,'' Stevens says with a chuckle. ``At least for a few million years.''  There are plenty of other hazards in California, however, and ``Independence Day'' producer/writer Dean Devlin thinks that this may explain the disaster-movie revival.  ``I think it's really just a reflection of what's going on in the world,'' he says. ``Los Angeles is like a real-life disaster zone with fires, earthquakes, floods and mudslides. It's like Hollywood has been taking notes for future scripts.''  ``Or it could be a solution to Hollywood's very real problem of finding a bad guy,'' ``Independence Day'' director Roland Emmerich suggests.  ``It's politically incorrect these days to use any kind of nationality or race as the face of evil,'' he explains. ``Mother Nature and aliens are bad and, face it, they don't offend anyone.''  The basic esthetic of disaster movies hasn't changed since the last disaster boom in the 1970s. They may cost more and flash slicker special effects, but the formula remains the same.  Take a high-concept disaster. Mix in state-of-the-art special effects. Add B-list stars such as ``Twister's'' Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton, ``Independence Day's'' Bill Pullman or ``Volcano's'' Anne Heche. Mix well, add publicity and _ hopefully _ count megadollar grosses.  In fact, the new disaster movies could almost be remakes of the old disaster movies. The recent ``Turbulence'' was a not-so-subtle spin on ``Airport'' (1970). James Cameron's upcoming ``Titanic'' is a historically authentic ``The Poseidon Adventure'' (1972). ``Volcano'' and ``Dante's Peak'' are riffs on Allen's ``When Time Ran Out'' (1980). ``Asteroid'' and ``Deep Impact'' sound suspiciously like ``Meteor'' (1979).  As for ``Flood,'' only the punctuation seems to set it apart from Allen's ``Flood!'' (1976).  Nor do disaster movies demand big bucks for scripts. In ``Twister,'' someone actually condemns the villain by gasping, ``He's in it for the money, not the science!''  In lieu of top actors or fresh dialogue, of course, the new disaster epics rely on special effects, with each film striving to top the last.  ``Every film has to be bigger and better,'' ``Twister'' director Jan DeBont says, ``which is code for more expensive,''  Today, amateurish miniature shots are out, and integrated computer imagery and robotics _ combined with new, high-tech miniatures, of course _ are in.  ``Independence Day'' cost $75 million to make, almost a bargain given its 500 visual-effects shots requiring 6,000 model and computer setups. ``Twister'' was a virtual steal at $45 million, because 22 minutes of the film _ including even the flying cow _ were done on computer.  By contrast, ``Dante's Peak'' cost between $100 million and $120 million, according to star Pierce Brosnan. ``Asteroid,'' at $19 million, would be cheap for a movie, but as television budgets go, it's staggering.  ``Volcano'' won't be cheap either. The filmmakers bought an old Hughes Aircraft airplane hangar, erected an exact, full-size replica of five square blocks of Los Angeles streets _ and then destroyed it.  Even volcanic ash isn't cheap, though someday it might have been even more expensive: The ash was created from surplus baseball cards, shredded and delivered in 100-ton packages.  ``The cards go quickly, because they're immediately placed in big pipes that blow the stuff and fire everywhere. It's quite a spectacle,'' Goodman says.  Aircraft hangars must be in demand. For ``Flood,'' one was purchased and outfitted with a 5-foot metal wall holding back 5 million gallons of water.  With budgets running so high, of course, the pressure is on to bring in the crowds. ``Flood's'' producers must be nervously eyeing returns from Sylvester Stallone's ``Daylight'' (1996), a similarly waterlogged film that took in a meager $29 million at the box office.  Now, in Hollywood, that's a real disaster. c.1997 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Amy Irving in a scene from ``Three Sisters.'' By JERRY TALLMER (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  The brief program bio for Amy Irving in ``Three Sisters,'' the classic Anton Chekhov play now running at Broadway's Roundabout Theatre, lists 15 movies she's been in.  They include her debut in ``Carrie'' (1976) and as 1/3 of a bigamous marriage with Dudley Moore and Ann Reinking in ``Micki &AMP; Maude'' (1984). And of course there's Barbra Streisand's ``Yentl'' (1983), in which she portrayed a girl who falls in love with disguised-as-a-boy Streisand, and earned an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress.  Even now, 13 years later, it's probably the role the public most associates her with _ that and the yuppie Jewish woman wooed by a tender pickle merchant in ``Crossing Delancey'' (1988).  In a less-known, more-against-type role, she provided the singing voice for the ultra-sexy Jessica Rabbit in ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'' (1988) _ an odd case of double-dubbing, since she was singing for Kathleen Turner, who provided Jessica's slinky speaking voice.  But though the world may see Irving as a just-under-the-first-rank movie star, it's not how she sees herself.  ``I don't think of myself as a movie actress,'' says the fine-lined beauty who plays Olga, the self-sacrificing schoolteacher, opposite two other actresses with solid Hollywood credentials _ Jeanne Tripplehorn as the tempestuous Masha, and Lili Taylor as idealistic, supersensitive Irina.  ``We're all theater-trained actresses,'' Irving says during an interview in her dressing room at the Roundabout, a couple of hours before a performance. ``For me, it's not the celebrity that's doing it here,'' she says. ``It's the talent in the room.''  She pauses. ``But it is a pretty interesting marquee,'' she admits with a smile.  Irving's stage credentials are certainly impeccable, beginning with her drama-school days at San Francisco's American Conservatory Theatre and at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.  Since then, she's appeared in numerous plays in New York and elsewhere, from Bernard Shaw's ``Heartbreak House'' to Arthur Miller's ``Broken Glass'' and Athol Fugard's ``The Road to Mecca.''  The latter two represented the works' New York premieres, and Irving's performance as a young Englishwoman in ``Road to Mecca'' earned her an Obie Award, Off-Broadway's equivalent of the Tony or Oscar.  Chekhov seems to fit right in with her past history of great playwrights such as Shaw, Miller and Fugard.  ``It takes a damn good playwright to bring me to New York,'' Irving says with a laugh, her blue eyes bright behind the smart new twin-headlight glasses she's recently acquired to remedy her newly diagnosed far-sightedness.  Actually, her Broadway engagement is particularly convenient for Irving, who now lives on Manhattan's Upper West Side with her second husband, director Bruno Baretto, and their two children _ 11-year-old Max Spielberg, her son by first husband Steven Spielberg, and Baretto's 6-year-old son, Gabriel.  ``I can walk to work,'' she says.  Previously, Irving lived in Los Angeles, a town not noted for its theatrical life. She did a lot of theater there, she says, but didn't much like it.  ``A long drive to the theater, a long drive home after the show,'' she recalls. ``There's no theater community out there, no people talking about theater all around you. None of the theatrical energy of New York.''  Irving met Baretto in 1993, when he directed her in ``Benefit of the Doubt.'' Like her first husband, the acclaimed director of ``E.T.'' and ``Schindler's List,'' the Brazilian Baretto is a respected director, most noted for his 1978 film, ``Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands'' and, more recently, ``Carried Away'' (1996), in which Irving co-starred with Dennis Hopper.  It's no accident that both her husbands have been directors, Irving admits.  ``I'm a textbook lover of directors,'' she says.  The first director in her life, and probably the most influential, was her father, Jules Irving. Founder of the San Francisco Actor's Workshop, he was also co-director of New York's Repertory Theatre of Lincoln Center for eight turbulent years starting in 1965, when Amy was 9.  Irving takes a framed oval photograph from her makeup shelf.  ``My parents in `The Playboy of the Western World' in San Francisco,'' she says.  It's a lovely photo _ Jules Irving and Priscilla Pointer, locked in one another's embrace, way back when. The man in the photo looks barely 16.  ``He always looked like a baby,'' his daughter says with a smile.  Jules Irving died in 1979, but Pointer, who has since married actor/director Robert Symonds, remains active. Currently, Irving says, her mother is in Los Angeles, ``rehearsing for some Israel Horowitz plays.'' Pointer can also be glimpsed as a visiting aunt in ``Carried Away.''  In fact, it was Pointer who provided Irving's first encounter with ``Three Sisters,'' which is being performed at the Roundabout in a new translation by Lanford Wilson.  ``I saw my mother play Masha when I was 6,'' Irving says. ``If she were here now, she'd be giving me notes. When I did Masha at Williamstown (Mass.) nine years ago, she gave me a lot of notes.''  Yes, Irving wasn't always Olga. In fact, she's also played Irina, back in her San Francisco days at ACT. Call it a Chekhovian hat trick.  ``Well, it's my favorite play,'' she says. ``When I heard they were doing `Three Sisters' at the Roundabout, I let them know I was interested, and they invited me.''  Near the picture of her parents on Irving's makeup table stands a framed passage about the play, from a piece by Russian author Maxim Gorki:  ``Next to her stands the sad figure of Olga from `Three Sisters.' She also loves deeply and submits without a murmur to the whims of the base, dissolute wife of her idle brother. She watches the lives of her sisters being destroyed before her eyes, and she weeps, unable to help anyone, totally incapable of a single living powerful word of protest.''  Irving finds the passage helpful in playing the role, she says.  ``It drops seeds into my body,'' she explains, ``helps me realize why I can't do certain things. It ties back the Amy in me and lets Olga come out,''  Next up for Irving, she says, is more Chekhov _ ``The Sea Gull,'' often considered the Russian playwright's greatest work.  ``Not that I'm only going to do Chekhov,'' she says.  Indeed, her next job will take her back onto the big screen. During an off day at the Roundabout, she plans to fly to California to shoot a bit part _ ``a tough FBI agent,'' she says _ in Baretto's next film, ``One Tough Cop.''  Already in the can is a small role in Woody Allen's next film, ``Deconstructing Henry.'' It's not a major part, she says wryly.  ``There's like 8,000 people in it,'' she explains. ``I play his third wife.''  In the meantime, though, it's Chekhov on Broadway. The noted light comedienne Amy Irving, seasoned veteran of Hollywood glamor, the woman who once married Barbra Streisand onscreen and Steven Spielberg offscreen, is doing angst-ridden Russian theater.  And she couldn't be happier. c.1997 Jerry Tallmer  (Jerry Tallmer is a New York-based free-lance writer.)

By Madeline Drexler c.1997 McCall's (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  You remember the news-breaking stories with their confident claims: ``A Drink a Day Keeps the Doctor Away,'' ``Fatty Diets: No Link to Breast Cancer,'' ``Aspirin Seen to Halt Colon Cancer.''  All three of these bulletins were trumpeted in the media adding more do's and don'ts to the avalanche of advice about staying healthy.  But should we always trust the latest headlines? It wasn't long ago, after all, that oat bran was a magic bullet, beta-carotene was an all-purpose cancer fighter and Alar was the scourge of apple-eating children.  Then, just when we'd altered our habits to respond to the news, science changed its mind. The oat-bran data were suddenly unconvincing; a group of Finnish smokers who took beta-carotene supplements were found to have an increased lung-cancer risk; ingesting Alar turned out to be far less risky than driving longer distances to buy organic apples.  Fortunately, there are ways to separate the studies you should believe from those that aren't worth the paper they're printed on. Follow these guidelines and you'll know when to change your behavior in response to the latest findings _ and when not to give up something you love after all. SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH: EXAMINING IT UNDER A MICROSCOPE  What we know about lowering our risk for disease comes from different kinds of research. One type, animal studies, can hint at the biological reasons some substances are potential health hazards.  But animal biology doesn't always match human biology. For instance, while asbestos fibers wreak havoc in human lungs, they barely affect lung tissue in mice. So, in general, when you read that something produces illness in animals, don't automatically assume it's bad for you too.  In order to study health dangers in humans, experts turn to epidemiology, which looks at the incidence and distribution of disease within groups of people. Many attention-grabbing headlines are based on this kind of study.  Epidemiology has taught us important lessons over the years: that smoking drastically raises the risk of lung cancer; that a fatty diet promotes heart disease; that sun worship destroys skin.  But not all findings are equally clear. In fact, the science of epidemiology is riddled with problems. Take the phenomenon known as the confounding factor, a hidden cause and effect that explains a study's outcome.  One example: While some studies suggest a low-fat diet protects against cancer, the people who eat wholesome foods are also more apt than others to practice healthy behaviors, such as daily exercise. So maybe it's these factors, instead of a specific diet, that are responsible for the protection.  Certain epidemiological studies, particularly retrospective studies (which look back on habits and exposures of a diseased group and compare them with those of a healthy group), have another flaw: It's called the recall bias _ the perfectly human tendency to forget or fudge the facts.  Volunteers are notorious for not accurately reporting their eating habits. A study may also be biased if the group being tested is not representative. This is the complaint, of course, against the vast bulk of research, which has looked only at men.  Yet another problem with epidemiological studies is that they rarely point to a specific trigger for disease. For instance, while air pollution is clearly harmful, researchers aren't sure exactly which component in foul air hurts us.  One way to overcome these uncertainties is with very striking increases in risk. In the case of smoking, for instance, epidemiological studies have found that a daily pack of cigarettes boosts your risk of lung cancer about 1,000 to 2,000 percent. Put another way, a smoker's chances of getting lung cancer are about 10 to 20 times that of a nonsmoker!  However, most epidemiological studies result in less persuasive numbers. A 50 percent increased risk may sound like a lot, but what it means is that your odds of contracting a condition are 1.5 times what they would normally be if you hadn't had the exposure in question.  If your chances of getting a disease were only one in 1,000 to begin with, a 50 percent increase merely raises your risk to 1.5 in 1,000.  Epidemiologists say that any study showing less than a doubled increase in risk is unconvincing, unless the result has been borne out repeatedly before. It also helps if animal studies offer a biological explanation for the results and if there's a dose-response relationship, meaning greater exposure leads to higher risk. HOW TO MAKE SENSE OF THE NEWS  _ Remember that no single study is the final word. Science builds on itself bit by bit, disregarding certain ideas while reinforcing others. Think of individual studies as snapshots in scientific time, moments in an onslaught of facts and theories.  ``If it's a brand-new finding, wait and see what other people conclude,'' says Dr. Clark Heath, vice president for epidemiology and surveillance research at the American Cancer Society.  _ Place the study in context. Did it contradict a massive body of previous evidence? Did it look at just a small group of people? Were its findings weak (less than a doubling of risk)? Did it appear in a journal that failed to consult recognized experts in the field to evaluate the research? If so, don't rush to change your life based on its conclusions.  _ Beware of media hype. Newspaper editors jump on stories that make good headlines, and researchers may be guilty of ballyhooing the implications of their data.  ``If you can get recognition, it may help you acquire your next grant,'' says Dr. Matthew Longnecker of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.  Should you change your behavior based on an epidemiological study? That's tricky. When the risks are low and the potential benefits are great, making changes may be advisable.  Research consistently indicates, for instance, that vitamin E may help protect against heart attacks. It probably won't hurt to supplement your diet with the vitamin, because it has few side effects.  Above all, always try to put things in perspective. A number of studies have suggested, for example, a link between the weak electromagnetic fields emitted from high-voltage power lines and certain cancers. But the dangers (if any exist) are far less than the risk involved in, say, not wearing a seat belt.  ``People sometimes panic over risks that may be slight compared with the kind of risk they're taking driving their kids to the grocery store,'' says Sander Greenland, a professor of epidemiology at UCLA.  Take aim at the behaviors consistently shown to have the biggest impact on your health.  1. Don't smoke.  2. Eat a low-fat, primarily plant-based, high-fiber diet.  3. Stay trim, and exercise.  4. Try to avoid stress.  As Lynn Rosenberg, a professor of epidemiology at Boston University, puts it, ``The Greeks said `Moderation in all things.' They were probably right.'' -0- SIDEBAR: DOES REGULAR ASPIRIN USE REDUCE YOUR ODDS OF DEVELOPING COLON CANCER?  The study: An evaluation of 89,000 women, comparing rates of colorectal cancer in regular aspirin users with those of subjects who said they didn't use aspirin.  The results: Women who took four to six aspirin a week for at least 20 years had a significantly lower incidence of colon cancer than those who didn't.  The bottom line: The study is very convincing. It echoed a raft of other investigations, and research on rodents suggests that aspirin may inhibit an enzyme needed to synthesize chemicals that may stimulate tumor growth.  If you have a family history of colorectal cancer or polyps, or inflammatory-bowel disease, you may want to talk to your doctor about taking regular low doses of aspirin. -0- SIDEBAR: DOES A HIGH-FAT DIET INCREASE YOUR RISK OF BREAST CANCER?  The study: A review of seven studies that looked at the relationship between dietary fat and the odds of developing breast cancer among 338,000 mostly middle-aged women in four countries.  The results: The risk of breast cancer among the women with the leanest diets (with fat making up less than 20 percent of total calories) was no lower than the risk among those who splurged the most (with fat equal to or more than 45 percent of calories).  The bottom line: The connection between fat intake and breast cancer is unclear. On one hand, international studies comparing cultures with high- and low-fat diets indicate there is a connection.  Breast-cancer rates are low in Asian countries, for example, where diets are typically low in fat. But studies that evaluate the relationship between diet and breast cancer within cultures seem to contradict the idea.  So what should you conclude from the evidence so far? While fat consumption may not lead to breast cancer, you shouldn't take this study as license to indulge freely in rich foods.  Something researchers do know for sure is that a high-fat diet raises the risk of heart disease. -0- SIDEBAR: DOES LIGHT DRINKING HELP OR HURT YOUR HEALTH?  The study: An examination of alcohol consumption and mortality rates over 12 years in nearly 86,000 women, ages 34 to 59.  The result: Light to moderate drinkers (women who had less than half a drink to about two of them per day) as a group had a significantly lower death rate than those who drank heavily or not at all. The women who drank one to three drinks per week had the lowest death rate _ mostly because they suffered less cardiovascular disease. Those 50 or older benefited the most from light-to-moderate drinking, probably because they were at greater risk for heart problems.  Just a few weeks after the results of the first study were made public, however, a study of 16,000 women clouded the picture. It claimed that over a lifetime as little as one drink a day could raise a woman's risk of breast cancer by 40 percent, and two drinks a day could up the risk by 70 percent.  The bottom line: Light drinking appears to protect against heart disease but may raise your breast cancer risk.  According to Dr. Matthew Longnecker, an epidemiologist with the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, who conducted the breast-cancer study, if alcohol does play a role in causing breast cancer, it probably accounts for only 5 percent to 10 percent of all cases.  How should you balance alcohol's apparent ability to fight off heart disease with its possible increased risk for breast cancer? Your answer may hinge on your individual risk profile for each disease as well as on your vulnerability to alcoholism, which carries serious complications of its own.  Your physician can help you weigh all the risks and benefits.

Most couples occasionally experience sexual problems. And when things don't work in the bedroom, many women blame themselves or their relationships.  Yet sexual conundrums often have physical _ and treatable _ causes.  Two decades ago experts thought that up to 20 percent of sexual difficulties were physiological. Today most would put the figure at 40 percent to 50 percent,'' says Dr. Theresa Crenshaw, a San Diego sex therapist.  Unfortunately, embarrassment or fear may prevent some women from seeking help, and physical problems, if undiagnosed, can have psychological consequences.  ``It doesn't take long before an internal voice asks, `Am I going to have trouble?' whenever a woman has sex,'' says Dr. Judy Seifer, president of the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors and Therapists.  ``If her difficulties continue, she may avoid sex altogether.''  But this cycle can be prevented. The more a woman knows about sexual dysfunction, the less likely she will suffer in silence. Here's a look at the causes of some common problems and how they can be treated.  _ Medications.  ``Hundreds of prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs impair sexuality,'' notes Crenshaw, author of ``The Alchemy of Love and Lust'' (Putnam, 1996).  For example, most antidepressants, antianxiety and blood-pressure medications (particularly beta-blockers) can diminish sex drive. The antidepressant Prozac also delays sexual response time, making it difficult for many women to achieve an orgasm.  Birth-control pills that contain high levels of progesterone, which regulates the menstrual cycle, can depress desire and cause moodiness. In addition to clearing nasal passages, OTC antihistamines and decongestants may dry up vaginal secretions, making intercourse uncomfortable.  ``Luckily, there are alternatives for most of these drugs,'' Crenshaw says. Prozac can usually be replaced with bupropion or trazodone; an antianxiety drug with a lower dosage or a different medication; and a beta-blocker with an ACE inhibitor. The problem of a high-progesterone oral contraceptive can be solved by substituting a lower-dosage pill or another form of birth control.  A woman can stop using an antihistamine if possible, or try an OTC water soluble lubricant.  Before taking any medication, ask your doctor or pharmacist about its sexual side effects, or check the Physicians' Desk Reference (available at libraries).  Don't stop taking a prescription drug without consulting your doctor. You could trade one medical condition for another.  _ Hormones. Each month a woman's sexual responsiveness rises and falls depending on her hormonal levels.  Around ovulation many women may be more interested in sex due to a slight rise in testosterone, which fuels arousal. Following ovulation, progesterone levels increase and sex drive ebbs. Then, about two days before menstruation, progesterone production drops. Blood flow to the pelvic area increases, causing some women to feel more sexual.  After childbirth, fluctuating hormone levels can make sex uncomfortable or undermine desire. The stress of a new baby and the fatigue of midnight feedings, as well as conflicts a woman may have about her body, add to the problem.  Vaginal dryness may result when estrogen levels drop following delivery.  ``Because vaginal tissues are thinner and more delicate then, they get irritated or infected more frequently,'' Seifer says. An OTC lubricant can usually help.  If a woman nurses, the hormone prolactin, which stimulates milk secretion, inhibits estrogen and testosterone production.  ``Almost all new mothers experience reduced sex drive,'' Seifer says. ``But doctors rarely warn them. It's a tragedy, because if a woman talks to her husband about it beforehand, misunderstandings can be avoided.''  What many women don't realize, Crenshaw adds, is that having sex, even if they're not in the mood, may help.  ``This isn't just for your partner's sake,'' she says. ``You also benefit from touch and tenderness and bonding.  _ Discomfort.  ``Painful intercourse may be a symptom, and should be checked by a doctor,'' Seifer says.  Some women may develop vaginal irritation or burning because they have an allergic reaction to the latex or lubricants used in condoms or the chemicals found in spermicidal jellies. Symptoms are eased by using a different product.  Most women who undergo an episiotomy do not experience problems after the usual healing period of six weeks. With the resumption of sexual relations, though, many women may have tenderness due to vaginal dryness.  Consult your doctor if discomfort persists. In rare instances, scar tissue can form around an incision and may need to be surgically removed.  Other conditions that can cause discomfort include vaginal and urinary-tract infections; vaginismus (involuntary tightening of the vaginal walls); infections of the ovaries, fallopian tubes or cervix; fibroids (tumors of the uterus); endometriosis (inflammation of the uterine tissue) and vulvodynia (chronic burning of the vulva).  Proper treatment can help alleviate each problem.  _ Fatigue.  ``It's normal to be uninterested in sex when you are exhausted,'' says Dr. Domeena Renshaw, director of the Loyola Sex Therapy Clinic in Chicago.  Some causes of fatigue, such as middle-of-the-night feedings and juggling the demands of family and career, cannot be easily resolved. But you can try to reduce whatever stress these responsibilities trigger.  Renshaw, author of ``Seven Weeks to Better Sex'' (Random House, 1995), suggests that you schedule private time to relax and fantasize: Soak in a bath, practice meditation or yoga, take a nap when your kids do or close your office door for 10 minutes and put your feet up.  Regular exercise also helps. ``It tones you and improves your self-confidence and your body image, which makes you feel more sexual,'' Renshaw says.  Do some aerobic activity _ walking, jogging, swimming _ for at least 30 minutes a day, three or four times a week.  And yes, you've heard it before: Take time off as a couple. If you and your spouse can't vacation without the children, organize a baby sitting pool so you can slip out to a movie or take a long walk holding hands.  Through awareness, medical attention and communication with their partners, women can avoid any psychic damage that might be caused by sexual dysfunction.  ``If a woman deals with a physical problem before it becomes an emotional one,'' Seifer says, ``she's so much better off.''

Perhaps the book's strongest example of the press influencing events is its handling of the disputed 2000 vote in Florida in which the networks first called the state of Florida for Gore, then called it and the election itself for Bush, only to retract it less than two hours later. Dan Rather, for example, told viewers at around 2 a.m., ``Sip it, savor it, cup it, photostat it, underline it in red, press it in a book, put it in an album, hang it on the wall.

"161512"	"they"	"write"	" In The Indigo Children, Carroll and Tober define the phenomenon.

As developed by Rove, they write, this doctrine holds that people are angry in the main because the issues and values dividing Americans are real and consequential: A successful leader will stand forthrightly on one side of a grand argument. Then he or she will win that argument by sharpening the differences and rallying his most intense supporters to his side. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173674"	"they"	"write"	" After Little Rock, they write, news organizations would change, in just about every respect, the way they covered the civil rights story. At The Times that change included naming Claude Sitton as the new Southern correspondent. Sitton's writing packed massive amounts of information into taut word pictures, Roberts and Klibanoff explain, and in Sitton's six years on the race beat, nobody in the news business would have as much impact as he would on the reporting of the civil rights movement, on the federal government's response, or on the movement itself. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
