A white-haired man barreled in, talking fairly loudly into a cell phone. I thought nothing of it for about two seconds until I realized we were underground, and he was talking into a cell phone. I took another look and saw that what he held to his ear wasn't a cell phone, but a banana.  He was telling the person on the other end of the banana that he was going to marry that person's daughter, bring her flowers and sing her love songs.  He hummed a note or two, hung up, dialed the banana and reached someone in Italy. I know this because he said: ``Hello? Oh, Italy? Come stai?'' I don't know what the two parties discussed after that because he continued speaking in what seemed to me to be Italian. When they were done, he redialed, reaching Germany (``Guten tag!'') followed by Spain.  By the time he contacted Florida, every eye in the car was fixed on him and his banana, and most were filled with tears from laughing so hard.  As the man left the train at 66th Street, the young man standing to my left wiped his eyes.  ``He had the stem of the banana in his ear,'' he said. ``I always thought that was the part you talked into.''  _ MICHELLE GILLAN  Dear Diary:  Robert Kilgore recently saw what could probably be described as the ultimate in optimism. A restaurant in his Upper East Side neighborhood was closed after an inspection from the Department of Public Health. Next to the official notice was a handwritten sign with an address and the request, ``Visit us at our other location.''  Dear Diary:  Several months ago, much to my dismay, I was called to jury duty. After three full days of waiting, I was selected to sit on a jury with seven other women. Together we spent another day and a half in a hot, drab jury room, waiting to be sworn in.  One eccentric women babbled on about a lawsuit she'd been involved in, and when the judge caught wind of this she decided to dismiss us all from the case, for fear that we'd been ``tainted'' with preconceived ideas about the law.  The responsible party must have felt guilty, for she disappeared as soon as we were set free. But the rest of us lingered; we'd just begun to enjoy one another's company and were reluctant to leave. The solution? We exchanged e-mail addresses and decided to meet regularly for dinner. We range from 20-somethings to grandmothers, and from chefs to writers to ad executives. We've just finished our third ``Jury Luck Club'' dinner since April, and are looking forward to the next.  _ KIRSTEN WEIR  Dear Diary:  I emerged from the Park Place subway station in Lower Manhattan into a cold rain to find a young mother with an infant, a stroller and two fistfuls of shopping bags at the top of the stairs. She was obviously unable to navigate the entrance without help. As a 50-year-old man slowly recovering from a back injury, I was reluctant to offer assistance and stood to the side to ponder other solutions.  With the rain coming down harder and after several passers-by _ including many young, fit specimens _ rushed past without offering help, I finally volunteered. Cautiously lifting the baby and stroller, I began the descent, step by deliberate step.  Eventually reaching the token booth with baby, stroller and, happily, my back all in good shape, I accepted the sincere thanks of the much relieved young woman.  My sensitive, middle-aged ego was inflated, but then instantly deflated by a previously unnoticed New Yorker who must have observed the entire extended saga.  ``It's so hard to find a gentleman these days,'' she said, pausing before completing her thought. ``And when you do, it's always an old one.''  _ JAMES A. SCHMIDT  Overheard by Susan Teltser-Schwarz on upper Lexington Avenue, two attractive late-20-somethings:  She:``How are you?''  He:``Terribly hot, out of a job and living with my parents. How are you?''  NEW YORK  The city is my ocean _  I swim in it  Like a dolphin in the sea.  I know its flows and eddies,  Its currents  Its dangers and joys,  Its safe harbors, its hidden refuges.  I can read its foamy trails,  Navigate its bywaters,  Slip through its changing flows.  I splash on its surface,  Surf on its waves,  Dive deep into its recesses,  Break through and breathe,  See its colors beneath the surface,  Its growths and sparkles on the bottom.  I float on my back  Lettings its currents carry me,  And break free of them  To swim my own way.  _ RICHMOND SHEPARD  Dear Diary:  I was walking with a friend by Union Square and he was telling me about a cute girl at work whom he was interested in but who he felt was out of his league. I began arguing with him that no girl was out of his league, and that he should at least make an attempt.  Just then a middle-aged man who was walking in front of us turned around and said: ``People told me my wife was out of my league. We've now been married for 35 years. No girl is out of anybody's league.''  The man smiled and kept walking. I turned to my friend and said, ``See, listen to the strange man on the street.''  _ DOUGLAS SILVERSTEN  Dear Diary:  New Yorkers have automatic greeting responses. After finishing with my business at a bank teller's window, I said to her, ``You are very pretty.'' She shot back, ``You, too.''  I'm not.  _ JERRY OPPENHEIMER </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020909.0030 type=story > <HEADLINE> QB STEWART ENJOYING SINGULAR TASK </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  PITTSBURGH  (BC-FBN-STEELERS-STEWART-) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
