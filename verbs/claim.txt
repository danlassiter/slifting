"16124"	"they"	"claim"	" Respondents answer that the choice-of-law provision in their contract evidences the parties' express agreement that punitive damages should not be awarded in the arbitration of any dispute arising under their contract. Thus, they claim, this case is distinguishable from Southland and Perry, in which the parties presumably desired unlimited arbitration but state law stood in their way. Regardless of whether the FAA pre-empts the Garrity decision in contracts not expressly incorporating New York law, respondents argue that the parties may themselves agree to be bound by Garrity, just as they may agree to forgo arbitration altogether. In other words, if the contract says ``no punitive damages,'' that is the end of the matter, for courts are bound to interpret contracts in accordance with the expressed intentions of the parties even if the effect of those intentions is to limit arbitration. We have previously held that the FAA's pro-arbitration policy does not operate without regard to the wishes of the contracting parties. In Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468 (1989), the California Court of Appeal had construed a contractual provision to mean that the parties intended the California rules of arbitration, rather than the FAA's rules, to govern the resolution of their dispute. Id., at 472. Noting that the California rules were ``manifestly designed to encourage resort to the arbitral process,'' id., at 476, and that they ``generally foster(ed) the federal policy favoring arbitration,'' id., at 476, n. 5, we concluded that such an interpretation was entirely consistent with the federal policy ``to ensure the enforceability, according to their terms, of private agreements to arbitrate.'' Id., at 476. After referring to the holdings in Southland and Perry, which struck down state laws limiting agreed-upon arbitrability, we added: </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"

To be sure, the Internet is still a brand new medium for investors. But in the last few months, investing opportunities on the information superhighway have bloomed. By CORRIE M. ANDERS.  SPORTS (``s'' category)  BBA-AL (Seattle) _ The Cleveland Indians are one victory away from a World Series appearance, but the Seattle Mariners believe they have the Indians right where they want them as the teams head back to the noisy Kingdome for Games 6 and 7 in the AL Championship Series. By ALAN TRUEX.  BBA-PAUL-ASSENMACHER (Cleveland) _ For perhaps the first time in his nine years of major leaguery, Paul Assenmacher was being interviewed on live television after a game. ``Everybody's got their 15 minutes of fame, I guess,'' he said with all the bravado of a member of the federal witness protection program. ``I'm just glad I was able to help out tonight.'' Classic Assenmacher. By RAY RATTO.  FBN-COLTS (Indianapolis, Ind.) _ Anarchy preceded the Colts to the winner's circle Sunday at the RCA Dome. The officials went awry before Doug Brien's final kick, long before. The scoreboard said Indianapolis 18, San Francisco 17, at the end, when clarity finally imposed itself on this murky mess of a game. In the commissioner's office this week, the officiating supervisors will watch the videotape with chagrin. Eyes will roll. Foreheads will be slapped.

Stories scheduled for Page 1 will be listed in AM-FRONTPAGE-NYT, which will move by approximately 7 p.m. ET.  INTERNATIONAL  (Coded i)  CHINA-TAIWAN (Beijing) _ One day after Taiwan's landmark election, Beijing has made overtures to ease tensions, proposing a summit meeting with Taiwan's leaders. Seth Faison.  YUGO-BOSNIA (Visegrad) _ For the Muslims who fled this city as well as the Serbs who remained, this war has bound this generation to a Serbian militia leader named Milan Lukic, who hasn't been indicted for war crimes but is emblematic of dozens of Serbian militia leaders who rose in the early days of the war. Chris Hedges.  IMF-CAMDESSUS-PROFILE (Washington) _ A profile of Michel Camdessus and how he is trying to reinvent the IMF at a time when it is at a crossroads: the Mexico fiasco, shrinking budgets, and changing capital markets. Jeff Gerth, Elaine Sciolino.  ROMANIA-ORPHANS (Bucharest) _ Six years after the fall of Nicolae Ceausescu, whose communist regime spawned a notion that children were better off in state-run institutions than in the care of impoverished families, Romania's orphanages are as full as ever. Jane Perlez.  HISPANIOLA-HOSTILITY (Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic) _ With a new president already in office in Port-au-Prince and another scheduled to be installed here this summer, Haiti and the Dominican Republic are suddenly moving to end decades of mutual hostility. Larry Rohter.  MEXICO-U.S.-BORDER (Agua Pietra, Mexico) _ U.S. Border Patrol crackdowns south of San Diego and El Paso have made Agua Prieta one of the most popular illegal crossing points along the entire Southwest border. Sam Dillon.  CAMBODIA-LEADER (Kantuot) _ It has become increasingly clear that Hun Sen, 44, whose modest title is Second Prime Minister, is the man who runs Cambodia. Seth Mydans.  CANADA-HAITI-POLITICS (Montreal) _ A look at politicking around the Montreal Haitian community, and at the impact on Canada's foreign policy; pegged to a weekend visit here of Rene Preval. Clyde Farnsworth.  BRITAIN-MADCOW (Dateline TK) _ A visit with an especially unhappy cattle farmer. (Foreign Journal.) Stephanie Strom.  GERMANY-ELECTIONS (Bonn) _ Voting in three German regional elections may provide a revealing midterm judgment on Helmut Kohl's government at a time of record unemployment. Alan Cowell.  NATIONAL  (Coded a)  MILLION-MAN-MARCH (Denver) _ After a three-year-old boy was killed in a drive-by shooting, 100 black men fanned out through a black neighborhood here. They knocked on doors until leads resulted in three arrests on Christmas day. After rival gangs firebombed four houses in the same northeast Denver neighborhood in January, about 1,000 men turned out for a five-hour protest rally. The firebombings stopped. Nearly five months after the Million Man March, arguments have faded in Denver that the gathering's spirit would be a flash in the pan. Instead, this African-American community seems changed by the march, in ways tangible and intangible. James Brooke.  NEBRASKA-JOBS (Omaha) _ Jobs are going begging in Nebraska, which last year had the lowest jobless rate in the country at 2.4 percent. And it sits in a regional pocket of states where the maximum rate is 4 percent. What's behind it all? James Brooke.  KENTUCKY-EDUC (Dayton, Ky.) _ At a time of incessant alarms about the need to radically revamp American education, one state has actually done it: Kentucky, where a landmark court ruling six years ago produced the most comprehensive overhaul of public education the nation has ever seen. But Kentucky's experience says at least as much about the uncertainties of the vogue for educational ``reform'' as it does about the payoffs. Five years down the road, there is little definitive evidence that the overhaul is working. Peter Applebome.  MADCOW-DISEASE (Undated) _ An epidemic of mad-cow disease in Britain has caused a panic and a plunge in beef sales, despite years of government denials that the disease could jump to people who eat beef or drink milk. Last week, the British government did an about face, announcing that its scientific experts had advised of a possible link between mad cow disease and 10 cases of a similar human ailment, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. It takes years, even decades, for the symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, to develop. Because of that long latency, Britain now faces a horrific possibility: that tens of thousands of apparently healthy people may have become infected by the incurable disease that slowly rots the brain. Lawrence K. Altman.  WASHINGTON  (Coded w)  COUNTER-LOBBYISTS (Washington) _ Environmentalism is so popular that the foes of environmentalism are lobbying under deceptive names: The National Wetlands Coalition (oil &AMP; gas companies), Wildlife Legislative Fund of America (hunters), Northwesterners for More Fish (people who want dams and like logging), and the Sahara Club (off-road vehicle enthusiasts).  POLITICS  (Coded p)  OHIO-POLITICS (Canton, Ohio) _ The Senate decided last week to fund a job-training program at current levels, rather than cut back funding 30 percent as the conservative House leadership wants to do. In Canton, there is an active training program that would suffer if the House gets its way. A look at how the local establishment, including Republican Congressman Regula, is fighting to preserve it. Will he and Dole prevail over the House's wishes? Michael Winerip.  ECON-POLITICS (Washington) _ Steve Forbes is out of the race and Pat Buchanan is relegated to the sidelines. But some of their economic ideas _ reformulated or toned down _ are already reappearing in the campaigns of Dole and Clinton, as they vie for the support of the economically-anxious who backed the Forbes and Buchanan campaigns.

FINANCIAL  (Coded f)  NY-BLUECROSS-CONVERT (New York) _ Within days after Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield received New York state approval earlier this month to establish a for-profit subsidiary, legislative and consumer watchdog groups began pressing for a lucrative payoff for the public as part of the package. The goal is the same in a number of other states, with officials demanding that Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies turn over hundreds of millions of dollars to charities or state treasuries as the price of converting their not-for-profit health-care businesses into for-profit enterprises. Milt Freudenheim.  ISDN-PHONECOMPANIES (Undated) _ A consumer rebellion has flared up from coast to coast and caught much of the telephone industry flat-footed. The fight is over something called ``Integrated Services Digital Network,'' or ISDN. But the brawl is really over roadblocks to the Internet. ISDN is an old digital technology that quadruples the top data speed of an ordinary copper telephone wire. It is modest technology, compared to fiber optics. But now, thanks to soaring demand for speed fueled by the Internet, ISDN is a potentially hot technology. But some phone companies look on it as a bother, and are afraid it will cut into revenues. Edmund L. Andrews.  ENHANCED-CD-FILMSCORE (New York) _ Of the five original film scores nominated for an Oscar at the Academy Awards ceremony, John Williams's soundtrack for ``Nixon'' has a certain something extra. When popped into a CD player, the soundtrack plays like any conventional music disk. But placing it into a computer's CD-ROM drive opens a storehouse of related multimedia material. These flourishes may have little bearing on whether the score earns Williams a statuette. But Oscar-nominee status for the first film soundtrack in the emerging format known as enhanced CD is drawing attention to the inherent multimedia potential of movie music. Charles Bermant.  RSI-DEBATE (Undated) _ While regulators and deregultors in Washington fight over what to do about RSI, a small group has come up with a compromise. But since it was first presented to Labor Secretary Robert Reich last fall, the task-force proposal has been ignored _ apparently a victim of an atmosphere in Washington so sharply polarized that opposing sides do not even talk to each other.

PUBLIC-RADIO-MEDIA (Undated) _ From the folksy, struggling rural stations vital to their service areas to the big city-slicker stations that command healthy audience shares and generous donations, the success of public radio has been one of the radio industry's best-kept secrets, analysts say. Public television, with its much bigger budgets and audiences, tends to dominate most of the debate over the future of public broadcasting. But public radio is still in a rapid growth period, while the more mature public television industry has slowed in the face of a barrage of competition within the TV industry and from competing forms of entertainment. Robin D. Schatz.  MAG-DESIGN-MEDIA (New York) _ The influence of Milton Glaser and Walter Bernard permeates the magazine world. Working separately at first and then as a formidable graphics design partnership, they have shaped and reshaped leading magazines and newspapers in the United States, Europe, and Asia for more than 30 years. Even more important than their mark on so many well-known magazines, however, is their influence on the scores of talented young assistants who came to work in their atelier, an ornate former Tamany Hall courthouse on East 32nd Street. Deirdre Carmody.  MTV-EXPORT-MEDIA (Undated) _ After a decade of relentless global expansion, MTV is finally learning that American pop culture has its limits as an export. Rival music-video channels have sprouted from Brazil to Hong Kong. Simply by showcasing local artists performing in their native languages, these MTV clones have been able to cut into MTV's audience. The rise of local channels is eroding what was only five years ago a cherished precept of media conglomerates: that American news, entertainment, and music can travel virtually anywhere, and that the exporters could practice a ``one-size-fits-all'' policy. Mark Landler.  COURSEPACKS-COPYRIGHT-MEDIA (Undated) _ Authors and publishers are up in arms about a ruling by a federal appeals court that allows copy shops to produce customized anthologies for students, called ``course packs'', designed by professors, but without seeking permission or paying royalties to the holders of the copyrights involved. The logic of the court's majority was that because the professors had placed the books on reserve at the library as supplemental reading, and the students were free to copy the material on their own, selling the course packs did not violate the copyright holders' rights.
