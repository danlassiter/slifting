"105440"	"he"	"``sifted"	" Weighing in at 4 1/2 pounds, Roget's fifth edition runs 1,141 pages and comprises more than 325,000 words. As Chapman later described the editing process, he ``sifted, snifted, sorted and snorted'' vast computerized databases of contemporary texts to unearth thousands of words that Roget would have been hard-pressed to define: ``AIDS,'' ``yuppie,'' ``Lyme disease,'' ``infotainment,'' ''ibuprofen.'' Elsewhere, he broadened the meanings of existing words, including ``hacker'' (formerly under ``Golf,'' now also under ``Computer Science, Liveware'') and ``crack'' (now under ``Substance Abuse, Cocaine'' as well as the time-honored ``Opening''). </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
