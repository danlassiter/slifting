"95970"	"he"	"intones"	" In the end, Cleese suggests that our obsession with attractiveness has skewed our society's sense of what's really important in life (another less-than-startling revelation). Standing before a bunch of magazines with celebrities plastered on their covers, he intones, ``All of these very famous people don't have a single idea between them that will help your lives.

"152217"	"he"	"intones"	" Adams's melodies, supported by the pedal steel guitar of Cindy Cashdollar, convey a genuine feel for the Dead/Young heyday. In Easy Plateau, where Adams sounds uncannily like a young Jerry Garcia, he intones, My head ain't filled with nothing but cats and rocking chairs. No wonder Dead bassist Phil Lesh just played with Adams at the recent Jammy Awards (they did the Dead's Wharf Rat). Adams seems like a willing disciple. This is the first of three album projects that he'll release this year - and makes you wonder what other musical eras he will visit. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
