DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service  WASHINGTON  CAMPAIGN REFORM CALLING THE TUNE  Overhauling campaign finance laws is an issue in many election contests around the country this year. But in the congressional race in the 3rd District of Washington, it is just about the only issue.  Rep. Linda Smith, a Republican maverick with a strong populist bent and a relentless, evangelical enthusiasm for a cause, won her seat two years ago with a loud call for campaign reform, pushed hard for it once she reached Capitol Hill and is now calling even louder for it as she seeks re-election.  As she courses her woodsy district in the state's southwestern corner, she heretically complains that her own party leader in the House, Speaker Newt Gingrich, has been working with Democrats to stall an overhaul of campaign laws.  So if Ms. Smith is re-elected, she is telling voters, she will come back to Congress next term determined to push what she calls one of the toughest reform packages ever proposed. Among other things, her ``Bipartisan Clean Congress Act'' would include the ultimate in reform legislation: the outlawing of campaign contributions by political action committees.  She also wants to require congressional candidates to raise at least 60 percent of their campaign contributions within their home states and would seek legislation to ban the mass mailings so treasured by incumbents during an election year.  The congressman's Democratic opponent, Brian Baird, chairman of the psychology department at Pacific Lutheran University, in Tacoma, initially argued that Ms. Smith's pitch for an overhaul of campaign laws was but a political smokescreen by Ms. Smith to hide a weak voting record that includes, of all things, he contended, doing the bidding of some political action committees. And anyway, Baird said, voters worry a lot more about job security and health care than campaign laws.  That political counter seemed to go nowhere. So now Baird is also pushing for an overhaul of campaign financing, calling for a federal law that would mandate free radio and television air time for all candidates. He also suggests _ but would not try to mandate _ that states produce more instructive voter guides, that newspapers produce better campaign stories and that schools welcome more appearances by candidates.  NORTH CAROLINA  GOOD TIMES LEAD TO A GOOD FIGHT  For the better part of a century, Democrats controlled both houses of North Carolina's General Assembly. So after Republicans, riding the national GOP tidal wave, took over the state's House of Representatives in 1994, it was probably only a matter of time before partisan legislative gridlock hit.  That time has come.  Two weeks ago, after six weeks of wrangling, the Assembly adjourned for the first time in memory without a budget deal.  At issue: How to spend a $700 million revenue windfall _ in a year in which both houses are up for re-election, as is Gov. James B. Hunt Jr.  Republicans want to put $400 million into modest governmental raises and some tax relief, then prudently bank the rest. Democrats want to spend all $700 million, mostly on more generous raises and also on education and environmental programs that they accuse the Republicans of neglecting.  Hunt, a Democrat in a lively re-election contest, insists that there is a compromise out there somewhere, if only the Republican-controlled House would face reality. Among the Republicans in the House: his fall opponent, state Rep. Robin Hayes.  Last week, the governor held a series of meetings to publicize the ``devastating'' gridlock. Then he ordered an emergency Assembly session for next Monday. He says North Carolina is in ``a state of crisis.''  Hayes counters that Hunt is ``grandstanding'' and ``creating a crisis so he can take credit for being the one to rush to the rescue.''  With no progress on the horizon, some legislators have recently begun sporting buttons that read, ``It's the Surplus, Stupid!''  COLORADO  COMPETITIVE SPIRIT SEEMS ON THE WANE  There's seemingly endless talk these days about disenchantment with politics. But in Colorado it may be possible to measure the disenchantment.  Of the 84 seats in the Colorado House and Senate that will be on the ballot this fall, 25 have only one candidate running.  Never before have there been so many uncontested contests in the state, though in recent years the number has been steadily rising. The previous high was 22 uncontested races in 1990.  Political professionals, who say a similar reluctance to run can be found in some other states, attribute the lack of competition to a growing mistrust of government, an increase in blatant gerrymandering, and the unceasing need to raise more and more campaign money to gain or keep a job that does not pay particularly well but requires a huge investment of time and energy. They also note that Republicans have been dominant in Colorado for the past two decades, an increasingly discouraging development for Democrats.  ``It's very tough,'' says Mark Soltes, the political director of the Colorado Democratic Party.  He should know.  Most races that are uncontested this year are uncontested because no Democrat was willing to run.  Chuck Henning, the communications director for Republicans in the Colorado House, explained: ``Some say, `Why the hell should I go through the agony of raising thousands of dollars for a seat I'm not going to win?' ''  William Pound, director of the National Conference of State Legislatures, said the reluctance to run might be growing nationally.  ``There isn't any decline in uncompetitive races,'' Pound said, ``and there is probably growth.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960701.0747 type=story > <HEADLINE> EXCERPTS FROM RULING AGAINST GOVERNMENT </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WASHINGTON (BC-SCOTUS-THRIFTS-TEXT-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"

Bush learned he would achieve his dream of becoming president, there was little doubt about where he would make the announcement and who would be introducing him. It had all been prearranged. The venue would be the Texas House of Representatives _ large enough to accommodate a big crowd. And the introduction would be made by the Panhandle Democrat who conveniently symbolized the kind of bipartisan politics Bush wanted to take to Washington. House Speaker Pete Laney, as Bush wrote in a 1999 autobiography, is ``the strong leader of a dying breed, the rural conservative Democrats who have dominated Texas politics since Reconstruction.''

E N T E R T A I N M E N T  CLIBURN-RODZINSKI  FORT WORTH, Texas _ In less than a week, the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition will commence, and if it proceeds as smoothly as expected, much of the credit can go to one man.

CLIBURN COMPETITION  FORT WORTH, Texas _ What Hollywood is to movies, what Detroit is to cars _ that's what Fort Worth is to piano competitions.

Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment category.  CLIBURN-CHANGE  FORT WORTH, Texas _ Every Van Cliburn International Piano Competition brings change. But no Cliburn in the past ever witnessed the sort of fundamental shift that the 2001 event brings. To begin with, the 2001 Cliburn will replace the traditional single commissioned work for the semifinal round with the American Composers Invitational, a totally new approach to bringing original music to the Cliburn. And the 2001 Cliburn will present a controversial new voting procedure that could fundamentally change the dynamic of selecting winners, potentially even resulting in more than one gold medalist. The most profound change, however, is that of venue. Previously held at Texas Christian University, the Cliburn moves downtown this year to Bass Performance Hall. By WAYNE LEE GAY.

My heart was set on attending the University of Notre Dame for college, no doubt partially because of the nuns who taught us the Fighting Irish fight song. If the future wasn't full of promise for every girl of Mexican-American heritage then, I never knew it. It never occurred to me not to aspire to college. No one ever suggested that peer pressure or pregnancy or prejudice, limited economics or lowered expectations might erect barriers to higher education, a career and beyond. With the passage of three decades, obstacles for Hispanic women should increasingly have fallen; opportunities should abound.
