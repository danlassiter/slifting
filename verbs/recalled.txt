Lebow, who died on Oct. 9, once described the marathon ideal as ``a temperature between 40 and 45 degrees and raining.'' Steinfeld, Lebow's successor as marathon director, prefers balmy weather that will lure huge crowds. ``The runners,'' he noted, ``will be there no matter what.''   Wednesday, offering a highly preliminary forecast, Fred Gadomski, a Penn State meteorologist, said that the race, which starts at 10:50 a.m. Sunday was likely to begin with the temperature in the low 60s and that showers would probably develop by early afternoon, bringing race readings down to the mid 50s.   That would be fine with Ritva Lemettinen of Finland, one of the elite runners at Wednesday's marathon news conference. ``I hope the weather is 10 degrees,'' she said, using the centigrade equivalent of 50, ``with a wind at my back.''   Or maybe a blizzard. When she won the Chicago marathon last year, she recalled, it was below freezing, ``and snowing.''   According to Lemettinen and Emma Scaunich of Italy, who was sixth in the women's race here last year and expects to be in the top five this year, the runners to beat on Sunday are Olga Appell, who was second in 1993; Wanda Panfil, the 1990 winner; Albertina Dias of Portugal, and two Romanian runners, Adriana Barbu and Anuta Catuna.   ``The Romanians can be very strong,'' said the 40-year-old Scaunich, who seems a shoo-in for the master's title.   Offering an elite runner's view of the men's division, German Silva of Mexico said that Vincent Rousseau of Belgium would be strong and so would his Mexican countrymen, among them Salvador Garcia, the 1991 winner, and Arturo Barrios, a new U.S. citizen who placed third last year.   But the man to beat, according to Silva, is Silva. ``I think I will win,'' he said.   The first thing Scott Lange, the marathon's marketing director, wants you to know is that he did not lose the Ronzoni account. It's just that Borden, which makes both a pasta (Creamette) and a pasta sauce (Aunt Millie's), offered ``considerably more money'' than Ronzoni, a one-product pasta company, to become the marathon's official pasta sponsor.   The second thing he wants you to know is that it was Lebow who made the reluctant final decision to sever the 10-year relationship with Ronzoni in favor of the big Borden bucks.   What Lang would just as soon you not know is anything about the two pasta scandals that emerged at Wednesday's news conference.   For one thing, none of the five winners of the five-borough contest to select pasta recipes for Saturday night's pasta party at Tavern on the Green came from the Bronx. According to the chief judge, Paul Poidevin, the restaurant's executive chef, the judging was done at a borough-blind tasting. ``We didn't know where any of them came from,'' he said.   For another, it was discovered that Aunt Millie's Low Fat spaghetti sauce has three times as much fat as Aunt Millie's Family Style sauce. It seems that by replacing high-fat meat with really high-fat cheese, Aunt Millie produced a ``low-fat'' sauce that derives 43 percent of its calories from fat. Don't call the cops. The company says the ``Low Fat'' label is legal.   Don't expect a gold-medal performance on Sunday from Johann Koss of Norway.   It's not so much that Koss, who won three gold medals in speed skating at the 1994 Winter Olympic Games, doesn't run nearly as well as he skates. It's just that he will be serving as an escort for his disabled countryman, Ketel Mo, who has cystic fibrosis and expects to take seven hours to complete the 26.2-mile course.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941102.0245 type=multi > <HEADLINE> CUSTOMIZED WHITE PAGES DESCRIPTIONS HAVE A UNIQUE RING </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  (BC-WHITE-PAGES-LADN) </DATELINE> <TEXT> In the land of vanity license plates, could vanity telephone listings be far behind?   Paul Hopkins thought not. The 65-year-old retired clock maker called Pacific Bell to customize his listing in the White Pages, maybe add a word or two to help him stand out from the sea of Hopkinses in the Valley.   ``I've been in the clock and jewelry business in North Hollywood for 40 years ... then retired,'' Hopkins said. ``So many people want to know where you are, what happened to you, that I thought there must be a way.''   A few calls to Pacific Bell, and Hopkins bought a line of type under his name that proclaimed him to be a ``clock maker.'' Now long-lost customers and friends beat a path to his telephone.   ``I have had a lot of old friends call who thought I was dead and gone and lost forever,'' Hopkins said.   For $6 per year, Pacific Bell customers can spell out their business, hobby, religious affiliation or even nickname. Vanity license plate rules apply -- no profanity, no racial slurs, nothing illegal and nothing that could irritate other people.   Less than 10 percent of the people listed in the White Pages choose the service, which began in 1985, said Brenda Flood, product manager for the White Pages listings at Pacific Bell. But interest in the special listings is growing as more people begin small businesses and work out of their own homes, she said.   The company is considering other options for the White Pages, including a choice of type faces such as italics or script.   ``Californians travel and see things in other directories that they want at home,'' Flood said. ``Sometimes they send me actual pages from other directories and say, `Can't we have this?'''   Other special San Fernando Valley listings include Rolphe Kent, a ``composer for film,'' and Steven J. Green, ``film maker.''   Robert A. Miller, who owns Cosmo Electric, hopes ``Electrical contractor'' helps him stand out from the 37 other Robert Millers and nine Robert A. Millers in his neck of the White Pages.   ``Gourmet Italian chef,'' Donatello Castelli's listing, helps potential customers who lose the Van Nuys chef's business card but remember his name and his food.   Jerry Mills might know you're calling even before you finish dialing. His listing is ``palmistry, astrology, hypnotherapy.'' L.S. Jones, ``Laurel and Hardy Club,'' probably has a few funny things to say. And Scott Bornstein, ``memory expert,'' doesn't have to think twice before reeling off his Northridge telephone number. Antonio Cruz, ``gardener -- jardinero,'' landscapes in two languages.   Canoga Park psychotherapist Sheila Goss got more and less than she bargained for. A licensed therapist, her personalized listing reads ``psycho therapist.''   ``You're kidding? Really?'' Goss exclaimed, and started to laugh. ``Oh no -- that's so funny.''   So far, the descriptive line has neither hurt nor helped her business, she said.   ``I thought it might help business, that someone might just be looking through the phone book and see it,'' Goss said. ``I'll have to look it up and see what it actually says, though. I might want to do something about that.''  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941102.0247 type=story > <HEADLINE> PRESIDENT CAMPAIGNS HARD, BUT ONLY FOR DEMOCRATS WHO WANT HIM TO </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> PROVIDENCE, R.I.

Sunday, the book, ``Crossing the Threshold of Hope,'' published by Knopf, will have been on the New York Times best-seller list for six weeks.   The name of the play, written by the pope in 1960 under the pseudonym Andrzej Jawien, is ``The Jeweler's Shop.''   It opened last week for a limited engagement at the St. Bart's Playhouse and will be performed Saturday night and Sunday afternoon and evening.   A musical drama, the play focuses on the theme of love through the experiences of three different couples.   ``The pope was a playwright, an actor, a director, a translator and a drama critic for the local paper in Cracow,'' George Gordon, the producer of the play, said.   When Gordon met Pope John Paul at the Vatican five years ago, he recalled, ``He told me, `I wish I could do some more theatrical writing. Maybe some day I will when I have the opportunity.' ''   And now, there is word that a double CD of the Pope reciting the rosary, which has gone platinum in Spain, may be rerecorded for distribution in this country.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941209.0254 type=story > <HEADLINE> HOUSE DEMOCRATS FACE PAINFUL CHOICES </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WASHINGTON  (BC-REPUBS-HOUSE-590&AMP;ADD-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"

The brokers in the Atlanta office knew how many options he had, he recalled, and badgered him to exercise them, hold onto the stock and borrow to pay transaction costs and taxes.

There was the humiliating initial physical, he recalled, in which a doctor examined him for signs of anal intercourse, apparently because he suspected Santanna was gay. At the boys' homes he was sent to, he was repeatedly taunted for being effeminate. He couldn't tell staff members; they never asked.

His came when he tried to persuade his bosses that they needed a new line of cards to appeal to black Americans. They didn't see the need, he recalled, because blacks already bought Hallmark cards.

"138515"	"he"	"recalled"	" One of the most difficult cases, he recalled, was the prosecution of former Kansas City, Kan., police Officer John Cheek, who was convicted of voluntary manslaughter in the 1994 shooting death of Milton Foster Jr. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200310.gz"
"138686"	"he"	"recalled"	" His first foray into arranging marriages, he recalled, was in 1996, after he received permission to work with student marriages at Tehran University.

"139616"	"he"	"recalled"	" In 1976, he recalled, Jimmy Carter's campaign was kept alive during the early primaries through fund-raising concerts by Southern rockers including the Allman Brothers Band, Charlie Daniels Band and Marshall Tucker Band.

"139899"	"he"	"recalled"	" The Israeli judge who sentenced him asked what he would have done with his life had he not found himself facing prison. The whole courtroom burst into laughter, he recalled, when he replied that he dreamed of being a lawyer. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"140008"	"he"	"recalled"	" The people of Birney have probably seen more Shakespeare than 99 percent of the people in New York City, Jahnke said.

"140260"	"he"	"recalled"	" Once during a big stadium show in the 1980s, he recalled, he achieved his all-time most successful guitar face after jumping from a drum stand and sliding across the stage, smashing his knee badly against an amplifier. At which point, he said, the pain and the expression on my face probably out-Hendrixed Hendrix. And when I was in all that pain, I remember saying to myself, 'Go with it, J.J. Milk it.

"142268"	"he"	"recalled"	" Saban's path to moguldom has certainly been unusual. He was born in Egypt but fled to Tel Aviv with his parents, his brother and his grandmother after the 1956 Suez War. Struggling to get by, the family lived in a one-room apartment and shared a bathroom, he recalled, with a hooker and a pimp. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"142608"	"he"	"recalled"	" Back in the 1980s, he recalled, I used to look at litchis, they used to look so good, and I'd have to put them aside -- I'd only choose the broken ones on the ground. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"143204"	"he"	"recalled"	" The problem was, this street didn't need a slight cultural shift, Eisner said. This street needed a dramatic about-face.

"143597"	"he"	"recalled"	" In the 2000 presidential campaign, he recalled, Cheney was the best of the four candidates -- better in the televised debates than Bush, Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore and Joe Lieberman, the Democratic vice presidential candidate. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"143886"	"he"	"recalled"	" The enemy, he recalled, had descended by the thousands on the cabbage patch before him. They chomped on the fresh green crowns as though it were their very own smorgasbord, and then blithely moved on. Afterward, he worried about the imminent arrival of their unruly young. Greedy and ill-mannered, they would probably snack on his market garden indiscriminately. Only God knew, Sakho surmised, if the corn would make it to the harvest.

"143888"	"he"	"recalled"	" The enemy, he recalled, had descended by the thousands on the cabbage patch before him. The uncouth foe of which he spoke recently with such revulsion is the latest calamity to befall the West African farmer: an unusually fierce infestation of desert locusts that has swept across the Sahara over the summer and threatened to cut into West Africa's grain harvest by up to 25 percent, according to a recent estimate by a committee of regional government officials. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"143917"	"he"	"recalled"	" John F. Kennedy had the Alliance for Progress and Ronald Reagan had the Caribbean Basin Initiative to help such nations, he recalled, but America's current leadership has forgotten our neighbors to the South. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"145211"	"he"	"recalled"	" One day, when Jenkins was a bachelor, living with three other defectors, the American took advantage of the rare absence of their political supervisor to search their house.

"146150"	"he"	"recalled"	" In Riosucio, in his simple wood-frame home, Marino Salazar is still stumped. His daughter Leida seemed happy, he recalled, holding a picture of a smiling girl in a green dress and pink shirt. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"148459"	"she"	"recalled"	" When Dawn Hudson, a vivacious Arkansas native and former actress and screenwriter, took over as executive director of the IFP's struggling Los Angeles chapter in 1991, she found herself at the helm of a ceremony more notable for its intoxicated languor than for its glitz or clout. The 1991 show, she recalled, ran four and a half hours and featured a 45-minute keynote address by Francis Ford Coppola. Built around an analogy comparing filmmaking and wine-making, the speech seemed to touch on each and every phase of a vintner's work. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"149425"	"he"	"recalled"	" Habib said that when he refused to confess to being part of a 1995 terror plot, one man turned on the current. He lifted his feet to avoid the shock, he recalled, and he was suspended from the wall. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"

"151060"	"he"	"recalled"	" When he came to America five years ago, he recalled, he gorged on steaks the size of which he had never seen before.

"151512"	"he"	"recalled"	" While putting away a deep-fried pork chop, Bun B explained that DJ Screw's sound helped earn the city national respect.

, she said,	 She and the other surviving dancers began to train a new generation -- Shapiro's -- and to teach them the dance dramas and the complex movements they remembered. About 30 percent of the repertory has not been performed since the early '70s, she said, and the choreography and special movements of the hand and body for those dances may be lost forever. Still, Proeung Chhieng said, the art form's past is essentially secure, and the time has come to consider the shape of its present and future. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, he said,	 While there is room for new ideas, he said, the essence of the classical dance must be maintained: the regal body positions; the elaborate, hyperextended gestures of the hands and feet and the combination of solid groundedness and fluid lightness that gives the dance its special flavor. Like 'Seasons of Migration,' he said, its past and future have to have real connections with each other. They cannot be separated. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz

This is not about a majority or even a significant number of Bush nominees; it's about a handful with fringe views or shaky qualifications.

, he emphasized,	 It's hard to find an American who doesn't believe that, with enough will, he or she can achieve anything -- we've been brought up to believe that, said Dr. Barry Glassner, a sociology professor at the University of Southern California. Health, he emphasized, is no exception: It's the same whether you're 40, 50 or 80. It doesn't matter whether you are male or female, black or white.  </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, he said,	 So what are Americans, with their faith in starting over, to do? When it comes to making oneself over, said Glassner, they have two options. One, he said, is that you can consider yourself inadequate or inferior for failing to force the years to melt away. The other is to shift the definition of rejuvenation from a arduous restructuring of the self to a paint job. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz

, he explains,	 Lou, 76, has spent his twilight years as a boarder in a succession of two-family houses in northwest Queens, surviving on about $800 a month in Social Security benefits.

The supervisors' vote, 6 to 5, had barely backed him, he recalled, and in the mayoral election that followed, he lost Chinatown -- for the first time in his career -- as result.

He went to the State University of New York at Binghamton, which he called an affordable school with good buzz, and majored in political science. Law school -- specifically, Georgetown University Law Center -- seemed a logical next step, but his continued antipathy to rules almost scuttled him. They had all these required courses that I didn't like, he said, so I got lots of C's, even a D.

Within 10 minutes after receiving the changes, he recalled, I said, 'No way.' Those were not words I would have said. It left the impression that I was conscripted.

"157929"	"he"	"recalled"	" The playwright is boyish and old-man-ish at the same time, smiley and intense, with geek-cool architect glasses. At 32, he is a little old to be considered precocious, but the writer phase of his life is new. Ten years ago, he had returned to his hometown, the Woodland Hills area of Los Angeles, to wrap up his undergraduate degree, and to wrestle with his coming-of-age issues -- a father he described as a corporate raider and a monster (they are not in contact), and a loving but difficult mother who, he recalled, could turn me into a door-slamming, bug-eyed crazy person. Like the character Todd in the Jenny Chow play, Jones worked as a pizza delivery boy at Amechi's in Los Angeles, drove a Dodge Dart with a sawed-off top, and spent his spare time with a friend who, like his heroine, suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder. It would take her half an hour to 45 minutes to get out the door, he recalled. But once she was outside, she was a lot of fun. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"

In 1935, with a doctorate from Vienna University, he was unable to work because of anti-Semitism at the university (where, he recalled, he had also witnessed Jews being beaten by Nazi brownshirts), but a job came his way: to write a brief history of the world for young readers. He had six weeks. It was published in German after Gombrich went to England. It led to his writing his classic textbook, The Story of Art, and thus helped shape his career. Over the decade, the history was translated into 17 languages, but it has not appeared in English until now, in this translation by Caroline Mustill begun under the guidance of Gombrich, who died in 2001. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"

At Chrysler, he recalled, they were totally surprised that I was not such a stiff and unapproachable guy when he arrived. But, he added, I was not recognized here in Germany as being extraordinary or out of the norm. Still, he noted, there are differences in how Americans and Germans do business, among them the speed of decision-making.

IRAQ-BUSH (Washington) -- President Bush delivered a vote of confidence to Iraq's prime minister on Thursday and rejected calls to begin a drawdown of American forces in Iraq, using their meeting in Jordan to push back on a decision by an independent bipartisan panel to call for a gradual withdrawal. But Bush, who returned to Washington later Thursday, may find that his firm insistence that he would not accept any timetable for withdrawing American troops will come up against a competing view taking hold here: that it is in the interests of both the United States and Iraq to reduce the American military presence there starting no later than the middle of next year. (Byline TK.)  With photos NYT1-8.  Editors: An early lede has moved.  REPUBS-GOVS-MCCAIN (Doral, Fla.) -- Sen. John McCain of Arizona turned up here Thursday for a surprise stop at the Republican Governors Association -- the group headed by Mitt Romney, the Massachusetts governor who happens to be McCain's main rival for the Republican Party nomination in 2008. McCain's appearance here -- which included eight hours of non-stop meetings -- gave Romney a reminder that he can not take support of his fellow-governors for granted. By Adam Nagourney.  AFRICA-SEX-ABUSE (Sambava, Madagascar) -- Even as Sub-Saharan Africa races to adopt many of the developed world's norms for children, from universal education to improved nutrition to limits on child labor, one taboo -- child sexual abuse -- remains stubbornly resistant to change. In much of the continent, child advocates say, perpetrators are shielded by the traditionally low status of girls, a lingering view among many that sex with children, particularly by relatives, does not constitute a criminal offense and justice systems that amount to obstacle courses for victims. By Sharon LaFraniere.  With photo and map.  W.VA.-MEDICAID (Hamlin, W. Va.) -- No question, John Johnson is a doctor's nightmare. Speaking from the easy chair where he spends his days in a small wood house, his left trouser leg folded by a safety pin where a limb was lost to diabetes, Johnson lit another cigarette. Johnson, 61 and a former garbage man, goes to a clinic once a month for diabetes checkups and takes insulin. His bills are paid for by taxpayers through Medicaid. But when doctors urged him to mind his diet, he recalled, I told 'em I eat what I want to eat and the hell with 'em. But ignoring doctors' orders may exact a new price among West Virginia's Medicaid recipients as the state begins a plan to reward responsible patients with significant extra benefits or -- as critics describe it-- to punish poor people who do not join weight-loss or anti-smoking programs or miss too many appointments by taking away important services. By Erik Eckholm.  With photo and graphic.  PROSTATE-CANCER-TREAT (Undated) -- The nearly 240,000 men in the United States who will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year have one more thing to worry about: Do their doctors have a big financial stake in choosing their treatments? Among several widely used treatments for prostate cancer, one stands out for its profit potential. The approach, a radiation therapy known as IMRT,can mean reimbursement of $47,000 or more a patient. Critics see a potential conflict of interest on the part of urologists, the specialists who typically help prostate patients choose a course of treatment. The critics say that urologists who can profit from IMRT may be less likely to recommend other proven approaches -- which for older patients can sometimes mean forgoing treatment altogether. Part of a series. By Stephanie Saul.  IRAQ-BUSH-ASSESS (Washington) -- In the cacophony of competing plans about how to deal with Iraq, one reality now appears clear: despite the Democrats' victory this month in an election viewed as a referendum on the war, the idea of a rapid American troop withdrawal is fast receding as a viable option. A News Analysis by David E. Sanger.  PARIS-FOR-SALE (Paris) -- For sale: history, with a view. France is selling dozens of historic properties in Paris and the provinces, using the proceeds to move government bureaucrats into less expensive properties and to help pay off the national debt. So far it has unloaded dozens of chateaux, villas and hotels particuliers, the stone mansions of the golden age of Paris.For all their Gallic pride, the French seem happy to have anyone take them off the hands of taxpayers. All the locations are great, and they are all beautiful pieces of real estate, said Eric E. Sasson, European head of real estate for the Carlyle Group, the global private equity firm that has bought several properties. By Craig S. Smith.  With photo.  ALVIN-AILEY (new York) -- The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater is on a roll: a new building, lots of touring, more great dancers than ever and interesting new choreographic premieres this season.

EXP-CLINTON-AIDS-DRUGS (Undated) -- The Clinton Foundation, backed by the new French-led drug buying effort largely financed through a tax on airline tickets, has negotiated sharp cuts in the price of AIDS drugs for children. By Celia W. Dugger.  EXP-SPY-POISON (London) -- In the latest turn in the mystery surrounding Alexander Litvinenko, the former Russian spy who died of radiation poisoning here a week ago, the British government said on Thursday that radiation had been detected in 12 locations around London, and was likely to be found in more. By Sarah Lyall and Steven Lee Myers  EXP-PYRAMIDS-CONCRETE (Undated) -- In new research on the Great Pyramids of Giza, a scientist says he has found that some original parts of the massive structures appear to be made of concrete blocks. If true, historians say, this would be the earliest known application of concrete technology, some 2,500 years before the Romans started using it widely in harbors, amphitheaters and other architecture. By John Noble Wilford.  EXP-REPUBS-GOVS-MCCAIN (Doral, Fla.) -- Sen. John McCain of Arizona turned up here Thursday for a surprise stop at the Republican Governors Association -- the group headed by Mitt Romney, the Massachusetts governor who happens to be McCain's main rival for the Republican Party nomination in 2008.

Tom Vilsack of Iowa, a Democrat, launched his long-shot bid for the presidency Thursday, calling for an end to U.S. dependence on foreign oil in favor of alternative energy sources. By Jeff Zeleny.  EXP-U.S.-CITIZEN-TEST (Washington) -- The government announced plans for a new citizenship test on Thursday that will be tested in 10 cities across the country. The goal is to make it more relevant and still make sure it tests knowledge of fundamental American history and values. By Holli R. Chmela.  EXP-CIVIL-DEFENSE-LOGO (Undated) -- The stark civil defense symbol -- a C and D forming a red circle in a white triangle in a blue circle -- died Thursday at the age of 65. Its demise was announced by the National Emergency Management Association, which described the symbol brusquely as a relic from the cold war. A new logo was unveiled. By David W. Dunlap.  EXP-HOUSING-MARKET (Undated) -- The prices of single-family homes rose at their slowest pace since 1998 in the third quarter from the second, and were essentially flat when adjusted for inflation, according to a highly regarded government index released Thursday. The data suggest that prices, especially for moderately priced existing homes that the index focuses on, continue to weaken across the country and particularly in formerly hot coastal markets. By Vikas Bajaj.  EXP-PARIS-FOR-SALE (Paris) -- For sale: history, with a view. France is selling dozens of historic properties in Paris and the provinces, using the proceeds to move government bureaucrats into less expensive properties and to help pay off the national debt.
