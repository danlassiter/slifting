"131713"	"he"	"acts"	" But it's a fact: In 2002, Ice Cube, at the ripe old age of 33, is a major player in the old old-school sense. He writes scripts, he acts, he produces, he's even taken a crack at directing, with 1998's ``The Players Club.'' More important as far as Hollywood is concerned, he gets movies made cheaply, and they are profitable. ``Barbershop'' _ one of three films released this year by Ice Cube's Cube Vision production company _ had a budget of $12 million and has raked in $75 million and counting. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
