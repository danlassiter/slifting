"7858"	"he"	"argued"	" Shabani was charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U. S. C. s846. He moved to dismiss the indictment because it did not allege the commission of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy, which act, he argued, was an essential element of the offense. The United States District Court for the District of Alaska, Hon. H. Russel Holland, denied the motion, and the case proceeded to trial. At the close of evidence, Shabani again raised the issue and asked the court to instruct the jury that proof of an overt act was required for conviction. The District Court noted that Circuit precedent did not require the allegation of an overt act in the indictment but did require proof of such an act at trial in order to state a violation of s846. Recognizing that such a result was ``totally illogical,'' App. 29, and contrary to the language of the statute, Judge Holland rejected Shabani's proposed jury instruction, id., at 36. The jury returned a guilty verdict, and the court sentenced Shabani to 160 months imprisonment. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"

ATTN) THE STATES AND THE ISSUES (bl) By ROBIN TONER c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service  THE ENVIRONMENT: Republicans Go On the Offensive  Much of politics is a struggle to define the opposition, which explains the skirmishing around the country between many House Republicans and the environmental community: the escalating Green War.  Congressional Republicans have long bristled at accusations that they have happily and heedlessly tried to roll back the nation's environmental safeguards; they have also recognized how politically dangerous that claim can be.  A recent ``Candidate Alert'' from the National Republican Congressional Committee urges Republicans to ``use your candidacy as a vehicle for addressing our country's environmental challenges head-on.''  The idea, the Republicans say, is to promote their party's new approach to the environment: ``common sense, flexible and effective approaches that build on consensus, private property ownership, free enterprise, local control, sound scientific evidence and the latest technology.''  Among the ``suggested activities'': ``Hold a press conference and issue a press release on the importance of a cleaner, safer, healthier environment for future generations. Ask families and children to appear with you at your press conference. Remember, Republicans are saving the environment for them.''  Daniel J. Weiss, political director of the Sierra Club, is not convinced _ or amused. A Sierra Club release earlier this year warned that ``anti-environment senators and representatives'' were trying to ``paint themselves green'' with ``phony environmental burblings and slick photo opportunities.''  Weiss argues that ``many anti-environment incumbents will try to greenscam their record, and it's our job to ferret out the truth.'' The 104th Congress, he argued, ``has been the most anti-environment Congress since the first Earth Day in 1970,'' and he predicted that it would provoke the most intense election-year effort yet by the environmental movement.  The Sierra Club's activities range from television advertising to leafleting to picketing the environmental events put on by members of Congress whose records are deemed wanting, according to Weiss.  Targeted states include California, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon and Washington.  Weiss indicated that his group watched records, not party lines, and that its New Jersey branch recently endorsed Rep. Bill Martini, R-N.J., for re-election.  NORTH CAROLINA: High Stakes In a Key State  North Carolina is emerging as a critical front in this election year, with a high-profile Senate race, several competitive House races and a presidential contest that looks far closer in the South than most experts expected only a few months ago.  Republican National chairman Haley Barbour acknowledged as much in a speech to state Republicans last week.  ``North Carolina has more opportunity this year and more danger for the Republican Party than just about any other state,'' Barbour said. ``You have more to win and more to lose.''  He noted that North Carolina was at the forefront of Republican gains in 1994 and said that 1996 ``promises to be even bigger.'' But he added: ``It also has the risk that we might go down.''  TENNESSEE: No Sure Thing For Ford's Son  Harold Ford Jr., 26, is still widely considered the odds-on favorite to win the Democratic nomination to succeed his father, Harold E. Ford, and represent Tennessee's 9th Congressional District. But for all his family's formidable political clout in Memphis, the younger Ford will not go unchallenged.  Among the entrants in the Aug. 1 Democratic primary are state Sen. Steve Cohen, a lawyer and a liberal in the Tennessee Senate, and state Rep. Rufus Jones.  Another important factor is Mayor W.W. Herenton, Memphis's first black mayor and a powerful rival of the Ford family. He has said he does not want to see Ford's son simply inherit his seat.  ``It is in the best interest of Memphis politics for voters to have a menu of credible candidates in any race, including the 9th Congressional race,'' the mayor told the Memphis Commercial Appeal. He has yet to endorse anyone.  Cohen asserted: ``Political power isn't something you can inherit in this country. We had a revolution 200 years ago to make sure that didn't occur again.''  This district is 60 percent black and heavily Democratic. Ford, who is retiring, has represented it for 22 years. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960525.0268 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-LISTENING-POST-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> No. 366, May 22-23, 1996  TODAY:  1.

Life is so wrong, notes the Burned-Out Newspapercreatures Guild for the 374th time, and this is BONG Bull No. 374!  ABOUT THE MOVIE. There's an outside chance that the producers of the Pulitzer Committee-snatches-prize-back-from-liar movie will be about an ambitious but lazy resume forger who slanders black people for selfish gain. Or, they may try for the trendy Racism Made Me Do It slant. Either way, it'll be the scrawniest turkey at the farm.  AND NOW, THE ENVELOPE PLEASE. Nanette Logue (Pwoodgrl(at)aol.com) of the (Antioch, Calif.) Ledger Dispatch and Archive Dominatrix of the Flying Pig Contest announces the winners in that competition for fotogs sent to take grip-and-grins and other ordinary shots that never win prizes.  Winners are posted in the website, http://www.ccnet.com/(tilde)cccorlew.  (``The judging, a beer-fueled event, held in a seedy Antioch apartment under cover of darkness, resulted in no arrests or police visits,'' the Dominatrix avers.) In the website non-winners can find copies of the wondrous certificates, suitable for downloading if they have the computer gear, and the sponsors vow to make no protest if onlookers award themselves Flying Pig honors, especially since there were some vacancies in the awards list. You can also click to send e-mail to judges, telling them off for missing you.  The winners:  _Person in office. 3rd: Rohanna Mertens (The Patent Trader, Cross River, N.Y.). Two real estate agents show the reporter how easily they could buy and sell houses over the Internet, but they couldn't quite log on.  _Meeting. 2nd: Dean Guernsey (The Bulletin, Bend, Ore.) ``Willy Loman'' with his ``Stop the Pit'' sign is from a city council meeting where people turned out to protest a gravel pit in Sisters, Oregon.  _Groundbreaking etc. 2nd: Trent Nelson (Salt Lake Tribune, Salt Lake City, Utah). A shot from the knees down of the lady who received the honor (a facsimile of her signature on an airplane) sitting in a chair. Was the photographer editorializing? Let's just say that some people should not wear short skirts.  _Opening day. 1st: Diane Kulpinski (The Bulletin, Bend, Ore.) Trout season. Man on shore, boats in water, ethereal and beautiful, you can almost forgive people crazy enough to go out in freezing-ass cold at dawn's first light just for fish when you make a shot like this. The fotog, presumably, didn't even need the fish.  _Bowling. General disappointment. Bowling alleys need different lighting. Lack of surprises. Lack of bad fashion in the photos. We know it's out there. No winner.  _Something at a school. HM: Tomas Ovalle (Valley Times, Pleasanton, Calif.). Kindergarten kids doing the Watermelon Dance. Neener, neener, neener.  _Pet o' Week. 3rd: Victor Des Roches (Porterville, Calif., Recorder). The turkey was living in someone's yard and it was the week before Thanksgiving.  _Group photos. 1st: Victor Des Roches (ibid.). Second-grade students who wrote letters to Oklahoma City residents after the bombing. The kid hanging upside down clinched this winner.  _Same day every year event. 3rd: Meri Simon (San Jose, Calif., Mercury News) Senior citizen admonishes Santa to ``be good'' when he visits a nursing home.  _Three women with objects. As was explained on the entry form, not really a gender-specific category, nor did it have to be three persons.  The first-place photo was clearly the winner, and a judges' favorite. 1st: Peter Haley (The News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash.) Shot in a public urinal from behind the subjects. Two men, well, holding objects. One guy, wearing a kilt, is holding his bagpipes in one hand, and the other guy a sweater, so it is actually two men holding two objects.  _``...of the Week'' 1st: Teri Harris (The News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash.) At the ``basketball game of the week,'' a member of the (Seattle) Sonics Dance Team watches the game on all fours, while the two men seated (ital) behind (unital) her keep their eyes on something other than the game.  _Old news. 2nd: Diane Kulpinski (ibid.). The fire was put out just before the reax of the two women in the picture. Lady in the middle reportedly broke down while visiting (how could we ever guess?) her burned-out mobile home with relatives.  _Never ran. In this category, the photographers had to include the reason that the photo never ran.  Some of the reasons were as funny or sad as the photos themselves. 1st: Trent Nelson (ibid.) Two high school girls interested in medical careers examine a human head in the cadaver room. Never ran because: ``It's gory and might be someone's grandpa''; HM: Rick `Netmoser` Egan (Salt Lake Tribune). Victim of a drunken driver demonstrates that he appears normal following his ordeal, unless he removes his shirt to reveal a giant scar and ``smiles big.'' Never ran because: The `knocked silly` expression belies the serious intent of the feature story.  _(Combined for shortage of entries) Worst Cropped and Misuse of a Photo. Photographers usually like to forget about these tragedies. 2nd: Paul Hu (Press-Telegram, Long Beach, CA). Oval crop.

The beauty of having your own contest is that when you see something that zonks you out, you can create a special category for it.  Actually a series of photos, everything from the serious and dramatic to the comedic. The Burning Man Festival, an inexplicable event which involves fire, darkness and nudity in the desert. Never ran because: It would be against newspaper tradition to show people anything new when you can show them the same cliches month after month.  SLANDER AND LIBEL TIME. Patrick Lackey of the Norfolk (Va.) Virginian-Pilot suggests a contest for those who best complete the following sentence: `I knew an editor so dumb that he (she)...`  Lackey's entry: `...had to sing Happy Birthday to himself to remember his name.`  A minority of the Editorial Standards and Martini Recipes Committee was troubled by the premise, but Happy Hour intervened and the protest died for lack of a second.  PARAJOURNALIST. No, not semi-journalists, though it would be good for describing any newsroom middle manager who spends more than 30 minutes a day in meetings. ``Parajournalist'' set off curiosity in Internet newsies' venues recently: It's apparently a European term for one who drops in (or parachutes; see WWII), as in following the pack to a big event.  Another nifty term on its way to Webster's: Two-pot screamer, an Aussie bartender's term for one who gets drunk easily. It came up in talk about the Snakebite, a 50-50 concoction of beer and hard cider, which many Brit publicans decline to serve because it acts fast and hard and pub owners hate the violence.  And a nice one from modern lit: Stepford editor. In Mark T. Sullivan's fine novel Hard News (Kensington, $21.95) it describes the new breed of wimpy careerist newsroom manager. Sullivan borrows from Ira Levin's novel The Stepford Wives, about robot spouses.  COMIX SECTION.

There's an outside chance that the producers of the Pulitzer Committee-snatches-prize-back-from-liar movie will be about an ambitious but lazy resume forger who slanders black people for selfish gain.

Nanette Logue (Pwoodgrl(at)aol.com) of the (Antioch, Calif.) Ledger Dispatch and Archive Dominatrix of the Flying Pig Contest announces the winners in that competition for fotogs sent to take grip-and-grins and other ordinary shots that never win prizes.  Winners are posted in the website, http://www.ccnet.com/(tilde)cccorlew.  (``The judging, a beer-fueled event, held in a seedy Antioch apartment under cover of darkness, resulted in no arrests or police visits,'' the Dominatrix avers.)

A shot from the knees down of the lady who received the honor (a facsimile of her signature on an airplane) sitting in a chair. Was the photographer editorializing? Let's just say that some people should not wear short skirts.  _Opening day. 1st: Diane Kulpinski (The Bulletin, Bend, Ore.) Trout season. Man on shore, boats in water, ethereal and beautiful, you can almost forgive people crazy enough to go out in freezing-ass cold at dawn's first light just for fish when you make a shot like this. The fotog, presumably, didn't even need the fish.  _Bowling. General disappointment. Bowling alleys need different lighting. Lack of surprises. Lack of bad fashion in the photos.

Life is so wrong, notes the Burned-Out Newspapercreatures Guild for the 374th time, and this is BONG Bull No. 374!  ABOUT THE MOVIE. There's an outside chance that the producers of the Pulitzer Committee-snatches-prize-back-from-liar movie will be about an ambitious but lazy resume forger who slanders black people for selfish gain. Or, they may try for the trendy Racism Made Me Do It slant. Either way, it'll be the scrawniest turkey at the farm.  AND NOW, THE ENVELOPE PLEASE. Nanette Logue (Pwoodgrl(at)aol.com) of the (Antioch, Calif.) Ledger Dispatch and Archive Dominatrix of the Flying Pig Contest announces the winners in that competition for fotogs sent to take grip-and-grins and other ordinary shots that never win prizes.  Winners are posted in the website, http://www.ccnet.com/(tilde)cccorlew.  (``The judging, a beer-fueled event, held in a seedy Antioch apartment under cover of darkness, resulted in no arrests or police visits,'' the Dominatrix avers.) In the website non-winners can find copies of the wondrous certificates, suitable for downloading if they have the computer gear, and the sponsors vow to make no protest if onlookers award themselves Flying Pig honors, especially since there were some vacancies in the awards list. You can also click to send e-mail to judges, telling them off for missing you.  The winners:  _Person in office. 3rd: Rohanna Mertens (The Patent Trader, Cross River, N.Y.). Two real estate agents show the reporter how easily they could buy and sell houses over the Internet, but they couldn't quite log on.  _Meeting. 2nd: Dean Guernsey (The Bulletin, Bend, Ore.) ``Willy Loman'' with his ``Stop the Pit'' sign is from a city council meeting where people turned out to protest a gravel pit in Sisters, Oregon.  _Groundbreaking etc. 2nd: Trent Nelson (Salt Lake Tribune, Salt Lake City, Utah). A shot from the knees down of the lady who received the honor (a facsimile of her signature on an airplane) sitting in a chair. Was the photographer editorializing? Let's just say that some people should not wear short skirts.  _Opening day. 1st: Diane Kulpinski (The Bulletin, Bend, Ore.) Trout season. Man on shore, boats in water, ethereal and beautiful, you can almost forgive people crazy enough to go out in freezing-ass cold at dawn's first light just for fish when you make a shot like this. The fotog, presumably, didn't even need the fish.  _Bowling. General disappointment. Bowling alleys need different lighting. Lack of surprises. Lack of bad fashion in the photos. We know it's out there. No winner.  _Something at a school. HM: Tomas Ovalle (Valley Times, Pleasanton, Calif.). Kindergarten kids doing the Watermelon Dance. Neener, neener, neener.  _Pet o' Week. 3rd: Victor Des Roches (Porterville, Calif., Recorder). The turkey was living in someone's yard and it was the week before Thanksgiving.  _Group photos. 1st: Victor Des Roches (ibid.). Second-grade students who wrote letters to Oklahoma City residents after the bombing. The kid hanging upside down clinched this winner.  _Same day every year event. 3rd: Meri Simon (San Jose, Calif., Mercury News) Senior citizen admonishes Santa to ``be good'' when he visits a nursing home.  _Three women with objects. As was explained on the entry form, not really a gender-specific category, nor did it have to be three persons.  The first-place photo was clearly the winner, and a judges' favorite. 1st: Peter Haley (The News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash.) Shot in a public urinal from behind the subjects. Two men, well, holding objects. One guy, wearing a kilt, is holding his bagpipes in one hand, and the other guy a sweater, so it is actually two men holding two objects.  _``...of the Week'' 1st: Teri Harris (The News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash.) At the ``basketball game of the week,'' a member of the (Seattle) Sonics Dance Team watches the game on all fours, while the two men seated (ital) behind (unital) her keep their eyes on something other than the game.  _Old news. 2nd: Diane Kulpinski (ibid.). The fire was put out just before the reax of the two women in the picture. Lady in the middle reportedly broke down while visiting (how could we ever guess?) her burned-out mobile home with relatives.  _Never ran. In this category, the photographers had to include the reason that the photo never ran.  Some of the reasons were as funny or sad as the photos themselves. 1st: Trent Nelson (ibid.) Two high school girls interested in medical careers examine a human head in the cadaver room. Never ran because: ``It's gory and might be someone's grandpa''; HM: Rick `Netmoser` Egan (Salt Lake Tribune). Victim of a drunken driver demonstrates that he appears normal following his ordeal, unless he removes his shirt to reveal a giant scar and ``smiles big.'' Never ran because: The `knocked silly` expression belies the serious intent of the feature story.  _(Combined for shortage of entries) Worst Cropped and Misuse of a Photo. Photographers usually like to forget about these tragedies. 2nd: Paul Hu (Press-Telegram, Long Beach, CA). Oval crop. Need we say more?  _Special Write-in Category, Man at microphone or Speech giver. 3rd: Peter Haley (ibid.) ``Luck and f16 made this bird appear much closer to the U.S. Senate candidate than it was.''  _Judges' Special Never Ran Extravaganza-a-thon-a-rama Award: Tomas Ovalle (ibid.). The beauty of having your own contest is that when you see something that zonks you out, you can create a special category for it.  Actually a series of photos, everything from the serious and dramatic to the comedic. The Burning Man Festival, an inexplicable event which involves fire, darkness and nudity in the desert. Never ran because: It would be against newspaper tradition to show people anything new when you can show them the same cliches month after month.  SLANDER AND LIBEL TIME. Patrick Lackey of the Norfolk (Va.) Virginian-Pilot suggests a contest for those who best complete the following sentence: `I knew an editor so dumb that he (she)...`  Lackey's entry: `...had to sing Happy Birthday to himself to remember his name.`  A minority of the Editorial Standards and Martini Recipes Committee was troubled by the premise, but Happy Hour intervened and the protest died for lack of a second.  PARAJOURNALIST. No, not semi-journalists, though it would be good for describing any newsroom middle manager who spends more than 30 minutes a day in meetings. ``Parajournalist'' set off curiosity in Internet newsies' venues recently: It's apparently a European term for one who drops in (or parachutes; see WWII), as in following the pack to a big event.  Another nifty term on its way to Webster's: Two-pot screamer, an Aussie bartender's term for one who gets drunk easily. It came up in talk about the Snakebite, a 50-50 concoction of beer and hard cider, which many Brit publicans decline to serve because it acts fast and hard and pub owners hate the violence.  And a nice one from modern lit: Stepford editor. In Mark T. Sullivan's fine novel Hard News (Kensington, $21.95) it describes the new breed of wimpy careerist newsroom manager. Sullivan borrows from Ira Levin's novel The Stepford Wives, about robot spouses.  COMIX SECTION.

"62683"	"he"	"argued"	" Switching in an instant from slashing partisanship to the more detached tone of the historian-politician, Gingrich sought to suggest that American conservatism at the end of the 20th century differed relatively little from American liberalism of 50 or 60 years ago. In the intervening years, he argued, liberalism has been completely taken over by minorities and single-issue pressure groups. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199606.gz"

Fascism, despite its claim to being a ``totalitarian'' regime, was, he argued, a softer dictatorship that retained much of the liberal bureaucracy, made peace with the Roman Catholic Church and did not share Hitler's obsession with racism and the Jews.

Bush waded into the labor dispute that has paralyzed 29 ports on the west coast. He invoked the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, a law unused since the 1970s, which lets the president force people back to work if a strike or a management lockout ``imperils national health or safety.''  Arguing that the blocked ports threatened both America's economy and its national security, Bush got a court injunction which ordered the ports to reopen, at first until Oct. 16 but then, most likely, for the full 80-day cooling-off period allowed by the Taft-Hartley law.  Businessmen were delighted. Many had been urging the White House to intervene in a dispute that was starting to hurt: With 200 ships idling off the west coast and scores more heading across the Pacific, manufacturers were missing parts, retailers could not plan their Christmas shelves and farmers could not sell food to Asia.  The National Association of Manufacturers claimed that 5 percent of its members had already closed plants or cut production. Bush said that farms were losing ``a thousand jobs a day'' and that, in all, the economy was losing ``up to $1 billion a day.''  In fact, by opening the ports after a closure of only 11 days, Bush has ensured that the macroeconomic consequences of the dispute will be minimal. Though it will take weeks to work through the backlog of cargo, and though specific industries will be temporarily hit, overall economic growth is unlikely to suffer much. After all, this dispute had been simmering for months. Many firms had stocked up on inventories or arranged other means of transport.  The problem for the White House was that the costs of a port shutdown would have snowballed if the dispute had continued. Exports and imports together are worth around 25 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, and the west-coast ports carry more than half of the cargo that is shipped in and out of America in containers. Since many goods cannot efficiently be moved by air, a long stoppage would have meant a huge supply shock.  The risks of such a shock, given America's already-weak economy, were chiefly what tipped the White House toward action. Bush has also been accused of concentrating too much on Iraq and not enough on the economy, and opening the ports was a dramatic way of denying that.  But the decision has a political price. Bush has infuriated the unions, a core Democratic constituency _ and one that he himself has been courting heavily _ only weeks before the midterm elections.  The AFL-CIO was outraged at the invocation of Taft-Hartley. Ron Blackwell, one of its top men, called the White House action ``unprecedented, unnecessary, unfortunate and unjustified.'' This was, he argued, the first time that Taft-Hartley had been used when management was locking out workers _ the port operators locked out workers on Sept. 27, accusing them of a deliberate work slowdown, a ``strike with pay.''  Irritating the unions so close to the midterm elections is a risky business for Bush. Outraged, they may work all the harder to get out Democratic votes in tight races. But the bigger risk is that this dispute undermines the White House's long-term efforts to woo selected unions away from the Democrats.  Bush won only a third of union-household votes in the 2000 election. Since then his top strategist, Karl Rove, has been waging a quiet campaign to win more union support. Bush's decision to impose steel tariffs in March 2002 was designed, in part, to curry favor with steel workers. He is doing well with the Teamsters, who favor drilling for oil in Alaska, and the half-million-member carpenters' union, who have doubled their contributions to Republican congressional candidates in 2002.  If Bush comes to look like a politician who is against collective bargaining and intervenes on behalf of bosses, however, all this progress could turn very sour.  Anyway, Taft-Hartley may not actually solve the port problem. The 10,500 longshoremen who control the west-coast ports, furious about the Taft-Hartley decision, are now all the more determined to hold out for union control over jobs created by new technology at the ports, a key issue in the dispute.  Quite possibly no compromise will be reached during the 80-day cooling-off period. And the history of Taft-Hartley is not promising: On eight of the 11 occasions when the act has been invoked in cases involving dock workers, the dispute has re-emerged after 80 days.  Still, by then the midterm elections will be safely out of the way.  -----  EDITORS: Visit the New York Times Syndicate Web site at http://www.nytimes.com/syndicate for more information on THE ECONOMIST and other features. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20021011.0104 type=story > <HEADLINE> IN NEW YORK, AN INCHOATE RALLY FOR PEACE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 10-11-02 14:04:00EDT (BC-NY-PEACE-RALLY-ECONOM) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"

"143243"	"he"	"argued"	" Marriage as an institution has changed beyond recognition, he said. Once, he argued, marriage made a wife the property of her husband.

Theory, he argued, had all but supplanted literature in English departments, reducing the literary canon to a litany of political and social wrongs, a cesspool, as he put it, of racism, poverty, sexism, homophobia and imperialism.

He published an essay urging the Clinton administration to draw a red line: Tell the North Koreans that if they move to turn their stockpile of spent nuclear fuel into bomb-grade plutonium, we will bomb their reprocessing facility.

"149791"	"he"	"argued"	" First and by far most important, he argued, was what he called the high-powered job hypothesis -- that women are, for whatever reason, less likely to enter jobs that demand enormous time commitments. The second was that, while average ability may be the same, women may be represented in smaller numbers at the very highest (and very lowest) levels of scientific aptitude. In statistical terms, more men than women may be at the top and bottom levels of the distribution of scientific aptitude compared with the middle; in other words, the bell curve mapping men's scientific aptitude may have fat tails.

"150962"	"he"	"argued"	" In the most frequently cited of them, Parental Investment and Sexual Selection (1972), Trivers started from the basic observation that in most species females invest more time and energy in their offspring than males. If Hamilton was right, Trivers reasoned, this meant that females, who had more at stake in each of their offspring, would be more choosy about their mates, and that males, who had less, would compete with each other for the chance to inseminate as many females as possible.

"164277"	"he"	"argued"	" The Colonials, he argued, were a top-10 team and deserved better. Krzyzewski was not thrilled at having to face an experienced, physical team like George Washington so early in the draw, either. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164302"	"he"	"argued"	" Hume, in contrast, welcomed the necessary artifice of manners, through which, he argued, a mutual deference is affected; contempt of others disguised; authority concealed; attention given to each in his turn; and an easy stream of conversation maintained, without vehemence, without interruption, without eagerness for victory, and without any airs of superiority. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164329"	"he"	"argued"	" But even if it does, and even if all the world's polio cases can be wiped out, he argued, problems that are now being nearly ignored in the all-out effort to corral the last few cases will suddenly loom large. For example, as a precaution, vaccination must be continued for many years after the last case is found, polio experts agree. (Nearly every American child is still immunized -- albeit with a killed vaccine given by injection -- even though polio was virtually wiped out in the United States in the 1960s.) </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164588"	"he"	"argued"	" Evidence found in the second search should be thrown out as well, he argued, because the warrant was based on the first faulty search. The trial court ruled against him, but two Georgia appellate courts agreed with him, saying all the evidence should be thrown out. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164720"	"he"	"argued"	" Still, since the late 1990s, a falling unemployment rate no longer seems to result in predictably higher wages and higher prices. Greenspan contended that a rising productivity rate was increasing labor's output. Shortages, as a result, were less likely to develop, he argued, and that took pressure off the Fed to raise rates and thus dampen inflation. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164784"	"she"	"argued"	" The ex-wife (referred to in court papers as BZ) argued that, since the stakes and cost to her in creating an embryo, even an in vitro embryo, were much higher than for her ex-husband, her desires should count for more. Providing sperm, her lawyers pointed out, is one of the more straightforward medical procedures imaginable, while extracting an egg is a difficult, occasionally painful process involving extended hormone and drug treatments. And more important, she argued, women have a much shorter reproductive life span than men: BZ was 45, and in losing the case she, like Natallie Evans, lost her last chance at biological motherhood. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"165070"	"he"	"argued"	" Moreover, he argued, the point of the process was not just to seek retribution but to help shape the history of the war, to spur Serbs to end their denial of atrocities and reconnect Serbian society to the rest of Europe. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"166106"	"they"	"argued"	" In 2002, Chomsky, with Marc D. Hauser of Harvard and W. Tecumseh Fitch of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, wrote a paper about what all this meant for the evolution of language. Language evolution is vexing, they argued, because it relies on so many things that are not specific to language. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"166196"	"she"	"argued"	" In her closing argument, Conolly sat before the jury with a child-size mannequin in a jean skirt, just like one worn by the first girl. Recounting her testimony, Conolly used both hands to reach up under the skirt to the top of the underwear. Surely, she argued, such a bold maneuver would have attracted attention in a classroom full of kids. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"166264"	"I"	"argued"	" When my wife told me that learning to drive a stick shift was like dancing -- best done while the mind is young and malleable -- I was not persuaded. Even in my mid-30s, I argued, my mind is as elastic as Silly Putty. But she archly reminded me that when we took salsa lessons, I did not learn salsa. So I did not tell her I had signed up for driving lessons until after I had completed the first one. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"

"166418"	"he"	"argued"	" Dorgan said the term guest-worker was a misnomer because, he argued, it's not a temporary program. Instead, Dorgan insisted, it would flood the country with low-wage replacement workers. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"166721"	"she"	"argued"	" Pamela R. Metzger, the director of the Tulane Law School's Criminal Court Clinic, has petitioned the court to release Dunn and more than a dozen other poor prisoners in similar circumstances. Releasing them would not hamper the prosecution, she argued, and would give them an opportunity to try to gather evidence in their own defense. And, she said later, to be free from imprisonment and punishment without due process of law. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"166796"	"she"	"argued"	" Hirsi Ali urged the Dutch to stand firm, and not to appease immigrants. She said Dutch Muslims needed to free themselves from the control of clerics who preached subjugation of women and ostracized homosexuals. The 40 or more Islamic schools and mosques isolate children and could breed dangerous militants, she argued, so they should be closed. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"167248"	"she"	"argued"	" The diminished interest in secrecy, she argued, cannot outweigh the benefits that came from the reporters' coverage of the BALCO case, which included new policies by Major League Baseball, a new focus on the dangers of steroid use among athletes from high school on up and praise from President Bush. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"167648"	"he"	"argued"	" Further, he argued, We can be proud that our union doesn't shy away from making tough calls and even prouder of our members' willingness to make sacrifices for those who preceded them and those who will follow. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"

"168086"	"it"	"argued"	" Getting Taylor to The Hague has been a diplomatic headache ever since his capture as he tried to leave Nigeria in March. The Sierra Leone government requested that he be tried outside the country because, it argued, his followers could destabilize the region once again, after more than a decade of war. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"168242"	"she"	"argued"	" Rather, Boardman said, the president has the responsibility to make sure the Constitution is upheld.

"168292"	"they"	"argued"	" Both Surftech and Santa Cruz Surfboards were already making epoxy-finished boards before Clark folded, and therefore were positioned to fill increased demand. Their products were better, they argued, because traditional surfboards were susceptible to cracks and erosion of the coating, which can lead to foam getting waterlogged. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"169211"	"he"	"argued"	" Second, he argued, is the necessity of using lawful ways like the Patriot Act to track down and share information. Officials were able to track down the plotters in Britain, just as their Canadian counterparts broke up an apparent terrorist ring in Toronto and U.S. authorities made arrests in Miami in other alleged conspiracies. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169420"	"he"	"argued"	" I find the world just too complex to embrace a single ideological point of view, Evan Bayh said. Moreover, he argued, conservative strategists like Karl Rove like nothing better than pushing Democrats into an ideological corner. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169637"	"they"	"argued"	" But military historians soon began to question the numbers. The 30 percent estimate seemed high, they argued, given that 15 percent of Americans deployed to Vietnam served in combat roles. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"

"169776"	"he"	"argued"	" Israel, the officer said, views Hezbollah as Iran's western front and, regardless of how poorly the new U.N. forces may perform, he argued, Israel will benefit from new international support for the extension of Lebanese sovereignty to the Israeli border, made most visible in the deployment of the Lebanese army. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"

"170459"	"he"	"argued"	" Simply connecting Alfonso Rodriguez to Dru Sjodin (through fibers, DNA and circumstantial evidence) does not answer when Dru Sjodin died, he said, and he suggested that Sjodin could have died within minutes of being pushed into the car, a bag over her head. The movement of her body to a ravine outside Crookston would be incidental to the assault, Hoy said, and would fall outside interstate transportation as defined by the federal kidnapping law. Under that scenario, he argued, Rodriguez should have been tried in a state court, where the death penalty is not available. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"170654"	"he"	"argued"	" Iran should distance itself from Syria, he argued, adding that Iran's focus on opposing Israel - a key reason that a nuclear Iran alarms the West - brings high risks without any national interest. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171042"	"they"	"argued"	" The U.S. must attack Iran, they argued, because its Islamic leaders are suicidal zealots -- indistinguishable from the Sept. 11 hijackers -- ready to sacrifice themselves and millions of fellow Muslims in a nuclear exchange if they can take Tel Aviv or New York with them. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"

"171380"	"they"	"argued"	" Such a redefinition, they argued, would send a signal to other nations that they, too, could rewrite their commitments to the 57-year-old conventions and, ultimately, lead to Americans seized in wartime being abused and tried in kangaroo courts. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171802"	"he"	"argued"	" Instead of simply building dams, levees and other controls that can actually encourage development in vulnerable areas, he argued, society should reduce risks by steps like discouraging such development. His ideas and advocacy led to the creation of the National Flood Insurance Program in the United States and programs to manage flood plains around the world. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"171812"	"they"	"argued"	" As little as a year ago, most Iraqis dismissed fears of sectarian war. Iraqis of different sects had always mixed, they argued, and no amount of bombing would change that. But as the texture of the violence changed from spectacular car bombs set by Sunnis to quiet killings in neighborhoods of both sects, few still cling to that belief. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"171872"	"he"	"argued"	" Six years ago, when Al Gough approached the then-WB about his young Superman series, Smallville, he knew that the show would resonate with comic-book geeks and modern mythology fans alike. After all, he argued, everybody loves an underdog, especially if that underdog can fly and save the day. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172174"	"they"	"argued"	" Most Democratic Party leaders objected to major provisions in Bush's plan. They argued that the United States should not be denying detainees so many of the fundamental constitutional rights guaranteed to suspects in civilian and military courts. Nor should Congress, they argued, give the president the latitude to classify people, including US citizens, as enemy combatants-and to determine what methods short of actual torture could be used in their interrogation. This is not just a bad bill, said Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, this is a dangerous bill. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172316"	"he"	"argued"	" Death, he argued, was not that big a deal; it was just crossing a line. He heralded communal self-destruction as an act of revolutionary suicide protesting the conditions of an inhumane world. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172338"	"he"	"argued"	" Fiscal conservatives, he argued, were emerging as the swing voters in need of attention, in part because they had become increasingly likely to vote Democratic in the years since President Bill Clinton was in office.

"172381"	"he"	"argued"	" The need for assistance, he argued, is every bit as great as it was before civil rights legislation ended formal discrimination.

"173104"	"they"	"argued"	" In 2003, Veizer joined Nir J. Shaviv, an astrophysicist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, to propose a new climate driver. They envisioned slow movements of the solar system through the surrounding galaxy as controlling the cosmic rays that bombard Earth's atmosphere. A reduction, they argued, would lessen cloud cover and Earth's reflectivity, warming the planet. The reverse would cause cooling. The Phanerozoic record of cosmic-ray bombardment showed excellent agreement with climate fluctuations, trumping carbon dioxide, they wrote. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173111"	"he"	"argued"	" But smart investors, he argued, were absorbing the surplus by buying up homes that builders were now unloading at bargain prices -- some for as little as $60 to $80 a square foot, which local experts say is barely enough to cover construction costs let alone land expenses. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"

"173535"	"he"	"argued"	" In the 1963 book A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960, which he wrote with Anna Jacobson Schwartz, Friedman compiled statistics to buttress his theory that recessions, as well as the Great Depression, had been preceded by declines in the money supply.

"173595"	"he"	"argued"	" Toys R Us, he argued, had made several obvious blunders. One of the biggest came in 1996, when executives separated the toy and child products businesses. The new Babies R Us stores proved popular with shoppers, but at Toys R Us the sudden absence of items like pacifiers and bibs caused a sharp drop in customer traffic. This was rooted in shopping patterns: Most consumers buy toys once or twice a year, while new mothers tend to buy baby clothing once a month. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
