By R.W. Apple Jr.   HEALTH-GAP (Washington) -- President Clinton's goal of health insurance for all Americans is often described as a moral imperative or a political objective, but it is also a pocketbook issue.

"38307"	"it"	"would"	" Nor is our assessment of these provisions changed by the fact that s553(a), in generally providing that nothing in the Bankruptcy Code affects creditors' prebankruptcy setoff rights, qualifies this rule with the phrase ``(e)xcept as otherwise provided in this section and in sections 362 and 363.'' This undoubtedly refers to s362(a)(7), but we think it is most naturally read as merely recognizing that provision's restriction upon when an actual setoff may be effected which is to say, not during the automatic stay. When this perfectly reasonable reading is available, it would be foolish to take the s553(a) ``except'' clause as indicating that s362(a)(7) requires immediate payment of a debt subject to setoff. That would render s553(a)'s general rule that the Bankruptcy Code does not affect the right of setoff meaningless, for by forcing the creditor to pay its debt immediately, it would divest the creditor of the very thing that supports the right of setoff. Furthermore, it would, as we have stated, eviscerate s542(b)'s exception to the duty to pay debts. It is an elementary rule of construction that ``the act cannot be held to destroy itself.''

"46556"	"it"	"would"	" A. Yes, it would, and a waterproofing company using this method usually guarantees its work. In your case the water table (water level underground) is high; it tends to rise in wet weather and spring rains, which are augmented by snow melt. This high water level is close under the floor slab, and is under pressure. Instead of coming through the concrete (unless there are cracks in the floor), it comes in at the weakest point of the structure; namely, between foundation and floor. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"

"48172"	"he"	"would"	" The interpretation of exactly what would constitute such a violation is critical for Flaherty. If he is found in violation, he would, most observers agree, have to step down as speaker. But if the charges relate only to taking gratuities from lobbyists and not to misconduct in office, most observers feel Flaherty, who enjoys a strong reservoir of good will among his House colleagues, would have a solid chance of retaining the speakership.

Ninety minutes later, Reynolds managed to get away from her 28-year-old son, but not before he had bitten off most of her nose, part of her lip, some of her left ear and right eyelid, and had chewed deep gouges out of her left cheek.

Steve Buscemi is a triple threat as writer-director-star in this great talkie. The title comes from the name of the saloon where barflies congregate to talk about their bleak lives.  ``Last Man Standing'' _ Bruce Willis adds another nail to his acting coffin in this overwrought reinterpretation of ``Yojimbo'' by veteran director Walter Hill. A lot of blood and whine.  ``Normal Life'' _ This Ashley Judd film noir, directed by John (``Portrait of a Serial Killer'') McNaughton, showed up on HBO before New Line gave it a theatrical release. While Luke Perry doesn't keep his end up, the film's sense of dread and darkness make it better than most.  ``Bulletproof'' _ Damon Wayans and Adam Sandler team up in this bogus buddy movie. Let's put it this way _ they won't make you forget the team of Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte in this cop comedy.  BRITISH IMPORTS: ``Who'' is First. ``Dr. Who'' knows the what, why and where of everything in several new video releases. ``The Five Doctors'' and ``The King's Demons'' feature all five of the actors who played Who over the past two decades. ``The Green Death'' is also out, along with ``The Hand of Fear,'' ``The Mark of the Rani'' and ``Dragonfire.'' ...

The ballplayers are universally well paid. They have great benefits, including a pension system that is the envy of all other sports. They travel like royalty, going from place to place in charter planes, staying in four-star hotels, and dining on a handsome $72.50 per day meal money (this for people generally paying for no more than one meal a day). It's a great life, one well worth protecting.  There are no real outstanding issues. No one in management is going after the fringe benefits, which are clearly here to stay. Free agency is a given. So what, from a Players Association viewpoint, would be a reason to strike?  It's pretty hard to explain, but it really all comes down to this:  --In order that a $16 million-a-year player can earn $20 million.  --In order that an $8 million-a-year player can earn $10 million.  --In order that a $2.5 million-a-year player can earn $3.6 million.  --In order that a $975,000-a-year player can earn $1.3 million.  --In order that a $300,000-a-year player can earn $399,422.17.  I'm not saying the owners are all wonderful fellows. The general rule of thumb is to trust an owner only as far as one can throw the stadium. Owners often lie. Owners often cook the books. Owners distort things constantly.  But owners seem to realize that a work stoppage is in no one's best interest. At least not the interests of anyone who wishes to field a team once the stoppage is over. At least the owners offered up a no-lockout pledge. The players have never been willing to reciprocate with a no-strike pledge. This is not surprising, since the Players Association has never really gotten it.  The Players Association has served a very useful purpose. It wasn't all that long ago (the 1960s) that the minimum salary was $6,000 and the reserve clause was in full force. Overmatched players conducted their contract negotiations themselves against cagey general managers. Players, even the great ones, were abused and mistreated.  But that was then and this is now. The great battles have been fought and won. The working conditions, which cover every player from A-Rod to the lowest backup, are first rate, and for this every player can thank Marvin Miller, who fought and won that good fight two decades ago.  There really is nothing left to fight for. The players have no additional needs, no additional wants. Life is blissfully ideal.  Of course, that's not what they're being told by their association superiors.  In the best of all worlds, Major League Baseball would have a salary cap. A salary cap doesn't exactly put NBA and NHL players on food stamps, as you may have noticed. A salary cap wouldn't alter the lifestyle of too many baseball players, either. But because the sainted Miller would have dined with a Republican in preference to OK'ing a salary cap, because the association has itself locked into a more-more-more posture of entitlement, and because the association has not lost any significant battles in its present guise, there really is no such word as true ``negotiation'' in their vocabulary. To them, the expiration date of a Basic Agreement is the signal to flex its muscles yet again. At no point does anyone in the association ever step back to look at the Big Picture. It's only a matter of what have you, management, done for me lately?  The pawn in all sport labor-management confrontations is the Great American Sports Fan, who pays his or her money to support the enterprise. And no set of fans has been trashed with more regularity than the baseball fan, whose game has been interrupted four times since 1981.  The 1994 strike that eliminated the World Series for the only time since 1904 cost baseball a great many fans, but not enough to get the full attention of the players, who look at such places as Boston and St. Louis and proclaim baseball to be healthy. The truth is, there are places such as Tampa, Miami, Kansas City, and the saddest case of all, Detroit, where a strike might have whatever fans are left swearing off baseball forever. This is without even mentioning Montreal, where the Expos, owners of a best-in-baseball 74-40 record at the time of that strike, have never recovered and now face extinction (for many reasons, admittedly, but the strike is surely one of them).  The absolute last thing baseball can have in such locales is a work stoppage that would give people already wavering in their support of the sport an excuse to find other things to do with their time than attend baseball games, watch them on TV, and listen to them on the radio.  ``I know it's hard for the fans to understand when we're arguing about the kind of money we're talking about, which is billions and millions,'' acknowledges Johnny Damon, who seems to be much too nice and gentle a soul to be the Red Sox' player representative. ``I think it will come down to whether (Yankees owner George) Steinbrenner is willing to share more with the middle markets or the smaller markets. It does seem that every plan we hear seems to benefit Milwaukee.''  Ah, the Bud Selig issue. Don't think this doesn't muddy the waters considerably. The Players Association truly believes everything Selig says must be analyzed in terms of whether it is good or bad for Milwaukee.  If I honestly believed the only reason players would go on strike was that they simply distrust the willingness of owners to tell the financial truth, I would be somewhat sympathetic to their cause. The owners have a financial mess they must address, and they can fix some of their problems without bringing in the players. But that is not why the players would strike.  The players are willing to strike because they have been taught never to surrender anything. They believe they are The Chosen, and are therefore entitled to every single thing they have. The players are isolated beyond measure, living in their own little cocoon, interacting not at all with the people who follow their game.  If players really knew what the fans thought of them as a group, they would, after breaking out in a cold sweat, tell Donald Fehr &amp; Co. to make a deal, rather than risk the consequences of a strike that very likely will have a catastrophic effect on the game. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020706.0180 type=story > <HEADLINE> A PRIEST WHO SAW SEXUAL ABUSE FROM THE OTHER SIDE BECOMES A </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> MANALAPAN, N.J.

PAKISTAN-PEARL (Islamabad, Pakistan) _ A body uncovered in a shallow grave in the southern city of Karachi has been identified as Daniel Pearl, the American reporter who disappeared there in January, according to forensic evidence that American officials are now handing over to the Pakistani police, several officials said on Thursday. Since the body was discovered in May, investigators had assumed it belonged to Pearl, but DNA tests were never made public. By Ian Fisher.  ITALY-JEWISH-CEMETERY (Rome) _ Visitors to the Jewish section of a historic cemetery here Thursday found smashed headstones, toppled columns and overturned earth, a chilling scene that marked the arrival in Italy of a wave of anti-Semitic attacks across Europe. Italian law enforcement officials and leaders of Jewish groups in Rome said there was no indication yet of who might be responsible for the destruction, which apparently occurred late Wednesday or early today and affected nearly 40 graves in the Verano Cemetery. By Frank Bruni.  KYRGYZ-HORSE-MILK (Teo-Ashoo Pass, Kyrgyzstan) _ Got horse milk? Nogoy Raspayev does. Perched on a rock 11,000 feet up the Talass Alatoo Mountains, oblivious to a wind-whipped drizzle whirling from clouds a few feet above his head, he lifts a bowl to his mouth, drinks deeply, and practically belches an emphatic ``Ahhhh!'' He literally licks his lips. Then he does it all over again. If you were Kyrgyz, you would, too. Horse milk is tasty enough in its own right _ thick, foamy and so much sweeter than cow's milk that even a single cup seems leavened with spoonsful of sugar. More important, though, is that horse milk can be fermented to make kymys, the de facto national beverage _ and a drink with a decidedly equine kick. By Michael Wines.  With a map.  WASHINGTON  (Will move in the ``w'' news file.)  CONGRESS-EXECUTE (Washington) _ The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday endorsed a bill meant to raise the standards of defense lawyers in capital cases and make DNA testing more readily available to those sentenced to death, thereby minimizing the chances that innocent people will be executed. The Innocence Protection Act was approved in a 12-7 vote, with two Republicans, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Sam Brownback of Kansas, joining all 10 Democrats in support. The committee chairman, Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, called the vote ``a watershed'' and said legislation could be passed by both houses of Congress this year or early next year. By David Stout.  NATIONAL GENERAL  (Will move in ``a'' news file.)  DETAIN-HAMDI (Norfolk, Va.) _ Government lawyers have one week to explain why they are holding Yaser Esam Hamdi, 21, an American-born man rounded up with Taliban fighters in Afghanistan without placing any charges against him, a federal judge ruled Thursday. Hamdi was captured in November and later transferred to the Norfolk naval station brig where he is being held in solitary confinement. Federal prosecutors say Hamdi is a captured enemy combatant and they have successfully fought attempts by a federal public defender to meet with him.  CULTURE  (Will move in ``e'' news file.)  ROWING-IN-CENTRAL-PARK (New York) _ One noon in late spring I went to the Lake in Central Park and rented a boat. I glided leisurely on the water. Mallards swam in pairs. Often little fish would jump. My oars made tiny whirlpools. The woods around me seemed 10,000 shades of green; wisps of clouds floated on a perfectly blue sky. I rowed near a cormorant, its ebony feathers glistening in the dancing sunlight. It began to follow me! As I rowed here, there and everywhere, the beautiful bird followed me like a dog. It periodically dived underwater, surfaced and continued to follow. Somewhere near the blossoming lily pads, it left without saying why. When I returned the boat, I told the man who helped me land that I had just had one of the finest experiences in the city. ``It's a shame most New Yorkers don't know about it,'' he said.

"122273"	"you"	"would"	" The result of the first calculation was that your funds would last you about midway through the 25th year if you earned 8 percent returns, began withdrawals at a $66,000 annual level, and gave yourself a 3.5 percent ``raise'' each year to deal with inflation. At that point, you would, of course, still have the assets represented by your home, and presumably that would have grown in value as inflation brought prices upward. But the point is that things would begin looking pretty dim after a quarter-century. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"122867"	"I"	"would"	" Ready-made for MTV, Bowling for Soup's powerful sound and playful style begins with lead singer and songwriter Jaret Reddick. The 30-year-old from Wichita Falls is sort of an edgier version of Matthew Perry's character from ``Friends.'' With his Kool-Aid-colored hair, tattooed legs and towel-snapping sense of humor, he sets the tone for Soup's onstage escapades, which include mooning the audience and constant chatter about beer and bodily functions.

"154520"	"he"	"would"	" Here's an interesting nugget to consider: the plight of Saint Joseph's center Dwayne Jones. He declared for the draft, went through without getting picked, and now, because he did not hire an agent, will return to college for his final season. So, what happens if he turns into Emeka Okafor next season? Will he be a lottery pick? Apparently not. Because he went through the draft and did not get chosen, he would, under the current rules, become a free agent upon leaving campus. That might set up an interesting scenario. A somewhat similar situation exists with high schooler C.J. Miles, who had said he'd probably honor his commitment to Texas if he wasn't picked in the first round. He went in the second round to Utah. The Jazz would still keep his rights, so suppose he shows up in Austin for the next couple years and turns himself into a legitimate All-American. Jazz basketball boss Kevin O'Connor said of Miles, We want him to understand that it's about the next 15 years, not about next year. We didn't spend the 34th pick in the draft thinking he couldn't play. But we want to do what's best for him. Miles said he hasn't made up his mind. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"

"159703"	"he"	"would"	" Little things that most people don't take seriously, he would, Jamison said. He's coming in after a game, that's his practice. Bowling, most guys wouldn't take it as seriously as Gilbert. But he makes it fun. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"

"162096"	"it"	"would"	" Not that it will get very far in Congress. Term limitation is yet another piece of the electoral puzzle in which incumbents, at least currently, hold the upper hand. Because qualifications for members of Congress are set exclusively in the Constitution, it would, under Supreme Court interpretation, take a constitutional amendment to limit U.S. House and Senate terms. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"

"169973"	"I"	"would"	" I'll definitely embrace the long tail when it comes to music, DVDs, funky-colored kitchen mixers and hard-to-find replacement parts for charcoal grills. But when Anderson turns to media and glories in how the rise of the blogosphere and Wikipedia, for example, will revolutionize information-sharing, I get queasy.

"171773"	"I"	"would"	" Until now. In late September, as he spoke to a group of business executives in Massachusetts, a question was posed as to whether he'd like to see an increase in the federal gasoline tax, which has stood at 18.4 cents a gallon since 1993. Yes, I would, Greenspan responded with atypical clarity. That's the way to get consumption down. It's a national security issue. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
