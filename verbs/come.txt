, he said,	 Rock El Casbah is just the latest stunt in a career that has been devoted to provocation and musical cross-pollination. Taha, who has lived in Paris for two decades, is a leader of the current generation of rai musicians, but he is more politically confrontational and sonically adventurous than suave international stars like Khaled and Cheb Mami. To even label Taha a rai singer is a bit misleading; his fierce blend of rai, arena rock, electronica, and agitprop is a genre unto itself -- a kind of postmodern North African dance-punk -- and his new album is his most ambitious: a suite of songs about the chaos that has enveloped the world since Sept. 11, 2001. Tekitoi is among the most eloquent musical responses to that day and its aftermath, certainly the most explicit to emerge from the Arab world. Asked to explain the album's genesis, he said, I dreamed of singing my nightmares. </P> 	nyt_eng_200503.gz
, he said,	 Taha has always been prone to harangues, but Tekitoi is even more blunt than past albums like Made in Medina (2000). He strove, he said, to strip all artifice out of his lyrics and speak directly to the man on the street; his model was Plastic Ono Band, John Lennon's famously unvarnished 1970 primal scream therapy record. But Taha's songs also look back farther, to rai's early 20th-century roots in Oran, the polyglot Algerian port city where he lived before emigrating to France with his family at 10. Rai (which means opinion in Arabic) began in Oran as bawdy, catchy wedding music, but quickly became an outlet for youthful discontent and protest against French colonial occupation. You can hear echoes of that rebel tradition in songs like H'asbu-Hum!, which lashes out at a truly epic list of betes noires: Liars, thieves, humiliators, killers, oppressors, traitors, the envious, the rotters, the diggers, propagandists, destroyers, humiliators, slavers, the lazy/Get rid of them! Ask them for an explanation! </P> 	nyt_eng_200503.gz

, I promise,	 Best known here for his reinvention of Swan Lake as a psychosexual hybrid of Hitchcock's The Birds and an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch catalog, Bourne's brand of storytelling through dance -- in which the themes are adult and the sex is fully acknowledged -- has made his work hugely popular in Britain. We have a lot of people being dragged along for the first time by friends who say, 'I know you don't like dance but you'll enjoy this, I promise,' he said. There's a certain amount of winning over to be done. Sex and humor are important ways of doing it. Because once you've physically reacted, with a laugh or whatever, we've got you. </P> 	nyt_eng_200503.gz
, you know,	 But just as the manservant in Play Without Words turns out to be more powerful than his master, Bourne's not having lived a dancer's rigidly circumscribed life was, despite the loss to his footwork, a boon to his choreographic imagination. I was developing my interest in theater and film and going out and, you know, living a bit, he said. A lot of dance people mature quite late. Their interests are narrow. And then they're often influenced by just one or two particular people they've worked with: That's the style they know inside-out, and it's very difficult to do anything else. That's not my problem! </P> 	nyt_eng_200503.gz
, he said,	 The company eventually came apart, not without acrimony. (Bourne said that his dances were being done without him; he has now bought back the rights to his work from Adventures in Motion Pictures, which went bankrupt.) Regrouping in 2002 as New Adventures -- whose first production is Play Without Words -- Bourne hoped to avoid the unpleasantness that arises when commercial considerations become too dominant, as happened, he said, when Swan Lake came to New York. I felt I was pushed into denying its gay content to the media, he said, with evident embarrassment. Marc Thibodeau, the publicist for the Broadway production, said that he had arranged for plenty of gay press and also had provided television shows with excerpts that emphasized the Prince-Swan duets. Our problem wasn't that it was the gay 'Swan Lake,' he said, but that it was 'Swan Lake'! </P> 	nyt_eng_200503.gz
, he said,	 Bourne may also suffer from a perception that his works are exclusively gay, which isn't altogether surprising when you consider his fondness for pecking swans, beefy mechanics -- and Tchaikovsky. But at their best, his dances are polymorphously perverse; in releasing the latent eroticism between the men, he releases it everywhere, creating what he hopes modern audiences will see as a truer picture of their world, homo-, hetero- and even presexual. (In his Nutcracker, Clara's dream is a sexual awakening: She tests her magical, man-size toy by putting her fingers in its mouth.) The common subject of his works is, he said, the yearning for the beautiful, unattainable person -- which is naturally balletic and yet universally understandable, even for audiences that have lost their taste for 19th-century symbolic drama. I wouldn't be surprised if Bourne ended up directing a terrific TV series someday, a dancing teenage soap opera on Fox -- with hunks but no fairies. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20050310.0343 type=story > <HEADLINE> 'ADULT SWIM': DESTROYING TELEVISION, TOON BY TOON </HEADLINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200503.gz
