Bob Katz, who owns the Nu-Tread tire and auto repair shop on Saratoga Street in East Boston, is marketing his services in a park-and-fly-and-fix package. The pitch is this: Leave your car for repairs; he'll drive you to Logan Airport (a three-minute ride, he says), fix the car while you're gone, and pick you up when you get back. No extra charge for the parking. Katz has former Judge Paul Garrity doing cable TV commercials for him.... Another new Logan parking option: The Days Inn in Saugus (Route 1 southbound) is charging $7 a day for parking in its garage. That's about half what most park-and-fly lots near the airport charge. There's a tradeoff for such a low price, of course: The Days Inn is 20 minutes from Logan, and its shuttle service doesn't run between 11 p.m. and 4:30 a.m. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"

But he is able to make clever real estate deals (he and his partners rent Lotus' 10,000-square-foot space for only $24,000 a month, he says), and he remains a sensible man.

In the early pages of this book, a selection of Fante's work edited by Stephen Cooper, there is, for example, Arturo Bandini, a young man determined to become the world's greatest writer.
