"13097"	"I"	"misspoke"	" When Skaggs recited chapter and verse from the standards' text to challenge her erroneous assertion that they emphasize a single book about a Hiroshima victim in teaching about World War II, she nervously backpedaled, saying, ``If I said that, I misspoke,'' and, ``Maybe I read them too quickly.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"
"151774"	"I"	"misspoke"	" The bottom line is, I misspoke, and I'm sorry if I offended anyone, Schwarzenegger said about his comments Tuesday to a newspaper publishers' group in San Francisco. I meant 'securing' our borders, not 'closing' them. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz

, she said,	 P.S. Downstairs at the party, Angela Lansbury mentioned that the production would be moving to the Broadhurst T heater in New York. In Los Angeles, she said, the legitimate theaters are all downtown, a long way from West L.A., where so many culture lovers live. I mentioned the Disney Concert Hall and she lit up. Remember that she's a woman who's spent a lifetime on the stage, in front of TV and movie cameras, a classic entertainment star, oh all right already, a legend. It has wonderful parking! she said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz

, they say,	 The agents of change on the University of Texas campus think it's a little weird that the editor of The Daily Texan is elected by the student body. That's not how it works in the real world, they say, and it's not good for the paper. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, he says,	 If you care about this, you care deeply. If you don't care -- and many of the 50,000 students on this campus clearly don't -- you're more interested in getting ready for finals as the clock runs out on the school year. Senior Cale McDowell, one of the leaders in the effort to make the editorship appointed by the Texas Student Publications board, says he's researched past attempts to make the switch and was struck by how contentious the issue was. Now, he says, There's apathy across campus. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz

, she does,	 A month after starting school or a new activity, a slow-to-warm-up child is still tentative, taking her time, not fully joining in, until, little by little, she does, says developmental psychologist Myrna B. Shure of Drexel University in Philadelphia. After three months, this child looks like any other. The truly shy child, on the other hand, is still on the periphery three months later, perhaps experiencing stomach aches or other physical symptoms of anxiety. Shure is author of Thinking Parent, Thinking Child (McGraw Hill), which has a section on shy children. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, it vanishes,	 The slow-to-warm-up child feels cautious or uncomfortable in some unfamiliar situations. The period of discomfort can last two weeks, 20 minutes, or 2 minutes. The point is, at some point, it vanishes, says Kagan, who was the first researcher to identify traits in infancy that predict shyness. His newest book, with Nancy Snidman, is The Long Shadow of Temperament (Harvard Press). </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, he adds,	 For teens, Stay involved in your child's life, Carducci says. Be persistent and patient. Talk about how you handle social situations. Bring stories home from work. Talk about your adolescence. The idea is for them to see they are not suffering alone.

, he says,	 Coincidentally, the first Walden production was a collaboration with Cameron on the 2003 documentary Ghosts of the Abyss. Mike planned to produce more historical documentaries, he says, but shifted course when Holes came along and proved successful. Still, the Flahertys hear from skeptics that no matter how good or faithful a movie version is, turning a beloved kids' book into a movie is a bad idea. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, he continues,	 What's thrown in our face is, if it ain't broke don't fix it, Mike acknowledges. But what often drives that complaint is dismay with the way books have been filmed in the past. With Holes, for example, Walden executives were warned that Sachar would be disappointed. When we told them Sachar was writing the screenplay, they started to listen to us, Mike says. If an author doesn't see the potential of making a quality film, he continues, We'll stay away from the book. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, he contended,	 His primary motivation, he contended, was his concern for the lack of support he received from the GOP for funding education. Indeed, the biggest current complaints about the president's highly-touted education program are about its lack of adequate federal funding. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz

, she argues,	 Buster says she uses sunflower oil because she doesn't want the stronger taste of olive oil to interfere with the almonds' flavor. The oil keeps the almonds moist, she argues, and when she tried to market a drier product, at retailer request, it didn't sell well. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, he says,	 In writing about poppy seeds, he refers to Seinfeld character Elaine, who tested positive for drugs after eating poppy seed bagels. The author assures readers that while this is entirely possible, under normal circumstances they need not abstain from poppy seeds. The tiny black seeds won't impair your judgment or driving ability, he says, citing a test by the Oregon State Police Laboratory as proof, and they add delicious nutty crunch not just to bagels but also to many other baked goods, especially that Purim specialty, hamantaschen. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, she said,	 Court security is just not on somebody's radar screen until you have these tragedies, Mary McQueen, president of the National Center for State Courts, told the Associated Press.

, I think,	 A native person is challenged, I think, not to feel on some level a profound resentment toward Catlin; his obsession with depicting Indians has an extremely invasive undertone to it, West says. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, he decided,	 He would paint the Western Indians, as yet unsullied by white civilization, he decided, and attract the support of the government and other interested parties by documenting a truly lofty and noble race. And at the same time he would forge for himself a commercial success. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, he said,	 With his wife and young family, he moved to St. Louis. There he met William Clark, of Lewis and Clark expedition fame, now superintendent of Indian affairs in the West. In 1830 and '31 Catlin accompanied Clark on trips to treaty signings with various tribes and thus began, he said, his Indian project. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz

, they whisper,	 The flashy newcomers, the old guard grumbles, give raucous celebrity parties in their own exclusive, gated enclave; because almost all of the screenings take place south of Canal Street, with many at the 11-screen Regal Cinemas Battery Park Stadium complex, midtown Manhattan moviegoers unaccustomed to venturing south of Houston Street must go out of their way to attend. Besides, they whisper, isn't the TriBeCa Film Festival really a business opportunity masquerading as civic boosterism? And doesn't its avowed goal of helping revive the economy of Lower Manhattan after 9/11 smack a little of entrepreneurial piggybacking on a catastrophe? </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz

, he said,	 About one passage, in which the two hands play in contrary motion, he said, approvingly, Like a car crash! and he added: We used to take drugs to be able to hear Phil's music. Just letting it wash over you was what was so radical and so liberating. I can't tell you how often I lay on my back in a loft somewhere and let that happen. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, he said,	 He went on to reminisce about the early years of his friendship with Glass, back in the days, he said, before SoHo was SoHo, when it was just industrial New York. It was a moment of extraordinary loft culture, he said, in which artists, dancers and musicians all intermingled and, in effect, put on shows for one another. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, he added,	 What these artists had in common, he added, was that they were all working on the relationship of the part to the whole and within a very severe set of restrictions. For me the idea of a musical portrait has to do with the sense of connectedness that was always there -- the belief in a system and the joy in limitation, he said. It was a belief that in part had to do with the political structure of the country then, with every institution being questioned. You just wanted to purge your work and see what was left. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, he said,	 To the degree that the piece does capture some of the spirit of Close, he said, it is less a matter of conscious reflection than of shared experience. I've known Chuck very well and over a long period of time, he said. I knew him when he got married and when he had children and when he had the illness and when the children went away to college. I was married to a painter who died some years ago, and after she died he came to the house and -- with some effort, he was in the wheelchair then -- we looked at her work together and he advised me what to do with it and so forth. And so we've been, I think -- to copy a word he said -- we've been embedded in each other's lives. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20050421.0136 type=story > <HEADLINE> 36 HOURS IN: OAK PARK, ILL. </HEADLINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, he was,	 The two men made an odd couple. Beebe was a celebrity scientist with a taste for adventure. At the New York Zoological Society, where he ran the department of tropical research, he was prized for his ability to raise money from rich patrons and attract publicity, primarily through the popular magazine articles he wrote about his expeditions.

, she said,	 Last year, when the feisty filmmaker Michael Moore and his Bush-bashing documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 were a focus of controversy, California State University at San Marcos revoked an invitation for him to speak on campus. The Associated Press reported Thursday that Moore has struck back, establishing the Michael Moore Freedom of Speech Scholarship to give $2,500 each to two Cal State San Marcos students who have done the most to fight for issues of student rights by standing up to the administration. The first winners of the annual award are to be announced in June. Karen Hynes, the president of Cal State San Marcos, revoked the invitation last fall because, she said, the school was prohibited from spending state money on partisan political activity. In October, Moore spoke off campus, where he announced plans to establish what he called a hell-raiser scholarship. A Cal State San Marcos spokesman, Rick Moore (no relation), said, Moore has the right to do whatever he wishes to do, and we're glad to see another scholarship available to students who go to our school. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20050421.0152 type=story > <HEADLINE> CLONES AND EMOTIONS IN ART </HEADLINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz

Their first inclination, I think, would be: Of course bring it to a major distributor.

This is more suited to the smaller distribution companies; let's take it to Lions Gate or Newmarket.' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
