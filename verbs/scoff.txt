FOLEY-UNION-(Seattle)_ Former House Speaker Thomas Foley has agreed to oversee the first union election of farm laborers in Washington.

(Story will move in the `f' category.)  ROCK-QUEENSRYCHE-(Undated)_Seattle-based Rock group Queensryche has added an elaborate multimedia show to its tour. It combines actors, costume changes, videos, a light show and live ``satellite'' cameras that follow the musicians around the stage. It's also designed to withstand inclement weather at outdoor concert venues, called ``sheds.''  BY GENE STOUT. (Story will move in the `e' category.)  VIRTUAL-DENTISTS-(Undated)_ Dentist-phobes may recognize this scene:  Reclining in the chair and bracing for the drill, you see a poster of some peaceful nature scene on the ceiling, taped there to calm you.

He has new tricks in his office to help patients relax.  BY VANESSA HO.
