"7486"	"she"	"agrees"	" Ms. Francois, a co-producer of the American version of ``Nine Months,'' doubts that ``Neuf Mois'' will ever be released in the United States, since it would be almost unprecedented for a foreign film to be picked up for distribution after its remake was released. Also, she agrees, French comedies are a tough sell, even in their virgin forms. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199410.gz"
"9949"	"she"	"agrees"	" Although Lily (Ms. Cole) loves her Manhattan employers, the career-driven Towlers, she agrees, albeit reluctantly, to help her brother Booker, who is in debt to a mobster, burglarize the place. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"
"16722"	"he"	"agrees"	" He wants to change the subject. Do I notice the man sitting in the dark corner of the cafe sipping coffee? The man who looks slightly sinister? That man gave information to the Nazis during the war, the cafe owner tells us. There are others, too. Yes, he agrees, it was 50 years ago. ``But we remember these things.'' Like many small French towns, Eugenie-les-Pres has old war wounds, still unrepaired a half-century later. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"
"36877"	"she"	"agrees"	" After a long walk in the sun, the Chama, though silty, is too inviting. A barebottomed _ baptismal? _ plunge is called for, and friend Aurelio is game. ``Wooooo!'' we screech like coyotes. Must be 50 degrees. But it's a good hurt, she agrees, floating in the lustrous vise of the canyon with a rising tissue paper moon as witness. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"55622"	"she"	"agrees"	" Sure, she agrees, it's unfortunate that Hollywood doesn't generate more work for actresses in her age bracket, but Dickinson doesn't wallow in self-pity. ``Yeah, I'd like to work more, but there's only so many roles and there's a lot of women to fill them.'' She suspects she was not the first choice for the ``Sabrina'' role and has no illusions about her performance. ``That's a role that anybody could have done,'' Dickinson allows. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"
"55644"	"he"	"agrees"	" ``I dare not say I am creative,'' he said modestly. But being open-minded, he agrees, allows him to generate ideas more easily. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"
"70973"	"she"	"agrees"	" The biggest new problem, she agrees, is arranging psychological counseling for victims and sometimes their families, particularily Spanish-speaking families. But they all have needs. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"
"70998"	"she"	"agrees"	" The biggest new problem, she agrees, is arranging psychological counseling for victims and sometimes their families, particularily Spanish-speaking families. But they all have needs. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"
"119433"	"she"	"agrees"	" So her sophomore major label release, 1995's ``Only Everything,'' turned up the volume, blasted distortion, and alienated fans with cryptic lyrics. One song included on ``Gold Stars'' _ ``Fleur de Lys'' _ is sung in French. Hatfield was, she agrees, trying to push the world away. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"119789"	"he"	"agrees"	" After much coaxing, he obliges with a careful, detached analysis that doesn't mention those offending arms until Elizabeth calls his attention to them. Yes, he agrees, much to her perverse satisfaction; they're a little flabby. Kevin, for his part, worries out loud about the condition of his abdominals and frets that his personal trainer helped him to accumulate bulk instead of the leanness he desired. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"131010"	"he"	"agrees"	" Ron Kobeleski, played with nicely gradated credulousness by Dylan Haggerty, is an out-of-work video cameraman dozing through his days in San Bernardino, Calif. When Walter Ohlinger (Raymond J. Barry), the 60-ish loner who lives across the street, asks for Ron's help with a video project, he agrees, but only because he needs the money. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"144159"	"he"	"agrees"	" The two meet cute Breillat-style when the girl desultorily takes a razor blade to one of her wrists in the bathroom of a gay disco. After the guy helps with her wounds, she propositions him: In return for money, he will spend four evenings with her. Glazed with boredom, stupidity or perhaps just numb from all that dancing, he agrees, and the unlikely duo embark on a round of anguished talk and some bad sex. Editorial discretion limits what I can say about the carnal encounters, save that they are graphic, at times clinical in aspect and awkwardly choreographed. Unpleasure rather than pleasure is the name of Breillat's game, which I assume explains the already-infamous scene in which a garden tool suddenly appears where no garden tool should. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
