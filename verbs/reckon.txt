, he said,	 CHOLO-STYLE (New York) _ Patricio Gasia, 20, flaunts his own brand of street cred, one part hip-hop two parts cholo, which is slang for the Mexican-American gangster style that originated in East Los Angeles. His street-tough look, a composite of oversize T- shirt, visored cap and pastel-tinted rosary, was enhanced by his bicycle, a low and streamlined trick bike, customized with baroque metallic flourishes. Gasia, a busboy who works in Spanish Harlem, spoke last week through a friend and interpreter. His style ``comes from people of color but with a Latino twist,'' he said. The idea is to look, he said, ``chingaso _ ready to fight, like a gangster.'' Gasia is among a wave of young Mexican-Americans in New York who have imported the East Los Angeles outlaw look, though not necessarily the lifestyle, from the West Coast. In cities across the country, young Latino men and some women are picking up on the same trend, incorporating elements of cholo into their street garb, conferring on the style an authenticity that commends it to the would-be hip.

You're getting richer.  Howard Dean, who turned 55 on Nov. 17, used the occasion to spend quality time with a group of very special people in his life: anyone willing to donate $55 to attend a rally at the Capital City Brewing Co. in Wach)fgton. (Technically, it was a ``suggested'' donation.) Beer was not included, so the 375 suds-seekers ran their own tabs.  Dean, the former Vermont governor, may have gotten the Birthday Bucks idea from Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, who used his 57th birthday (Oct. 8, for you fellow Libras) to organize a national fund-raising effort at, of course, $57 a pop. ``We played it big on the Web as it was approaching,'' said Kucinich's campaign adviser, Jeff Cohen. ``We got boatloads of checks.'' The day's take totaled $70,281. No word on the tally of cards with bad jokes.  Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts turns 60 on Dec. 11, but there will be no piddling $60 gifts. His 300 guests are expected to pony up $250 to $2,000 each at a Boston fund-raiser.  Gen. Wesley K. Clark, meanwhile, turns 59 on Dec. 23 _ a little close to Christmas for maxing out on gifts, as he must have sadly learned long ago, but his staff says they're making plans anyway.  WATCH WHERE YOU PUT THAT ADVERB  To keep their boss's ego in check, members of Sen. Charles E. Schumer's staff have adorned his ulMetin board with a memento of his speech at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard in November: a copy of the two-page biography handed to the audience.  After listing the achievements of this ``dedicated public servant'' and ``trailblazing leader'' and ``tireless advocate,'' Schumer's biographer in Boston intended to insert a word bemoaning the senator's admiration for the New York Yankees, but the word was inserted in the wrong sentence. So the saga of his political career ended on a less than triumphant note: ``In 1998, unfortunately, Schumer became New York's junior seve President Bush ``a one-way bus ticket back to Crawford, Texas.''  The trouble is, there is no bus to Crawford, where Bush has a ranch and would presumably retreat after his stint in the White House. Greyhound's closest station is in Waco, 18 miles away, and Waco's local bus service, known as the Hop, stops at the city limits.  There are three options if Dean gets his wish and sends the president ridin' the dog to Waco. Bush could leave at 1:50 a.m. and arrive the next afternoon at 2:50, making 29 stops but only one transfer. Or take the 9:30 a.m. bus, cutting the trip by three hours and 45 minutes but requiring three transfers _ which would complicate work for his Secret Service busmates. Or leave at 11 p.m. on the shortest route, although it includes two overnights, landing in Waco _ remember, he still needs a ride to the ranch _ at 7:30 a.m., two days after leaving Washington.  Bush can take solace in the tradition that departing presidents get a final ride home on the presidential airplane. But there appears to be no specific constitutional impediment to alternative transportation on Greyhound One.  INSTANT RESPONSE, BY COMMITTEE  It's traditional for candidates to bombard one another during the campaign, but so far President Bush is leaving that messy work to a noncandidate, the Republieffort by the White House to balance two goals: keeping Bush above the grimy day-to-day fray of campaigning while making sure no Democratic attack goes unanswered.  So it was that when the Democratic presidential candidates debated in Des Moines, Iowa, on Monday night, the RNC was churning out news releases through the afternoon, pointing out all the things Bush's would-be opponents were doing wrong. More than a few found their way into the morning newspapers.  And for the sake of the television cameras, the chairman of thecglmittee, Ed Gillespie _ who races to rebut the Democrats even though, last we checked, he is not running for president this year _ was on hand to bash the Democrats.  An inquiry to the Republican National Committee about why it, rather than Bush's well-financed re-election campaign, was responding to the Democratic presidential candidates turned up this explanation: The debate was put on by the Democratic National Committee, so therefore the Republican National Committee should have the chance to respond. By that logic, since MSNBC helped sponsor the debate, perhaps Fox executives should have been there with their own critique.  AWARDS OF THE WEEK  Least Illuminating Botanical Lesson: A presidential candidate is expected to utter banalities with the passionate conviction of Moses on the mountain, but sometimes even an orator as polished as the Rev. Al Sharpton can't get away with it _ especially when he has already said it at least once before. When asked during the Des Moines debate whether he favored sending $87 billIon0to Iraq, he replied, '``Absolutely not,'' and p2gceeded with a thundering explanation of why no further good could come from a war fought in error: ``I've said before, I'll say again: You can't plant watermelon seeds and expect oranges.'' The connection between $87 billion, watermelons and the Iraqi desert remained unclear at debate's end.  Best Use of Tautology: Sen. John Kerry, normally not the most deft of debaters, got one of the least promising questions in Des Moines. ``Senator Kerry, what about the French?'' asked Tom Brokaw, the moderator. ``Are they friends, or are they enemies, or something in between?''  It seemed unanswerable, but Kerry, who has been accused of looking French himself, s|7;228:9321ffs on a Gaulois to denounce American vulgarity, he replied with a trans-Atlantic insult. ``The French,'' he explained, ``are the French.''  As the audience laughed, Brokaw tried challenging him _ ``Very profound, Senator'' _ but Kerry knew he had nailed this one.  ``Well, trust me, it has a meaning,'' he said, ``and I think most people know exactly what I mean.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20031129.0012 type=story > <HEADLINE> A PROUD MUSSOLINI REFUSES TO LET GRANDPA BENITO BE VILIFIED </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> ROME  (BC-ITALY-MUSSOLINI-800&amp;A) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200311.gz"
