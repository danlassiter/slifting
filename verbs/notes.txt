Monday night's postcard is from Bombay, described by James as India's ``boom town of 12 million'' with more people arriving every day. First off, he notes, ``this place is hot.''

(HLW) By LAUREL GRAEBER c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  A FISH IN THE WATER: A Memoir  By Mario Vargas Llosa. Translated by Helen Lane. Penguin, $14.95.  The author is best known as a novelist, but he had a brief career as a politician. He explores both roles in this memoir, which describes his formative years as well as his 1990 run for president of Peru. The campaign was a debacle, but many predicted Vargas Llosa would use the experience to write ``a good book,'' Alan Riding said here last year. ``And he has.''  HEADING WEST  By Doris Betts. Scribner Paperback, $12.  Nancy Finch, an unmarried librarian, is the kind of woman nothing happens to. That is, until her vacation in North Carolina is interrupted by an armed man, who kidnaps her and proceeds to drive toward the Grand Canyon. Issues of responsibility and accountability arise as Nancy realizes she has become a silent partner in her own abduction. Just restored to print, this 1982 novel offers pleasures ``infinitely more subtle, complex and memorable than being scared in your armchair,'' Beth Gutcheon wrote in these pages when it was published. She added, ```Heading West' is a book of great delights.'' Ms. Betts's collection THE ASTRONOMER AND OTHER STORIES (Louisiana State University, $11.95) is also in print again. Many kinds of innocence are lost in these pieces, including, in the title novella, that of a retired man who has assumed he is beyond fantasy and desire. In 1966 our reviewer, Benedict Kiely, said the author ``displays equally a rich imagination and disturbing vision.''  A NEW WORLD: An Epic of Colonial America From the Founding of Jamestown to the Fall of Quebec  By Arthur Quinn. Berkley, $15.  A historian details the many ways in which early America's idealism was either squelched or non-existent. (John Smith's character, he notes, was not exactly as it is portrayed in Disney's ``Pocahontas.'') ``His book is a scrumptious reminder of the pleasures of historical writing that rises to the level of literature,'' George F. Will wrote in the Book Review last year.  ARABIAN NIGHTS &AMP; DAYS  By Naguib Mahfouz. Translated by Denys Johnson-Davies. Anchor/Doubleday, $12.  Many folk and fairy tales have a dark side, and this Egyptian Nobel laureate finds one throughout ``The Arabian Nights.'' (Scheherazade's marriage to a lecherous murderer was hardly a happy ending.) His retelling can be read as a ``daring and biting critique of the corruption of power in the modern Middle East,'' one critic said earlier this year. The same publisher has reissued Mahfouz's novel THE HARAFISH, translated by Catherine Cobham ($11), which depicts the fate of numerous generations of a family whose roots are in what Americans might call the underclass (and Arabs call the harafish). In 1994, one reviewer described it as ``a whirling dervish of a good yarn.'' More Arabian tales can be found in DAMASCUS NIGHTS, by Rafik Schami, translated by Philip Boehm (Scribner Paperback, $11). In 1959, a great Syrian storyteller, struck mute by witchcraft, can regain his voice only if he is given seven unique gifts _ which turn out to be stories. The author ``writes with wisdom, wit, and lightheartedness,'' Malcolm Bradbury said here in 1993.  TRUE NORTH: A Memoir  By Jill Ker Conway. Vintage, $12.  The author, who wrote of her childhood in the Australian outback in ``The Road From Coorain,'' turns here to her adult challenges in a different wilderness: academia. She ``has come a long way from the parched fields'' she grew up in, Carol Brightman wrote in these pages last year. A woman's journeys are also the basis of AN UNSPOKEN HUNGER: Stories From the Field, by Terry Tempest Williams (Vintage, $10). This Utah-based writer and naturalist explores her own connections to the earth and those of women like Georgia O'Keeffe and Rachel Carson. In 1994, our reviewer, John Hanson Mitchell, praised the book's ``dark strength and power.''  ONE TRUE THING  By Anna Quindlen. Dell, $6.99.  The narrator, a young journalist named Ellen Gulden, has to confront both the loss of her mother and the accusation that she ended her ill parent's suffering. As the novel depicts Kate Gulden's final days, ``the reader cannot help caring about her, and mourning her death,'' Frederick Busch said in the Book Review last year.  HENRY ADAMS  By Ernest Samuels. Belknap/Harvard University, $16.95.  This book, a revision and abridgment of the author's 1964 Pulitzer Prize-winning three-volume work, shows its subject to be more appealing as a historian and writer than as a human being. ``It is a complete success'' and ``a remarkable feat of the biographer's art,'' Hugh Brogan wrote in these pages in 1989.  OUT OF SILENCE: An Autistic Boy's Journey Into Language and Communication  By Russell Martin. Penguin, $11.95.  Speaking is so natural to most people that it is rarely remembered that every conversation is the result of a complex neurological process. The author writes of just how difficult it was for language to take hold in his autistic nephew's seething brain. The result is ``deeply moving,'' F. Gonzalez-Crussi said here last year.  THE TRIBE OF TIGER: Cats and Their Culture  By Elizabeth Marshall Thomas.  Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $12.  Felines, by no means all aloof or solitary, are revealed in their complexity by the author of ``The Hidden Life of Dogs.'' Whether writing of the cougar or the house kitty, ``Ms. Thomas has an astute sense of the meaning of every meow,'' our reviewer, David Quammen, said in 1994. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950924.0036 type=story > <HEADLINE> REPUBLIC NEW YORK TO BUY BROOKLYN BANCORP FOR $529.6 MILLION </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> New York, Sept. 24 (Bloomberg) (BC-REPUBLIC-BROOKLYN-BANCORP-BLOOM) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"

We celebrated being young until we weren't young anymore, and now we celebrate getting older, as if it were our idea, as if we had a choice in the matter. Dowling finds many causes for joy. Women entering their 50s today are, she notes, generally better educated, more independent, more financially self-sufficient and more involved in community affairs and politics than previous generations of midlife women. She compares the 50s with adolescence, a jumping-off place, a time full of ``wild, unknown possibilities ... that unique mixture of fear and excitement.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"

Images of Bronstein eating her lunch _ a meal that included a somewhat sloppy peach _ were broadcast throughout a Letterman show in September, says a story in the New York Observer. For the two weeks following, Letterman continually showed the peach-eating segment, calling the unidentified eater such things as a ``seductive temptress.'' As his studio audience cheered the image, Letterman asked that the woman step forward. At one point, he even broadcast her picture on the Times Square Jumbotron, asking her to call an 800 number.  Bronstein's suit said that Letterman's actions, which ``publicly ridiculed and vilified her,'' were violations of a New York State right-to-privacy law.  Letterman stopped broadcasting the image as soon as he was contacted by Bronstein's lawyers, but did not respond to the lawyer's request for an apology, a promise that the shows would not be rebroadcast and money for damages.  Letterman's lawyers cited ``fundamental protections'' guaranteed by the First Amendment, and said that ``the law does not recognize any claims for hurt feelings.''  Harvey Rothberg, lawyer for the plaintiff, told the Observer that his middle-age client suffers from the effects of childhood polio, spinal fusions and a thyroid condition.  ``In other words,'' said Rothberg, ``they picked the wrong woman. This lady has been a victim all her life, and now she's a victim of David Letterman. And it should be stopped.''

A buyer for the company is expected to be announced by the end of March, said Eduardo Bours Castelo, Fresh Del Monte's chief executive officer, in an interview in Mexico City.  The government acquired Del Monte last year when it seized the assets of Carlos Cabal Peniche, who held a 7 percent stake in its parent company and controlled Del Monte's management and operations. Cabal is wanted for embezzlement and has fled the country.  Del Monte, with 1995 sales of about $1.1 billion, is the world's third-largest banana producer after Dole Food Co. of Westlake Village, California, and Chiquita Brands International Inc., of Cincinnati. One of the better known brands in the U.S., the name was trademarked by a California packer in 1891. Latin American Satellite Rocket Explodes  Xichang, China, (Bloomberg) -- A Chinese rocket carrying an Intelsat satellite exploded as it was being launched today, delivering a blow to a group including Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and Tele-Communications Inc. that planned to use the spacecraft to beam television signals to Latin America.  ``We're in a risky business. These things happen from time to time,'' said Irving Goldstein, director general and chief executive of Intelsat.  The China Great Wall Industry Corp. provided the Long March 3B rocket for today's failed launch of a satellite built by Loral Corp. of New York for Intelsat.  It carried 40 transponders and would have had a primary broadcast footprint that extended from southern California through Central America and from Colombia to northern Argentina in South America.  Bogota, (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp.'s Colombian division said 1995 profit fell 20 percent in U.S. dollars because of high interest rates and a strong Japanese yen.  GM-Colmotores said net income declined to 45.6 billion pesos, or US$46.2 million, from 47.6 billion pesos, or US$57.4 million, based on 1994 exchange rates.  Sales rose in peso terms last year, to 621.8 billion pesos from 551.6 billion pesos in 1994. Sales declined 5.3 percent in dollar terms, reflecting the Colombian peso's 19 percent decline against the dollar. Regent Calls on GT Shareholders to Oust Board  Santiago, (Bloomberg) -- Regent Kingpin Capital Management Ltd called on shareholders in the GT Chile Growth Fund to push for the resignation of GT's board, following Regents takeover bid for the fund.  The board refuses to do so, said Bryon Ousey, spokesman for GT Capital Management Ltd, which owns the fund. ``Our position is unchanged,'' Ousey said. ``The board is still very determined to ensure equal treatment for all the shareholders.''  The GT Growth fund is the second-largest foreign investment fund operating in Chile, managing assets of $372 million. Regent's plan to sell off the fund's holdings, announced last month, has hurt Chilean stocks in recent weeks, analysts said.  Regent said its earlier takeover bid for the fund has the support of 67.23 percent of the shareholders. Venezuela 1996 Budget Totals $16.9 Bln  Caracas, (Bloomberg) -- Venezuela's government proposed a 1996 budget of about 4.90 trillion bolivars ($16.9 billion), with a deficit equal to 3 percent of the gross domestic product.  The budget will be presented to Congress for approval on Feb. 22, officials said.  Congress rejected the government's first proposal last fall, forcing the government to roll over the 1995 budget.  If Congress and the government can't agree this time, the 1995 budget will remain in place for the rest of the year, officials said.  The 1995 budget pegged spending at 2.79 trillion bolivars. The 1996 budget represents a 76 percent increase. Inflation was 57 percent last year.  Caracas, (Bloomberg) -- Banco de Venezuela SA said the government will sell the country's second-largest bank in May at the earliest.  A minimum bid price of 60 billion bolivars (US$206.8 million) to 80 billion bolivars has been set, officials said. The sale will require government approval, bank officials said.  Banks from Europe and South America have expressed interest in Banco de Venezuela, officials said.  Banco de Venezuela, the nation's oldest bank, was seized by the government in August 1994 because of solvency problems.  Lima, (Bloomberg) -- The Peruvian government sold state-owned steel manufacturer Siderperu to a group headed by Acerco SA for $193 million in cash and securities.  Acerco's bid, made with a Peruvian bank and an unidentified U.S. company, won out over rival Aceros Arequipa SA, the only other bidder.  The government had set a minimum price for Siderperu of $136 million, including $80 million in cash, $26 million in Peruvian debt, and a four-year investment commitment of $30 million, of which perhaps one-third will be for environmental clean-up.  Located in Chiclayo harbor, 160 miles north of Lima, Siderperu is Peru's sole manufacturer of rolled steel. It shares the cast steel products market with Aceros Arequipa.  In 1994, Siderperu produced 270,000 tons of molten steel, below its 1986 historic level of 360,000 tons, and last year it sold 24,000 tons of steel, a 50 percent increase over 1994, for $150 million.  Santiago, (Bloomberg) -- A fine imposed on Telex-Chile SA by regulatory authorities doesn't justify the recent slump in the company's share price, Lehman Brothers analyst Matthew Hickman wrote in a report.  Telex owns Chile's third-largest long-distance telephone company, Chilesat SA.  Shares in Telex tumbled 17 percent to 1890 yesterday after regulators fined the company's management and directors for inaccurately accounting for one-time gains of $8.9 million.  Investors were concerned the allegations would hinder Telex's plans to form a strategic alliance with an international telecommunications company.  Sao Paulo, (Bloomberg) -- Cia. Brasiliera de Distribuicao said 1995 earnings more than doubled on higher sales and lower costs.  Brazil's second-largest supermarket chain, known as Pao de Acucar, said net income rose to 75.24 million reais (US$77.43 million) from 30.3 million reais in 1994.  Net income was 1.08 reais per 1,000 shares, compared to 5.11 reais per 1,000 shares in 1994. Pao de Acucar split nonvoting shares 10 for one and increased common shares by more than double in 1995. Shares are frequently listed in lots of 1,000 in Brazil.  Revenue increased 15 percent to 3.17 billion reais from 2.76 billion reais. Sales at stores open for more than a year increased 21 percent, the company said.  Lima, (Bloomberg) -- Peru's gold miners expect the country to lead South America in gold production by the year 2000, thanks to stepped-up exploration and lower production costs.  ``Exploration investment this year in Peru will be at least $100 million,'' said Jaime Urranga, president of Consorcio Minero Horizonte, which operates in Libertad, Peru's second-largest gold-producing area.  Gold exports totaled 50 metric tons (about 1.76 million ounces) in 1995 and should reach 60 tons this year, Urranga said. South Africa, the world's largest gold exporter, shipped 500 tons in 1995.  Bogota, (Bloomberg) -- At least 11 banana workers were killed in northern Colombia after armed men forced them off a bus and shot them, police said.  Several people were reported injured in the shooting. Police did not provide a specific number of injuries.  The incident occurred in the northern region of Uraba, where repeated clashes involving guerrillas, ex-guerrillas and paramilitary groups have taken place.  The killers are suspected to be members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the largest guerrilla group in the country, Col. Livardo Molino of the national police told Colombian radio. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960214.0612 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-SPOT-BUDGET-BOS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> For Release THURSDAY AMs, February 15, 1996  The Boston Globe plans to move the following stories for use by NYTimes News Service clients.

Includes a 100-word sidebar By MARIANNE JACOBBI c.1996 Family Circle (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) (Editor's note: The name Dan Cooper has replaced a real name.)  Rebecca Wentz was a l5-year-old honor roll student when she fell in love for the first time. It was March 1991, her freshman year at Quakertown Community High School in Pennsylvania, and she'd just started dating Dan Cooper, a popular junior, 17, from the next town.  At first, things with Cooper were great. But six months after they started dating, he began to show a different side, insisting Wentz not talk to other guys. Wentz thought that meant Cooper loved her.  As the months passed, he became more controlling, telling Wentz what to wear and constantly checking up on her. He also became aggressive, roughhousing with her in jest.  Although his behavior intimidated Wentz _ Cooper was, after all, a 180-pound bodybuilder _ she accepted it as normal.  The first time he hurt her, in the fall of 1991, she was late picking him up from wrestling practice.  ``He was so upset he pushed me on the ground in front of his friends,'' Wentz recalls.  Shocked and embarrassed, she wondered how someone she loved, someone she'd been intimate with, could treat her that way.  Cooper later apologized and vowed never to do it again. Soon however, he was lashing out at Wentz whenever she made him angry. Each time Cooper assaulted her, Wentz forgave him.  ``I always felt it was my fault,'' she says. ``I shouldn't have walked that way, dressed that way, talked to that person.''  She stayed with him for nearly two years. A SILENT EPIDEMIC  ``Teen-age dating violence is where domestic violence was 10 years ago,'' says Adolph Montana, a counselor at project PAVE in Denver, which helps teen abusers and victims.  In fact, one in four teens in the United States is involved in an abusive dating relationship, according to David B. Sugarman, professor of psychology at Rhode Island College.  What's more, they may be starting a cycle of violence that never ends.  ``It's toxic,'' says Carole Sousa, head of the Dating Violence Intervention Project in Cambridge, Mass. ``Without intervention, these kids are headed for more of the same.'' THE LURE OF LOVE  How can smart, successful young women like Wentz fall under a violent boyfriend's spell? Many girls are attracted to abusive boys because they're initially charming and romantic _ they sweep girls off their feet, explains therapist Barrie Levy, co-author of ``What Parents Need to Know About Dating Violence'' (Seal Press, 1995).  For other girls, especially very young ones, the attraction stems from a lack of experience and from peer pressure. Many teens are learning about intimacy for the first time, Sousa points out.  Levy, who has worked with battered women for 20 years, has seen girls as young as age 12 involved in abusive relationships because they feel pressure to have a boyfriend _ any boyfriend.  ``So many of them have told me that they'd rather keep seeing a guy, no matter how much it hurts, than be without him,'' she says.  But every minute a girl remains in an abusive relationship, she risks her future _ and her life.  ``The experience hinders her academic development and her career choices,'' Sousa says.  It also puts her in danger, because dating violence, like marital abuse, escalates over time. According to the FBI, 29 percent of all female murder victims in 1993 were slain by a boyfriend or husband. THE ISOLATION TRAP  The typical pattern of teen violence starts with verbal and emotional abuse.  ``Then the boy tries to put a wedge between the girl and her parents, so that her source of support is unavailable,'' Sousa explains.  That's exactly what Cooper did. Wentz had always been close with her parents. But once she started seeing Cooper, that all changed.  ``Rebecca used to confide in me,'' says Regina Wentz, Rebecca's mother. ``All of a sudden, she stopped communicating. And if I said `no' to her about something, she'd go out of control, yelling and screaming.''  Rebecca began staying out past curfew, and her grades dropped as well. Her parents weren't quite sure what to make of her behavior; they thought Rebecca was simply rebelling. The possibility that she was being beaten by her boyfriend never occurred to them _ nor does it occur to many other parents.  Family Circle magazine's 1995 survey of mothers and daughters, conducted with YM magazine, found that while 31 percent of mothers report that their daughter has been hit, shoved or verbally abused by her boyfriend, 53 percent of the teen-age girls who responded report having been abused in one of these ways.  What's more, 56 percent of mothers don't believe that any of these abusive behaviors has ever happened to their daughter at all.  Regina Wentz and her husband didn't learn the truth about Rebecca and Cooper until 18 months after the two had started dating. Rebecca was home one afternoon in November 1992 with her 12-year-old brother, 14-year-old sister and Cooper.  She and Cooper were arguing about his abuse when a friend of his suddenly burst into the house and attacked Rebecca and her sister Rachel.  ``He told me. `If I can't hurt you, I'll get someone who can,''' Rebecca says.  Cooper and the attacker fled.  ``My heart was in my throat,'' Regina says of the scene she discovered when she came home moments later. Rebecca had surface cuts on her hand and Rachel's stomach was bruised.  Regina called the police, who didn't press charges against Cooper, because he hadn't hit the girls. But they gave Rebecca the number of a battered women's shelter. She called their hotline, entered individual counseling and joined a support group.  For the first time, she was able to reveal her painful secret and break free of Cooper for good.  Now a sophomore at Rollins College in Florida, Wentz speaks out against dating violence at high schools and colleges. THREATS AND FEAR  Another reason teen-age girls tolerate abuse is fear that their boyfriends' threats of serious harm _ or even death _ will be enacted if they tell someone or end the relationship.  In Wentz's home state, Pennsylvania, teens can obtain restraining orders from the courts. But that's not the case across the country. In most states such orders are not available to those under age 18. A person has to have been married, lived with her partner or have had a child with him before she can obtain one.  However, the future looks bright for Wentz, because girls who leave their battering boyfriends and get professional help are destined for healthier relationships.  ``Most girls become acutely aware of the warning signs of abuse after having been through it,'' Levy says. They can also determine much sooner if a relationship has turned bad. MEDIA RESPONSIBILITY  ``Kids learn from many of today's movies and music videos that women are objects to be dominated and degraded,'' Levy says, who lays part of the blame for dating violence on the media.  ``Because teens have less experience in intimate relationships than adults, they're more apt to fall for these Hollywood images and to see hitting, verbal explosiveness and jealousy as signs of love.''  Alcohol and drug abuse have also been strongly linked to dating abuse.  ``They aren't the cause of the violence,'' Sousa says, ``but they are two of the ways abusers give themselves permission to lash out.''  Unlike his former girlfriend, Cooper faces a shaky future. He hasn't followed through with counseling.  ``Unless an abusive boy gets help, he may be on the road to becoming a lifelong batterer,'' Levy says.  Violence operates like ``an addictive behavior,'' she explains. ``Once you let go of the inhibition to strike, it gets easier to do it again and again.''  Wentz is convinced Cooper is still abusing other young women. Sousa and other experts are optimistic, however, that teen batterers can change.  ``They should have a better chance of stopping their destructive tendencies than do older men because the longer and more frequently one uses violence, the harder it is to give up,'' Levy says.  Parents need to be educated because discussing the issue openly with sons and daughters is the best way they can safeguard their children.  ``You need to talk with your kids about healthy relationships so that they know the qualities to look for and exhibit,'' Levy advises.  Most of all, parents need to stop thinking of teen dating as puppy love and start taking it much more seriously because no one's daughter is immune. SIDEBAR: WARNING SIGNS  If you notice several of the following red-flag behaviors or signals, it could indicate that your daughter is in a violent relationship.  1. She's stopped seeing friends or has given up favorite activities.  2. She has fallen behind in school.  3. She is suddenly hostile and secretive.  4. She is moody, withdrawn or depressed.  5. Her boyfriend is possessive and jealous of other boys, her girlfriends and her family.  6. Her boyfriend keeps tabs on her.  7. Her boyfriend uses alcohol or drugs.  8. She seems afraid of her boyfriend and fears breaking up with him.  9. She has bruises she can't explain.

By NANCY K. AUSTIN c.1996 Working Woman magazine (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Years ago, an executive with a reputation as a superb judge of talent told me his ``secret'' to hiring the right people: He picked good drivers. About halfway through an interview, he would toss the keys to his Taurus to the astonished applicant and suggest a short spin around the neighborhood.  The executive figured that the way the candidate responded _ first to the invitation, then to whatever the trip might offer _ was a reasonable indicator of how she would handle the stresses and surprises of business.  Of course, there was nothing at all reasonable about the driving stunt, but even managers who would never dream of doing such a thing will confess to using a few offbeat strategies to smoke out the real person behind the tailored suit and word-perfect resume.  They try to trick people by asking gimmicky questions: If you knew you had only a year to live, what would you do differently? If you were an animal, what would you be? Can a man legally marry his widow's sister? (Hint: If a man has a widow, he's too dead to marry anyone.)  Or they go in search of the inner applicant using personality tests: When you have to do something unpleasant, would you rather do it all at once, or an inch at a time?  Or they try to find what a candidate is really made of by conducting the dreaded ``stress interview,'' in which a half-dozen executives surround the applicant, barking out questions and interrupting any attempts to answer. (It's a method favored by certain consulting firms, investment-banking houses and cops. Intimidation, not enlightenment, is the goal here.)  Now, though, a few companies known for getting the most out of their people, including Kraft Foods, Delta Air Lines, AT&AMP;T and Procter &AMP; Gamble, are seriously rethinking the way they size people up.  They've learned the hard way.  ``There is absolutely no correlation between how well you interview and how well you perform on the job,'' says Nicholas Corcodilos, managing director of the North Bridge Group, an executive search and consulting firm based in Lebanon, N.J.  ``Managers keep hiring on the basis of personality rather than ability to do the job.''  Wait a second. Isn't doing the job the point of the whole exercise?  It should be, Corcodilos says, but ``employers and candidates alike tend to get lost in the formalities of the interview. These include a slew of standard questions that are almost meaningless, except that they produce a lot of anxiety.  ``Interviewing is not about where you see yourself in five years. It is not about your weaknesses or your strengths. It is not about your most challenging experience or greatest accomplishments. Interviewing is about the job.''  And achieving that focus, as Corcodilos explains in ``The New Interview Instruction Book'' (North Bridge Press, 1994), means reinventing the interview process. (The book, hard to find in stores, can be ordered with a call to (908) 236-8440. It will be published by Dutton next spring.)  ``The new interview,'' Corcodilos says, ``is a hands-on, at-work meeting between an employer, who needs to get a job done, and a worker, who is fully prepared to do the job during the interview.''  For this new model to work, both sides have to be prepared. The payoff for the employer is a more reliable judgment about a candidate's value to the organization.  It's not hard to understand why companies are embracing this new approach: Old-fashioned recruiting and selection methods can't keep pace with corporations' rapidly changing needs.  That's why Mary Kay Haben, executive vice president of the pizza division at Kraft Foods, spends so much time thinking about the questions she and her managers ask.  ``We work hard to focus our questions on the job that has to be done,'' she says.  That means lots of open-ended inquiries to get beyond the canned responses that, let's face it, applicants are sick of giving and interviewers are sick of hearing: What decisions have you made that you wish you could take back? How do you motivate others?  Haben quizzes candidates on mini case studies.  ``I'll describe a situation and ask, `How would you handle this?''' In other words, she lays out a real live business problem, then steps back and watches the prospect tackle it.  She also relies on ``multiple data points,'' reactions from five or six Kraft managers who individually interview the same roster of candidates, then meet later to compare notes.  ``In the old days,'' she says, ``everybody followed the resumes and asked exactly the same things. That doesn't happen anymore.''  For job applicants, then, homework is mandatory. No more breezing into an interview relying on charm and a good line of patter. The new-style interviewer expects serious candidates to demonstrate an understanding of the company's operations, its standing in the market and its strategic and tactical problems.  Yes, applicants have to recommend ways to improve the company's products or services, but they must also be ready to explain how they'd turn their recommendations into action.  There are, of course, those diehard interviewers who never met a gimmick they didn't like. They're the clods who take a smart, well-prepared candidate to lunch and volley their toughest questions at her when she's working on a mouthful of baby greens with walnut-raspberry vinaigrette.  Or they'll drive by a candidate's house to see if the lawn is neatly edged and the car is washed.  Roger Dow, vice president and general sales manager of Marriott Lodging, has no patience for that sort of nonsense.  ``If you play games,'' he warns, ``you'll hire a group of game-players.''  In the interviews he conducts, Dow sticks to actual business issues.  ``I always pose a live situation,'' he says. ``I might say, `Here's one of the biggest challenges we face in our business: The competition is consolidating. What can we do about it?'''  The candidate he's looking for will present at least the broad outlines of a solution that will have a favorable impact on profits. If she doesn't have a solution, she should be able to show how she'd find one _ fast.  That's not to say that the new interview is all about function, and that personality doesn't count. Showing that you belong, that you are motivated and enthusiastic, is still as important as demonstrating that you can do the work.  To make sure you're conveying that impression, Reiko Hasuike, president of Decision Quest, a Los Angeles-based consulting firm that specializes in jury selection, strongly recommends that interviewers, particularly women, take a hard look, preferably on videotape, at what they do during an interview.  ``Women nod a lot when an interviewer speaks and men don't,'' she observes. ``Women often smile more, and they have a rising intonation at the end of a sentence. In the end, it makes them subservient.''  But don't overcompensate, Corcodilos warns. He's seen too many women who have picked up ``men's terrible interview habits, such as having an overly forceful handshake or trying to be too clubby.''  ``The most successful women I know in business have ignored the traditional male back-slapping. These women focus on what really matters: getting the job done profitably,'' he adds.  And being a woman isn't necessarily a liability in an interview.  ``When women make direct eye contact,'' Hasuike says, ``when they lean forward to ask a thoughtful question during the interview, it is very persuasive.''  In the end, you only have to remember a few simple rules. If you're in search of a job, you must be able to demonstrate to a would-be employer that you can do a broad range of work, not just meet the bare minimum of the job description.  To do that, focus on the work during the interview. (Not that you should tear up your resume. Part of focusing on the work is talking about how you tackled similar assignments earlier in your working life.)  Talk about specific tools _ market research, computer technology, the skills of your team _ that you'd bring to bear on a problem. And be ready to detail how your approach would affect profitability.  As for employers, they have to assess every ounce of capability and keep one thing uppermost in mind: the ability to solve a problem _ to do the job.  If the candidate can make a convincing display of that ability, it's time to ask the least gimmicky question of all: When can you start?  (Nancy K.

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Brett Butler in a scene from ``Grace Under Fire.'' By JEANNE WOLF (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Brett Butler knows how to make an entrance.  The star of television's ``Grace Under Fire'' sashays into a suite at a trendy Beverly Hills hotel clad in a blue miniskirt and tailored white-silk blouse, proclaiming in her throaty Southern drawl, ``Now, don't I look just like Lois Lane?''  In fact, Butler looks fetching as she gives her blond hair a toss and settles back to talk about her new autobiography, ``Knee Deep in Paradise.'' The book, published by Hyperion Books, has earned her respectable reviews from critics who confess they weren't aware that the former stand-up comedian turned TV star could write as well as she can make an audience laugh.  ``People who say, `How could you write like that?' haven't been with me for the past 20 years when I've been writing until 4 a.m.,'' she says with a smile.  ``I'd been staying up late writing stories, but not about myself. Suddenly one night I thought, `I'm going to have to tell my story.' And that was the hardest one of all to tell.''  Butler's book is a disarmingly honest, bittersweet memoir spanning a gothic Southern childhood dominated by the disappearance of her eccentric father, who abandoned the family when she was 4.  ``I spent the first 20 years of my life waiting for two men I was reasonably certain would never come back _ my dad and Jesus Christ,'' Butler writes. ``I don't wait for them anymore. My dad anyway.''  Butler never really knew her father. She learned most of what little she knows about him after he died by reading a collection of books which he had owned, which had handwritten notes filling the margins.  Yet when she sat down to write ``Knee Deep in Paradise,'' she says, his presence suddenly became palpable.  ``I was separated from my husband at the time,'' she recalls, ``and I was sitting in a rented house in the Hollywood Hills. As I began to write I felt his presence in the room. I knew it was my dad.  ``But then I went, `Wait, this person is too happy to be my dad.' Then I remembered what my godfather had said to me: `If you write a book, your father, wherever he is, will be insufferably proud.'  ``I don't know whether I believe in reincarnation,'' she says, ``but I guess at that moment I believed that a relationship gone bad between a parent and child can be healed posthumously.''  After Butler had written her book, one of her sisters sent her recently discovered audio tapes of her father doing comedy routines.  Everyone who has heard the tapes has been astounded by the similarity between the two, she says. ``His voice is deep like mine _ they keep saying, `That's you, Brett!'''  Though her mother remarried when she was 6, Butler's childhood with her four younger sisters was hardly idyllic.  ``I remember, and I didn't put this in the book,'' she says, ``that when I was 11 I went to a mental-health clinic because I felt under a lot of pressure and I really needed to talk to someone.  ``I said to this counselor, `My mom is really depressed, she sleeps late and I have to get my sisters ready for school and I don't know what to do.'  ``And the woman looked at me _ I'll never forget it _ and said, `Who are you to judge your mother?'  ``That unleashed something very adult in me that came out like, `Yeah, up yours, sister.' I wasn't about to let this mean broad abuse her power rather than showing me a little compassion. And that was the beginning of my growing up.''  ``Knee Deep in Paradise'' unflinchingly recounts Butler's teen-age forays into alcohol, drugs and sex.  ``I tried to spare everyone the most graphic stuff,'' she says. ``It's `tell all but don't tell everything.'  ``For a lot of years I was pretty low because I never seemed to be with anyone who saw the potential in me, either spiritually or emotionally. Eventually you have to forgive yourself and try to crawl back.''  Butler doesn't shy away from what have become the most sensational aspects of her story. She writes frankly about drinking to the blackout point night after night and searching for affection by having sex with a string of men in a string of towns she can hardly remember.  At age 20, Butler tried to settle down in a marriage to Mike Wilson, but she writes that it disintegrated into beatings the day after she walked down the aisle. After three years of abuse, she got a divorce.  While Butler's second marriage to attorney Ken Ziegler has sometimes been marred by discord, it has endured.  ``We were separated 10 or 12 months out of the first year of the TV series,'' she says. ``Then we got back together and I began to realize that if I had to choose between the career and the money or Kenny, I'd take Kenny in a heartbeat.  ``During the time that I was fighting with the producers of `Grace Under Fire,' when things were really going badly, I said to Kenny, `Look, if push comes to shove, let's sell the house and go to Tucson. I'll wait tables and keep on writing bad poetry. I'll probably have to shave my head so the tabloids won't recognize me and write stories about the recluse I've turned into.'  ``And without taking a beat, Kenny said, `Just say the word, Brett.' And suddenly I felt like I was on a mountain with fresh wind blowing around me _ knowing that I was with somebody who believed in me enough to let me walk away from all the Hollywood hype.''  With the difficult times on her series behind her, Butler thrives on her weekly appearances as Grace Kelly, a blue-collar heroine whose sassy sense of humor helps her to survive as a divorced mother with three kids.  ``If I can do 30 reasonably good minutes of TV every week, if it's a good show _ not even a great show _ and it's a show that matters to people, then I feel like I'm giving something back to the audience,'' she says. ``And that's a good feeling.''  ``Grace Under Fire'' survived Butler's creative differences with executive producer Chuck Lorre, who departed last season, and has continued to hold its own in the ratings. Now, Butler reveals, a cast change may be in the works.  ``Allen Autry wants to leave,'' she says. ``He's got a shot at a show of his own. He's been a real anchor. His character Rick has given Grace someone to play off of that really showcases her strength and sassiness.''  In the final episode this year, she notes, ``Rick asks Grace to marry him and move to Alaska. Actually, I'd like to see Grace meet some big strong New York guy and move to the Big Apple. I'd just like next season to be a little lighter and funnier.''  As for her real life, so vividly portrayed in ``Knee Deep in Paradise,'' Butler says, ``I wish I were a different person, but this is really the way I've lived.  ``Just the telling of it was cathartic. I just have to keep trying to explain to people that I did those things, but I swear I never lost my sense of humor.  ``I'm OK,'' she says. ``Really, I am.'' c.1996 Pentacom Productions  (Jeanne Wolf, who is based in Hollywood, reports on the entertainment industry for television, radio and print outlets.) ------------------------------------------------- </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960513.0110 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-CHARLIE-SHEEN'S-NEW-`ARRIVAL'-PAGEUP-ART-NYTSF) </DATELINE> <TEXT> CHARLIE SHEEN: WALKING ON THE MILD SIDE?

By CINDY PEARLMAN World rights except Chicago (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Charlie is being an angel.  Talking on the car phone in his black Mercedes as he weaves through downtown Los Angeles at rush hour, Charlie Sheen says he's a new man.  Later he will talk about drinking, dating porn stars, getting tattoos and patronizing prostitutes, among the other elements that made the past year of his life ``a living nightmare.''  But right now, Sheen wants it known that he is really ``just a normal, boring guy.'' In the middle of a divorce, he insists, ``I'm not even dating. I don't have a date tonight.''  That may be hard for those who followed Heidi Fleiss' prostitution trial to believe. Sheen testified that he'd spent more than $53,000 on 27 visits from Fleiss' employees.  It hasn't made life easy. Sheen was watching the Academy Awards ceremonies when host Whoopi Goldberg joked about how many of the female nominees had played hookers and prostitutes.  ``How many times did Charlie Sheen vote?'' Goldberg quipped, and the audience roared.  ``I was watching the Oscars and I leaned over to my brother Emilio (Estevez) at that moment and said, `Wow, that is kind of a roast,''' Sheen recalls.  His extracurricular notoriety is part of the reason that he is no longer respected as a serious actor, as he was back in his days starring in ``Platoon'' (1986) and ``Wall Street'' (1987).  ``I don't get the opportunities I think I deserve,'' Sheen admits. ``They've forgotten me. But all it takes is one movie to remind them.''  Sheen hopes that one movie will be ``The Arrival,'' opening May 31. In it, he plays Zane Ziminski, a radio astronomer who has been listening to cosmic noise for years. Then one night he finds a shock wave that leads him to believe aliens have landed.  ``I did the movie because it was different for me,'' Sheen says. ``That's what we're all striving for. Originality, right?''  A minute later, he adds, ``I could use a hit. There's no denying it.''  That Sheen is even contending for a hit is surprising in its own right. The past year got so bad that at a press gathering for ``The American President'' (1995), his father, actor Martin Sheen, appealed to a table of journalists for their support.  ``Pray for Charlie,'' Martin Sheen said. ``Pray for my boy. He has appetites that get him into trouble.''  ``Dad was incredibly supportive and very helpful,'' Charlie Sheen says now. ``He's a good guy in a crisis. He's a good guy, period. There isn't a whole lot he hasn't dealt with.''  This year didn't start off any better than the last one. On Feb. 19, Sheen announced that he was divorcing his wife, Donna Peele, after less than six months of marriage.  ``Well, I think it could have been a lot worse,'' he says of the divorce. ``We parted as friends. We've maintained communication. And we both understand that it was the best thing for both of us.  ``I just didn't want to turn around in 10 years and (realize that) the coolest decade of my life, my 30s, had just drifted away in misery,'' Sheen says. ``I think you've got to make quick decisions. You recognize something is wrong and then you've got to move on from there. That's pretty much what I did.''  In April, Sheen pulled perhaps his most unexpected move yet: He announced in a national magazine that he had found God.  ``I'm a born-again Christian,'' he says. ``Now I've found God. I'm so tired of walking alone. I really wanted something to believe in and embrace. I'm looking for a faith lift. In L.A., you don't run into many of those.''  This new spirituality, Sheen says, has made him clean up his life. Gone are the days of visiting strip clubs, dating porn stars and getting tattoos.  And drinking? Is Sheen sober now?  ``What's your definition of sober?'' he demands. ``I give myself one night a week. I mean, come on. You can have a little bit of fun.''  Born Carlos Irwin Estevez, Sheen never had it easy, he says, from the moment of his birth.  ``I was born a blue baby,'' he says. ``I had the umbilical cord wrapped around my neck. I was almost born dead. I like to believe that my soul was in limbo and looking for some entry point, and then I picked who I wanted as parents.''  Sheen grew up visiting his father's movie sets and decided as a teen-ager to go into the family business. By the time he was 15, he had produced and directed more than 200 short films on Super 8 and video. Most starred starring the neighborhood kids _ a not-so-obscure lot including Sean and Chris Penn, Rob and Chad Lowe and Sheen's brother Emilio.  Sheen made his professional debut in a 1975 TV movie, ``The Execution of Private Slovik,'' and then made his first big-screen appearance in 1984's ``Grizzly II: The Predator.''  His critically acclaimed performance in Oliver Stone's ``Platoon'' put him on the Hollywood map, and he followed it with another solid dramatic role in Stone's ``Wall Street.''  ``That seems so long ago. What was I, like 7, when I made those films?'' Sheen says sadly.  For whatever reason, his career derailed, with turkeys such as ``Courage Mountain'' (1989), ``Navy SEALS'' (1990), ``Men at Work'' (1990, co-starring Estevez), ``Cadence'' (1991, directed by Martin Sheen and co-starring Charlie Sheen's brother, Ramon Estevez) and ``The Three Musketeers'' (1993).  Even his hits were critically panned, including ``Young Guns'' (1988), ``Major League'' (1989) and ``Hot Shots'' (1991).  Nor did the actor show a good eye for hot scripts. Woody Harrelson's film career has largely been based on scripts that Sheen turned down, beginning with ``White Men Can't Jump'' (1992).  ``I thought it was reverse racism, to tell you the truth,'' Sheen says. ``That's an issue with me and we shouldn't get into it.''  Then Sheen rejected ``Indecent Proposal'' (1993).  ``I didn't really believe the story,'' he explains. ``I mean, who'd give up one mil to elephants at the end of the film after he sold his wife for the bucks? I didn't buy it.''  But it's his off-the-camera antics that have earned Sheen such a bad public image. Recently, for example, he made headlines by being seen with Kato Kaelin, the controversial houseguest/witness in the O.J. Simpson case.  Sheen says he's still hanging out with Kaelin.  ``People give Kato no credit for his intelligence, his wit and his charm,'' he says. ``What did Kato do? I'm just curious. I seriously thought about taking out a full-page ad in the L.A. Times with the headline, `What Did Kato Do? Nothing.'''  Sheen could certainly afford it. His troubles haven't translated into Hollywood blackballing. He made $5 million for ``The Arrival,'' and this summer he will film ``Most Wanted,'' in which he plays an investigative reporter who bonds with a prison escapee.  Sheen says he would drop his price to do a prestigious film such as ``Leaving Las Vegas'' (1995) or ``Pulp Fiction'' (1994).  ``Absolutely, I want to get serious again. It's about acting with me and not about my flaws du jour,'' he says. ``I wish Hollywood would realize that. I mean, look, the last few years had a couple of hiccups. It's all going to be good again. I just have to focus.''  In fact, this very drive might help him achieve his goals, since he's on the way to meet with director Barry Levinson, creator of ``Diner'' (1982), ``Rain Man'' (1988) and ``Bugsy'' (1991). Levinson has a hot project, and Sheen wants to get involved.  ``Can't give the title,'' he says cagily, ``but it could be big.''  It's probably not the proposed big-screen version of the 1970s TV hit ``Charlie's Angels.''  ``That's a negative,'' Sheen says. ``I'm too young to play Charlie. I mean, can you see me and these three beautiful women detectives?''  Well, now that you mention it ...  ``It might be a little too obvious,'' he says, laughing. c.1996 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.) ------------------------------------------------- </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960513.0111 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-ENIGMA-OF-ENDOMETRIOSIS-PAGEUP-NYTSF) </DATELINE> <TEXT> THE ENIGMA OF ENDOMETRIOSIS: A PAINFUL DISORDER CAN BE TREATED (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448, or by fax her at 816-822-1444.) By GREG BEAUBIEN c.1995 Chicago Tribune (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  For 20 years, Kathleen Klages suffered from painful periods. By the time she was 30, they had become sheer torture.  ``On the first day of my period I couldn't go to work,'' she recalls. ``I'd turn white, break into a sweat and double over in pain.''  People told her not to worry, that menstrual pain was normal. But it turned out that her cramps were caused by endometriosis, a disease in which the tissue that lines the uterus grows outside the uterine cavity.  Endometriosis afflicts an estimated 5 million women in the United States, and probably many millions more worldwide. And though medical science has progressed in its understanding of the disorder, the cause of endometriosis is still a mystery.  ``It remains an enigmatic disease,'' says Dr. Edmond Confino, a reproductive endocrinologist at Chicago's Northwestern Memorial Hospital. ``We agree that it's treatable, but in many cases incurable.''  Several theories attempt to explain the cause of endometriosis. One theory is that tissue from the uterus escapes into the pelvic cavity during menstruation.  Another speculates that a defect in embryonic tissues causes some women to be born with endometriosis.  Still another theory suggests that environmental pollutants such as a dioxin may play a role in the disease.  Endometrial growths _ also called implants, lesions, nodules or tumors _ can form inside a woman's fallopian tubes, on the outside of her uterus or ovaries, and even on her pelvis, bladder or intestines. Growths sometimes appear on lungs, arms or thighs, but only rarely.  Like the endometrium (the tissue that lines the uterus), endometrial growths are fueled by estrogen, a female sex hormone. But unlike the endometrium _ which builds up, then sheds during the monthly menstrual cycle _ endometrial growths have no way to leave the body. Instead they become inflamed, causing pain, internal bleeding and the formation of scar tissue.  Sometimes the growths rupture, spreading endometriosis to other areas of the body. Depending on where it forms, scar tissue can accumulate and block the reproductive organs or intestines. Scar tissue can also interfere with the function of the bladder.  Endometriosis usually strikes women in their 30's and 40's but can occur much earlier. Symptoms of the disease include painful menstruation and sex, heavy menstrual bleeding and infertility. Painful bowel movements and other intestinal problems can also occur.  According to the Endometriosis Association, a research and education organization based in Milwaukee, such symptoms tend to worsen over time but sometimes follow a pattern of remission and recurrence.  About 40 percent of women with endometriosis experience some degree of infertility, according to RESOLVE, a national consumer organization for people trying to have children. But, like other aspects of the disease, the relationship between endometriosis and infertility isn't fully understood.  One theory is that scar tissue blocks the fallopian tubes and prevents eggs from coming into contact with sperm.  Women with endometriosis can have children, but they might need help from technology such as in vitro fertilization (IVF).  ``It really depends on the woman's age and the condition of her ovaries,'' Confino says. ``If she's 40 and has severe endometriosis, her chances of having a baby are dismal unless she has assistance.''  Klages, who's now 33 and works as a scrub nurse, managed to have a baby despite severe endometriosis. She and her husband, Gary, had been trying to conceive for several years before she was diagnosed with the disease.  She later endured three corrective surgeries and two miscarriages. The couple were on the verge of giving up when she became pregnant again.  ``It was real scary,'' Klages says. ``We were worried about another miscarriage. We asked ourselves, `How long can we keep doing this? Maybe we have to accept that having a baby is not meant to be.'''  But in early 1995, Klages gave birth to her son, Garrett. And in November she learned she was pregnant again.  Infertility is a major issue with endometriosis, but for some women, pain is the bigger problem.  ``I see just as many endometriosis patients with pain concerns as with reproductive concerns,'' says Dr. Charles Miller, a reproductive endocrinologist at the Center for Human Reproduction in Chicago.  ``It can totally incapacitate women (and keep them) from their jobs and families.''  Mary Lou Ballweg is the president of the Endometriosis Association. In 1979, after years of vibrant health, she became ridden with the disease.  ``I had to crawl to the bathroom,'' she said in a recent interview. ``The major accomplishment of my day was to take a shower.''  But fortunately for victims of endometriosis, medical and surgical treatments of the disorder have significantly improved.  ``We defined the disease much better in the '80s, and there have been a couple of treatment advances in the '90s which are very exciting for patients with endometriosis,'' Miller says.  Using an outpatient surgical technique called laparoscopy, doctors can remove endometrial growths without making a large incision or leaving an obvious scar.  The laparoscope is a long, slender device that enters a woman's abdomen through a small incision _ about half an inch long _ and allows the surgeon to see what's inside. The surgeon then uses a second slender instrument to remove endometrial growths.  But even laparoscopy doesn't always solve the problem of endometriosis. Recurrence of the disease forces some women to have multiple surgeries over a period of years.  Ballweg had a hysterectomy and her endometriosis still returned.  ``Even the most aggressive surgical approach won't cure everything,'' Confino says. ``It doesn't address the cause of the disease.''  He cautions that surgery should be used judiciously, because of the risks of scarring and damage to the internal organs.  In addition to surgical advances, drug treatments for endometriosis have also improved. Lupron, for example, can shrink endometrial growths by temporarily interrupting estrogen production.  But the drug is notorious for its side effects.  ``Lupron slams you into menopause,'' says Kathleen Fitzgerald, a 42-year-old nurse who's long suffered from endometriosis and today runs a support group at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.  Within three weeks of starting her Lupron prescription, she was having 25 hot flashes a day, plus night sweats, insomnia, headaches, mood swings and depression. Lupron can also cause vaginal and skin dryness, and shrinkage of the breasts.  According to Miller, a healthy diet can help reduce the spread of endometriosis. He recommends that women with the disease eat plenty of organically grown fruits and vegetables.  But before any kind of treatment can begin, women must first secure an accurate diagnosis. And that can be challenging, because some male doctors still don't take women's health complaints seriously.  Fitzgerald, for example, went to a succession of doctors before she found one who gave her a laparoscopy and diagnosed her endometriosis.  ``The other ones told me it was all in my head,'' she says.  According to Ballweg, it takes women with endometriosis an average of 10 to 15 years to be diagnosed. Doctors often tell them that the pain is normal, that having a baby will make it disappear or that the pain is imaginary and the woman should see a psychiatrist.  ``It's a very tough disease to treat,'' Ballweg says. ``Don't leave it up to your doctor. Get active. You need a specialist and you need to do your homework.''

By PAUL WOLF From Diversion c.1996 Paul Wolf (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  Like many prospective home buyers, Dr. Alice Bradley (not her real name), had locked in a favorable mortgage rate one month prior to closing the deal on the house of her dreams. A few weeks later, the usual reams of paperwork were in order and she was looking forward to inking the transaction.  That's when the mortgage lender called. It seems that Bradley's credit history had turned up some negative information _ late car payments and credit card installments. She was stunned. She knew that she always paid her bills on time and never carried a balance on her credit card.  This story, recounted by John Ventura, a Houston lawyer and author of ``The Credit Repair Kit'' (Dearborn Financial Publishers, 1996), has a mixed ending. Bradley straightened out the problem _ a credit bureau had her confused with a deadbeat who was also named Bradley.  She got her mortgage, but unfortunately the lenders' 30-day commitment to provide the advantageous mortgage rate had expired because of the delay, and Bradley got a new one that was one-quarter of a percentage point higher. That's a hefty 30-year penalty to pay for someone else's error.  Bradley's story highlights an important but little-understood aspect of our consumer-driven society: When it comes to your bill-paying history, Big Brother not only watches, but also makes mistakes with disturbing frequency.  If you pay all your bills in cash and never intend to borrow money to expand your practice, buy a house or a car, or send your kids to college, feel free to ignore this article. If not, read on.  There are three major credit bureaus: Equifax in Atlanta, TRW in Layton, Utah, and Trans Union in Springfield, Ill., along with dozens of smaller outfits across the country. According to Ventura, they collect about two billion pieces of credit information a month and generate about 550 million credit reports a year on 180 million consumers.  Of those reports, as many as 40 percent are estimated to contain mistakes. Given these numbers, it's easy to see how details can get fouled up on your report.  Credit bureaus receive information from creditors around the country _ banks and credit card companies are the most familiar, but anyone who provides goods and services in expectation of payment fits in that category, including utility companies, airlines, department stores and such professionals as physicians and lawyers.  Ventura says many mistakes occur because the system has been overwhelmed in recent years by the vast expansion of credit and credit reporting. In addition, he notes, the burden of discovering and correcting these mistakes often falls on the consumer _ there are no stiff legal or regulatory incentives forcing the bureaus to clean up their acts.  A little knowledge and vigilance can go a long way toward keeping your credit history from derailing or delaying your financial goals.  The first course of action is painfully obvious but often neglected: Pay those bills on time.  Ruth Susswein, president of BankCard Holders of America, a nonprofit consumer group, says that ``(professionals), with their busy schedules, can often fall behind inadvertently _ either because they have delegated bill-paying tasks to someone who isn't following through, or through simple neglect.''  And while it's quick and easy to accumulate black marks for late payments, the opposite is true for getting rid of them. Depending on the bureau, records of payments that are 60 days late or longer will linger on a credit report for four to seven years, according to Susswein.  Of course, a few such late payments, in the absence of other serious negatives, won't necessarily cause a lender to balk. But they will likely prompt the lender (especially for bigger loans) to require a written explanation as to why those marks are there _  a headache you can obviously live without.  Bear in mind that credit bureaus have nothing to do with evaluating the information they provide _ that's the lender's job, and they all have different standards.  Many experts suggest consumers undergo a routine credit checkup through one of the three big bureaus once a year. TRW provides one free credit report to consumers per year; the others provide them at nominal cost, typically about $8.  Alternatively, if you think you have a black mark from a particular creditor, simply ask what bureau (if any) the company provides information to, and then request a report. Some services offer credit reports to consumers for a fee.  If you don't check your credit once a year, Susswein recommends that you at least do so two or three months in advance of any loan for which you expect to apply.  ``That way the information will be timely, and not so far in advance to have dated information in it,'' she notes. By doing this check you can preempt the kind of snafu that delayed Bradley's closing.  A more sophisticated form of safeguard planning is especially applicable to married professionals, Ventura notes. If one spouse is taking out a loan, say to start a business, the other spouse _ if at all possible _ should not cosign the loan.  ``The natural inclination for married couples is to jointly sign everything,'' Ventura says, ``but that should be avoided. That way if, for instance, a doctor starts a practice that doesn't work out, or is overwhelmed by debts from school, his or her spouse's credit remains untouched.''  This advice particularly applies when one spouse starts a small business, which usually faces long odds. Note, however, that for bigger loans, such as a mortgage, usually both spouses will have to sign.  What happens when you catch a mistake on your credit history? Send the credit bureau a certified letter, noting that you wish to dispute the record. Be sure to enclose a copy of the credit report in question on which you've highlighted the erroneous charge, and provide any supporting information, such as a letter from the vendor.  The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that credit bureaus respond to written requests within a ``reasonable'' time. TRW and other credit bureaus try to respond within 30 days, according to Maxine Sweet, vice president for consumer affairs at TRW.  However, Ventura advises consumers to be especially assertive. For example, your creditor may have supplied erroneous information that has resulted in the black mark on your record. When the credit bureau investigates your complaint, ``The credit bureau is likely to accept the creditor's word, not yours,'' Ventura says.  ``And in doing so, the credit bureau will not be violating the law. Resolving credit record problems may require patience and persistence.''  If you encounter resistance, legal action against a credit bureau is always a possibility, Ventura notes, but there are things to consider. For example, simple negligence, as in Bradley's case, isn't enough for a lawsuit, even though she suffered damages. The bureau must have been unwilling to rectify its mistake _ which they did, even though it was after her mortgage was delayed.  A critical consideration is cost: Is the amount in question enough to justify hiring a lawyer?  Another tactic is to send copies of your correspondence to the Federal Trade Commission and the state attorney general, and let the bureau know you are doing so. The bureaus are eager to avoid bad publicity, so they may be more responsive.  Should you decide you do want legal assistance, try contacting the National Consumer Law Center for a referral.  One other caveat. If you have serious credit problems, be very skeptical about credit repair companies that tout their ability to clean up the slate. Such firms typically claim that they can ``wipe out bankruptcies and other negative information in your credit record'' or use ``little known loopholes'' in the law to help.  These claims are untrue, Ventura says, and they often require that you deceive the government by fraudulently obtaining a new social security number.  ``Only time or successful negotiations with a creditor can erase negative information,'' he notes.  If, after learning the basics, you conclude that credit maintenance is a big pain, perhaps it's best to be philosophical. In a society that thrives on spending, borrowing and consuming, credit bureaus are a necessary evil. -0- SIDEBAR: FIVE STEPS TO PRISTINE CREDIT  1. Pay your bills on time.  Creditors have an unblemished stream of timely payments. Don't deny them this pleasure.  2. Don't be a frequent applier.  Applying repeatedly for credit cards within a short period of time may be a ``poor credit'' signal to a lender. Similarly, keeping open large lines of credit may make it more difficult to obtain an important loan.  3. Be yourself.  Is it John, Jack or Johnny? Catherine or Cathy? Junior or not? Be consistent when filling out credit applications so the credit bureaus have one less avenue of possible error.  4. Don't cosign if you don't have to.  Keep your credit history separate from your spouse's as much as possible. That way, if one of you runs into financial difficulty (real or apparent), the other's credit resources can serve as a backup.  5. Stay in touch.  If you are experiencing financial difficulties that may affect your ability to keep up with your debts, discuss the problem with your lender. You have nothing to lose and may gain more favorable terms. -0- SIDEBAR: WHERE CREDIT IS DUE Major credit bureaus:  _ Equifax (known as CBI in some areas): Office of Consumer Affairs, P.O.

By SHAWN HARTLEY HANCOCK From Healthy Kids c.1996 Shawn Hartley Hancock (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  Andrew and Stephanie Prince brought home a 4-pound Maltese puppy named Lucy two years ago when their daughter Olivia was just 3. With a small child and two busy careers, the Princes hardly needed the extra work, but they knew how the presence of a loving animal in the family would be a great advantage for their daughter.  ``Any pet, but certainly a dog, is a tremendous responsibility,'' says Andrew Prince, a New York City ophthalmologist and father of two. ``It needs love, affection and proper training. But there's just more love to get and more love to give when you add a pet to your family.''  To be sure, kids and pets belong together. For many children a pet is more than just an animal _ it becomes a close friend. Children who grow up with a well-trained, well-loved pet have an opportunity to learn many important lessons and values, including the boundaries of good behavior, loyalty, responsibility and the fundamentals of the life and death cycle.  A close and loving relationship with the family dog or cat _ as playmate, coach, comforter or protector _ is one of the most satisfying your child will ever have. But for the child and pet combination to succeed, everyone in the household must agree to take responsibility, beginning with the parents.  That means getting the right pet at the right time, and making a commitment to its care, training, feeding, grooming and exercise. CHOOSING THE RIGHT PET  ``Acquiring a pet takes a lot of planning and forethought,'' says Garry Gardner, a pediatrician in Darien, lll., whose household includes two children, a dachshund, a gerbil and a cockatiel.  ``Whatever you do, don't get an animal on the spur of the moment, no matter how much your child pleads.''  When choosing a family pet, there are several factors to keep in mind before making an informed and humane decision. Here are a few to consider.  _ The kind of commitment you are willing to make to the pet.  Before getting a pet, consider the needs of the animal carefully. How much time and attention will it require? How much money will you need to spend on food, veterinary care, training, grooming and pet supplies? Realistically decide whether or not your family can meet these needs.  _ Your lifestyle.  Consider the environment you live in. Do you have a house with a big fenced-in yard? Do you live in an apartment building with no park nearby? Your home environment will have an impact on the type of pet you choose and how well you'll be able to care for it.  _ The timing of the acquisition.  The worst time to get a pet is when your family has just moved to a new home or during holiday season, when the house is unusually chaotic. The best time is when everything and everyone in the home is stable _ no one's pregnant, on maternity leave or in between jobs.  Any animal needs time to adjust to its new environment, and that's especially tough if the home is in transition.  _ The age of your child.  The best time for a child to acquire a dog or a cat is after age 5.  ``Toddlers aren't able to restrain themselves sufficiently with an animal, and too often either the child or the animal gets hurt,'' says veterinarian Jane Leon, co-author of ``Becoming Best Friends'' (Berkeley, 1993).  But if you'd like your younger child to experience the joy of having a pet, choose an animal that requires little attention, is easy to care for and can be easily and humanely confined.  A low-maintenance animal, such as a fish or guinea pig, makes a nice first pet for a little one. You can put the tank or cage in your child's room where he can observe it. Be sure your child understands, however, that he may hold or touch the animal only when you are there to supervise.  _ Your family's health concerns.  If your child or a family member has asthma or allergies, find out how she will respond to the type of pet you are considering before you acquire it. Spend time at the home of relatives or friends who have a similar pet beforehand, if possible.  You can also minimize the allergens in your home by bathing an animal frequently and restricting it to certain rooms.  Non-furry pets, such as fish, may be a better choice for children with asthma or allergies.  _ The animal's temperament.  When choosing a pet for small children, consider the breed of the animal as well as the animal's temperament. If you're getting a dog, for instance, you could select a larger, more placid animal, such as a Labrador or golden retriever, says Dr. Stephen Zawistowski, senior vice president and science adviser at the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), in New York City.  ``Despite their size, these dogs are not rough with kids and can take the physical insults that kids are known to hand out,'' he says. (For more information on child-friendly pets, speak with a reputable breeder, counselors at an animal shelter or an animal-welfare organization, such as the ASPCA).  Even the gentlest dog or cat, however, can occasionally bite or scratch a child. If your child is bitten or scratched, clean the wound thoroughly with soap and water and call your pediatrician. Also make sure your child's immunizations are up to date.  ``Even the smallest wound, if left untreated, can be dangerous,'' Leon says. HOW KIDS CAN HELP  Once you acquire a family pet, your child can help to water, feed, groom, train or walk it. Caring for a pet teaches a child important lessons in responsibility and can give him the satisfaction of nurturing another living being.  Young children, between 2 and 5 years of age, can help out with animal-care tasks, but their most important ``job'' is to play with the pet, says veterinarian James Sokolowski, director of communications for Waltham, a pet-food manufacturer and research organization in Vernon, Calif.  Rolling a ball across the room to a golden retriever is good exercise for a baby and dog, plus it aids in the child's development, stimulates cooperative behavior and is, well, just plain fun. (But to avoid mishaps, never leave a baby or toddler alone with a pet.)  As a child gets a little older, his role in pet care can evolve. Sokolowski recommends that 5- to 7-year-olds:  _ select and name the pet;  _ assist with the pet's food and water;  _ help with grooming and brushing;  _ play with the pet and give it lots of attention and affection.  Children between the ages of 7 and 9 can:  _ see to the pet's elimination needs _ cleaning the litter box, scooping up lawn droppings or changing papers in a bird cage;  _ brush the pet on a regular basis and bathe it with their parents' supervision.  Children 9 years and up are old enough to really pay attention to their pet's needs. They can:  _ adhere to the pet's feeding and watering schedule;  _ take the pet for walks;  _ change a litter box or cage papers by themselves;  _ pay attention to the overall cleanliness of the pet's housing and feeding areas;  _ recognize obvious abnormalities in their pet that might require medical attention (such as limping).  By age 10 a child is old enough to accompany an adult to a dog obedience class, take a dog on longer walks and provide appropriate play toys for an animal.  By choosing a pet carefully and giving it lots of love and good care, you and your child will have a satisfying relationship with your pet _ and a loyal animal friend for years. -0- SIDEBAR: WHEN BABY MEETS BUSTER  Expecting a baby? You may be, but your pet isn't. With a little advance planning and some TLC, most dogs will adjust to a new baby within a short period of time. Here are some ways to prepare your pet for the transition.  Several months before the baby is born:  _ Let the dog sniff out the nursery to satisfy his curiosity about what's new.  _ Figure out roughly what your new schedule will be like, and gradually make any adjustments to your dog's feeding and walking schedules.  _ Work on basic commands such as ``down,'' ``come,'' ``stay'' and ``no'' a few minutes each day.  _ Be sure your dog is up to date on all his inoculations.  _ Introduce your dog to children of various ages and activity levels, particularly if he hasn't spent much time around kids.  When you arrive home from the hospital, spend a few minutes alone with your dog to re-establish your bond. When you enter the house with the baby, have your partner take charge of the dog; have the dog sit and stay about 10 feet away from the baby. Make calm and gentle introductions as you slowly bring the baby closer. If the dog becomes excited, end the introduction, and try again the next day.  Chances are your pet will learn to accept the new baby within the first six weeks. But if your pet is having trouble making the adjustment, call your veterinarian or an animal-welfare organization such as the ASPCA for help. -0- SIDEBAR: BEYOND FIDO AND FLUFFY  A number of small animals make good family pets, but others don't. Dr. Stephen Zawistowski, senior vice president and science adviser at the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in New York City, offers this advice.  _ ``Pocket'' pets: Guinea pigs make a wonderful first pet for a child. They're easy to hold and don't squirm or bite. They're also very responsive and whistle to their owners when they're happy.  Hamsters, on the other hand, are not recommended for homes with small children. Hamsters are nocturnal and tend to bite.  Gerbils are not recommended for small children either. They have long, fragile tails that can be broken if the animal is picked up incorrectly.  _ Birds: The best birds for kids are parakeets. They're relatively hardy and active enough to satisfy a child.  Children should understand, though, that birds are not the kind of animal they can grab and hold. A bird is a good choice for only a very gentle, careful child.  _ Fish: A fish tank is a wonderful complement to any home with children. Tropical fish come in a variety of colors, shapes and sizes, and there are enough inexpensive fish to make even a simple tank seem hypnotic.  Older children can feed fish easily and clean tank filters with little supervision.  _ Reptiles: Non-mammal animals, such as snakes, lizards, iguanas and turtles, require more exotic equipment and more specialized conditions for proper care. It's often harder to find veterinary care and food for such animals as well.  Snakes, lizards and turtles may also be carriers of the bacteria salmonella, which is spread through their feces.  For these reasons and others, reptiles are not recommended for children.  _ Ferrets: These small, furry animals (members of the weasel family) aren't recommended for households with children. Ferrets require a great deal of care and must be spayed or neutered like cats and dogs, but they aren't as trainable or interactive.  Ferret bites can also pose a risk to infants and children.

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Whoopi Goldberg in a scene from ``The Associate.'' By CINDY PEARLMAN World rights except Chicago (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  It was an offer she couldn't refuse. Whoopi Goldberg wanted to look like Marlon Brando.  In her latest movie, ``The Associate,'' which will open nationwide Oct. 25, Goldberg's character disguises herself as a white man to be taken seriously in the business world.  ``They asked me, `Which white man do you want to look like?''' Goldberg recalls. ``I said, `Make me look like my favorite actor.'''  Done. Her face was altered with white pancake makeup and chunky prosthetic cheeks. Her body was padded to make her look like Brando _ well, Brando about 100 pounds ago.  The effect was convincing, Goldberg reports.  The first day on the set, she says, she approached co-star Eli Wallach and said, ``How ya doing, Eli?''  ``In a very cautious voice, like a man about to call for security, he said, `I'm fine,''' she recalls.  ``I said, `Have you worked yet?'  ``He slowly said, `Noooo, I haven't, sir.' Then I realized he didn't know who he was talking to.  ``I said, `Eli, look! It's me! It's Whoopi!''' Goldberg says, laughing over coffee at New York's Regency Hotel on a chilly fall afternoon. Clad in a black pantsuit, she fires up a Marlboro Light and laughs some more.  ``The Associate'' is part of a virtual Whoopi Goldberg film festival. Earlier this fall she played a harried businesswoman trying to rear a child in the box-office disappointment ``Bogus.''  This Christmas will bring weightier fare, as Goldberg plays the widow of murdered civil-rights activist Medgar Evers in ``Ghosts of Mississippi,'' a Rob Reiner docudrama which co-stars Alec Baldwin.  Next year she will be seen in good friend Christopher Reeve's directorial debut for HBO, ``In the Gloaming,'' and in the Hollywood spoof ``An Alan Smithee Film,'' as well as playing a lawyer in ``Lily White,'' based on the Susan Isaacs book.  In her ``spare time,'' she is working on her autobiography, to be published in 1997.  As for ``The Associate,'' she says, ``It's a film about the `isms.' Racism. Sexism. Nepotism. It's about how the system is warped.''  Goldberg herself knows something about the pressure to be something one isn't. In her early days in Hollywood, she found that her braids, less-than-statuesque figure and offbeat style of dress weren't what studio executives expected in a prospective movie star.  ``I was too naive. I couldn't believe anybody would bring you somewhere and then want you to change,'' Goldberg says. ``These guys would say very delicately, `Whoopi, maybe you should do something with that ... you know.'  ``And I would go, `What?' They would go, `You know.'  ``I would have to say, `You mean my hair. You want me to change my hair? No, I'm not going to change my hair.'''  Goldberg laughs. ``Now, 13 years later, a lot of people do look like me. They pay a lot of money to get the Whoopi Look. I mean, people spend maybe a zillion dollars each week to get these lips. This butt is America. Isn't that ironic?  ``Where in the business world it helps to be a white male, in Hollywood when I started it helped to be a blond female,'' Goldberg adds. ``After 30 movies, I have noticed that a lot of those blond females aren't there anymore.''  In person, Goldberg is a study in contrasts _ one minute funny, the next dead-on serious.  ``I'm very moody. I'm not perfect,'' she says. ``Sometimes I'm a very quiet woman. I don't think of myself as the big presence in a room.''  These days the unconventional Goldberg admits to being happy for some fairly conventional reasons _ among them her two grandchildren, a 7-year-old and a 6-month-old.  ``I'm just not your average grandma,'' she understates. ``I like to teach the kids songs with bad words. And then I send them home and my daughter flips out.  ``I get these calls from my daughter saying, `What are you doing?' I'll say, `Honey, there was gas in the room and we made up a little song about it.' And my daughter will say, `Mom, you did it on purpose.'''  And then of course there's Goldberg's significant other, whom she met when they co-starred in the basketball movie ``Eddie'' (1996).  ``There's a wonderful man in my life,'' she says coyly. ``You might know him. His name is Frank Langella.''  By Goldberg's standards, she's kept her relationship with Langella reasonably quiet _ which isn't surprising, given the meltdown of her relationship with actor Ted Danson after the two did a controversial blackface act at a Friars Club dinner, as well as the publicity that attended the breakup of her marriage to labor organizer Lyle Trachtenberg.  Goldberg's career hasn't been as rewarding as her private life in recent years. Though she won a best-supporting-actress Oscar for ``Ghost'' (1990), her three most recent films have failed, including ``Bogus,'' ``Eddie'' and a dinosaur film, ``T-Rex'' (1995), that went straight to video after Goldberg went to court in a failed effort to void her contract for the film.  But advance word on ``The Associate'' and ``Ghosts of Mississippi'' is good, and she has recently agreed to move to Broadway next year, taking over Nathan Lane's starring role in ``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.''  Not bad for a woman whose previous jobs have included working as a bricklayer, a bank teller and a funeral-home makeup artist.  ``I don't think I have such a bad life,'' Goldberg says with a smile.  At 47, Goldberg has had her share of hard knocks. She was reared as Caryn Johnson in a Manhattan housing project. As a child, she had such severe dyslexia that doctors informed her mother that she might be mentally retarded.  Goldberg ended up dropping out of high school, fighting a drug habit, leaving a failed marriage and rearing her daughter, Alexandra, on her own.  Finally, seeking to turn her life around, Goldberg moved to the West Coast with Alexandra and became a stand-up comic. In 1983, director Mike Nichols saw her one-woman show and was impressed enough to help bring it to Broadway. There director Steven Spielberg saw it and immediately cast her in ``The Color Purple'' (1985).  ``My career is such luck,'' the actress says. ``If Mike Nichols had had a headache or Steven Spielberg had been out of the country, who knows what would have happened? It was a matter of luck and talent and perseverance.''  Certainly it wasn't a matter of keeping her mouth shut. Goldberg has long been outspoken on social and political issues. Last year, for example, at the Academy Awards ceremony, she took exception to Jesse Jackson's criticism of the lack of nominations for black actors and filmmakers.  ``I saw him at a party after the Oscars and he said, `Whoopi, let's be buddies,''' she recalls.  ``I said, `Why didn't you call us before you talked to the press?'  ``There's been a lot of us fighting these battles for a long time in Hollywood,'' she says. ``There's me, Danny Glover, Angela Bassett, Quincy Jones, Harry Belafonte. I told Jesse that to come and bomb us and walk away wasn't the right thing to do.''  Beyond speaking out on social issues, Goldberg imagines a semipolitical role for herself.  ``I'd like to be an ambassador to a foreign country,'' she says. ``It would be nice to welcome people to America. I'd throw a nice party in my neighborhood and just invite everybody.  ``Oh, I have so many things that would thrill me,'' Goldberg says, ``I'd be thrilled if kids could walk the streets after 8 o'clock and be safe. I'd be thrilled if I could help people fight to get off welfare, because I know that fight.  ``Let's face it,'' she says. ``I just want to save the world.'' c.1996 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Woody Allen and Natasha Lyonne in a scene from ``Everyone Says I Love You.'' Editor: At press time, we learned that the release date for ``Everyone Says I Love You'' has been postponed to 6 December 1996. You may wish to consider this in scheduling this story. By IAN SPELLING (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Nearly four decades after the end of the Hollywood musical as we know it _ the delirious fantasies in which characters spontaneously burst into song and dance at the drop of a hat _ here comes ``Everyone Says I Love You,'' a no-holds-barred musical.  And the man responsible is surely the most unusual suspect, that intellectual, Manhattan-centric Ingmar Bergman-wannabe, Woody Allen.  What's going on here?  ``For years, I wanted to do a musical, a romantic comedy where people sang,'' Allen says during an interview at a Manhattan hotel. The writer/director/actor is a talkative, amiable and comfortable conversationalist, nothing like the nebbishy characters he plays on-screen.  But can he sing? Allen dismisses the question, whether it applies to him or to the rest of his cast.  ``I could care less whether they could sing or not,'' he says. ``I didn't want the people to open their mouths and be like Jeanette MacDonald or Nelson Eddy, and have these brilliant, trained voices, which I always thought didn't have feeling to them. They were technically perfect, but I wanted to get a musical where people like you and me could sing as they felt.''  Allen cast ``Everyone,'' which Miramax Films will release on Dec. 6, as he would any of his movies, simply seeking the right actor for each role. He never told the actors or their agents that some singing and/or dancing experience might come in handy.  ``If they were good actresses and actors, I hired them,'' he says. ``Two weeks later, Dick Hyman, the musical director, called them and said, `You have to learn your songs.'  ``Most of them said, `I can't sing, I can't dance.' Dick said, `That's exactly what he wants. Those who do it, fine, and those who don't _ well, fine. Just be like you're acting, acting, acting and then have the singing be an extension of that.'  ``I always wanted to do a film like that and see where it goes.''  Allen stars as Joe, the divorced father of DJ (Natasha Lyonne) and the ex-husband of Steffi (Goldie Hawn), who is now remarried to Bob (Alan Alda). Joe has no luck maintaining relationships, but that doesn't stop him from pursuing the unhappily married Von (Julia Roberts).  Then there's Steffi's and Bob's inexplicably conservative son, Scott (Lukas Haas), and their daughter, Skylar (Drew Barrymore). Skylar is engaged to the amiable Holden (Edward Norton), but finds herself attracted to the just-freed-and-rather-horny criminal, Charles (Tim Roth). Allen follows these characters' adventures over the course of a year, trailing them from Manhattan to Paris and Venice.  ``As it turned out, the film got quite plotty by pure accident,'' Allen says. ``As I started tracing the romantic exploits of the people, the plot wrote itself.''  A rough cut of the film ran so long _ three hours and twenty minutes _ that Allen was forced to trim entire musical sequences and plot lines.  ``Tracey Ullman was originally the ex-wife of Alan Alda, but time couldn't support that much story,'' Allen says. ``Liv Tyler was the girlfriend of Lukas Haas.  ``It was better to cut out whole chunks than to noodle around and take little pieces and ruin things. It broke my heart.''  ``Everyone'' is an experimental, risky film, and Allen himself won't say if he thinks the experiment succeeded. He isn't much of a judge of such things, he says: While his film ``Manhattan'' (1979) is considered one of his masterpieces today, at the time he was so ``humiliated'' by it that he offered to buy back the film from United Artists and make a free picture for the studio if UA didn't release ``Manhattan.''  Of his new film, the 60-year-old director says, ``I could tell you that I think it is good or poor, but it doesn't seem to have any relation to what the public feels or what the critics feel.  ``I got the film I wanted to make,'' he adds. ``I wouldn't for a second be presumptuous enough to say, `Hey, this works and if you guys don't get it, you're crazy.'  ``For all I know, an audience could sit paralyzed with boredom. I just do the best job I can and hope people have a good time.''  Allen's film arrives in theaters at a time when his private life finally seems to be fading from public interest. No longer are Allen and his former significant other, actress Mia Farrow, generating tabloid headlines over their personal and child-custody battles.  These days, Allen sees his biological son Satchel during supervised visits. The filmmaker is still dating Soon-Yi Previn, Farrow's estranged, adopted daughter.  ``From a personal point of view, it's a pleasure to be able to lead my normal, reclusive, quiet life,'' Allen says. ``That's a great pleasure for me.  ``That was a very painful, unpleasant time. I'm someone who doesn't like to do a lot of press and yet I had to because my children were involved. For me to find myself walking up the steps of a courthouse, talking to large groups of (journalists) when I don't even do it very much on my own movies was very, very painful.''  On a lighter note, Allen still plays the clarinet every Monday night at Michael's Pub in Manhattan. He and his band even made a brief tour of Europe, drawing headlines because Allen the filmmaker is revered in several European countries, particularly France.  ``It was hilarious, the funniest thing you've ever seen,'' Allen says of the experience, which was captured on film by documentarian Barbara Kopple. ``I _ who am a thoroughly mediocre jazz clarinetist who put together an amateur band the way a guy goes out to play golf on the weekend _ went to Europe and found myself playing in all these great opera houses and concert halls.  ``Every show sold out, and there were hundreds of people outside my hotel and people meeting me at the airport. If I'd gone as a comedian in my heyday, I couldn't have approximated a tenth of that audience.''  Now back in Manhattan and eagerly awaiting the start of the basketball season for his beloved New York Knicks, Allen is at work on a new film, ``Deconstructing Harry.''  As usual, Allen has attracted a who's-who list of talent to the project, including Kirstie Alley, Judy Davis, Demi Moore, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Amy Irving, Robin Williams, Richard Benjamin, Judd Hirsch, Elisabeth Shue and Mariel Hemingway.  ``It's a comedy in the sense that `Husbands and Wives' (1992) was a comedy,'' he says. ``Again I'm the central character, but believe me, I didn't want to be.  ``I tried to get a number of other people and couldn't get them for one reason or another. Even after the first week of shooting, I called Gene Hackman's agent to see if Gene was available, but he had signed to do another movie.''  Allen doesn't know yet what his next film will be, but he does know there will be a next one, and another after that and another after that for the foreseeable future. It's no surprise _ with only a few exceptions, Allen has directed a new film each year for more than 20 years, totaling 22 since 1975.  ``There is a guilty feeling that I'll regret it if I don't do it,'' he says of his prolific pace. ``I feel that I'm young enough and healthy enough to work.  ``It's arduous work to make a film. I'll be on the set tomorrow at seven in the morning and shoot all day long. That's a lot of work, but I have the physical stamina to do it now.  ``I'll regret it one day if I'm 75 years old and I can't get the money to make a film or I can't get out of the wheelchair, when it's a film I can do now,'' Allen concludes. ``I just have this compulsion to make films while I have the opportunity.'' c.1996 Ian Spelling  (Ian Spelling is a New York-based free-lance writer.)

By PAUL WOLF From Diversion c.1996 Paul Wolf (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  Like many prospective home buyers, Dr. Alice Bradley (not her real name), had locked in a favorable mortgage rate one month prior to closing the deal on the house of her dreams. A few weeks later, the usual reams of paperwork were in order and she was looking forward to inking the transaction.  That's when the mortgage lender called. It seems that Bradley's credit history had turned up some negative information _ late car payments and credit card installments. She was stunned. She knew that she always paid her bills on time and never carried a balance on her credit card.  This story, recounted by John Ventura, a Houston lawyer and author of ``The Credit Repair Kit'' (Dearborn Financial Publishers, 1996), has a mixed ending. Bradley straightened out the problem _ a credit bureau had her confused with a deadbeat who was also named Bradley.  She got her mortgage, but unfortunately the lenders' 30-day commitment to provide the advantageous mortgage rate had expired because of the delay, and Bradley got a new one that was one-quarter of a percentage point higher. That's a hefty 30-year penalty to pay for someone else's error.  Bradley's story highlights an important but little-understood aspect of our consumer-driven society: When it comes to your bill-paying history, Big Brother not only watches, but also makes mistakes with disturbing frequency.  If you pay all your bills in cash and never intend to borrow money to expand your practice, buy a house or a car, or send your kids to college, feel free to ignore this article. If not, read on.  There are three major credit bureaus: Equifax in Atlanta, TRW in Layton, Utah, and Trans Union in Springfield, Ill., along with dozens of smaller outfits across the country. According to Ventura, they collect about two billion pieces of credit information a month and generate about 550 million credit reports a year on 180 million consumers.  Of those reports, as many as 40 percent are estimated to contain mistakes. Given these numbers, it's easy to see how details can get fouled up on your report.  Credit bureaus receive information from creditors around the country _ banks and credit card companies are the most familiar, but anyone who provides goods and services in expectation of payment fits in that category, including utility companies, airlines, department stores and such professionals as physicians and lawyers.  Ventura says many mistakes occur because the system has been overwhelmed in recent years by the vast expansion of credit and credit reporting. In addition, he notes, the burden of discovering and correcting these mistakes often falls on the consumer _ there are no stiff legal or regulatory incentives forcing the bureaus to clean up their acts.  A little knowledge and vigilance can go a long way toward keeping your credit history from derailing or delaying your financial goals.  The first course of action is painfully obvious but often neglected: Pay those bills on time.  Ruth Susswein, president of BankCard Holders of America, a nonprofit consumer group, says that ``(professionals), with their busy schedules, can often fall behind inadvertently _ either because they have delegated bill-paying tasks to someone who isn't following through, or through simple neglect.''  And while it's quick and easy to accumulate black marks for late payments, the opposite is true for getting rid of them. Depending on the bureau, records of payments that are 60 days late or longer will linger on a credit report for four to seven years, according to Susswein.  Of course, a few such late payments, in the absence of other serious negatives, won't necessarily cause a lender to balk. But they will likely prompt the lender (especially for bigger loans) to require a written explanation as to why those marks are there _  a headache you can obviously live without.  Bear in mind that credit bureaus have nothing to do with evaluating the information they provide _ that's the lender's job, and they all have different standards.  Many experts suggest consumers undergo a routine credit checkup through one of the three big bureaus once a year. TRW provides one free credit report to consumers per year; the others provide them at nominal cost, typically about $8.  Alternatively, if you think you have a black mark from a particular creditor, simply ask what bureau (if any) the company provides information to, and then request a report. Some services offer credit reports to consumers for a fee.  If you don't check your credit once a year, Susswein recommends that you at least do so two or three months in advance of any loan for which you expect to apply.  ``That way the information will be timely, and not so far in advance to have dated information in it,'' she notes. By doing this check you can preempt the kind of snafu that delayed Bradley's closing.  A more sophisticated form of safeguard planning is especially applicable to married professionals, Ventura notes. If one spouse is taking out a loan, say to start a business, the other spouse _ if at all possible _ should not cosign the loan.  ``The natural inclination for married couples is to jointly sign everything,'' Ventura says, ``but that should be avoided. That way if, for instance, a doctor starts a practice that doesn't work out, or is overwhelmed by debts from school, his or her spouse's credit remains untouched.''  This advice particularly applies when one spouse starts a small business, which usually faces long odds. Note, however, that for bigger loans, such as a mortgage, usually both spouses will have to sign.  What happens when you catch a mistake on your credit history? Send the credit bureau a certified letter, noting that you wish to dispute the record. Be sure to enclose a copy of the credit report in question on which you've highlighted the erroneous charge, and provide any supporting information, such as a letter from the vendor.  The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that credit bureaus respond to written requests within a ``reasonable'' time. TRW and other credit bureaus try to respond within 30 days, according to Maxine Sweet, vice president for consumer affairs at TRW.  However, Ventura advises consumers to be especially assertive. For example, your creditor may have supplied erroneous information that has resulted in the black mark on your record. When the credit bureau investigates your complaint, ``The credit bureau is likely to accept the creditor's word, not yours,'' Ventura says.  ``And in doing so, the credit bureau will not be violating the law. Resolving credit record problems may require patience and persistence.''  If you encounter resistance, legal action against a credit bureau is always a possibility, Ventura notes, but there are things to consider. For example, simple negligence, as in Bradley's case, isn't enough for a lawsuit, even though she suffered damages. The bureau must have been unwilling to rectify its mistake _ which they did, even though it was after her mortgage was delayed.  A critical consideration is cost: Is the amount in question enough to justify hiring a lawyer?  Another tactic is to send copies of your correspondence to the Federal Trade Commission and the state attorney general, and let the bureau know you are doing so. The bureaus are eager to avoid bad publicity, so they may be more responsive.  Should you decide you do want legal assistance, try contacting the National Consumer Law Center for a referral.  One other caveat. If you have serious credit problems, be very skeptical about credit repair companies that tout their ability to clean up the slate. Such firms typically claim that they can ``wipe out bankruptcies and other negative information in your credit record'' or use ``little known loopholes'' in the law to help.  These claims are untrue, Ventura says, and they often require that you deceive the government by fraudulently obtaining a new social security number.  ``Only time or successful negotiations with a creditor can erase negative information,'' he notes.  If, after learning the basics, you conclude that credit maintenance is a big pain, perhaps it's best to be philosophical. In a society that thrives on spending, borrowing and consuming, credit bureaus are a necessary evil. -0- SIDEBAR: FIVE STEPS TO PRISTINE CREDIT  1. Pay your bills on time.  Creditors have an unblemished stream of timely payments. Don't deny them this pleasure.  2. Don't be a frequent applier.  Applying repeatedly for credit cards within a short period of time may be a ``poor credit'' signal to a lender. Similarly, keeping open large lines of credit may make it more difficult to obtain an important loan.  3. Be yourself.  Is it John, Jack or Johnny? Catherine or Cathy? Junior or not? Be consistent when filling out credit applications so the credit bureaus have one less avenue of possible error.  4. Don't cosign if you don't have to.  Keep your credit history separate from your spouse's as much as possible. That way, if one of you runs into financial difficulty (real or apparent), the other's credit resources can serve as a backup.  5. Stay in touch.  If you are experiencing financial difficulties that may affect your ability to keep up with your debts, discuss the problem with your lender. You have nothing to lose and may gain more favorable terms. -0- SIDEBAR: WHERE CREDIT IS DUE Major credit bureaus:  _ Equifax (known as CBI in some areas): Office of Consumer Affairs, P.O.

By SHAWN HARTLEY HANCOCK From Healthy Kids c.1996 Shawn Hartley Hancock (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  Andrew and Stephanie Prince brought home a 4-pound Maltese puppy named Lucy two years ago when their daughter Olivia was just 3. With a small child and two busy careers, the Princes hardly needed the extra work, but they knew how the presence of a loving animal in the family would be a great advantage for their daughter.  ``Any pet, but certainly a dog, is a tremendous responsibility,'' says Andrew Prince, a New York City ophthalmologist and father of two. ``It needs love, affection and proper training. But there's just more love to get and more love to give when you add a pet to your family.''  To be sure, kids and pets belong together. For many children a pet is more than just an animal _ it becomes a close friend. Children who grow up with a well-trained, well-loved pet have an opportunity to learn many important lessons and values, including the boundaries of good behavior, loyalty, responsibility and the fundamentals of the life and death cycle.  A close and loving relationship with the family dog or cat _ as playmate, coach, comforter or protector _ is one of the most satisfying your child will ever have. But for the child and pet combination to succeed, everyone in the household must agree to take responsibility, beginning with the parents.  That means getting the right pet at the right time, and making a commitment to its care, training, feeding, grooming and exercise. CHOOSING THE RIGHT PET  ``Acquiring a pet takes a lot of planning and forethought,'' says Garry Gardner, a pediatrician in Darien, lll., whose household includes two children, a dachshund, a gerbil and a cockatiel.  ``Whatever you do, don't get an animal on the spur of the moment, no matter how much your child pleads.''  When choosing a family pet, there are several factors to keep in mind before making an informed and humane decision. Here are a few to consider.  _ The kind of commitment you are willing to make to the pet.  Before getting a pet, consider the needs of the animal carefully. How much time and attention will it require? How much money will you need to spend on food, veterinary care, training, grooming and pet supplies? Realistically decide whether or not your family can meet these needs.  _ Your lifestyle.  Consider the environment you live in. Do you have a house with a big fenced-in yard? Do you live in an apartment building with no park nearby? Your home environment will have an impact on the type of pet you choose and how well you'll be able to care for it.  _ The timing of the acquisition.  The worst time to get a pet is when your family has just moved to a new home or during holiday season, when the house is unusually chaotic. The best time is when everything and everyone in the home is stable _ no one's pregnant, on maternity leave or in between jobs.  Any animal needs time to adjust to its new environment, and that's especially tough if the home is in transition.  _ The age of your child.  The best time for a child to acquire a dog or a cat is after age 5.  ``Toddlers aren't able to restrain themselves sufficiently with an animal, and too often either the child or the animal gets hurt,'' says veterinarian Jane Leon, co-author of ``Becoming Best Friends'' (Berkeley, 1993).  But if you'd like your younger child to experience the joy of having a pet, choose an animal that requires little attention, is easy to care for and can be easily and humanely confined.  A low-maintenance animal, such as a fish or guinea pig, makes a nice first pet for a little one. You can put the tank or cage in your child's room where he can observe it. Be sure your child understands, however, that he may hold or touch the animal only when you are there to supervise.  _ Your family's health concerns.  If your child or a family member has asthma or allergies, find out how she will respond to the type of pet you are considering before you acquire it. Spend time at the home of relatives or friends who have a similar pet beforehand, if possible.  You can also minimize the allergens in your home by bathing an animal frequently and restricting it to certain rooms.  Non-furry pets, such as fish, may be a better choice for children with asthma or allergies.  _ The animal's temperament.  When choosing a pet for small children, consider the breed of the animal as well as the animal's temperament. If you're getting a dog, for instance, you could select a larger, more placid animal, such as a Labrador or golden retriever, says Dr. Stephen Zawistowski, senior vice president and science adviser at the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), in New York City.  ``Despite their size, these dogs are not rough with kids and can take the physical insults that kids are known to hand out,'' he says. (For more information on child-friendly pets, speak with a reputable breeder, counselors at an animal shelter or an animal-welfare organization, such as the ASPCA).  Even the gentlest dog or cat, however, can occasionally bite or scratch a child. If your child is bitten or scratched, clean the wound thoroughly with soap and water and call your pediatrician. Also make sure your child's immunizations are up to date.  ``Even the smallest wound, if left untreated, can be dangerous,'' Leon says. HOW KIDS CAN HELP  Once you acquire a family pet, your child can help to water, feed, groom, train or walk it. Caring for a pet teaches a child important lessons in responsibility and can give him the satisfaction of nurturing another living being.  Young children, between 2 and 5 years of age, can help out with animal-care tasks, but their most important ``job'' is to play with the pet, says veterinarian James Sokolowski, director of communications for Waltham, a pet-food manufacturer and research organization in Vernon, Calif.  Rolling a ball across the room to a golden retriever is good exercise for a baby and dog, plus it aids in the child's development, stimulates cooperative behavior and is, well, just plain fun. (But to avoid mishaps, never leave a baby or toddler alone with a pet.)  As a child gets a little older, his role in pet care can evolve. Sokolowski recommends that 5- to 7-year-olds:  _ select and name the pet;  _ assist with the pet's food and water;  _ help with grooming and brushing;  _ play with the pet and give it lots of attention and affection.  Children between the ages of 7 and 9 can:  _ see to the pet's elimination needs _ cleaning the litter box, scooping up lawn droppings or changing papers in a bird cage;  _ brush the pet on a regular basis and bathe it with their parents' supervision.  Children 9 years and up are old enough to really pay attention to their pet's needs. They can:  _ adhere to the pet's feeding and watering schedule;  _ take the pet for walks;  _ change a litter box or cage papers by themselves;  _ pay attention to the overall cleanliness of the pet's housing and feeding areas;  _ recognize obvious abnormalities in their pet that might require medical attention (such as limping).  By age 10 a child is old enough to accompany an adult to a dog obedience class, take a dog on longer walks and provide appropriate play toys for an animal.  By choosing a pet carefully and giving it lots of love and good care, you and your child will have a satisfying relationship with your pet _ and a loyal animal friend for years. -0- SIDEBAR: WHEN BABY MEETS BUSTER  Expecting a baby? You may be, but your pet isn't. With a little advance planning and some TLC, most dogs will adjust to a new baby within a short period of time. Here are some ways to prepare your pet for the transition.  Several months before the baby is born:  _ Let the dog sniff out the nursery to satisfy his curiosity about what's new.  _ Figure out roughly what your new schedule will be like, and gradually make any adjustments to your dog's feeding and walking schedules.  _ Work on basic commands such as ``down,'' ``come,'' ``stay'' and ``no'' a few minutes each day.  _ Be sure your dog is up to date on all his inoculations.  _ Introduce your dog to children of various ages and activity levels, particularly if he hasn't spent much time around kids.  When you arrive home from the hospital, spend a few minutes alone with your dog to re-establish your bond. When you enter the house with the baby, have your partner take charge of the dog; have the dog sit and stay about 10 feet away from the baby. Make calm and gentle introductions as you slowly bring the baby closer. If the dog becomes excited, end the introduction, and try again the next day.  Chances are your pet will learn to accept the new baby within the first six weeks. But if your pet is having trouble making the adjustment, call your veterinarian or an animal-welfare organization such as the ASPCA for help. -0- SIDEBAR: BEYOND FIDO AND FLUFFY  A number of small animals make good family pets, but others don't. Dr. Stephen Zawistowski, senior vice president and science adviser at the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in New York City, offers this advice.  _ ``Pocket'' pets: Guinea pigs make a wonderful first pet for a child. They're easy to hold and don't squirm or bite. They're also very responsive and whistle to their owners when they're happy.  Hamsters, on the other hand, are not recommended for homes with small children. Hamsters are nocturnal and tend to bite.  Gerbils are not recommended for small children either. They have long, fragile tails that can be broken if the animal is picked up incorrectly.  _ Birds: The best birds for kids are parakeets. They're relatively hardy and active enough to satisfy a child.  Children should understand, though, that birds are not the kind of animal they can grab and hold. A bird is a good choice for only a very gentle, careful child.  _ Fish: A fish tank is a wonderful complement to any home with children. Tropical fish come in a variety of colors, shapes and sizes, and there are enough inexpensive fish to make even a simple tank seem hypnotic.  Older children can feed fish easily and clean tank filters with little supervision.  _ Reptiles: Non-mammal animals, such as snakes, lizards, iguanas and turtles, require more exotic equipment and more specialized conditions for proper care. It's often harder to find veterinary care and food for such animals as well.  Snakes, lizards and turtles may also be carriers of the bacteria salmonella, which is spread through their feces.  For these reasons and others, reptiles are not recommended for children.  _ Ferrets: These small, furry animals (members of the weasel family) aren't recommended for households with children. Ferrets require a great deal of care and must be spayed or neutered like cats and dogs, but they aren't as trainable or interactive.  Ferret bites can also pose a risk to infants and children.

By CINDY PEARLMAN World rights except Chicago (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  It was an offer she couldn't refuse. Whoopi Goldberg wanted to look like Marlon Brando.  In her latest movie, ``The Associate,'' which will open nationwide Oct. 25, Goldberg's character disguises herself as a white man to be taken seriously in the business world.  ``They asked me, `Which white man do you want to look like?''' Goldberg recalls. ``I said, `Make me look like my favorite actor.'''  Done. Her face was altered with white pancake makeup and chunky prosthetic cheeks. Her body was padded to make her look like Brando _ well, Brando about 100 pounds ago.  The effect was convincing, Goldberg reports.  The first day on the set, she says, she approached co-star Eli Wallach and said, ``How ya doing, Eli?''  ``In a very cautious voice, like a man about to call for security, he said, `I'm fine,''' she recalls.  ``I said, `Have you worked yet?'  ``He slowly said, `Noooo, I haven't, sir.' Then I realized he didn't know who he was talking to.  ``I said, `Eli, look! It's me! It's Whoopi!''' Goldberg says, laughing over coffee at New York's Regency Hotel on a chilly fall afternoon. Clad in a black pantsuit, she fires up a Marlboro Light and laughs some more.  ``The Associate'' is part of a virtual Whoopi Goldberg film festival. Earlier this fall she played a harried businesswoman trying to rear a child in the box-office disappointment ``Bogus.''  This Christmas will bring weightier fare, as Goldberg plays the widow of murdered civil-rights activist Medgar Evers in ``Ghosts of Mississippi,'' a Rob Reiner docudrama which co-stars Alec Baldwin.  Next year she will be seen in good friend Christopher Reeve's directorial debut for HBO, ``In the Gloaming,'' and in the Hollywood spoof ``An Alan Smithee Film,'' as well as playing a lawyer in ``Lily White,'' based on the Susan Isaacs book.  In her ``spare time,'' she is working on her autobiography, to be published in 1997.  As for ``The Associate,'' she says, ``It's a film about the `isms.' Racism. Sexism. Nepotism. It's about how the system is warped.''  Goldberg herself knows something about the pressure to be something one isn't. In her early days in Hollywood, she found that her braids, less-than-statuesque figure and offbeat style of dress weren't what studio executives expected in a prospective movie star.  ``I was too naive. I couldn't believe anybody would bring you somewhere and then want you to change,'' Goldberg says. ``These guys would say very delicately, `Whoopi, maybe you should do something with that ... you know.'  ``And I would go, `What?' They would go, `You know.'  ``I would have to say, `You mean my hair. You want me to change my hair? No, I'm not going to change my hair.'''  Goldberg laughs. ``Now, 13 years later, a lot of people do look like me. They pay a lot of money to get the Whoopi Look. I mean, people spend maybe a zillion dollars each week to get these lips. This butt is America. Isn't that ironic?  ``Where in the business world it helps to be a white male, in Hollywood when I started it helped to be a blond female,'' Goldberg adds. ``After 30 movies, I have noticed that a lot of those blond females aren't there anymore.''  In person, Goldberg is a study in contrasts _ one minute funny, the next dead-on serious.  ``I'm very moody. I'm not perfect,'' she says. ``Sometimes I'm a very quiet woman. I don't think of myself as the big presence in a room.''  These days the unconventional Goldberg admits to being happy for some fairly conventional reasons _ among them her two grandchildren, a 7-year-old and a 6-month-old.  ``I'm just not your average grandma,'' she understates. ``I like to teach the kids songs with bad words. And then I send them home and my daughter flips out.  ``I get these calls from my daughter saying, `What are you doing?' I'll say, `Honey, there was gas in the room and we made up a little song about it.' And my daughter will say, `Mom, you did it on purpose.'''  And then of course there's Goldberg's significant other, whom she met when they co-starred in the basketball movie ``Eddie'' (1996).  ``There's a wonderful man in my life,'' she says coyly. ``You might know him. His name is Frank Langella.''  By Goldberg's standards, she's kept her relationship with Langella reasonably quiet _ which isn't surprising, given the meltdown of her relationship with actor Ted Danson after the two did a controversial blackface act at a Friars Club dinner, as well as the publicity that attended the breakup of her marriage to labor organizer Lyle Trachtenberg.  Goldberg's career hasn't been as rewarding as her private life in recent years. Though she won a best-supporting-actress Oscar for ``Ghost'' (1990), her three most recent films have failed, including ``Bogus,'' ``Eddie'' and a dinosaur film, ``T-Rex'' (1995), that went straight to video after Goldberg went to court in a failed effort to void her contract for the film.  But advance word on ``The Associate'' and ``Ghosts of Mississippi'' is good, and she has recently agreed to move to Broadway next year, taking over Nathan Lane's starring role in ``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.''  Not bad for a woman whose previous jobs have included working as a bricklayer, a bank teller and a funeral-home makeup artist.  ``I don't think I have such a bad life,'' Goldberg says with a smile.  At 47, Goldberg has had her share of hard knocks. She was reared as Caryn Johnson in a Manhattan housing project. As a child, she had such severe dyslexia that doctors informed her mother that she might be mentally retarded.  Goldberg ended up dropping out of high school, fighting a drug habit, leaving a failed marriage and rearing her daughter, Alexandra, on her own.  Finally, seeking to turn her life around, Goldberg moved to the West Coast with Alexandra and became a stand-up comic. In 1983, director Mike Nichols saw her one-woman show and was impressed enough to help bring it to Broadway. There director Steven Spielberg saw it and immediately cast her in ``The Color Purple'' (1985).  ``My career is such luck,'' the actress says. ``If Mike Nichols had had a headache or Steven Spielberg had been out of the country, who knows what would have happened? It was a matter of luck and talent and perseverance.''  Certainly it wasn't a matter of keeping her mouth shut. Goldberg has long been outspoken on social and political issues. Last year, for example, at the Academy Awards ceremony, she took exception to Jesse Jackson's criticism of the lack of nominations for black actors and filmmakers.  ``I saw him at a party after the Oscars and he said, `Whoopi, let's be buddies,''' she recalls.  ``I said, `Why didn't you call us before you talked to the press?'  ``There's been a lot of us fighting these battles for a long time in Hollywood,'' she says. ``There's me, Danny Glover, Angela Bassett, Quincy Jones, Harry Belafonte. I told Jesse that to come and bomb us and walk away wasn't the right thing to do.''  Beyond speaking out on social issues, Goldberg imagines a semipolitical role for herself.  ``I'd like to be an ambassador to a foreign country,'' she says. ``It would be nice to welcome people to America. I'd throw a nice party in my neighborhood and just invite everybody.  ``Oh, I have so many things that would thrill me,'' Goldberg says, ``I'd be thrilled if kids could walk the streets after 8 o'clock and be safe. I'd be thrilled if I could help people fight to get off welfare, because I know that fight.  ``Let's face it,'' she says. ``I just want to save the world.'' c.1996 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Woody Allen and Natasha Lyonne in a scene from ``Everyone Says I Love You.'' Editor: At press time, we learned that the release date for ``Everyone Says I Love You'' has been postponed to 6 December 1996. You may wish to consider this in scheduling this story. By IAN SPELLING (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Nearly four decades after the end of the Hollywood musical as we know it _ the delirious fantasies in which characters spontaneously burst into song and dance at the drop of a hat _ here comes ``Everyone Says I Love You,'' a no-holds-barred musical.  And the man responsible is surely the most unusual suspect, that intellectual, Manhattan-centric Ingmar Bergman-wannabe, Woody Allen.  What's going on here?  ``For years, I wanted to do a musical, a romantic comedy where people sang,'' Allen says during an interview at a Manhattan hotel. The writer/director/actor is a talkative, amiable and comfortable conversationalist, nothing like the nebbishy characters he plays on-screen.  But can he sing? Allen dismisses the question, whether it applies to him or to the rest of his cast.  ``I could care less whether they could sing or not,'' he says. ``I didn't want the people to open their mouths and be like Jeanette MacDonald or Nelson Eddy, and have these brilliant, trained voices, which I always thought didn't have feeling to them. They were technically perfect, but I wanted to get a musical where people like you and me could sing as they felt.''  Allen cast ``Everyone,'' which Miramax Films will release on Dec. 6, as he would any of his movies, simply seeking the right actor for each role. He never told the actors or their agents that some singing and/or dancing experience might come in handy.  ``If they were good actresses and actors, I hired them,'' he says. ``Two weeks later, Dick Hyman, the musical director, called them and said, `You have to learn your songs.'  ``Most of them said, `I can't sing, I can't dance.' Dick said, `That's exactly what he wants. Those who do it, fine, and those who don't _ well, fine. Just be like you're acting, acting, acting and then have the singing be an extension of that.'  ``I always wanted to do a film like that and see where it goes.''  Allen stars as Joe, the divorced father of DJ (Natasha Lyonne) and the ex-husband of Steffi (Goldie Hawn), who is now remarried to Bob (Alan Alda). Joe has no luck maintaining relationships, but that doesn't stop him from pursuing the unhappily married Von (Julia Roberts).  Then there's Steffi's and Bob's inexplicably conservative son, Scott (Lukas Haas), and their daughter, Skylar (Drew Barrymore). Skylar is engaged to the amiable Holden (Edward Norton), but finds herself attracted to the just-freed-and-rather-horny criminal, Charles (Tim Roth). Allen follows these characters' adventures over the course of a year, trailing them from Manhattan to Paris and Venice.  ``As it turned out, the film got quite plotty by pure accident,'' Allen says. ``As I started tracing the romantic exploits of the people, the plot wrote itself.''  A rough cut of the film ran so long _ three hours and twenty minutes _ that Allen was forced to trim entire musical sequences and plot lines.  ``Tracey Ullman was originally the ex-wife of Alan Alda, but time couldn't support that much story,'' Allen says. ``Liv Tyler was the girlfriend of Lukas Haas.  ``It was better to cut out whole chunks than to noodle around and take little pieces and ruin things. It broke my heart.''  ``Everyone'' is an experimental, risky film, and Allen himself won't say if he thinks the experiment succeeded. He isn't much of a judge of such things, he says: While his film ``Manhattan'' (1979) is considered one of his masterpieces today, at the time he was so ``humiliated'' by it that he offered to buy back the film from United Artists and make a free picture for the studio if UA didn't release ``Manhattan.''  Of his new film, the 60-year-old director says, ``I could tell you that I think it is good or poor, but it doesn't seem to have any relation to what the public feels or what the critics feel.  ``I got the film I wanted to make,'' he adds. ``I wouldn't for a second be presumptuous enough to say, `Hey, this works and if you guys don't get it, you're crazy.'  ``For all I know, an audience could sit paralyzed with boredom. I just do the best job I can and hope people have a good time.''  Allen's film arrives in theaters at a time when his private life finally seems to be fading from public interest. No longer are Allen and his former significant other, actress Mia Farrow, generating tabloid headlines over their personal and child-custody battles.  These days, Allen sees his biological son Satchel during supervised visits. The filmmaker is still dating Soon-Yi Previn, Farrow's estranged, adopted daughter.  ``From a personal point of view, it's a pleasure to be able to lead my normal, reclusive, quiet life,'' Allen says. ``That's a great pleasure for me.  ``That was a very painful, unpleasant time. I'm someone who doesn't like to do a lot of press and yet I had to because my children were involved. For me to find myself walking up the steps of a courthouse, talking to large groups of (journalists) when I don't even do it very much on my own movies was very, very painful.''  On a lighter note, Allen still plays the clarinet every Monday night at Michael's Pub in Manhattan. He and his band even made a brief tour of Europe, drawing headlines because Allen the filmmaker is revered in several European countries, particularly France.  ``It was hilarious, the funniest thing you've ever seen,'' Allen says of the experience, which was captured on film by documentarian Barbara Kopple. ``I _ who am a thoroughly mediocre jazz clarinetist who put together an amateur band the way a guy goes out to play golf on the weekend _ went to Europe and found myself playing in all these great opera houses and concert halls.  ``Every show sold out, and there were hundreds of people outside my hotel and people meeting me at the airport. If I'd gone as a comedian in my heyday, I couldn't have approximated a tenth of that audience.''  Now back in Manhattan and eagerly awaiting the start of the basketball season for his beloved New York Knicks, Allen is at work on a new film, ``Deconstructing Harry.''  As usual, Allen has attracted a who's-who list of talent to the project, including Kirstie Alley, Judy Davis, Demi Moore, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Amy Irving, Robin Williams, Richard Benjamin, Judd Hirsch, Elisabeth Shue and Mariel Hemingway.  ``It's a comedy in the sense that `Husbands and Wives' (1992) was a comedy,'' he says. ``Again I'm the central character, but believe me, I didn't want to be.  ``I tried to get a number of other people and couldn't get them for one reason or another. Even after the first week of shooting, I called Gene Hackman's agent to see if Gene was available, but he had signed to do another movie.''  Allen doesn't know yet what his next film will be, but he does know there will be a next one, and another after that and another after that for the foreseeable future. It's no surprise _ with only a few exceptions, Allen has directed a new film each year for more than 20 years, totaling 22 since 1975.  ``There is a guilty feeling that I'll regret it if I don't do it,'' he says of his prolific pace. ``I feel that I'm young enough and healthy enough to work.  ``It's arduous work to make a film. I'll be on the set tomorrow at seven in the morning and shoot all day long. That's a lot of work, but I have the physical stamina to do it now.  ``I'll regret it one day if I'm 75 years old and I can't get the money to make a film or I can't get out of the wheelchair, when it's a film I can do now,'' Allen concludes. ``I just have this compulsion to make films while I have the opportunity.'' c.1996 Ian Spelling  (Ian Spelling is a New York-based free-lance writer.)

Rather, he argues that optimistic extrapolations of stock prices are inconsistent with modest projections of economic growth. The total value of traded stocks today, he notes, is about 20 times corporate profits. If profits remain a relatively stable share of national output and output per worker continues to grow at about 1 percent a year, the stock market's price-earnings ratio would have to rise to 34 by 2015 to sustain a 7 percent average return. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199703.gz"

"121775"	"she"	"notes"	" In part, Power is out to change our understanding of genocide. She has waded directly into the volatile argument over what does and does not constitute genocide, using as her starting point the definition by Polish emigre Raphael Lemkin, who coined the term (and is one of the heroes of her book). Power argues that the concept of genocide has been misunderstood to apply only to events such as Nazi Germany's attempt to exterminate all Jews. In fact, she notes, the Genocide Convention adopted in 1948 by the United Nations (under Lemkin's prodding) defines genocide as the targeting of ethnic, racial, national, or religious groups with the intent of destroying a substantial part of those groups. Under that definition, Power maintains, genocide occurred not only during the Holocaust or Pol Pot's murderous reign in Cambodia but also during the systematic murder of Bosnian Muslims from 1992 to 1995 by Serbian forces. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"

"129241"	"he"	"notes"	"  W. BRUCE CAMERON AGE: 46 PROFESSION: Author and syndicated humor columnist  HE WROTE THE 'RULES': This Santa Monica resident is the author of ``8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter,'' the best seller that inspired the hit ABC sitcom starring John Ritter and is also being developed as a family-friendly feature for Disney. He's the father of two daughters, ages 21 and 19, and one son, age 15. He doesn't like to give their names, not to protect them from further embarrassment but because, he notes, ``there are a lot of kooks out there.''  WHAT MAKES HIM AN EXPERT ON PARENTING: ``Oh, you know, you do it a couple of times ... I don't think you get any better at it. I wrote the book with the whole idea being that I was going to offer a bunch of tips that ultimately don't work. If I can just prepare a father or a parent of a teenager for what they are getting into, that would be a job well done.''  THE DEJA VU PART OF RAISING TEENS: ``When they enter that stage when they feel like they can get along in life without ever communicating to you other than transmitting to you their needs and wants, it's sort of like having a brand-new baby. You celebrated the first steps of your baby. Here you celebrate the first teeny steps toward some sort of self-sufficiency, like the day when they come home from the grocery store and they actually bought something and don't demand that you pay them back. They actually somehow understand since they eat nearly all the food that you buy, that, occasionally, if they buy food they don't have to be reimbursed. That's like one of those amazing days.''  ON WRITING DIALOGUE: ``I can picture my daughters talking and write down what they're saying. And if I ever run dry, I just call them up and talk to them about what they're arguing about. They're ceaselessly arguing. They spend a lot of time arguing about who's going to get to drive the car and at what time, including all the way to New Year's Eve 2003. They're arguing about that now.''  HOW HIS SOURCES FEEL ABOUT THE DIALOGUE: ``As far as they're concerned, I am a purveyor of yellow dog journalism. They fail to see any accuracy in anything I've ever said about them.'' (Is he backing it up with tape recordings and notebooks?) ``No. I'm backing it up with the statement that I'm the father and as long as I'm paying the bills, I get to say what happened.''  HOW HIS KIDS FEEL ABOUT THEIR FAME: ``They insisted that my writing of 'The 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter' inhibited their ability to get dates. I'm here to tell you that if the level of social activity they experience in the dating scene represented a diminishment, then I didn't do a very good job. They claim that this has been hugely intrusive, and because they provided me with the material, I should buy them each a new car.''  ABOUT THE CAR THING: ``My son, who does not have a license to drive, has for the last two years gotten car magazines devoted to people who buy exotic imported automobiles. I'm assuming we're going to be facing insurance premiums.'' Those are above and beyond the no-doubt considerable premiums he already pays. Hearing of a coffee-table book that has beautiful glossy photos of automobile dashboards, Cameron says: ``If they were to show the dashboard of the car that my daughters drive, the air bag would be deflated in front of the steering wheel. Last year I had six collision claims, including one total, between the two daughters. They never got hurt, but they sure banged up the cars. It's amazing how every accident they've had was always the fault of whatever it was they ran into, including the mailbox.''  HIS NEXT PROJECT: ``8 Simple Rules'' is in its seventh printing, and he's currently writing a book about men. ``I'm going to betray my gender and give away all the secrets of how to change a man,'' Cameron said, promising that it will be more than a bound set of blank pages.  MORE INFORMATION: www.wbrucecameron.com, where, he suspects, many of the 10,000 hits a day come from misguided young men seeking photos of Cameron Diaz.

In his talk, Kernighan explained that everything a PC does _ handling text, music or video _ is all just a matter of processing 1s and 0s to the machine. The difference between today's multimedia notebooks and the room-size calculators of computing's early days, he notes, is mainly faster bit-processing engines and increasingly clever software. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"

Janjaweed militias have focused their wrath on innocent villagers for most of the two and a half years of the conflict in the Darfur region. But on Sept. 18, in a scene that aid workers described as something out of a Hollywood western, the militiamen surrounded the police station along Sudan's border with Chad, roughed up the chief and freed several of their members from jail. The fact that militias trained and armed by the government are now emboldened enough to turn their guns on the government is a sign of trouble. By Mark Lacey.

Azeri authorities have rounded up dozens of opposition activists who were planning demonstrations in support of fugitive opposition party leader Rasul Guliyev. Guliyev, who is wanted on corruption charges, flew to Simferopol in Ukraine where he was negotiating with Azeri authorities to be allowed to fly on to Baku, but the flight was canceled. By C.J.

Bloomberg took over control of the schools from a politicized Board of Education, angered many New Yorkers by banning smoking in bars and restaurants, and imposed the largest property tax increase in city history after running on a no new taxes platform. He reshaped the way the mayor's office runs New York, applying a results-based approach to almost every area of city government, appointing his commissioners largely based on expertise and giving them nearly free reign to determine policy. It was a 180-degree turn from the administration of his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani. By Jim Ruternberg.  With photo.  NEW-ORLEANS-GUILT (New Orleans) -- More than a month after the hurricane, thousands of residents of residents have begun to settle back into the New Orleans area. They are the lucky ones, whose homes and lives remain largely intact. But as they go about remaking whatever was put on hold by the storm, those who remain here -- the survivors -- are wracked with a stubborn sense of guilt. It follows them when they pick out new paint at Home Depot and when they grumble about the reduced hours of the corner supermarket, where it now takes an hour to get through the line. It gnaws at them when they answer the inevitable questions of how'd you make out? as nearly every conversation here begins. By Jennifer Medina.  WASHINGTON  (Coded w)  WHITE-HOUSE-CARD (Washington) -- For years, in a White House that prides itself on sharp efficiency, Andrew H. Card Jr. has been the guiding force. But as the administration has stumbled in recent months, some of the missteps have cast a shadow over the popular chief of staff. His office oversaw the administration response to Hurricane Katrina and Card personally managed the selection of Harriet Miers for the Supreme Court. Now, with the president's approval ratings dipping to new lows, Card, 58, is awaiting the outcome of his toughest personnel situation to date: The criminal leak investigation involving his nominal deputy, Karl Rove. The confluence of crises, all running directly through his suite just steps from the Oval Office, has some critics asking whether Card needs to clean house or assert himself more forcefully -- or at least consider a course correction before Bush is permanently downgraded to lame duck status.

But now McDonald, the chief executive of the largest black-owned bank in New Orleans, is relying on less tangible assets to help revive the bank's fortunes: his many connections to people in powerful positions. In recent weeks, he has met with Bill Clinton and spoken about his decimated business with the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Last month, when McDonald found himself in Atlanta on his 62nd birthday, Andrew Young, the former Atlanta mayor, threw a celebration for him. By Gary Rivlin.  SUPER-BOWL-AD-COLUMN (New York) -- Each year, the National Football League and its many marketer partners strive to imbue their elaborate Super Bowl promotional efforts with as much attention-getting hoopla as consumers can bear. For the Super Bowl on Feb. 5, the superlatives seem poised to ascend -- or descend, depending on your perspective -- to a new realm of hyperbole. The reason? The next Super Bowl will be the 40th championship game to be sponsored by the league, which in rendering the sequence in Roman numerals has arrived at the meaningful letters XL. Read one way, it is XL as in excel. Read another, it is as in extra large. But if the league and its advertisers are not careful, America may read XL as XS, as in excess. By Stuart Elliott.

SCIENCE  (Coded a)  SCI-BRAIN-IMAGING (Undated) -- For a variety of reasons, the hopes and claims for brain imaging in psychiatry have far outpaced the science, experts say. After almost 30 years researchers have not developed a single standardized diagnostic test or tool to guide treatment for any psychiatric disorder based on imaging studies. Several promising lines of research are under way. But imaging technology has not lived up to the hopes invested in it in the 1990s -- a period labeled the Decade of the Brain by the American Psychiatric Association. By Benedict Carey.  With photo.

"159020"	"he"	"notes"	" But in America, he notes, there are a number of cities like New Orleans and in Northern California -- which are built on one of the most dangerous plate boundaries in the world-- that will be gone in 100 or 200 years. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
"159752"	"she"	"notes"	" Rourke is a quiet writer, but her observations can sting.

"160841"	"she"	"notes"	" Fradkin said she expected that the results will hold for type 2 diabetes. Another large federal study is addressing that question, she notes, but it is already known that tight control of blood sugar in type 2 diabetes protects against nerve, kidney and eye damage, just as it does with type 1 diabetes. In addition, a study in the United Kingdom hinted -- although it did not demonstrate -- that type 2 diabetics who keep their blood sugar low have less heart disease and strokes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"

"161936"	"he"	"notes"	" Shugart makes a couple of interesting points: Until early in the 20th century, the size of the House was increased regularly, as the number of states and their population grew. Also, he notes, that when compared to parliaments in other major democracies, the size of the U.S. House is disproportionately low for the nation's almost 300 million population. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"

"163218"	"he"	"notes"	" Besides, he notes, Florida's parents - unlike those in parts of California - have not indicated a willingness to make the sacrifices needed for smaller class sizes to work.

"164081"	"she"	"notes"	" She visits the Netherlands, where rising sea levels caused by global warming are expected to swallow up large parts of the country. In areas where there are already periodic floods, a construction firm has started building amphibious homes (they resemble toasters, Kolbert says) as well as buoyant roads. Another field trip took her to Washington, where she was treated to double-speak by an under secretary charged with explaining the administration's position on climate change. Astonishingly, she comments in a rare show of heat, standing in the way of progress seems to be President Bush's goal. Not only did he reject the Kyoto Protocol, she notes, with its mandatory curbs on emissions, almost killing the treaty in the process, but he also continues to block meaningful follow-up changes to it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164429"	"he"	"notes"	" While painters start with a blank canvas, gardeners begin with a canvas partially filled with a house, a drive, trees and shrubs. People often overlook these permanent features, Smith says. These elements, he notes, typically provide a neutral canvas with pockets of opportunity for color. It's easier to dab cool or warm colors in these pockets than to reinvent the garden, he says. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164510"	"he"	"notes"	" Then, around a bend, a broken-down building of brick and stone emerges. It used to be part of a village, but no one lives here anymore. They started abandoning these villages about 1950, Michael said. But as we pass from hamlet to hamlet, we find the original stone path in good condition. By the side of the path is an old stone rice grinder, which would fetch a high price in the chic antique shops of Lyndhurst Terrace, he notes, if you could carry it there. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"

"166232"	"she"	"notes"	" Drawing inspiration from the classic Barcelona chair, designer Candice Olson delivers Beckett in her eponymous collection for Norwalk Furniture. Its arms arc gracefully, yet simply, in dark wood, nodding politely to mid-century modern and Danish design. The tufted seat curves gently into the back. Olson, a face many will recognize from HGTV's Divine Design, says Beckett is one of her favorites in the collection. It's important for furnishings to reference the past, she notes, but to grow and evolve for the future as the homeowners grow and evolve. With the collection she hopes to ease the fear that comes with contemporary furniture by warming it up a bit. Suggested retail: $837.

"167040"	"he"	"notes"	" Another difference between then and now, he notes, is that Iran's 2003 offer was more of a true quid pro quo security in exchange for no nukes while it is unclear exactly what Ahmadinejad is asking for in his recent letter. Though an implicit invitation to talk, it also contains a litany of Muslim grievances and questions Israel's right to exist. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"167434"	"it"	"notes"	" The Times' policy on naming juveniles is fairly flexible. Often though not always, The Times shields the identity of a juvenile offender or suspect, it states.

"169411"	"he"	"notes"	" By the late 1940s, he notes, a process had begun by which avant-garde art was introduced into the network of communications of the mass media, so that it could be consumed, like any other luxury goods. By the 1980s, he writes, this process was completed, and art had become a domain dominated by branded personalities. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"170582"	"he"	"notes"	" No one has been more willing to set out the new domino theory than the administration's chief hawk, Cheney. In private meetings with foreign visitors and members of Congress, according to several participants in those sessions, he raises the prospect that if America fails in Iraq, Saudi Arabia will be the next target and then maybe Pakistan -- which, he notes, has a good-sized nuclear arsenal.

"170862"	"he"	"notes"	" As it is, he notes, the odds of an American being killed by international terrorism are about one in 80,000, about the same as those of being killed by a comet or a meteor.

"171679"	"he"	"notes"	" But while some, like Suzman, were swayed, others, like Hodes, urged caution.

It may be that people who had negative attitudes about aging somehow knew that they were not really well. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"171877"	"she"	"notes"	" As for protein, Farrell says 5 grams is good and 10 grams is plenty. With bars, it's not 'the higher, the better,'  she says. I think 20 and above is more than the average person would need, unless it's for a meal replacement, then maybe it's OK.

"171878"	"he"	"notes"	" Children are particularly vulnerable to excess amounts of the fat-soluble vitamin A, which may weaken bones, Cooperman says, and for this reason should not be given highly fortified bars. The tolerable level of vitamin A for a 3-year-old, he notes, is only 2,000 international units per day, while a bar with 50 percent of the adult daily value already contains 1,500 IU. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"

"173581"	"she"	"notes"	" Perhaps that is why turnover is so low among California prison guards. In 2004, for example, only 1,000 of 36,000 officers left the department, an annual turnover rate of 3.6 percent. As University of California, Irvine, researcher Joan Petersilia notes, this is very low for public service in general and quite unusual for prisons, where turnover rates nationally hover around 20 percent. California, she notes, may have the lowest turnover rate of any state corrections department. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
