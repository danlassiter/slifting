HEALTH-FUTURE (Los Angeles) _ When Dr. Bruce Chernof is done, no longer will you bring your sore throat, your fever or most any other common ailment to his hospital, Los Angeles County Olive View/UCLA Medical Center. Instead, if you can't afford a private doctor, you'll have to go for treatment at one of the county's 35 neighborhood health centers. And those centers, which now provide little beyond prenatal care and immunizations for students, will be filled with doctors who can treat nearly any medical condition. ``It is the future of health care,'' said Chernof, who is helping design a new health-care system that stops people from using the emergency room as a doctor's office. This radical shift from hospitals to health centers will begin in the next few months countywide, as the nation's second-largest health-care system rebuilds itself after teetering on financial collapse. By Keith Stone. (Will move in the ``n'' California news file.)  PEROT-SOCAL (Los Angeles) _ For decades, Harry Musolff was an unhappy Democrat. From one election to the next, he cursed lethargic lawmakers and a growing federal debt even as he dutifully cast his vote. Lifelong Republican Gloria Rothenberg has a similar story. Alienated from a party that increasingly condemned her pro-choice, pro gun-control views, she nonetheless felt compelled to take part in the process. Pat Cook's concerns centered on the future of her two children. Neither party, she believed, was doing anything to ensure prosperity for the next generation, leaving her frustrated and disillusioned.  The priorities of these suburban San Fernando Valley residents may vary considerably, but united they stand in some significant ways. All three welcomed Ross Perot's anti-status quo approach in 1992, joining United We Stand America, Perot's political action group launched after his unsuccessful White House bid. And now, despite the frequently inscrutable actions of the diminutive Texas billionaire, they have taken their disgust with the two-party system a step further, abandoning their political pasts to sign up for Perot's freshly minted Reform Party (known outside California as the Independence Party, a designation not permitted here).

That way, he believed, Washington stood the greatest chance of being able to impose its will on the rest of the planet, presumed friends and alleged foes alike. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"

"44593"	"they"	"believed"	" On some matters, the differences are striking. For example, two thirds of the doctors surveyed thought that the high cost of health care makes US firms substantially less competitive in global markets, while only a tenth of health economists and 17 percent of theorists believed it so. No health economists believed that the poor had more health problems than the rich mainly because it was hard for them to see doctors. Rather, they believed, the poor are sick because of conditions stemming from their poverty. One third of the doctors believed otherwise. Nearly half the doctors thought that, under a system of mandated benefits, employers would bear the primary burden of contributions to employees' health insurance, while nine out of 10 economists doubted it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"

"50582"	"they"	"believed"	" Senators began offering to travel with Dole on his 727 jet, keeping him company on the road. Dole, they believed, needed another grown-up on his airplane to counter all the aides in their 20s and 30s to whom he would not listen. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"
"50971"	"he"	"believed"	" The man's job was doomed and Baumbusch knew it. But spilling the secret, he believed, would violate his integrity as a corporate officer and doom the company to a firestorm of fear and rumor. There was no way to win and no way out. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"

"51747"	"they"	"believed"	" A: It can be traced to a perhaps mythical Ned Ludd, who in the late 1700s was said to have destroyed stocking frames in a textile factory in Leicestershire, England. Between 1811 and 1816, masked bands of workers, led by a ``General Ludd'' or ``King Ludd,'' made nightly raids on English factories, systematically destroying machines that were replacing handicraft. The riots began in Nottingham and spread throughout England as the raiders, who became known as Luddites, protested layoffs, low wages and poor- quality goods _ all, they believed, caused by textile machines. Repressive measures and increasing prosperity combined to put the Luddites down. Today a Luddite is anyone who fears and would eliminate automation, not only because of the unemployment it creates, but also for its effect on the quality of life and for the human destruction that the machinery of war might create. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"
"52079"	"he"	"believed"	" And discussing press disclosures of CIA secrets before a congressional committee, he told his listeners that ``the First Amendment is only an amendment.''

"53245"	"he"	"believed"	" Yet Galindo knew that what he'd done in San Jose wasn't one for the books. He had more clean programs in him, he believed, and he uncorked another one in the Alberta prairie. When he stood on the podium next to Eldredge and Kulik, received his bronze medal and saw the American flags going up, Galindo began weeping. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"
"54498"	"he"	"believed"	" Dr. Peter Piot, the director of the U.N.

"55522"	"he"	"believed"	" As the world recoiled in horror at the enormity of the new force released against Japan at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Fulbright understood well the dark impulses that, throughout history, have arisen from suspicions and mistrust rooted in ignorance. Education between and among peoples, he believed, was the antidote to the physical, intellectual and emotional barriers that separated them. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"

"72049"	"they"	"believed"	" According to De Cubas, the two were told the papers they were asked to sign were required for them to emigrate to the United States. That, they believed, is why they were told to put a thumbprint under their names. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"
"72204"	"they"	"believed"	" With Dole trailing badly in voter preference polls with less than two months to go, Dole campaign aides have always viewed the debates as a good opportunity to close the gap. The inclusion of Perot, they believed, would dilute the confrontation and lessen the chance that Dole could chip away at Clinton's standing.

Growing political frustration and economic pain, among Palestinians who saw no gains and felt that Arafat was being treated with contempt, was bound to explode. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"
"74195"	"he"	"believed"	" A critic, he believed, should express himself only in print. His shy dignity and reputation were such that few people tried to penetrate his reserve. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"
"75834"	"he"	"believed"	" When photographer Alfred Stieglitz in the early part of this century attempted to make a portrait of his wife, Georgia O'Keeffe, he decided that one photograph could never capture the complexity of any human. People have many aspects; they change as they age. A true portrait, he believed, would have to start in childhood and continue to death. He managed a pretty fair sample of that with the hundreds of images of O'Keeffe that constitute her single ``portrait.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"
"76208"	"he"	"believed"	" The Duke and Duchess of Windsor were married at his chateau in France.

He was ultimately arrested in 1942 in North Africa as a collaborator with the Third Reich. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"

"79517"	"he"	"believed"	" The study was begun after Smith and Baron discovered that Jonathan Winthrop, a distinguished professor of moral philosophy at Harvard in the late 18th century, had instructed his students to keep fastidious records on weather conditions throughout their lives because, he believed, prophetically, that they would be valuable to future historians. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"

"85784"	"he"	"believed"	" Improved service, he believed, would boost ridership. And to make that possible, he believed, an increment of the federal gasoline tax should be earmarked for Amtrak. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"87697"	"he"	"believed"	" He died here, too, early in 1993 in New York Hospital, after having contracted the virus that causes AIDS, he believed, in a blood transfusion during heart surgery years earlier. But now his name will be on the main stadium of a $238 million tennis complex that will be open to the public each year during the 11 months before and after the Open. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"88199"	"he"	"believed"	" And in the end, he questioned the importance of the secrets that both sides risked lives and spent billions chasing after. Ultimately, he believed, US-Soviet relations were affected far more by economic and political factors than by any intelligence coups pulled off by the CIA or the KGB. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"88835"	"they"	"believed"	" They turned down doctors' orders for invasive tests. They refused offers to put the child on AZT _ one of a group of drugs known as antiretrovirals that can reduce the level of the AIDS virus in an infected person and symptoms associated with the disease _ and other similar drugs whose effect, they believed, would be to put off but not prevent death. Ms. Rodriguez was convinced that taking such medications had actually worsened her own condition. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199703.gz"
"90904"	"he"	"believed"	" On opening day in Milwaukee one year, after both teams had finished batting and infield practice, after the grounds crew had raked the infield dirt and prepared the batter's and catcher's boxes, when no one else was on the field, Piniella walked to the plate, without a bat, assumed his stance, stared at the mound and took swing after imaginary swing. Repetition, he believed, was good for the mechanics of hitting. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"90910"	"he"	"believed"	" Engelbart knows firsthand how difficult it can be to get innovative ideas out on the market as products. He invented the mouse as part of a complex computer interface that included a keyboard with only five keys and software for online collaboration. The system, he believed, would help people use computers to make unprecedented progress in thinking and problem solving. But, to his frustration, only the mouse was embraced by manufacturers and popularized. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"94303"	"he"	"believed"	" Solomon also plunges intrepidly into his personal history: the death of his mother at 58, his struggles with unpopularity in grade school, his discovery of his homosexuality and the implications of that discovery for his psychological condition. He does not spare himself in this book. He tells about having unprotected, anonymous sex with men as part of a plan to contract AIDS, a form of suicide that would, in his mind, have absolved him of moral responsibility for his death. Luckily, he did not contract HIV. He talks at one point about becoming violent himself, savagely beating a former lover who, he believed, had cruelly betrayed him, and he writes with rigorous honesty about his feelings afterward: </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"97380"	"he"	"believed"	" Another problem, Halberstam postulates, was that, unlike the Iraqi conflict, situations in Africa and Eastern Europe didn't involve anything obvious enough to provide easy explanations for military intervention: ``The challenge in the Gulf War had seemed infinitely simpler. One country had invaded another. A border had been crossed ... all of that had been easy for Bush to understand, and thus, he believed, for the American people to understand as well.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"

"99901"	"they"	"believed"	" Conversations with actual Egyptians proved to be a lot less fierce, even when they ran the same course. I chatted with four businessmen, managers in multinational companies who had studied and worked in the United States. I was struck by the way the clash of cultures seemed to be contained within them. The Western news media were deliberately stereotyping Muslims, they believed, making ``fundamentalist'' synonymous with ``fanatic'' and dwelling on pictures of aroused mobs. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"

"100594"	"he"	"believed"	" The moment lasted only a month, but Gray, 32, took the lessons he learned all the way to Wall Street, where he became a foreign exchange broker for Cantor Fitzgerald. Work hard, he believed, and anything is possible. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"

"102008"	"they"	"believed"	" Tobacco, you might remember, was a New World product but it quickly made its way to Europe and then the Far East. It is believed to have reached China around the late 16th century. Snuff, a powdered form of tobacco, became a hit within decades, especially by the late 17th century. Though the Europeans favored snuff boxes to hold their habit, the Chinese began creating decorative little bottles, based on the simple medicine bottles (snuff, they believed, had medicinal qualities). </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"103082"	"they"	"believed"	" The next few years see Lupe and Salvador running from the law, having children, making love, fighting and coming close to death in the sweltering deserts of northern Mexico. But each time, they believed, Someone was watching over them, guiding them, teaching them to look inside themselves for the Answer. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"103566"	"he"	"believed"	" Capital punishment, he believed, should be reserved for extreme circumstances. Then he heard prosecutors explain that Tucker had killed two people with a pickax. At the time, she claimed to have received sexual gratification with every swing. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"104442"	"he"	"believed"	" Violence and hatred would subvert and ultimately destroy the black cause, he believed, because ultimately ``the end represents the means.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"105286"	"he"	"believed"	" He still played for the better football team, he believed, ``but today, New England was the better football team,'' Fletcher said. ``And I told them that.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"108223"	"they"	"believed"	" To the Catholics, the size was not the issue. Any mosque on the site, they believed, would challenge the Christians by blocking the square and by raising minarets from which the Muslim calls to prayer would echo through the basilica. On Easter 1999, violence broke out between Christians and Muslims. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"109313"	"they"	"believed"	" Two singers performed songs written before Sept. 11 that had become more relevant, they believed, since the terrorist attacks.

"109450"	"we"	"believed"	" ``To have turned to outside firms with no knowledge of these complex transactions would necessarily have required them, we believed, to expend a very significant amount of time getting up to speed before they could provide us with recommendations,'' Derrick said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"

By John Markoff.  I-VILLAGE-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ On advertising strategy at I-Village, the online community for women. By Saul Hansell.  NEW-ECON-COLUMN (Undated) _ Developments in the registration of Internet domain names. By Susan Stellin.  COMPUTER-BRIEFS (Undated) _ In an apparent innovation, a Web ad for Comedy Central's TV show ``Crank Yank'' enables the viewer to send a recorded prank phone message to anyone, with a click of the mouse, using IP telephony ... The National Weather Service's recording, which for several years has been a computer-generated voice, is getting a human touch _ in a variety of ethnic and regional variations ... Faced with billions of dollars of debt and tepid consumer response to services like video on demand, cable television operators are looking for new ways to take advantage of their digital network systems, which the industry estimates cost $1,000 to build for each subscriber.  E-COMMERCE-COLUMN (Undated) _ This spring, Eziba began selling goods and giving away proceeds to charities. On Monday, Novica.com starts doing the same. Few, if any, big companies sell items with an eye toward both the bottom line and the public good, but in the online arts category, at least, it's a nascent trend. By Bob Tedeschi.  NASDAQ-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ Nasdaq's first annual report, released last week, has almost no financial information printed in it, and what information it does contain is misleading. By Floyd Norris.  PATENTS (Undated) _ Early this month, a life sciences company won a patent for an insomnia drug even though the drug is based on a chemical compound already covered by another patent. By Sabra Chartrand.  SKOREA-INSURANCE (Seoul, South Korea) _ The South Korean government plans its first overhaul of insurance regulations in 25 years, eliminating a 40 percent ownership limit on life and nonlife insurers. The changes should make it easier for conglomerates to get into the profitable insurance business. By Don Kirk.

"125180"	"we"	"believed"	" ``We've never stopped believing in ourselves,'' Angels infielder Scott Spiezio said. ``Even after we started slowly, we believed, and that's why we're here today. From here on out, we have nothing but big games. We try to focus on each game like it's our last one. This is what you dream about when you're a kid.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"126637"	"he"	"believed"	" He is 42, in the middle of his fifth war, and considers himself something of an expert in running and hiding. Women have always been kind. ``It was his fate, he believed, that life smacked him in the head every chance it got, then paid him back in women.'' A fair exchange is no robbery. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"129562"	"he"	"believed"	" The answer, he believed, lies in a concept called self-organized criticality. He frequently illustrated the idea with the image of a sand pile, like one that forms at the bottom of an hourglass. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"129712"	"he"	"believed"	" He left out the word win. It would come, he believed, by consistently working on these greater goals. And it has. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"130587"	"he"	"believed"	" This passion to understand the world geometrically led him to invent catastrophe theory, which sought to quantify how continuous actions (sailing along the smooth surface of a lake) could suddenly give way to discontinuous change (plunging over a waterfall). Such events, he believed, could be described with their own topography: abstract mathematical forms, with names like the cusp, the swallowtail and the butterfly, that could be used to chart and even predict life's surprises, bringing them within reach of reason. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"131278"	"he"	"believed"	" It was just sticky enough on the gray side _ the palm side _ to snag a pigskin through a rainstorm, he believed, so he used them Monday on a soggy day at Giants Stadium. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"131732"	"I"	"believed"	" It was a matter of pride and principle (and, again, neurosis) for me. If you're in a book club, I believed, you should make a commitment to read the books. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"131960"	"he"	"believed"	" Last August Ritter began to feel a greater urgency for his mission as carrier of the olive branch. He expected Bush to use the anniversary of 9/11 as a ``jingoistic springboard'' for attacking Saddam. To prevent war, he believed, the Iraqis needed to respond to worldwide pressure and allow the weapons inspectors back in, and he wanted to go to Baghdad to convince them. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"133537"	"he"	"believed"	" Banko testified in his own defense and denied their accounts, as well as the former altar boy's. But during Solari's cross-examination he acknowledged that he had once told detectives he had had sexual relations with both men and women who, he believed, were all older than 18. He said he had interpreted his vow of celibacy to mean he could never marry but could engage in sexual relations. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20021211.0443 type=story > <DATELINE> IRVING, Texas  (BC-FBN-COWBOYS-CORNERS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"135568"	"he"	"believed"	" Aron, in acidly calling his book ``The Opium of the Intellectuals,'' meant something similar. But in his era, he believed, the opium was a secular form of religion _ Marxism itself. Like religion, Aron argued, Marxism was a response to misfortune, offered a promise of salvation, gave meaning to human misery and helped direct actions and interpretations. But for Aron it was also a delusion, cloaking the complexities of history and society behind simple formulas and clouding moral perceptions. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"135759"	"he"	"believed"	" This charged atmosphere has obscured the story of the Army's spectacular transformation. Alexander, for example, took offense when President Bill Clinton argued that Colin Powell, promoted to brigadier general during Alexander's tenure, was the product of an affirmative action program. Alexander viewed the measures he had taken as common- sense fairness but rejected the label ``affirmative action.'' The term, he believed, implied that the black candidates for general had been less qualified than the white candidates or that they had been given some ``extra'' benefit. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136543"	"he"	"believed"	" In ``The Lord of the Rings,'' J.R.R. Tolkien wrote out his own myth. ``Certainly myth . . . holds an estranged place in the modern world, as Tolkien well knew,'' Bradley J. Birzer writes. ``But, he believed, so much the worse for the modern world.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"137880"	"he"	"believed"	" In August 1964, he picketed the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, N.J., where, he believed, most of the promoters of civil rights legislation could be found. He vowed he would never serve blacks in his restaurant, and so he sold it. The two former employees who bought it reopened it on a desegregated basis, but not before Maddox erected a monument in front of the building to mourn the ``death of private property rights in America.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200306.gz"

"141677"	"he"	"believed"	" Walden is an unusual work, more a digression-filled letter from a friend than a sustained philosophical argument. Still, Thoreau had some important principles to lay down. He wrote it for the mass of Americans who, he believed, lead lives of quiet desperation, sleeping through life and missing the most important things going on around them. His intent, he declared in the epigraph, was to crow like a rooster in the morning to wake my neighbors up. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"142405"	"he"	"believed"	" Abortion, he believed, is not a question of when life begins. It is a question of when love begins, and the answer lay in solidarity with mother and child alike. In the end, we're all hard cases; we all depend on the compassion and forbearance of others. Life is an unfolding gift, and it is not for anyone to throw it away. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"143827"	"he"	"believed"	" Serving five years in prison for conspiracy, Glisan said he was less concerned about deceiving shareholders with questionable accounting than hurting Enron's reputation. Enron, he believed, had serious financial problems by then and could have collapsed if Wall Street discovered its sleight of hand or if Enron wasn't able to make good on a handshake promise to get Merrill Lynch out of the deal within six months. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"146913"	"they"	"believed"	" Within hours, they'd all found Peterson guilty of the murders. But they still had to decide if the murders were premeditated. Peterson, they believed, had carefully planned his wife's murder, but several jurors felt he wasn't thinking about the Petersons' unborn baby when he plotted to kill his wife. There were many times Peterson had demonstrated how much he'd liked children, and, Cardosi recalls asking, if he'd really been focused on killing the baby, wouldn't he have stabbed his wife in the stomach? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"148402"	"we"	"believed"	" The terrible inequity was like a pebble shifting around in the shoe: always there, and occasionally excruciating. The visible reality that our work in the clinic was helping the people of the mountainside could not be dismissed, yet even as we took coffee and oatmeal in the morning, or sat down to a modest supper after a long day, we could glance past the clinic doors and wonder if this or that child had eaten such a meal all week. We handed out hundreds of nutrition bars on our walks, and thousands of vitamins at the clinic, yet we never invited anyone to fill a plate at our table. To do so, we believed, would engage a vast, unquenchable need and transform the clinic from a source of hope and care into a divisive, demeaning, and ultimately failing endeavor. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"149484"	"he"	"believed"	" Einstein's convictions are fairly well known. He objected to quantum physics and its probabilistic clouds. God, he famously asserted, does not play dice. Also, he believed, not everything depends on the perspective of the observer. Relativity doesn't imply relativism. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"
"149901"	"he"	"believed"	" He exhibited and published his personal work here and there, but those occasions were too few and far between to sustain a high-profile career, and Kertesz became a forgotten man. Always thin-skinned and irascible, he watched bitterly from the sidelines as artists like Cartier-Bresson and his fellow Hungarian Brassai -- who both, he believed, appropriated his innovations -- became famous. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"
"152277"	"he"	"believed"	" Gwyneth Paltrow was mentioned as a candidate for Samantha at that time, although, according to Josephson, the part might have also come up during general meetings with Jennifer Aniston, Alicia Silverstone and Cameron Diaz. Through the summer and fall of 1996, Beane was being queried about set descriptions. From New York, he heard that the film's budgets were being drawn up -- an indication, he believed, that the movie was perilously close to happening. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"154148"	"they"	"believed"	" At midnight on Thursday, dozens of people approached the Coney Island shore, turned to face the boardwalk and tripped backward into the ocean, observing a ritual hundreds of years old as they splashed water -- and, they believed, their bad luck -- behind them. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"154608"	"she"	"believed"	" Good health, she believed, was as straightforward as a glass of cold, pasteurized, whole milk. Mid century families drank it at every meal. The milkman cometh. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"157473"	"he"	"believed"	" For the growing forces of the Enlightenment, it also seemed to overturn the very idea that a theodicy could account for the disaster. Voltaire, who had once seen nature as benevolent, was whipped into a rationalist fury by the experience. Leibniz, he believed, had been refuted by nature. Voltaire wrote a Poem on the Disaster of Lisbon in which the quake's victims are called Tormented atoms on a heap of muck/ That death devours and that fate trips up. His character Candide watches the earthquake from a distance, seeing it as morally blind, killing the good and preserving the wicked. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
"157726"	"we"	"believed"	" I thought the most proud I was of our football team was their effort, Brown properly said. At times, we didn't play very good, but we played hard, we believed, and we played with confidence. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
"159503"	"he"	"believed"	" In moments like this, the hometown boy himself put stock in the old sports myth. Hard work was important, he believed, but performing in the clutch would be determined by innate talent. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"159789"	"he"	"believed"	" Case Western Reserve University hosts a day of Cooke-related panels and lectures. Guralnick speaks to an integrated audience, praising the little details, the musical embroidery that turns Cooke's songs from simple to sublime. He discusses Cooke's charisma and his association with Malcolm X, and the time he refused to leave a Louisiana hotel after being turned away, he believed, because he was black. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"160425"	"they"	"believed"	" They actively scoped out Casey as their weapon of choice against Santorum; Casey's antiabortion stance, they believed, would strengthen his chances against the much-despised Santorum. Casey, the current state treasurer of Pennsylvania, was recruited by party leaders, including Senator Charles Schumer of New York - who believes that fealty to the precedent established by Roe is required of any Supreme Court nominee. Prominent prochoice Democrats such as Kerry, DNC chairman Howard Dean, and Senator Hillary Clinton of New York made fund-raising pitches on Casey's behalf. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"161033"	"he"	"believed"	" The center, he believed, could serve as a modest substitute for the network of Jewish schools, libraries, theaters, museums and synagogues that had been destroyed, and could help preserve historic Hebrew books and materials that had survived. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"161131"	"she"	"believed"	" When the role of Paris in Troy came along, Kwatinetz clashed with Keshishian. He felt that the role presented too weak an image for an actor aspiring to the position of virile leading man. Keshishian felt differently. Bloom was slowly building a career, she believed, and a prominent part in a major international epic was a smart move. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"161279"	"he"	"believed"	" But his generation of Leavenworths, he believed, had slipped into mediocrity. So he included an open letter to his family that announced his intention to set up scholarships at three prestigious universities: Yale, Hamilton and the University of Michigan. His hope was to stimulate the energies and ambitions of male Leavenworths for years to come, and that the funds would never go unused. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"164148"	"I"	"believed"	" I'm a Holocaust survivor, and 61 years ago when I was liberated from Auschwitz, I believed, I was naive, I was 21 years old, and I believed that the world had learned their lesson and there would never be another genocide, she said. I made a commitment, when I was fortunate to come to this country, that I would never become a bystander. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164387"	"he"	"believed"	" But the agent, Harry Samit, testified that he was regularly thwarted by senior bureau officials whose obstructionism he later described to Justice Department investigators as criminally negligent and who were, he believed, motivated principally by a need to protect their careers. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"166092"	"he"	"believed"	" Alexander, who taught at the University of Chicago, drew connections between specific personality types and diseases like hypertension, stomach ulcers and asthma. Chronic emotional disturbances, he believed, led to tissue changes in various organs and thus a series of diseases. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"166093"	"he"	"believed"	" Of particular concern to Javert were women who had habitual abortions -- three or more miscarriages. The chief conflict experienced by such patients, he believed, was fear of pregnancy and of the baby. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"166569"	"he"	"believed"	" Unitarianism, in Jefferson's eyes, was progress over the ages of superstitious teachings of the so-called Christian priests. In fact, he hoped that the church would someday be reformed to bear witness to true Christianity. Jesus, he believed, was no more than a man but the greatest of all philosophers. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"166659"	"he"	"believed"	" Elmer Gabrieli, a doctor who left communist Hungary after World War II, was a visionary scientist. Computers, he believed, could revolutionize medicine by helping doctors analyze patient records. In the 1970s, he stepped down from his faculty position at the State University of New York at Buffalo's medical school, sold his lab, and invested the proceeds in his work. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"169299"	"they"	"believed"	" Part of the answer is that, after their crushing defeat in the 1930s, conservatives rebuilt their movement by adopting a purely negative stance against liberalism. They were so completely excluded from power, they believed, that in 1955 William F. Buckley Jr. famously depicted them Standing athwart history, yelling Stop. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"171856"	"he"	"believed"	" Brian Cashman, the general manager, watched from the stands and said he was stunned. This team, he believed, had that special something, that championship moxie he had seen before. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172887"	"they"	"believed"	" Researchers had long supposed that the increase in longevity was a passive phenomenon: on a low calorie diet, organisms would have lower metabolism and produce less of the violent chemicals that oxidize tissues. But Guarente and Sinclair believed that longer life was attained by an active program that triggered specific protective steps against the diseases common in old age. It was because these diseases were averted in calorie restriction, they believed, that animals lived longer. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173057"	"he"	"believed"	" His refusal, he believed, eventually led to his imprisonment for drug possession. American hippies protesting South Korea's participation in the Vietnam War had introduced Shin to marijuana and LSD, which he said he took for a while, but quit because it interfered with his work. The hippies went back to the United States, Shin said, but left a huge quantity of marijuana at his home. South Korean musicians, interested in experimenting, came to him. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173175"	"they"	"believed"	" The gap between theory and practice turned out to be hell for American airmen, who served, in effect, as guinea pigs in a series of experiments devised by a coterie of Mitchell disciples that Miller calls the Bomber Mafia. Long-range, fast-moving bombers, they believed, could fly unescorted into enemy territory and rain destruction with impunity. Its morale broken and its industry destroyed, Germany would surrender, making an invasion by ground forces unnecessary. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
