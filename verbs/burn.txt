"12349"	"we"	"burn"	" ``We're not the ones who are pulling up to the bridge and throwing desks and refrigerators over the side,'' Wells said. ``We use what society throws away.

"13288"	"they"	"burn"	" Shocking? Yes. Surprising? No. Having found little or no satisfaction in the courts, a number of America's abortion activists have gone well beyond crowding the entrances to clinics and jeering at patients. Instead they bomb, they burn, they murder. Some refer to these efforts as a ``war,'' and a holy war at that. But ``war'' implies armed combatants, and in this battle only one side is armed or even, strictly speaking, a combatant.

Others like Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield played soul-rock, with its melodrama (I yearn, I burn, I cajole, I tease, I strut, I conquer, I beg, I weep, I curse) and its love of Latin-tinged beats and gospel phrasings. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"
