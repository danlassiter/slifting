Bloomberg as a self-indulgent lark. This was so not only because of Bloomberg's limitations as a first-time candidate, but because of the immutable laws of New York politics that traditionally ensure Democratic victories. But Bloomberg's stunning victory raises the question of whether any of those laws still hold. Bloomberg campaigning with Mayor Giuliani on election day.

The filing describes other details as well about operations at the company, including a new joint venture in China, a $50 million credit line it seeks from lenders, and Feuerstein's $475,000 annual salary.  But final control over Malden Mills is the main topic under negotiation in bankruptcy court in Worcester, a forum where companies are often broken up or their senior managers replaced.  Already an attorney for the unsecured creditors in the case says he expects much opposition to the proposal, which he says is based on overly optimistic sales growth figures.  ``In essence, the company is asking the unsecured creditors to buy into a long-term pipe dream,'' said the attorney, Andrew Schwartz of Foley Hoag. The reorganization plan, he expects, will generate ``substantial opposition from the creditor constituencies.'' For one thing, the bulk of creditors' repayments wouldn't start until roughly 2005.  Malden Mills's Feuerstein has various cards to play to stay in his post, however. He is best known for continuing to pay idled workers after a devastating fire in 1995, and for using insurance money to rebuild locally.  Over-rebuilding and a decline in the outdoor-goods market then forced the company into financial difficulty. Lenders led by GE Capital Corp. forced the company into bankruptcy in November as a condition of further loans, and Schwartz and others have said Feuerstein could be forced aside.  That might be an unpopular choice, however. According to the filing, consumers worried about Malden Mills's future have sent donations totaling more than $10,000. In contrast to the credibility issues raised by the collapse of businesses like Enron and WorldCom, many media reports about Feuerstein have emphasized ``the corporate responsibility ethics espoused by Malden Mills,'' according to the court filing.  The proposed reorganization plan must now be approved by a federal judge, who will take into account the concerns of all sides. A GE Capital spokesman didn't return calls for comment Tuesday.  Major lenders still have some leverage if they don't want Feuerstein to remain or want to be repaid sooner than the company's 10-year schedule. In its plan Malden Mills says it is negotiating with lenders to arrange what it calls ``an exit financing credit facility of up to $50 million.''  Now the ball is in the creditors' court, said Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard Law School bankruptcy specialist. Large public companies often see their chief executives replaced within two years of emerging from bankruptcy, while smaller firms often keep their management in place. For closely held Malden Mills, with annual sales around $180 million, the situation is somewhere in between, she said.  ``Many creditors may want to see the current management stay around. Whether management stays will depend on whether the creditors as a group have confidence in Mr. Feuerstein,'' Warren said. ``If they like him, he's going to stay. If they don't like him, he's out of there.''  Schwartz declined to discuss what outcome his clients might seek. It could still be months before the court reaches a final decision.  Of the $50 million credit line sought by Malden Mills, $10 million would be guaranteed by the Massachusetts Development Financing Authority, the filing states. The company says its owes senior creditors about $160 million in all; it plans to repay the amount in quarterly payments over seven years, beginning three years from the day the reorganization begins, according to the filing.  To show how it can make the payments, the filing also includes projections of the income the company expects to generate through 2012. It projects net sales increasing from $183 million in 2003 to $250 million in 2012, and the company swinging from a loss of $7.3 million to a profit of $29.9 million during the same period.  One reason for the growth, the company states, is a new joint venture it has arranged with a Chinese company, Shanghai Challenge Textiles, to help gain sales it would otherwise have lost to Asian competitors. It has established a similar operation in Germany.  Separately, Malden Mills states in the filing that the company has struck a series of settlement agreements with various insurance companies over outstanding claims that Malden Mills and its casualty insurer had brought. Together these settlements have generated $5 million for the company, the filing states.  In the filing Malden Mills said it will provide at a later date details on how it will treat various debts such as certain leases. It estimates that in a Chapter 7 proceeding to break up and liquidate the company, creditors could expect to recover $38 million to $61 million. It has saved more than $4 million in payroll by cutting about 25 administrative jobs, according to the filing and company spokesman David Costello; it expects that it would eliminate about 50 of its 1,200 jobs if the reorganization plan is accepted.  In that case the reorganized company would keep Feuerstein as its chief executive, at a salary of $475,000, the filing states. The figure has remained the same in recent years, Costello said. Feuerstein's wife would also remain with the company, as a vice president paid $80,000 a year, according to the filing.

"153838"	"she"	"expects"	" Incensed, Knox takes up with another, even more marginalized group: the gay students who are suing the Lubbock School Board. Calling Nichols a sellout, she quits the Youth Commission and declares herself a liberal Democrat. This, she expects, will be the last straw for her parents, conservative Republicans who have been forbearing, though nervous, about their daughter's shift in priorities. (They do seem wowed by the media attention she receives as well as -- no doubt -- the documentary cameras.) Indeed, her mother, stressing that Knox seems thinner since leaving the Youth Commission, is chagrined by her daughter's new enthusiasm for gays and liberalism. But she doesn't stop her. Eventually, they march together to protest homophobia. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"161404"	"she"	"expects"	" For some of the Orchard's international partners, the strategy is working. Epsa, an Argentine tango label, distributes about 500 albums through the Orchard. Laura Tesoriero, the label's chief executive, who also works with the Orchard as a representative in South America, said it had sold 10,000 digital tracks last quarter -- no more than a rounding error by the standards of the United States pop music market, but enough to leave her feeling encouraged about the future of digital sales. A significant number of those sales, she expects, were to Argentines living in this country. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
