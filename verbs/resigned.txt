"12930"	"he"	"resigned"	" Gingrich bristles at any comparison between his book deal and the one that caused Wright such turmoil. ``In the case where I talked about Speaker Wright, after the Ethics Committee investigated, he resigned,'' Gingrich noted Monday. The Ethics Committee alleged that bulk sales of Wright's book, ``Reflections of a Public Man,'' were intended to skirt House limits on outside earned income; book royalties are exempt from those limits. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"

Five years ago, the church ceded control to a foundation that it created to raise enough money to eventually purchase and operate the 400-acre campus. The foundation hired Sherman Jones, a Harvard graduate, as headmaster, and he redesigned the curriculum to create a college preparatory program. But last June, he resigned, and now the school is $1 million in debt with an uncertain future, said Thad McClammy, the school's acting headmaster. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199703.gz"

None of the stabbing injuries were serious.  The man, a 26-year-old who resigned from his job at the priority- mail-sorting center on Harrison Avenue last month over a dispute with a co-worker, returned around 6:30 p.m. Tuesday armed with a .380-caliber handgun and two large folding knives, said Anthony Esposito, a postal inspector.  A woman who knew the man tried to stop him at the door, Esposito said. ``She said, `Don't do this. Turn around,''' he said.  But the man, whose name was not immediately released, brushed past her into the building. He tried to get onto the work floor, but he did not have a key pass, so he entered a locker room off the lobby, Esposito said.  There, the man took out one of the knives and attacked two women and one man, Esposito said. One person was stabbed in the neck, one in the back and one in the arm, he said.  Someone called 911, and when three Kearny police officers walked into the locker room several minutes later, the man had stripped to his underwear and had apparently slit one of his wrists, said Terrence Hull, the first assistant Hudson County prosecutor. The man was smeared with blood _ probably his own _ and was holding the gun, Hull said.  The officers ordered the man several times to drop the gun, but he refused, and when he started walking toward them, all three officers opened fire from about 10 feet away, Hull said. ``You see some guy in his underwear, covered with blood and holding a gun, and he's not listening to you, you don't have much of a choice,'' Hull added.  The man's gun, which was loaded, was not fired, Hull said.  The man was pronounced dead at the scene. The stabbing victims were treated at hospitals and released.  The 250 workers at the center, a vast gray warehouse along a county highway that runs through the marsh between Jersey City and Newark, were herded into another wing after the incident.  ``They wanted to make sure no one got hurt, because they weren't sure if he had any accomplices,'' said Stanley Haynes, an equipment operator. After more than two hours, the workers were sent home.  The man, who came to the United States from Ethiopia in 1984 and lived in Newark, had worked in temporary jobs for the Postal Service since 1998, the authorities said. He had worked at the main post office in Newark and at another postal building at Newark International Airport.  He started working at the Kearny center, which distributes and sorts priority mail for much of New York City and New Jersey, in January, Esposito said. On March 5, after a personal dispute with a woman on the job, he resigned, Esposito said.  ``Employees described him as very troubled,'' Esposito said.  It was not clear if the man intended to attack the woman involved in the personal dispute, Esposito said. She was not in the building at the time of the attack, he said.  Tuesday's attack was the latest violent episode in a postal building in northern New Jersey. In 1991, a fired postal worker in Ridgewood killed two mail handlers as they arrived for work. In 1993, a former postal employee killed four co-workers in the Upper Montclair post office.  Although postal employees have become synonymous with workplace violence in this country, a study released last year by the Postal Service found that they were no more prone to workplace violence than the average American worker. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010411.0043 type=story > <HEADLINE> BRYANT RETURNS TO LAKERS WITH BIG EFFORT </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  ((to be updated with quotes)) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
