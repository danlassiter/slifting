Jesse Helms, the incoming chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, created a new uproar Tuesday when he was quoted saying that President Clinton was so unpopular on military bases in North Carolina that he ``better have a bodyguard'' if he visits the state. Helms later called the comment ``a mistake.''   Just days after Helms, a Republican from North Carolina, created a storm of controversy by saying that President Clinton was not up to the job of commander in chief, he told The News and Observer, a newspaper in Raleigh, that ``Mr. Clinton better watch out if he comes down here.''   After several senators criticized the comments that Helms made to the Raleigh newspaper on Monday, he issued a statement in which he called the comment ``an offhand remark'' not meant to be taken literally.   Concerned by the threatening nature of Helms's remarks, the Secret Service announced that it was looking into his comments and whether the president faced any threats in North Carolina.   (NYT) -- A federal appeals court Tuesday upheld the expulsion of a midshipman from the U.S. Naval Academy who had acknowledged that he was homosexual.   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on a 7-3 vote rejected Joseph C. Steffan's argument that his discharge solely because of his stated sexual orientation was unconstitutional.   The decision reverses an earlier ruling by a three-judge appellate panel that had ordered the Naval Academy to reinstate Steffan.   (NYT) -- The busiest travel week of the year hits full stride Wednesday, when an estimated 1.3 million passengers will jam the nation's airports amd millions more holiday travelers will clog roads and highways.   Because of changes in traditional Thanksgiving travel patterns, more people than ever will be heading for far away places, eager to squeeze in a variety of sights and sensations in just a few days.   ``Instead of journeying to Grandma's house near home, many families will spend Thanksgiving a good distance from home, treating the holiday as a mini-vacation,'' said Jerry Cheske, who monitors travel patterns for the American Automobile Association.   Henry Blinder, a spokesman for Thomas Cook Travel/American Express, said, ``We're noticing that more people than usual are also taking off Friday this year, in addition to Thanksgiving day, and using it for vacation travel.''   WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (NYT) -- The incoming leaders of Congress won standing ovations Tuesday after they pledged to the nation's Republican Governors to restore power to the states.   They also reassured the governors that while the states would get less federal money, they would not be unduly burdened by efforts in Washington to balance the budget and streamline government.   In their first joint appearance since the election two weeks ago, Newt Gingrich, the House Speaker-in-waiting, and Bob Dole, who will be the Senate Majority leader, also were here to emphasize that they could work well with each other. The two men have never been particularly close, and during the campaign this year Dole declined to endorse Gingrich's ``Contract with America.''   WASHINGTON (NYT) -- Federal regulators adopted new rules Tuesday for the sale of mutual savings banks to other banks or investors, the last step in a 10-month crackdown on deals in which savings executives legally pocketed millions of dollars.   Under the regulations approved Tuesday, executives will no longer be allowed to award themselves free stock and options in the transactions, or buy large chunks of stock in their institutions' initial public offerings.   The regulations also set new appraisal procedures, aimed at eliminating the consistently low prices for initial public offerings that resulted in mutual savings bank stocks jumping by 20 percent or more on the first day of trading until recently.   WASHINGTON (NYT) -- Firing back at conservatives who have vowed to trim welfare costs, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich Tuesday issued a broad but vague call to choke off as much as $200 billion in ``corporate welfare'' as a way of finding money for job training and other programs to help workers.   Corporate subsidies should be investigated across the board, he said in a speech to the Democratic Leadership Council. But he stopped short of identifying any unreasonable or counter-productive subsidies. Though he referred to a Democratic think tank study that identifies $111 billion in political pork, the labor secretary said he was not endorsing that report or the suggestions in it.   Instead, in his third speech in which he has laid out a theory of America on the decline -- with a crimped middle class and a growing divide between the rich and poor -- he blamed social divisions and lingering pocketbook issues for the Democrats' defeat in the elections and reiterated his vow to streamline and reinvigorate his department's approach to job training and job creation.   Convulsive political change will continue, he warned, until the middle class sees an end to a spiral of downward mobility that started 15 years ago.   LEWISBURG, W. Va., Nov. 22 -- Tracy M. Lippard, a beauty queen who discovered her boyfriend was seeing another woman when he skipped her final pageant, Tuesday was convicted of trying to murder the parents of the other woman.   Miss Lippard, 23, admitted she tucked a loaded pistol in her pocket and went looking for her boyfriend the morning after he broke his promise to attend the pageant. Planning revenge, she drove from her home in Newport News, in Tidewater, Va., to Lewisburg -- a 275-mile trek from a land of strip malls and burglar alarms to one of church bells and country roads.   ``This was the last lie,'' she testified. ``I had laid awake all night, wanting to know the truth. Any woman who has ever been two-timed, or three-timed, or whatever knows the feeling.''   Indeed, the love triangle turned out to be more like a love trapezoid. The boyfriend testified he was dating Miss Lippard in Virginia, had impregnated a woman in West Virginia and was engaged to someone in North Carolina.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941122.0215 type=story > <HEADLINE> DEM SENATORS PROPOSE FILIBUSTER RULE CHANGE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WASHINGTON  (BC-FILIBUSTER-HNS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"

Times News Service  ERBAKAN OF TURKEY VISITING LIBYA AND NIGERIA  ISTANBUL, Turkey (NYT) _ Pressing his campaign to forge a worldwide alliance of Muslim nations and evidently unconcerned about foreign and domestic criticism, Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan of Turkey plans to leave on Wednesday on a trip that will take him to Libya and Nigeria.  According to press reports here, Erbakan is making the trip against the advice of his own foreign ministry. Turkey has been governed since June by an uneasy coalition between Erbakan's pro-Islamic Welfare Party and the Western-oriented True Path Party headed by Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller.  Erbakan's trip to Libya and Nigeria is to deepen Western concerns. The United States has declared Libya a terrorist state, and it is under international sanctions for failing to turn over two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland. Nigeria's military rulers have jailed the winner of the country's last presidential election, and attracted worldwide criticism after executing nine opposition figures last year.  BURMA CONTINUES TO BLOCKADE HOME OF PRO-DEMOCRACY LEADER  YANGON, Myanmar (NYT) _ The government said Tuesday it had detained more than 500 people and would continue for now to blockade the home of the pro-democracy leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, in the most widespread crackdown in years on the political opposition.  The official press quoted Senior General Than Shwe, the leader of the military junta in the former Burma, as calling the measures mild and warning that more ``drastic actions'' could be taken against opponents of the regime.  At a press briefing, a government spokesman, Col. Kayw Thein, said that the detentions had been made to prevent Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's political party from holding a conference over the weekend and that most of the detainees would be released.  But he said Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi had broken the law by making weekly speeches at her home and that authorities were still considering whether to take further action against her.  DEFENSE MINISTER SAYS RUSSIAN MILITARY FALLING APART  MOSCOW (NYT) _ Russia's defense minister said Tuesday that the military is falling apart and that the Kremlin may no longer be able to count on it in a crisis.  Gen. Igor Rodionov, who was appointed to his post this summer at the recommendation of security adviser Alexander I. Lebed, painted a despairingly bleak picture of a ever-shrinking military that was poorly trained, poorly housed and even poorly fed.  Rodionov dismissed talk of a direct mutiny in the ranks. But at the same time he warned that moral was plummeting to the point where the military was becoming politically unreliable.  If months of back wages are not paid, he warned, ``the Defense Ministry cannot guarantee that no undesirable and uncontrollable processes will develop in the armed forces.''  ``That is, the army will stop performing its direct duties,'' he added ominously.  EUROPEAN UNION TO CHALLENGE U.S. CUBA SANCTIONS IN WORLD TRADE COURT  WASHINGTON (NYT) _ In a surprise rebuff to the Clinton administration just weeks before the election, the European Union said Tuesday it would challenge in the court of world trade the United States law that imposes sanctions on foreign companies doing business with Cuba.  The action came only weeks after President Clinton sent a special envoy, Stuart Eizenstat, on a tour through Latin America and Europe seeking to stop any action against the United States, telling the European Union that any effort to take its case to the World Trade Organization would be ``ill advised.''  But Eizenstat met intense opposition to the American action, from presidents and prime ministers who complained that the United States was using its economic power to extend its laws beyond its shores.  GAP IN HEBRON REMAINS HUGE, ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS SAY  HEBRON, West Bank (NYT) _ Hebron, with its pale stone houses, crumbling archways and sacred monuments, chafed under an Israeli-imposed curfew Tuesday while Israeli and Palestinian officials meeting in Washington worked to shape the next phase of this ancient city's existence.  Hebron is the last West Bank city still patrolled by Israeli troops. In the middle of the city of approximately 100,000 Arabs live some 400 or so Jews, surrounded by Israeli army posts and coils of concertina wire. The previous Israeli government agreed that most Israeli troops would be pulled out, and those who remained were to be posted in the immediate vicinity of the Jewish settlements.  Interviews here with both settlers and Palestinian residents suggest that the gap in expectations remains huge.  Palestinians darkly warned that any move to renege on the signed commitment by the Israelis to withdraw troops from Hebron would only insure further bloodshed.  NEW AFGHAN RULERS SEEK TO PRESENT NEW IMAGE TO WORLD  KABUL, Afghanistan (NYT) _ After a harsh beginning that included hanging the corpse of the country's last Communist president in a public square, Afghanistan's new Muslim fundamentalist government set out Tuesday to present a more congenial image to the world, and in particular to the United States.  A senior official told a news conference that the Taliban religious movement whose troops overran Kabul last week wanted what he called ``friendly and good relations'' with the United States, and that the new government would welcome American aid in rebuilding this war-devastated country.  He also ruled out backing from the new government for international terrorism of the kind that has been associated with some Islamic fundamentalist groups, and said the Taliban would not seek to spread its fundamentalist creed to Muslim countries, including Pakistan, that neighbor Afghanistan. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19961001.0510 type=story > <HEADLINE> CALL THEM IRREPRESSIBLE OFFERS: WAYS OF WALL STREET (REPEAT) </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> New York, Oct. 1 (Bloomberg) (BC-WAYS-OF-WALL-STREET-REPEAT-BLOOM) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"

Writing in The American Scientist three years ago, they warned, ``As the population density along the Atlantic Coast continues to increase, northeasters will have an even greater impact upon the lives and livelihoods of coastal residents.'' </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19961028.0425 type=story > <HEADLINE> LADYBUGS AT HOME </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-SCIENCE-Q&AMP;A-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"
"76669"	"he"	"warned"	" In particular, Gore praised Torricelli, a seven-term Democrat locked in a tight race with Rep. Richard Zimmer, for his efforts to stop ocean dumping and to prevent oil spills. If Republicans remain in control of the Senate and Congress after Election Day, he warned, they will give polluters a role in creating environmental laws. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"
"80122"	"he"	"warned"	" Reynolds predicted that retail, restaurant and small to medium-size companies will be pleasant surprises in 1997.

"80233"	"he"	"warned"	" A ``collapsing financial asset bubble'' isn't a Fed concern if it doesn't ``threaten to impair the real economy,'' Greenspan said, and the sharp 1987 stock market drop ``had few negative consequences for the economy.''

"86633"	"he"	"warned"	" At that moment, ``the crook'' was barricaded inside the National Palace a few blocks away, protected by sandbags, troops and barbed wire. After one month of rowdy protests and a 48-hour nationwide strike observed by 2 million people _ one sixth of Ecuador's population _ Ecuador's deeply unpopular president, Abdala Bucaram, was fighting a desperate battle for survival. Late Thursday night, ``El Loco'' _ the lunatic, as Bucaram proudly calls himself _ was ousted by a majority vote in Ecuador's 84-seat Congress on the grounds of ``mental incompetence.'' Fabian Alarcon, president of the National Congress, was sworn in as Bucaram's interim successor _ until new elections next February. But the disgraced leader was refusing to go quietly. Calling himself the victim of a ``constitutional coup,'' Bucaram locked himself in his office and vowed he wouldn't turn the government over to ``congressional conspirators.'' To add to the confusion, Vice President Rosalia Arteaga said Alarcon's appointment was unconstitutional and declared herself president. As Ecuador's three presidents stared one another down, the mood on Quito's streets was changing from exuberance to anger and violence: on Friday night an 18-year-old high-school student was killed, the first casualty of the crisis. Meanwhile, Gen. Paco Moncayo, Ecuador's popular army chief, urged a ``constitutional solution'' and pledged his troops wouldn't use the mounting chaos as an excuse to crush Ecuador's democracy. But, he warned, ``we cannot allow a power vacuum to continue.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"

"86865"	"they"	"warned"	" I first posed the question to the flight attendants on my Aer Lingus flight over, and judging from their puzzled responses I probably should have dropped the inquiry there. Jean asked Jan, who asked the rest. They came back with several suggestions _ none of which, they warned, were real Irish but all were guaranteed to be fun. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"86910"	"I"	"warned"	" My initial advice to Ken Burns was clear, sharp-edged and, as subsequent events would show, dead wrong. You cannot make a documentary film about Thomas Jefferson, I warned, because Jefferson predates the photograph. All the earlier Burns documentaries depended upon gritty photos _ of Civil War battles, old-time baseball players or Western landscapes _ artfully arranged and mixed with talking heads who explained what the pictures meant. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"

"89071"	"he"	"warned"	" Bush is welcome to spend time and money in California, said Bob Mulholland, a spokesman for the state Democratic Party. But before election day, he warned, the Texas governor is going to have to talk about subjects that are much more controversial than education. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200007.gz"
"89223"	"he"	"warned"	" In 1930, James Weldon Johnson wrote that Harlem was, unlike most black ghettos consigned to cities' borders, at the ``heart of Manhattan.'' For that reason, he warned, it would probably not last as a black area. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200102.gz"
"90477"	"he"	"warned"	" ``Nobody here can be organizing a private army or arming 20 men with rifles,'' he said last month. ``Here, the armed forces are our defense, and no one else.'' If ranchers defy him, he warned, ``they will go to prison.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"90891"	"they"	"warned"	" Opponents argued that the measure, called the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, would chip away at abortion rights by codifying a fetus _ at any stage of the pregnancy _ as a separate individual.

"92684"	"he"	"warned"	" Gareth Evans, former foreign minister of Australia and now president of the International Crisis Group, said at a news conference here on Thursday that the potential for the type of genocide that occurred in Rwanda, where more than half a million Tutsi and moderate Hutu were massacred in 1994, exists in Burundi. The Security Council, he warned, seems unprepared to act. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"93496"	"he"	"warned"	" A senior security official said Monday that Israeli intelligence has evidence that freed militants are rebuilding bomb-making infrastructure, which was dismantled through arrests by the Palestinian Authority in the two years before the current fighting broke out. The result, he warned, will be deadlier bombs. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"93727"	"he"	"warned"	" Last Saturday President Bush and Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, talked hopefully about bridging the differences between Washington and Moscow on missile defense. On Monday Putin indicated what might happen if they did not. If Washington withdraws from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, he warned, Moscow will set aside its 1993 nuclear arms reduction treaty with the United States and put multiple warheads on its missile force. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"

"94112"	"they"	"warned"	" But skeptics of missile defense said the report clearly showed that even the most advanced anti-missile technology needed years of testing to work out unforeseen bugs.

"95241"	"he"	"warned"	" Jim Avery, the utility's senior vice president of fuel and power operations, likened the electric system to a fishing net: only as strong as its weakest link. Without the new lines, he warned, blackouts could become commonplace in San Diego County by 2004. But the need in southwest Riverside, where the utility proposes erecting steel transmission towers as tall as 190 feet, is less imminent. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"
"95674"	"it"	"warned"	" The report outlined the demographic pressures on Social Security. However, it warned, when the huge Baby Boom generation begins to retire, the government will be forced to cut benefits or raise taxes by more than 25 percent, undertake extensive borrowing or eliminate other federal programs. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"

"96999"	"he"	"warned"	" In 1928 Justice Louis D. Brandeis made a prediction. Someday, he wrote in a dissent to a Supreme Court decision on wiretapping, the government may find ways to reproduce documents in court without removing them from ``private drawers.'' Such methods, he warned, will expose ``the most intimate occurrences of the home.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"

"100981"	"he"	"warned"	" If the South were to lift the military alert, said Hong Kwan-hee, director of planning at the Korea Institute of National Unification in Seoul, an adjunct of the government, ``there will be a very big reaction here.'' Conservative forces, he warned, would protest against further concessions by Kim, who has often been accused of yielding to North Korean pressure since he met with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, in June of last year. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"101273"	"he"	"warned"	" Still, it is too early to tell how much weight to give the latest economic data, said William Dudley, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs. He does not think that new data has been good enough to have ``motivated this change in the mood'' in the bond market. ``You don't know what October means until you see November,'' he said. Retail sales, he warned, ``could bounce right back down again.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"102405"	"he"	"warned"	" ``An accomplice's testimony has the potential of being explosive for  the prosecution,'' said Michael Iacopino, president of the New Hampshire  Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.

"105242"	"he"	"warned"	" Also Sunday, the NATO secretary-general, Lord Robertson, said it was urgent for European members of NATO to spend more on their militaries to be able to fight a modern war.

"105394"	"it"	"warned"	" The partnership, it warned, ``is a very complex vehicle designed to thread the needle of a variety of accounting, regulatory and tax issues.''

By Barry Bearak, Eric Schmitt and Craig S. Smith.  With map.  AFGHAN-WOMEN-EDUC (Kabul, Afghanistan) _ The task had Aziz Ahmad Rahmand, a professor of contemporary Afghan history, bursting with pride as he hurried about Kabul University on Wednesday. Rahmand was supervising entry examinations, the kind of duty senior professors in most other countries shun. But not in Afghanistan, where the source of the professor's bliss lay in the fact that row upon row of women were taking the exam. By John F. Burns.  With photos.  KIDNAPPED-REPORTER (Islamabad, Pakistan) _ As authorities here search for a British-born Pakistani militant suspected of kidnapping an American journalist, Pakistani officials _ including President Pervez Musharraf himself _ are raising the possibility that he acted with the help of Indian intelligence agencies. By Douglas Jehl.  AUSTRALIA-SECURITY (Sydney, Australia) _ Australia wants firmer penalties and longer jail sentences for convicted spies and traitors, but broad legislation proposed after Sept. 11 for that purpose could also imprison public sector whistle-blowers and journalists who expose scandals, not state secrets, civil libertarians and legal experts contend. By Becky Gaylord.  RUSSIA-EXERCISE (St. Petersburg, Russia) _ It was 100 years ago that Lenin stirred future Russian revolutionaries with the portentous query, ``What is to be done?'' Two weeks ago, President Vladimir Putin proffered an answer: calisthenics. A slothful population, he warned, was sapping not only Russia's health but also its potential to rebuild itself as a great power. Putin's scolding may have failed to move the average sausage-and-potatoes Russian to exertion, but it hit Russian politicians like a cannon-fired medicine ball. By Michael Wines.  CHECHNYA-CASUALTIES (Grozny, Russia) _ The Russian army continues to take casualties in its battle against Chechen rebels, who lay mines and snipe at them daily. But dozens of civilians are killed and maimed each week too, and their suffering occupies medical workers day and night. By Patrick E. Tyler.  With map.  NIGERIA-EXPLOSION (Lagos, Nigeria) _ The accidental explosion in Nigeria's largest city two Sundays ago came after months of rising lawlessness here in Africa's most populous nation. It focused anger on an elected government that is widely seen as ineffective, uncaring and, nearly three years after the end of military rule, dangerously fragile. By Norimitsu Onishi.  With map.  SOMALIA (Jameao, Somalia) _ Since Sept. 11, the United States has taken a new interest in Somalia, which is so fractured that the nominal government controls less than half its capital city and some coastal strips, believing that it may become Osama bin Laden's hiding place, a refuge for experienced terrorists and a breeding ground for new ones. By Donald G. McNeil Jr.  With photos and map.  INDIA-BOMBAY (Bombay, India) _ For Bombay, the capital of India's financial services sector and the enduring symbol of the country's ambition and pluck, supporting the basic human needs of its citizens is a challenge of mammoth proportions. By Somini Sengupta.  With map.  CAMBODIA-TRIBUNAL (Phnom Penh, Cambodia) _ Cambodians said they felt betrayed and abandoned after the United Nations gave up its attempt to create an international tribunal to try former leaders of the Khmer Rouge. Worn down by the stubbornness of the Cambodian government, the United Nations said Friday it was ending nearly five years of negotiations over the makeup and procedures of the tribunal.

By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.  IRAN-1979-RECONSIDERED (St. Louis) _ Rodney V. Sickmann has been rethinking his role in one of the first acts by Islamic extremists against the United States, on Nov. 4, 1979, when he was a Marine guard at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. On orders from his superiors, Sickmann did not so much as lob a tear gas grenade at the mob coming to occupy the embassy. Now he thinks he and his fellow guards should have started shooting. The surrender, he said, sent the message that there was no penalty for attacking the United States. By Matthew L. Wald.  TERROR-MISSING (New York) _ Thumbnail sketches of some of the victims of the attack on the World Trade Center.  FARMS-POLLUTION (Dedham, Iowa) _ By the time the Raccoon River winds through the western hills here, passing corn fields and livestock pens before reaching Des Moines miles to the east, it is so polluted the city has to put it through a special nutrient filter to meet government standards for drinking water. The culprits are not industrial plants or mines belching toxins into the river. They are Iowa farms. By Elizabeth Becker.  KORBUT-FAME (Norcross, Ga.) _ At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, Olga Korbut won three gold medals in gymnastics. But while she was a contortionist in the air, her personal landing has been hard. On Jan. 31, Korbut was accused of shoplifting $19.35 worth of goods from a supermarket. And the Secret Service is investigating the manufacture of $30,000 in counterfeit $100 bills found in an abandoned home that she formerly owned. No one has been charged, and she denies any connection to conterfeiting. But whether the supermarket incident was a misunderstanding or a sad, desperate act, it underscores the troubled, melancholy life Korbut has led in her attempt to come to grips with her Olympic fame. By Jere Longman.  With photos, NYT20 on 2/1 and NYT13 on 2/6.  CLEVELAND-VOUCHERS (Cleveland, Ohio) _ What distinguishes St. Rocco School on Cleveland's gritty west side from Catholic schools in other parts of the country is that the state of Ohio is paying the bulk of the tuition for half of the school's 200 pupils, who are the recipients of vouchers designed to help them and several thousand other pupils in Cleveland flee failing public schools. The question of whether such an arrangement amounts to outright government aid to parochial schools and thus violates the Constitution's separation of church and state will be taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court later this month. By Jacques Steinberg.  With graphic.  ENRON-COLLAPSE (Houston) _ Investigators picking through the wreckage of Enron, seeking to understand what caused its collapse in December, have explored its byzantine partnerships and financial strategies. From these details, a clearer picture has begun to emerge about what happened inside the walls of Enron during its last 11 months. It is two completely different tales _ the public image, polished by its most senior officers, of an innovative powerhouse on the verge of reshaping the world, and the hidden truth of a company plagued by secrets, whose executives were struggling to hold it together. By Kurt Eichenwald with Diana B. Henriques.  ENRON-OVERVIEW (Undated) _ A summary of Enron news from the past week.  POULTRY-ANTIBIOTICS (Undated) _ The poultry industry has quietly begun to bow to the demands of public health and consumer groups by greatly reducing the antibiotics that are fed to healthy chickens. By Marian Burros.  OXYCONTIN-MISUSE (Undated) _ As misuse of OxyContin has spread nationwide, lawmakers and others have looked to causes like the aggressive promotion of the drug by its producer, Purdue Pharma. But officials say that another facet of that problem may be doctors who are so enthusiastic about the useful role of narcotics in pain treatment that they become targets for drug seekers or fail to detect patients prone to addiction. By Barry Meier.  POLITICAL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Texas race to feature debate in Spanish; New Tucson district drawing a crowd; Reno must battle for union support; Hawaii GOP eyes governor's office. By B. Drummond Ayres Jr.  WASHINGTON  (Coded w)  BUSH-POLITICS (Washington) _ President Bush has decided that it is time for full-scale Republican politics. He has committed to appear at dozens of fund-raisers and other political events for Republican candidates across the country in this midterm election year, and has told members of Congress that retaining Republican control of the House of Representatives is his first political priority. His second, he has told them, is regaining Republican control of the Senate. By Elisabeth Bumiller.  COLUMNS  (Coded k)  DOWD-COLUMN (Washington) _ Where have all the glowers gone? By Maureen Dowd.

"106051"	"he"	"warned"	" If a woman does go out on a mission for longer than a day and a night, he warned, she must be accompanied by a male chaperone. He was quoted in the London-based Al Sharq Al Awsat on Feb. 2. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"110625"	"he"	"warned"	" The threat from agriculture terrorism, he warned, won't last just a few months. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"111569"	"he"	"warned"	" And, he warned, the United States will respond decisively wherever threats form around the world. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"111897"	"he"	"warned"	" Blowing a soccer referee's whistle and calling the executives ``off sides,'' Chavez warned about a ``subversive movement in neckties'' trying to destabilize the country. But, he warned, ``I can do away with all of them,'' he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"112144"	"they"	"warned"	" Our own guess is that the 40 Nobel laureates, whose letter was released yesterday by the American Society for Cell Biology, have a better grasp of the science. They argued that a ban on research and therapeutic cloning ``would impede progress on some of the most debilitating diseases known to man.'' Those ailments include Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, spinal cord injuries and various cancers and neurological diseases, among others. Research cloning may help scientists develop embryonic stem cell treatments that would not be rejected by a patient's own body, the Nobelists said. A ban on this important science, they warned, would send a strong signal to young researchers that ``unfettered and responsible scientific investigation is not welcome in the United States.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"115084"	"he"	"warned"	" As governor of Texas, Bush signed a similarly limited mental health parity law. And during his speech, he warned, ``It is critical ... that we do not significantly run up the cost of health care.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"115087"	"he"	"warned"	" As governor of Texas, Bush signed a similarly limited mental health parity law. And during his speech, he warned, ``It is critical ... that we do not significantly run up the cost of health care.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"

"116105"	"she"	"warned"	" In her notes of Oct. 9, Temple, who has so far invoked her Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate herself and thus has not testified, noted that an SEC investigation was ``highly probable.'' If the firm's Professional Standards Group, responsible for resolving difficult accounting questions, did not approve of treatment of Enron financial disclosures, she warned, Enron would still have to restate its earnings and there was ``probability of charge of violating C&AMP;D in W.M.,'' or violating the cease-and-desist order that was part of the Waste Management settlement. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"

"117591"	"he"	"warned"	" ``You win a goat, it's a very nice thing,'' Ngubane said. But the competitions, he warned, are not for amateurs. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"118272"	"he"	"warned"	" ``The IPO was a big hurdle,'' said Rob Plaza, an analyst with Morningstar Inc. ``Short of the IPO, insolvency was a real possibility. The fact they can bring in cash from CIT eliminates almost all chance of bankruptcy or insolvency.'' But, he warned, ``They're going to have to write down more of their assets.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"119093"	"he"	"warned"	" Arafat told reporters in Ramallah that suicide bombings against civilians ``must be completely halted.'' Otherwise, he warned, the result might be ``full Israeli occupation of our lands.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"119455"	"he"	"warned"	" ``They have made a political decision to react to the market's needs, not anticipate them,'' Goldstein said. ``We think 9/11 demand will be back and if we have a normal autumn and winter, then we think we will have oil demand grow this winter by 2 percent or higher.'' OPEC, he warned, may not be ready for such a jump in demand and prices could go up sharply. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"119816"	"they"	"warned"	" This was deeply controversial territory. To many doctors, keeping score was yet another assault on their autonomy and prestige. It could also, they warned, be dangerous: The statistics were tricky and easily twisted. The malpractice lawyers would pounce. Worse still, if women knew how many cancers their doctors were missing, they might avoid mammograms altogether. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"

"121911"	"he"	"warned"	" But, he warned, ``It might be that there's some disappointment as to what the actual applications are. I would be a little cautious about declaring that this would be the next big thing'' before networks are fully upgraded and the kinks worked out. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"121972"	"she"	"warned"	" But, she warned, the governor still needs to be ``careful'' when it comes to two issues important to many Hispanics: public education and the state's harsh drug laws. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"122569"	"he"	"warned"	" But television, he warned, ``has begun to cannibalize itself, and `TV-ography' is a great example. Old television is no longer just for reruns; it's beginning to have its bones picked every which way.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"122971"	"he"	"warned"	" Still, most Afghans admit that they need the American troops. The new government is counting on them not only to battle the remaining Taliban and al-Qaida forces but also to act as a check on meddling neighbors, especially Pakistan, which had supported the Taliban. ``We don't have any options except to have the Americans here,'' said Muhammad Kazem Ahang, a prominent professor and member of loya jirga, the traditional governing body that chose Karzai as interim president. But, he warned, ``It must be done sensitively.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"123553"	"he"	"warned"	" CHOREOGRAPHERS-MUSIC-CHOICE (New York) _ George Balanchine said that Verdi's music could be danced from beginning to end, but Mahler, he warned, was not for choreographers. What may sound enchanting to one choreographer may be as grating as car alarms to another. By Joseph Carman. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"123770"	"he"	"warned"	" George Balanchine said that Verdi's music could be danced from beginning to end. But Mahler, he warned, was not for choreographers. What may sound enchanting to one choreographer may be as grating as car alarms to another. While most choreographers might agree on a few desirable elements in a musical score, disagreements abound about which musical choices are truly inspiring or, conversely, wholly unacceptable. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"

"125424"	"he"	"warned"	" ``Studios have a great habit of creating movies based on something that works,'' said Tom Wolzien, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. But, he warned, if studios fail to deliver a character with whom moviegoers identify, ``then the shelf life for sequels and merchandise is half as long.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"125637"	"he"	"warned"	" ``We expect Baghdad will send a confirmation on its readiness to comply,'' Ivanov said. Otherwise, he warned, Baghdad will have to ``bear all the responsibility of the consequences'' of continuing to defy the will of the international community. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"127150"	"they"	"warned"	" It will be preceded by a storm surge of 10-20 feet, they warned, as well as by numerous rain bands dumping from 6 to 10 inches on land still soggy from last week's Tropical Storm Isidore. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"127804"	"he"	"warned"	" Such unauthorized information and uninformed speculation, he warned, puts the investigation at risk. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"135425"	"he"	"warned"	" Bonds could even have a negative year, he warned, if the economy is a little stronger than expected and the Federal Reserve Board raises its benchmark short-term interest rate sooner than the second half of the year and more than the expected half a percentage point. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136355"	"he"	"warned"	" Any delays, he warned, could threaten its successful removal. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"

"137386"	"they"	"warned"	" On the eastern end of the city, some 22,000 Marines awoke on Wednesday morning to attack. The plan was to fan out across the city, attacking the strongholds of the regime, going block by block, if need be, to root out the diehards. The Marines were planning on a long and tough fight. Urban warfare, they warned, would not pretty. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200304.gz"
"137884"	"he"	"warned"	" Sherman said the suits would initially target people who make large numbers of songs available over the Internet, but could soon target even those who download a few songs. No one, he warned, would be exempt. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200306.gz"
"137953"	"he"	"warned"	" Joseph Cirincione, a non-proliferation expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told CNN that the United States and North Korea need a ``face-saving way'' to end a standoff over negotiations that centers on U.S. demands for multilateral talks and North Korean demands for direct U.S.-North Korean talks. Without some sort of progress, he warned, miscalculations on both sbout it.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200307.gz"
"138230"	"he"	"warned"	" ``We need to decide as a nation what we want to do,'' he admonished. The solution, he warned, was not just a jazzy new shuttle, though his report made clear that the 1960s technology of the current model is part of the problem. ``We shouldn't start by designing the next vehicle,'' he said. ``That is a trap that we've fallen into several times.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200308.gz"
"140096"	"he"	"warned"	" But, he warned, freedom of expression, while welcomed, is leading to other consequences. You will find more young people, I'm sad to say, turning to fascism and jingoism. Why? Because of poverty. If you look at the history of Germany, you'll understand. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"140963"	"he"	"warned"	" When blending ingredients with fruit, he warned, You can use lighter, playful flavors, but you have to justify those aromas, that sweetness, with something deeper, like the toasty nori. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"141467"	"he"	"warned"	" Gov. Jeb Bush said he would appeal the decision. Unless it is overturned, he warned, the ruling could invalidate other scholarship programs in the state, including those for college students and for children in special education. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"142257"	"she"	"warned"	" I don't think the average citizen understands what that means, Emergency Management Chief Laurie Feagans said. Power lines and tons of trees could come down because of high winds and the already-saturated ground, she warned, and -- if that happens -- cars should stay off the roads. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"142856"	"he"	"warned"	" In a book called Weapons of Mass Distortion, Bozell warned that newscasters, especially CBS anchor Dan Rather, regularly deny having biases and yet allow their views to seep into coverage. Unless that changes, he warned, the liberal news media are headed for a meltdown, he warned. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"143352"	"she"	"warned"	" She also noted that when lawmakers first raised concerns about the wireless directories, companies balked at the idea of allowing customers to opt out for free. Privacy policies and industry promises, she warned, can change. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"144940"	"he"	"warned"	" But if the 10th is processed instantly, he warned, it could cause many of the others to be returned for insufficient funds, running up charges from both banks and creditors. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"146641"	"he"	"warned"	" Most executives say they see no sign of this yet, but they are still cautious. We don't see the danger of a huge collapse that would cause them to export huge tonnage, said Nicholas Tolerico, the president of ThyssenKrupp Steel Services, the trading and distribution arm of the German giant. But at the same time, he warned, If there were even a slight downturn, probably the first thing that would be adjusted is the amount they import. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"148485"	"he"	"warned"	" After what he called the years of sabbatical following the end of the Cold War, the nation faces a world forever hardened by the Sept. 11 attacks. And, he warned, unless tyrants are tamed, things will only get worse. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"148723"	"he"	"warned"	" American officials have been trying to convince Iraqi voters that they can vote safely. American and Iraqi operations conducted over the last several weeks have set the conditions for the vast majority of Iraqis to vote safely, said Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the senior American commander in Iraq, in a brief interview here. But even so, he warned, There will be violence. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"150396"	"she"	"warned"	" If he doesn't stay away from the gangs, she warned, he is going to get hurt or he's going to get in a lot more trouble. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"150870"	"he"	"warned"	" Mess with the game, he warned, and it will mess with you. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"150937"	"he"	"warned"	" We're left with impossible decisions, said Weldon, a strong supporter of Pentagon spending who was lamenting the trillion-dollar costs for the major weapons systems the Pentagon is building. One of those choices, he warned, might cut back Future Combat. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"151107"	"he"	"warned"	" But, he warned, coercive techniques will induce a detainee to say anything to make the discomfort stop. At various points, US officials have approved of threatening prisoners with menacing dogs, shackling prisoners into painful stress positions for up to four hours, and engaging in physical contact that threatens the subject but does not injure him. Some interrogations have gone further. FBI reports say prisoners have been sexually humiliated and shackled for 24 hours without food. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"151553"	"he"	"warned"	" When Chirac announced the referendum in late February, a clear majority approved the Constitution. But in a poll released the day before his TV presentation, 53 percent said they intend to vote against the document. Since much of the impetus for the new Constitution originated in France, a rejection by French voters could be a devastating blow to the entire project. Chirac warned that France would be weakened if it became the only country not to ratify, saying opponents of the text were deluding themselves if they believed that the other 24 EU members would consent to renegotiate the 448 articles of the new Constitution after a French no vote. Instead, he warned, France will be the black sheep who will have blocked everything. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"151986"	"he"	"warned"	" To put it in his words, as our governor, Weld wanted to bring the portcullis down on further state borrowing so as not to cantilever debt onto new generations; budget-balancing, he warned, was not a lightning strike, but more like Vicksburg, a siege whose success could be hastened if a goony bird descended from the sky carrying $100 million, or if patronage walruses could be purged from the payroll. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"153145"	"he"	"warned"	" President Jacques Chirac went on television to urge the French to approve the European Constitution in a referendum on Sunday. This is a historic responsibility, he said with the flags of France and Europe behind him. Europe would break down if the treaty were rejected, he warned, while France would be less strong in defending its interests. But poll after poll has predicted that the French will reject the treaty; the latest, for Le Figaro, gave the no camp 55 percent. The constitution needs a unanimous yes from the union's 25 countries to come into force, and rejection by France would be humiliating personal defeat for Chirac. When he decided to put the constitution to a popular vote last year, support for it was 60 percent. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"153667"	"he"	"warned"	" Rochelle Dreyfuss passed photographs of the two bags to her friend Graeme B. Dinwoodie, director of the intellectual property law program at the Chicago-Kent College of Law at the Illinois Institute of Technology. He advised Nicole Dreyfuss to fire off a cease-and-desist letter to Abercrombie. But, he warned, don't expect much in return. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"153968"	"she"	"warned"	" By learning to land on my midfoot, I could correct these problems, Davis said. But I should be careful, she warned, because tinkering with a new gait can suddenly load the heel and Achilles with unaccustomed stress and cause a whole new set of injuries. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"154032"	"he"	"warned"	" If progress isn't shown soon, he warned, we're going to lose the American people or we're going to break the American army. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"154052"	"she"	"warned"	" Most important, marketing experts say, is to keep adding features to the premium product after the cheaper one comes out. Companies will be OK as long as they keep innovating in their premium line, Hopelain said. But, she warned, if they do not want a mass migration to the less expensive items, they'd best not be tempted to put new features in the cheaper product for a long, long time. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20050623.0230 type=story > <HEADLINE> HIGH COURT RULES THAT HOMES CAN SEIZED FOR PRIVATE PROJECTS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WASHINGTON </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"

"155220"	"he"	"warned"	" Ogden said he was reasonably optimistic that conferees could reach a middle ground on a sales tax increase. But, he warned, even a half-cent increase may provoke a filibuster this late in the session. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"155230"	"he"	"warned"	" Mayer said the lack of pharmacist involvement could lead to adverse reactions to medications. And, he warned, customers -- especially seniors -- could be robbed of their drugs, depending on where pharmacies locate machines. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"156171"	"he"	"warned"	" Even after two years of effort to correct the foam debris problem, he warned, there will continue to be a threat of critical debris generation. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"157358"	"they"	"warned"	" Besides, if the company won, it might set a scary precedent. Federal law recognizes a right to reverse-engineer products to make compatible add-on products. The BnetD people thought this provision of the law covered them. If it didn't, they warned, just about any entrepreneur who wants to study a software product, then augment it, could find himself in the dock. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
"157398"	"he"	"warned"	" Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said the tally of the dead cannot be made until the house-to-house search for living victims is concluded. When the death count is totaled, he warned, it will be an unhappy memory. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
"158555"	"he"	"warned"	" But Monto said that it was not necessarily a good idea to allow broader production of Tamiflu by more companies in more countries. If Tamiflu becomes widely and inexpensively available to the general public, especially in countries where medicines are distributed with little regard for prescriptions, he warned, then Tamiflu might start being used so heavily that the bird flu virus could develop resistance to it, possibly even before the virus becomes an epidemic. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"

"163386"	"he"	"warned"	" Climate change may also complicate environmental reviews. Antoni Lewkowicz, a professor of geography at the University of Ottawa, worked on permafrost issues surrounding an Alaska pipeline plan more than 20 years ago.
