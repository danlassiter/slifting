The moral he drew was that if America stopped the North Vietnamese now, it would not have to fight a larger war later. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"

"157949"	"he"	"remarked"	" Other films by Wisethat continue to enjoy enthusiastic support include The Body Snatcher, a 1945 horror film with Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi; The Set-Up, a gritty 1949 study of second- rate boxers; and the 1951 science-fiction cult favorite The Day the Earth Stood Still. Wise counted among his own favorites The Haunting, a cult favorite from 1963 with Julie Harris and Claire Bloom, and the 1958 drama about capital punishment, I Want to Live! Wise considered himself a director of content, not messages, and he was not afraid to experiment. In 1959 he filmed Odds Against Tomorrow, an anti-racist drama with Harry Belafonte and Robert Ryan about a brutal bank robbery that he made without the customary fades (going to black) or dissolves (overlapping scenes) to denote the passage of time. Fades and dissolves, he remarked, tend to slow the tempo and break the mood. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
