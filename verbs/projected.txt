The economists also projected Japan's short-term and long-term interest rates will move higher by year-end, while the official discount rate will remain at a record low 0.5 percent.  Japan will likely grow 2.2 percent this year, according to the poll of 18 economists, the strongest since it expanded 4.0 percent in 1991.  But the Nikkei 225 stock average will rise only 600 points by December to 21,850 and the dollar will stay at about 105 yen until year-end, economists predicted.  To be sure, investors have priced the economic recovery into stock prices. But arguably the most important factor behind that optimism has been the yen's retreat against the dollar, which increases earnings at Japan's export-dependent manufacturers.  Consider the parallels: From July to December, the dollar rose 23 percent against the yen and the Nikkei average rose 37 percent. Since the start of this year, however, the dollar has risen 3.0 percent and the Nikkei has increased 3.5 percent.  Furthermore, the road to economic recovery looks like a long, painful one. Structural problems, ranging from falling real estate prices to excessive payrolls, are hindering growth. Most corporate profit growth so far has come from cost-cutting.  Reflecting that, economists project Japan's jobless rate will be 3.3 percent by year-end, near the current record 3.4 percent.  ``This is an economy that, although it is enjoying a cyclical recovery, is still battling against structural problems,'' said Russell Jones, chief economist at Lehman Brothers Japan Inc. ``It's lost its dynamism.''  Continued import growth and weak exports will narrow Japan's trade surplus for a second year, by about 17 percent to $89 billion, economists said. In 1994, it reached a record $120.9 billion.  Economists expect three-month certificate of deposit rates to rise to 0.88 percent by year-end, up from the current level of 0.66 percent. The yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond would be 3.6 percent, they projected, up from the current 3.19 percent.  Higher interest rates will offset the smaller trade gap, keeping the yen stable, economists said.  Growth this year will be driven by capital expenditure, the poll showed. Capital investment is projected to rise 3.9 percent, while consumer spending is projected to grow 2.4 percent.  Individual forecasts for the year follow: Cap.
