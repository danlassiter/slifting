Here, however, two of Nynex's potential competitors -- AT&AMP;T and MCI -- cry foul. They say that, contrary to the commission's intent, the accord would block their entry. The companies would have to use Nynex's wires to complete medium-distance phone calls, and they would have to pay Nynex access charges. AT&AMP;T and MCI say the accord sets these fees too high for too long. Upcoming public hearings should resolve this dispute. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199410.gz"

He's going to be working with the Make-a-Wish Foundation to raise money while, he hopes, bringing home a gold medal.

Interested people may pledge on QVC, a home shopping network. Kaepa and Champion, two of the official sponsors of USA Volleyball, are helping publicize the efforts with Ctvrtlik, who says, ``I just want to give something back.''

WASHINGTON  SECRET-SENATE-COX _ WASHINGTON _ For the next two days, the 15 freshman senators elected this fall will go through a basic orientation for the august chamber. The sessions, covering things like a ``History of the U.S. Senate'' lecture by senior Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, are closed to the public. That means not just the media, but any taxpayer is not allowed in. And some are complaining that that's taking things a little too far. (Foskett). MOVED.

GOP-LEADERSHIP-COX _ As the Senate Republican Conference gets set to vote for its leadership for the next two years, GOP officials had hoped that they could avoid any contested races. The Democrats, after all, had managed to line up behind their leaders. But for the GOP, they will have a contest between Sen. Paul Coverdell of Georgia and Sen. Conrad Burns of Montana for the Conference Secretary position. A contest that leaders hope won't result in more bad blood against an increasingly powerful Southern Republican group. (Foskett).

TEEPEN-COLUMN-COX _ UNDATED _ The Republican congressional leadership that talks of cooperation with President Clinton on even-numbered days is working on odd-numbered ones to investigate the administration to, it hopes, death.  The game is somehow to so discredit the president and first lady that the splash also will swamp Vice President Al Gore, calculated by Republicans to be the next Democratic nominee and feared, if he is, as likely a popular one.

Now she was living in Paris, and I was on my way home from Moscow. We were meeting for lunch. She picked the place, a small, exclusive restaurant a block off the Champs Elysees. The maitre d' stopped me halfway through the door. In Paris, the same as back home, foreigners sometimes have a hard time making themselves understood. But this much I could understand: Katya certainly seemed to have cache among the rich and floosy. From Moscow to Paris, she had come a long way. (Murray). MOVED.

Forst, a cocky, prepsychedelic, 64-year-old white heterosexual male, the former bad-boy editor of New York Newsday who led that paper to two Pulitzer Prizes but also reveled in front-page cheesecake photos of Marla Maples and Donna Rice, is the oddest choice to edit The Village Voice, the 41-year-old leftist, weekly since Clay Felker, the New York magazine founder and prince of the where-to-find-the-best-pastrami story, who once ordered two stricken Voice writers to stop using only lower case. By Elisabeth Bumiller. (With photo.)  INTERNATIONAL  (Moved in `i' category)  CUBA-U.S. (Washington) _ The Clinton administration announced Wednesday that it would allow American news organizations to open bureaus in Cuba for the first time in nearly 30 years, hoping that the presence of a foreign corps of journalists will increase diplomatic and political pressure on the Communist government of Fidel Castro. By Steven Lee Myers.  TURKEY-SECULAR (Sincan, Turkey) _ Scenes that unfolded in this working-class suburb of Ankara over the last few days have stunned millions of Turks who want to believe that their country, even though it is now governed by an Islamist prime minister, will remain a secular democracy. By Stephen Kinzer. (With graphic and photo.)  KOREA-ASYLUM (Tokyo) _ A top North Korean leader slipped away during a shopping trip in Beijing and asked for asylum in South Korea, the South Korean government announced on Wednesday. If confirmed, the defection would amount to a spectacular coup for Western intelligence services trying to learn more about North Korea, one of the most isolated countries in the world. By Nicholas D. Kristof.  MEXICO-REBELS (Tecoanapa, Mexico) _ The people of this corn-farming village in the mountains of Guerrero State pride themselves on being hospitable. But they were especially friendly to the masked and uniformed guerrilla fighters toting AK-47 rifles who marched into the central plaza at dusk on Feb. 5 and held an hourlong rally. By Julia Preston. (With graphic.)  GERMANY-TV-SEX (Bonn, Germany) _ As Germany's cable television secures its place as Europe's richest, multimillion-dollar advertising marketplace, more and more cable planners are demanding greater freedom to show programs displaying uncensored sexual organs and acts. By Alan Cowell.  BUSINESS DAY  (Moved in `f' category)  WAGE-GROWTH (Raleigh, N.C.) _ American workers _ downsized, re-engineered and shoved into salary ruts _ are slowly beginning to climb back up. Last year, they won wage gains that were the largest since 1990, keeping them ahead of inflation for only the second time in a decade. Modest though these raises were, many economists expect them to continue. By Allen R. Myerson. (With graphics and photo.)  AMERICAN-PILOTS (Undated) _ Unionized pilots at American Airlines will not decide whether to strike until Friday. But given the widespread travel disruptions that the threat has already caused, a strike seems in many ways to have already started. By Adam Bryant. (With graphics and photo.)  AMERICAN-PILOTS-CLINTON (Washington) _ American Airlines canceled its Friday night overseas flights Wednesday in the face of a looming strike deadline, as President Clinton urged the nation's second-largest carrier and its pilots union to resolve a dispute that ``has huge implications for our country'' through mediation. By Todd S. Purdum.  AOL-MARKETPLACE (New York) _ America Online Inc. has long divided Wall Street into two sharply divided camps. To its supporters, the online service is a pioneer in a new medium, well on its way to building the first mass-market brand name in cyberspace. To its detractors, America Online is simply an aggressive marketer with mounting losses. By Steve Lohr. (With graphic.)  NYNEX-BELLATLANTIC-ASSESS (Undated) _ On the face of it, Bell Atlantic and Nynex seem to be sticking to their pledge that the $23 billion deal would be a merger of equals. On the list of the top 100 executives after the merger, 52 are from Nynex, 48 from Bell Atlantic. But as in any marriage, things were not quite what they seemed. With the companies in the final stages of closing the deal, it is now clear that Bell Atlantic's senior executives will play a dominant role. That was underscored Monday, when Richard Jalkut, the head of Nynex's telecommunications unit, abruptly resigned rather than accept a lesser post at the combined company. By Mark Landler. (With graphics.)  WORK-WELFARE-BIGBIZ (Undated) _ In his State of the Union address last week, President Clinton hailed five giant corporations for their pioneering efforts to put welfare recipients to work. But the limited progress of those companies is evidence of the daunting scope of the project. By Jon Nordheimer. (With photo.)  MUTFUND-CAUTION (Undated) _ Mutual fund investors demonstrated their lingering enthusiasm for stocks by pouring an estimated $24 billion into equity funds last month, the fourth-largest total on record, a mutual fund trade group reported Wednesday. But as investors began to put to work the flood of cash that annually flows into retirement savings accounts in January, they appeared to take a slightly more cautious stance, putting more than half of the new dollars into money market funds, generally the safest type of mutual fund. By Edward Wyatt.  DOLLAR-VALUATION (Undated) _ Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and his allies in the Group of Seven industrial nations are attempting to rein in the dollar, which has jumped 14 percent against the German mark and 16 percent against the Japanese yen in the last year. But in the statement they issued in Berlin backing this goal, they included one sentence that may have inadvertently given currency traders a reason to push the dollar even higher. The key words are these: ``We reaffirmed our views that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals.'' By Jonathan Fuerbringer.  MARKET (New York) _ Stock prices soared to record levels Wednesday, as investors pushed the market up yet another notch on the renewed strength of industrial and technology issues. By David Barboza.  STYLE  (Moved in `l' category)  AFRICA-TERMITES-DESIGN (Harare, Zimbabwe) _ Africa owes its termite mounds a lot. Prospectors mine them, looking for specks of gold carried up from hundreds of feet below. Africans building mud huts love them, because the grainy soil inside is just the right consistency for hard-packed floors. And of course, to aardvarks and other insectivores they are giant helpings of baked alaska. Now, Africa is paying an offbeat tribute to these ugly towers of bug-holed mud. Harare's newest office complex is said to be the only one in the world to use the same cooling and heating principles as the termite mound. By Donald G. McNeil Jr. (With graphic and photo.)  TOY-FAIR (New York) _ Toy Fair, always in February, is the starting gun for the Christmas buying frenzy. Since Monday, manufacturers have been welcoming retailers into their showrooms scattered around Manhattan's Flatiron district, and what these buyers choose will be hitting the stores by the fall. But it is really a gigantic casino where retailers place their bets on the playthings that, in their judgment, children will declare they must find under the tree. By Carol Lawson. (With photo.)  DIAZ-AZCUY-DESIGN (New York) _ No one ever accused Orlando Diaz-Azcuy of having swatches on the brain. He is that rarity, a designer with a sense of mission: to endow minimalism with a sense of history's riches. By Julie V. Iovine. (With photo.)  CULTURE  (Moved in `e' category)  HAITI-CARNIVAL (Port-au-Prince, Haiti) _ The Carnival in Haiti, which ended Tuesday, was powered by the sort of thrill that comes when large masses of people gather to dance and enjoy themselves; the streets of Port-au-Prince were heavy with the sweet humidity of music and sensuality. By Peter Watrous. (With photo.)  DR.-SEUSS-MERCHANDIZING (Undated) _ Yes, the empire of Dr. Seuss, the fabled writer of children's books that have sold over 100 million copies worldwide, a man who hated all forms of commercial exploitation of his work, is finally being franchised. By Dinitia Smith. (With photo.)  HUEY-NEWTON-THEATER-REVIEW (New York) _ Huey P. Newton may have had the heart of a Black Panther, but he didn't have the growl to match. By Peter Marks.

In the meantime, former legislative council member Christine Loh is trying to develop the civil society, which does not come naturally to either Hong Kong or the mainland. Her ``Civic Exchange'' helps fledgling groups organize for local causes such as cleaning up Hong Kong's beaches.

"116298"	"he"	"hopes"	" Putin has come under criticism in Russia from military leaders and other conservatives who believe he has given away too much and received nothing in return for his support of US policies. But analyst Hill says Putin is merely playing the weak hand he has been dealt, realizing that Russia's revival requires close relations with the United States and the West. Rather than trying to oppose US policies he knows he cannot stop, Putin has adopted a strategy of accepting things he cannot change, she suggests. In return, Putin earns a place at the table in NATO, in his dealings with the United States, and eventually, he hopes, in the World Trade Organization. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"

"127208"	"it"	"hopes"	" Losing Jevon Kearse to injury has hurt the Tennessee defense more than expected. Of course, the Raiders used special teams to help score 52 points against the Titans last week, but when the Tennessee defense was on the field, it was ripped. The Washington offense will have a new quarterback, either Danny Weurffel or Patrick Ramsey, and, it hopes, new results. Washington has scored seven and 10 points in its last two games, both losses, and should score more against the Titans.

"150009"	"he"	"hopes"	" Now, if he is to keep his business based in Canada, Strempler is going to have to draw a couple of wild cards, and soon. He recently moved 35 percent of his operation to Britain and he is still globe-trotting, seeking opportunities to open more pharmacy warehouses in the Greek isles and other locales. Such is the heat that he refuses to identify places he is scouting, for fear Washington will intervene to stop him from selling drugs imported from the cheapest global suppliers to Americans -- and eventually, he hopes, to Japanese, Germans and others. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"150347"	"he"	"hopes"	" Boasberg said he expects the team he's assembling to not only deliver a world-class museum that should attract national interest, but will also include a wide scope of educational programs targeted to all age groups, and, he hopes, a scholarship program. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"151357"	"he"	"hopes"	" Stage 3 clinical trials, the last step before approval, often involve thousands of patients. The FDA and drug companies want proof a drug will have broad societal benefits. But a drug like Iressa, and many similar drugs in the pharmaceutical pipeline, may not fit into that model. Instead, Haber said that advances in molecular biology soon will allow researchers, early in the clinical trial process, to identify patient subsets that will respond to certain drugs. Then, he hopes, government regulators will find the flexibility to approve drugs that offer considerable benefit to small groups of people. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"

"153017"	"he"	"hopes"	" In his comments both in the program and in conversation, Weiss placed emphasis on his need to scale down the traditional staging to something manageable for a small company like his own -- and, he hopes, others of a similar size. Odette had eight swan girlfriends, not 24 or more. The orchestra of 34 (which played well under Alfred E. Sturgis' baton) was amplified more loudly than a full band twice its size would sound on its own. Jeff A.R. Jones' sets were handsome but painted on two-dimensional flats.

"154985"	"it"	"hopes"	" SCI-SHUTTLE (Cape Canaveral, Fla.) -- Once again, the future of the space shuttle program will be carried on the wings of the Discovery. The shuttle sits on a launching pad at the Kennedy Space Center here, redesigned and re-evaluated from the top of its giant orange fuel tank to the bottom of its engine nozzles. NASA says it believes that this old ship, renewed, will get the shuttle fleet flying safely again after having been grounded for more than two years after the Columbia disaster. Discovery has had this role before, in 1988, two years after the Challenger exploded on launching, resulting in the deaths of its seven-member crew. Now, a modified and upgraded Discovery stands on the same launching pad, 39B. This time, however, the shuttles have only five years to retirement. NASA would like to retire the complicated shuttle system sooner. It is planning a new vehicle to carry astronauts into Earth orbit and, it hopes, later to the moon and beyond. But it still needs the shuttles, which have been flying for 24 years, to complete the International Space Station and fulfill its promises to 15 other nations involved in that $100.billion project.

(NYT46) HUDDERSFIELD, England -- July 17, 2005 -- BRITAIN-BOMBER -- Germaine Lindsay, one of the four men believed to be the London bombers, spent his childhood living in this building in Huddersfield, England as seen in July 2005. When Lindsay, the 19-year-old man suspected of blowing up a subway train at Russell Square, took hold of Islam four years ago, he did so zealously, his friends say.

Mainstream Hollywood, after decades of ignoring the pious, or occasionally defying them, is adjusting to what it perceives to be a rising religiosity in American culture. Producers, directors, studio executives and marketing specialists have been looking to either mollify or entice an audience that made its power felt with last year's Passion of the Christ. That film, along with the empowerment of a Christian conservative bloc after the last presidential election, helped change attitudes and practices in an industry usually known for its secularism.

Indeed, as smoke billowed up from London's Underground on July 7, dozens of promotional posters for the book stared out from the subway walls -- their images of smoke rising from the London skyline suddenly raw and offensive, their tagline, What If?, suddenly ignorant. Cleave, the author of a novel about a fictitious London bombing that was released July 7, goes online to ask what he should do with his book now.

Later this summer, Microsoft plans to introduce a competing service, Virtual Earth, with software that programmers will be able to use in similarly creative ways. So far the uses have been noncommercial. But Yahoo, Google and Microsoft are creating the services with the expectation that they will become a focal point in one of the next significant growth areas in Internet advertising: contextual advertisements tied to specific locations.

"155772"	"he"	"hopes"	" So Szydlowski, who until recently ran a theater in the ultra-fashionable Kazimierz district of Krakow, a few minutes from Nova Huta, has moved back to this place, where he grew up. He has taken over a few spaciously gloomy rooms in a former machine shop to create an experimental theater and, he hopes, to spur something new. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"

His goal is for the city's streets to be scrubbed nearly as clean as its subway trains -- and, he hopes, to stay that way. Success would be just that people can say, 'I remember when,' about the streets, like they do now with the subways, he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"156732"	"he"	"hopes"	" Much has been made of Barber's off-season workout program, which has made him stronger and, he hopes, more durable. But he also considers himself to be a smarter player. He has lost a step, but he can anticipate better. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"158768"	"he"	"hopes"	" The exhibition of I Remember Birmingham at the Museum of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg has special resonance now because Scott left New Orleans along with thousands of others as Hurricane Katrina approached. He left behind several hundred works of art that had recently been returned from the museum. He is living temporarily with one of daughters in Houston. In a telephone interview, he said his studio has been under 3 feet of water but he feels fortunate because it's a two-story, so the paintings and drawings on the second floor, he hopes, are all right. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"

"164826"	"he"	"hopes"	" Kuchar says he will be back in his element this week. He's bringing his wide, toothy grin and, he hopes, his A-game to the TPC at Sugarloaf in Duluth, Ga., for the BellSouth Classic. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"166702"	"he"	"hopes"	" The Pistons, if nothing else, will shove back with Ben Wallace, many times the league's Defensive Player of the Year. Being leaned on doesn't bother Shaq a bit.

"167139"	"he"	"hopes"	" And what about Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Republican governor that Angelides or Westly will face in November? A clue to his attitude is found in a brief bulletin to reporters from his office Monday: Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger will have no planned public events on Tuesday, May 30. He will hold private meetings in Sacramento. In other words, the governor is very content to keep a low profile while his two challengers beat up on each other and, he hopes, alienate the independents, who are roughly a fifth of the electorate and will be decisive in any close November election. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"

"171474"	"he"	"hopes"	" Now that persuasion has failed, Frieden wants to force the restaurant cooks in New York to follow his recipe -- and soon, he hopes, the rest of America will have to go along too. He justifies his fiat by comparing it to New York City's pioneering ban of lead paint a few decades ago. But the analogy just shows that his understanding of epidemiology and public-health policy isn't much better than his taste in French fries. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171730"	"it"	"hopes"	" It's not often that a Monet plays second fiddle to a Cabanel, or that a Rubens is sequestered in a back gallery while a Leighton commands center stage. In the hierarchy of display space in a museum, the big names are hung in the big galleries and the paintings that are considered pivotal are put in prime positions, so that what a guest sees has been edited to show the museum's breadth and depth. Its collections are refined, it hopes, to a consistent caliber of works and artists. This is not always the case, though, with personal collections, where the buyer acquires art according to his or her own tastes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"

"172275"	"she"	"hopes"	" Starbucks is all about community and inspiration, and everything in that movie seemed aligned with that -- it has that human connection, Denson said. It doesn't have to be a family film, but it does have to be socially relevant. As for the books she's selecting -- they won't all be by name brands like Albom -- she says she wants books that provide almost an education without being preachy. Yes, they should be inspiring, but also, she hopes, challenging: not racy or dark, but thought-provoking. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"

Frank Bascombe, the central character of Richard Ford's unforgettable The Sportswriter and the less unforgettable Independence Day, is now 55 years old. He's still selling real estate in New Jersey, but he is also lugging around 60 implanted radioactive iodine seeds that are, he hopes, bombarding his cancerous prostate into remission. He hasn't seen his wife in six months; his partner in real estate is a Tibetan Buddhist Republican; and someone has blown up the hospital where he likes to eat lunch. He looks about him and sees a world he no longer recognizes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173531"	"he"	"hopes"	" Christoph Westphal, Sirtris' chief executive, replied to this objection with a question: Is it too good to be true that when you are young you get no disease? He believes that activation of the sirtuins is what keeps the body healthy in youth, but that these enzymes become less powerful with age, exposing the body to degenerative disease. This is the process that is reversed by resveratrol and, he hopes, by the more powerful sirtuin activator drugs that his company has developed, though many years of clinical trials will be needed to prove they work and are safe. The developing buzz over sirtuin activators has infected scientists who do research on the aging process, several of whom are already taking resveratrol. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
