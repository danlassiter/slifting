Times News Service  KEMP MINES ANTI-WASHINGTON SENTIMENT IN MONTANA VISIT  BONNER, Mont. (NYT) _ Playing to both the political and economic importance of small business owners, Jack Kemp said today that entrepreneurs were the victims of a ``war on the rights of property owners'' by a ``liberal establishment in Washington,'' and that the Republican plan to slash taxes and regulation would help them generate more jobs.  Stumping across Montana, Kemp, the Republican vice presidential nominee, also mined the anti-Washington sentiment of many voters in the rural West, pledging to an enthusiastic audience here that ``your farms, your jobs, your families, your educations will not be run'' by federal bureaucrats.  In a state where mining and logging are important industries, Kemp told workers at a lumber mill here that a Dole Administration would be more sensitive to the tradeoff between jobs and environmental issues than the Clinton administration.  HOUSEHOLD INCOME UP IN '95 FOR FIRST TIME IN SIX YEARS  WASHINGTON (NYT) _ Household income rose in 1995 for the first time in six years, the Census Bureau reported Thursday, as the number of poor people in the United States dropped by more than 1.6 million, reaching historic lows for blacks and the elderly.  The bureau said half the households in the country had incomes of at least $34,074, an increase of 2.7 percent over the previous year. The inflation-adjusted increase of $898, was the first rise in median household income since 1989, the year before the country plunged into its last recession, and it was the largest jump in household earnings since 1986.  At the same time, the percentage of poor people dropped to 13.8 per cent of the population, from 14.5 per cent in 1994, second straight year of a decline in the poverty rate.  CLINTON CALLS ON ISRAELIS, PALESTINIANS TO END VIOLENCE  WASHINGTON (NYT) _ President Clinton called on the Israelis and Palestinians Thursday to end the escalating violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and to ''avoid unnecessarily provocative actions'' that could further undermine the faltering quest for a Middle East peace.  Clinton spoke on the South Lawn of the White House as American diplomats searched for a way to rescue the peace process in which Clinton has invested so much personal prestige. With the death toll now over 40, the two days of clashes in the Arab territories represented the worst violence since the Israeli-Palestinian peace was negotiated three years ago and sealed in a historic handshake on the White House lawn.  Clinton stopped short of condemning the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for opening a new entrance to an archeological tunnel that runs along the western retaining wall of the Temple Mount, a plateau sacred to Muslims for its Al Aksa Mosque and to Jews as the site of Herod's Temple. The action triggered a violent response by Palestinians.  CLINTON SIGNS BILL INSURING 48-STAY FOR MOTHERS AND NEWBORNS  WASHINGTON (NYT) _ President Clinton began Thursday by signing a bill to insure 48-hour hospital stays for mothers and newborns, and ended it by raising $3 million to help Democratic Senate campaigns around the country. In between, he went to Capitol Hill for a love-fest pep-talk with Democratic members of Congress with whom he has not always seen eye-to-eye.  It was yet another in the steady string of untroubled days that have become commonplace for a president who once seemed to attract trouble routinely.  ``Before he got in the room, the mood was excellent, and it was better when he left,'' Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly of Connecticut said in summing up Mr. Clinton's private midday visit with members of the House and Senate Democratic caucuses in the Longworth House Office Building.  ``It was electric,'' said Rep. Charles E. Schumer of New York, who is not usually so charged. ``The scent of victory in the air brings instant unity, good will and good feeling.''  SCIENTISTS STUNNED BY EVIDENCE OF AIDS IMMUNITY  Scientists have long suspected that some people might be immune to the AIDS virus. But now they are accumulating powerful, direct evidence of the extent and strength of such immunity. And many are stunned.  The most recent study, published Friday in the journal Science, provides the most detailed and convincing evidence yet that 1 in 100 whites have complete immunity to infection by the AIDS virus and 1 in 5 whites have inherited a resistance to the progress of AIDS once infected with the virus. Almost no blacks have the particular protective mutation investigated in this study, but scientists say other forms of genetic immunity almost certainly exist in both blacks and whites.  The findings raise numerous questions and offer remarkable opportunities for research, scientists say. Among the puzzles are why some ethnic groups have such a mutation and others do not, how and when this mutation arose, and what other genetic variants exist that protect against AIDS.  LUDID LEAVES ATLANTIS, WITH A LITTLE HELP  CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Shannon W. Lucid walked out of the space shuttle Atlantis Thursday propped up by helpers but ``on her own power'' after feeling the pull of gravity for the first time in more than six months, NASA officials said.  The shuttle touched down under scattered clouds at the Kennedy Space Center here at 8:13 a.m. after a 10-day mission to exchange cargo with the Russian space station Mir and retrieve Dr. Lucid, 53, a biochemist whose 188 days in space broke a record for an American astronaut and for a woman. In her place the Atlantis left behind another American, John E. Blaha, 54, to begin a four-month tour aboard Mir.  In a taped appearance from the astronaut quarters, Dr. Lucid looked relaxed and cheerful as she sat on a reclining chair with legs crossed, laughing and showing the good nature that kept her smiling even after her return was delayed by hurricanes and shuttle problems back on Earth. Surrounded by her husband, Michael, two daughters, a son and a son-in-law, all of whom flew in from Texas to welcome her, she joked,  ``Look like we're altogether and that you're happy that I'm home.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960926.0616 type=story > <HEADLINE> COX RADIO SELLS SHARES TO HELP FUND ACQUISITIONS: IPO FOCUS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> New York, Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) (BC-COX-RADIO-IPO-FOCUS-BLOOM) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"

"152329"	"he"	"joked"	" CHAMELEON-COMPOSER (Undated) -- James Tenney is the Zelig of American composition. He's been there for a lot of the big moments. He's known most of the big names. He's been, so to speak, in all the pictures. Yet few people have even heard of him. This week, two concerts -- Sunday night and Wednesday -- are chipping away at the block of ignorance. Tenney's work of the past five decades includes a tape collage piece made up of tiny fragments of an Elvis Presley recording of Blue Suede Shoes. It includes Postal Pieces, written as graphic scores that fit on the backs of postcards. And lest you think Tenney is simply a proponent of the avant-garde, it includes piano rags. Tonal rags. Tenney resists characterization. You can't define what kind of musician he is. He is called a pioneer of computer music, having created some of the earliest computer pieces during a tenure as resident composer at Bell Laboratories in the early 1960s. At the same time, he is grouped with the Minimalists, having hobnobbed and performed with Steve Reich and Philip Glass during the same period. Most of the things Tenney is known for aren't supposed to be able to be done in the same room, let alone by the same person. Of his desire to reconcile opposing forces, he joked, It's a personal characteristic that derives from the fact that my parents fought all the time and I was always trying to bring them together.

As hands rose across the courtroom, he joked, About half, causing jurors to erupt in laughter. During his presentation, which stretched almost three hours, Lanier generally called jurors by their names and often allowed them to speak at length. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"

Then he made a production of trading the Motown duds for a tailored suit jacket, a concession, he joked, to German formality. The Dieter Show, it appears, will go on. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"

"167243"	"he"	"joked"	" He had a rapport with stars. When Stewart was approached by strangers, he joked, No, I am Slim Aarons. It is likely that Aarons was the model for Stewart's part as the fascinated watcher in Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, and his apartment surely inspired the one in the film. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"

Asked how much rent the show pays, he joked, Not enough. As he lunched on fish later at the studio commissary, he perked up when Ron Meyer, the president of Universal Studios, brought over an energetic Tom Cruise from the next booth for a brief schmooze. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
