CUBA-U.S.-CANOSA (Miami) _ In any debate about American policy toward Cuba, a major figure is likely to be Jorge Mas Canosa, considered by many to be the principal architect of that policy. Arguably the most influential of the nation's 1.5 million Cuban-Americans, he has, through three administrations, found an open door at the White House and on Capitol Hill. Larry Rohter.  CUBA-U.S.-POLICY (Washington) _ Details of the U.S. policy shift on Cuba and how it came about. Steven Greenhouse.  ISRAEL-U.S. (Jerusalem) _ Israeli officials are concerned about the impact on the peace process of Republican moves in Washington to force the American Embassy in Israel to move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Clyde Haberman.  CHINA-POLITICS (Beijing) _ Many high-level officials have fallen victim to President Jiang's recent crackdown on corruption as he uses the issue of graft against his rivals. The entire city government of Beijing is effectively under arrest. Patrick E. Tyler.  PHILIPPINES-VOTE (Manila) _ When voters across the Philippines go to the polls on Monday, they will face a ballot that resembles both a social register and a rogues gallery, a reminder of how name recognition can mean much more than anything else in this country's messy democracy. Philip Shenon.  YUGOSLAVIA-CROATIA (Zagreb) _ Developments in Croatia, where Croatian troops have been moving in on the Serbs. Roger Cohen.  CHILE-LETELIER (Santiago, Chile) _ Since appeals were concluded three months ago for two military officers convicted of ordering the assassination of a Chilean opposition leader in Washington in 1976, tension has been rising here as both sides in the case have accused the other of trying to influence the Supreme Court in its decision.

Kenneth B. Noble.  ORLEANS-KILLINGS (New Orleans) _ In a city that has become deaf to gunshots and inured to murder, where no fewer than 21 people died violently in a single week between Feb. 25 and March 4, it was three recent killings in a modest Vietnamese restaurant that made New Orleans weep. A brother and sister, one planning to be a priest, one hoping to be a nun, died on their knees in prayer. A few feet away, a young off-duty police officer, father of a week-old son, was also killed, shot through the body, then in the head at close range, just to make sure. Rick Bragg.  PHD-FUGITIVE (Hollywood, Fla.) _ By most accounts, Kathryn A. Reiter is an intelligent and caring woman with the credentials to match that perception _ a Ph.D. in education, a former town council member, a foster mother. But last month, she added fugitive to that list when she absconded with her foster daughter after losing custody to the girl's family. Mireya Navarro.  CALIF-TAX (Newport, Calif.) _ Here in Orange County, the capital of anti-tax fervor, business and government leaders alike are facing the grim reality that a sales tax hike may be unavoidable. But even with a $1.7-billion deficit looming, there are those who argue that a tax hike would only exacerbate the problem. Seth Mydans.  TOXIC-CARS (Undated) _ Electric cars are all the rage with environmentalists; but the fact is that, given the current level of technology, they will result in a lot more lead pollution from the disposal of the batteries that they use. Peter Passell.  WASHINGTON  (Coded w)  BUDGET-POLITICS (Washington) _ Next week, the budget committees in both the House and Senate are to lay their budget cards on the table. Michael Wines.

VIDEO-GAMES-MULTIMEDIA (Undated) _ For all their success in movies, music, and publishing, the world's top media companies have been a flop in multimedia _that vast but inchoate market for video games, CD-ROMs, on-line services, and interactive cable channels. Of the 20 top-selling PC games now in stores, only one comes from a media company: ``Star Trek Training Tech Manual'' from Viacom. Of the 15 top-selling cartridge games, not one comes from the world of Big Media. Mark Landler.  VIDEO-GAME-PLAYERS (Undated) _ For video game aficionados, the gore of ``Moral Kombat'' or ``Eternal Champions'' is a diversion. For the five companies squaring off against each other in the fight over the market for the next generation of video game players, there is nothing diverting about the coming confrontation. The challenge is to achieve dominance in the $4-billion video game market by introducing better, faster machines with 32-bit microprocessors that can deliver striking three-dimensional graphics and quicker and more intricate action than the current 16-bit machines. Lawrence M. Fisher.  HAMPERS-GRACE (Undated) _ A look at Constantine L. Hampers, the man who chased out J.P. Bolduc from W.R.

GERMANY-DOLLAR (Frankfurt) _ The head of Germany's central bank, Hans Tietmeyer, in his most pointed remarks to date on the prospect of the beleaguered dollar rising against the Japanese yen and German mark, said it would not occur until President Clinton and the U.S. Congress took steps to reverse America's declining savings rate and reduce the country's budget deficit. Nathaniel C. Nash.  EAST-COAST-SHUTTLE (Undated) _ A look at the reasons for the East Coast shuttle's enduring success. Edwin McDowell.  EXEC-COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ Electonic `clipping services' can now cull cyberspace and fetch data for you. These services are customized electronic news services _ a new breed of information retrieval systems that scan on-line news sources and publications looking for information relevant to you. (The Executive Computer column.) Laurie Flynn.  CD-ROM-MAG (Undated) _ Word that Launch magazine is about the hit the streets later this week isn't likely to cause any sleepless nights at Time Warner or Conde Nast. Its start-up financing _ $150,000 from family and friends, and $1 million in venture capital _ amounts to little more than ``a rounding error'' in the budgets of big magazine publishers, jokes David Goldberg, co-founder of Launch. Yet in the infant industry of CD-ROM magazines, Launch is both the latest and the most ambitious entry to date. Aimed at the computer-literate 18-to-34-year-old market, it aspires to be the Entertainment Weekly of the magazine-on-a-disk business by offering a look at new music, movies, and computer games. Steve Lohr.  LAPTOP-BATTERIES (Undated) _ A look at zinc-air batteries for laptops. Matthew Wald.  MARKETPLACE _ Details TK.  CREDIT-RATES (Undated) _ Key interest rate numbers.

MEDIA-BUSINESS  (Coding varies.)  FCC-MURDOCH-MEDIA (Undated) _ A look at the implications of the FCC-Murdoch ruling: what, for instance, does it mean, long term, for the possibility of foreign ownership of TV networks? And can anyone really challenge Murdoch with his politcal clout? Bill Carter.  GQ-MAG-MEDIA (Undated) _ A look at GQ, a magazine that has succeeded by a mixture of fairly good journalism and the world of mens' fashion; somewhat in the manner of the old Esquire of 30 years ago. Deirdre Carmody.  TV-SOAPS-MEDIA (Undated) _ Where have all the soap opera ratings gone? Down. Why? There's a glut on the market. Kristen Baldwin.  TV-FOX-MEDIA (Undated) _ The Fox Children's Television Network is taking a risk next fall. On the surface it sounds safe to buy a new live-action show based on the most popular children's book series in many years, the ``Goosebumps'' series of amusing mysteries by R.L. Stine. But bumping ``Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' to broadcast it?

"29700"	"he"	"has"	" ``I always say, to be a good receiver, you need to be a good basketball player,'' Plumb said. ``A lot of those skills transfer over.

"57723"	"he"	"has"	" The 24-year-old actor and model was born in Rome. His family moved to New York when he was 12. As a teen-ager, he used to walk around Times Square and imagine himself up there on a billboard. In fact, his billboard perfectly captures the dreamy expression of adolescent yearning.

"78586"	"it"	"has"	" Robert Kuttner opens his essay in The American Prospect by asking: ``Has the Clinton presidency been a grave setback for liberalism?'' Kuttner concludes that yes, it has, largely due to Clinton's focus on balancing the budget, which has set fiscal limits on liberal policy initiatives, and partly due to the Dick Morris-inspired stance of ``triangulation,'' under which Clinton has moved right to maintain an equal distance from the Democratic and Republican parties. ``Every time Clinton validated a conservative theme, it made his own party seem a fringe, and made it harder for Democrats to champion liberal positions,'' Kuttner notes. He offers some sound advice to liberals: Stop relying on the power of the White House and look to the grass-roots for an infusion of energy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"

Keith Bradsher. a. 9 p.m.  BOTTOM:  SUNBELT-CITY (Jacksonville, Fla.) _ There may be no greater testament to the economic, cultural, and political ascension of the modern South than the elevation of its second-tier cities _ Charlotte, Nashville, Jacksonville, and Orlando _ into the major leagues. With the advance of the Jaguars and their two-year-old counterparts, the Charlotte Panthers, to this Sunday's conference championship games, football is being embraced and promoted by those upstart towns as a metaphor for civic momentum. Kevin Sack. a. 9 p.m.  FRANCE-NONSMOKER (Paris) _ Jean-Luc Michel is a clean-cut guy, a former air force flight controller who is married, has two children, and is crazy about planes. He talks straight, in a booming baritone, and keeps his own counsel. But when cigarette smoke wafts his way, he has, in his own words, ``a tendency to go thermonuclear.'' Michel, who worked in a room full of smokers, was recently fired when he opened a window to get some fresh air. i. 9 p.m.  INSIDE STORIES PROMOTED ON PAGE 1:  YUGO-CONSPIRACIES (Belgrade) _ Serbia is saturated with bizarre conspiracy theories, purported international plots, prejudices, and fantasies that swirl in dizzying complexity through the heads of Serbs, Croats, and Muslims. The communist ideology that gripped the former Yugoslavia for five decades, along with the ethnic orientation of the nationalist governments that rule Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia, has poisoned the political debate. Diatribes against foreign powers, secret organizations, and rival ethnic groups plotting everyone's demise are the stock of most public speeches. Chris Hedges. i. 9 p.m.  MORRIS-CLINTON (Washington) _ Six weeks after his forced resignation as Clinton's chief political strategist, and a month before last fall's election, Dick Morris telephoned the White House, saying he was ``in a bad way'' and requesting a personal conversation with the president, Morris recounts in his forthcoming memoir. Clinton called back the next day, Morris writes, and when the disgraced consultant told the president that he ``desperately wanted'' their relationship to continue, despite Morris's departure over a tabloid's exposure of his long-running relationship with a prostitute, Clinton replied: ``It will.'' That exchange is among the highlights of Morris's sprawling 350-page narrative of his nearly 20 years as an adviser to Clinton. Todd S. Purdum. w. 9 p.m.  JAPAN-STOCKS (Tokyo) _ Seven years ago, when Japan's main stock market index hit 40,000, many people expected it would continue to soar. On Friday, after a week in which stocks tumbled by more than 10 percent, the index touched 17,200 in afternoon trading, and many people fear it will continue to sink. There is no more reason to think they are more right this time than they were seven years ago, but the revolution in attitudes underscores the profound malaise in which Japan finds itself and the enormous economic challenges the country faces.

TV-PERKINS-COLUMN  PASADENA, Calif. _ Rick Reynolds, the Richard Lewis-like comedian, sits before TV critics at a CBS news conference and is crisply attired in the standard-issue Reynolds uniform: suit, no tie, a grimace of concern, confusion, and hyper-neuroticism plastered across his face. In his world, we're all empty shells of despondence and despair. Our lives are miserable and shallow. We just don't know it ... or we simply won't acknowledge it. Either way, we're doomed. Reynolds, standup comedian, philosopher, long time therapy patient, is here to publicize ``Life ... And Stuff,'' a new adult situation-comedy that explores the emotional dichotomy of life.

BUSINESS DAY  (Moved in `f' category)  VOLKSWAGEN-GM (Russelsheim, Germany) _ Just one year ago, General Motors' case against Volkswagen appeared to be bogged down in a German legal quagmire.

"83747"	"he"	"has"	" FRANCE-NONSMOKER (Paris) _ Jean-Luc Michel is a clean-cut guy, a former air force flight controller who is married, has two children, and is crazy about planes. He talks straight, in a booming baritone, and keeps his own counsel. But when cigarette smoke wafts his way, he has, in his own words, ``a tendency to go thermonuclear.'' Michel, who worked in a room full of smokers, was recently fired when he opened a window to get some fresh air. By Roger Cohen. WITH PHOTO (NYT16) of Michel. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19970111.0046 type=story > <HEADLINE> FRANCE FUMES OVER BAN ON SMOKING </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> PARIS (BC-R-FRANCE-NONSMOKER-ART-2TAKES-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"85071"	"he"	"has"	" In the playoffs, he has, under terrible conditions, grabbed six more passes for 69 yards and one touchdown, a biggie against Carolina in the NFC Championship game. He also was in the proverbial right place at the right time to recover an Edgar Bennett fumble in the end zone in the NFC semifinal victory over the 49ers. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"87196"	"he"	"has"	" Ultimately, even after Garcia was gone, Ruelas was able to cope and move on with his career. However, he has, indeed, never been the same. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"93941"	"she"	"has"	" Yeah, she has, earning an Oscar nomination for best actress for ``What's Love Got to Do With It'' and landing plum roles in big-studio films. So why would she take a salary cut to weather the heat and eventual boredom of this resort town? (``I've already seen just about everything there is to see here,'' Bassett admits, only 10 days into her three weeks on the job.) But more on her decision later. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"96771"	"he"	"has"	" He certainly has turnaround credentials. He was the Chrysler Corp.'s vice president for finance in 1979 and is widely credited with negotiating the complex financial agreements that kept Chrysler solvent. Since then, he has, with varying degrees of success, worked on salvaging such disparate companies as Waste Management, Aetna and Federal Mogul Corp., where he remains nonexecutive chairman until the end of the year. ``I'm listed in the Yellow Pages under `Flaming Disasters,''' he said with a laugh. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"
"97002"	"she"	"has"	" Certainly that has been the rap on Burton. In addition to her Broadway work, which includes the musical ``Doonesbury,'' she has also appeared in movies, among them ``The Ice Storm'' and ``August,'' an adaptation of Chekhov's ``Uncle Vanya'' set in Wales. She won an Emmy Award for ``Notes for My Daughter,'' a 1995 after-school special about breast cancer. Yet she never generated much electricity. Even now that she has the great part that eluded her, she has, by most accounts, made her very ordinariness work in a role that is often painted in bold, even lurid colors. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"
"99218"	"he"	"has"	" As he did in his tour de force twins, ``House'' and ``Garden,'' which are performed simultaneously with the same cast and characters, he has, in effect, had his hands tied behind his back and still managed to sew together a plot that works. The handicap here is that he was working with borrowed characters. The price he pays is that the old Wodehouse standbys he appropriates, archetypal variants even in their original forms, must all be reduced to a level of absolute stupidity on the stage or the plot pyrotechnics couldn't survive. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"102891"	"he"	"has"	" Whether or not his ambitious plans to rapidly disarm the region's private armies prove realistic, he has, under the banner of the newly appointed national leader, Hamid Karzai, gained an enthusiastic following. The new rulers here have moved with impressive speed to restore normality, albeit a peace still backed by truckloads of gunmen allied with Shirzai. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"102899"	"he"	"has"	" Whether or not his ambitious plans to rapidly disarm the region's private armies prove realistic, he has, under the banner of the newly appointed national leader, Hamid Karzai, gained an enthusiastic following. The new rulers here have moved with impressive speed to restore normality, albeit a peace still backed by truckloads of gunmen allied with Shirzai. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"113033"	"he"	"has"	" In fairness to Sprewell, he has, for the most part, played hard, hurt and undersized at small forward. He would be better off away from Houston, whose contract is probably unmovable. This is where the Knicks must begin what could be a climb, however modest, back to the Eastern Conference playoffs, by using Sprewell, their most tradable commodity, to obtain a veteran leader, a unifying presence to walk the walk, and make it on time. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"113281"	"it"	"has"	" But some of Lagos' supporters, particularly feminists and socialists, think it is the church that has damaged Chilean society and should apologize. Though Chile has the most open and unregulated economy in Latin America, it has, at the behest of the church, recoiled from social legislation that is routine everywhere else in Latin America, the world's most heavily Roman Catholic region. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"116085"	"he"	"has"	" Yes, he has, but Paul's one to keep such thoughts to himself. His life gets a kick-start, though, when Enzo fires ``Dragonfly's'' auteur director (Gerard Depardieu, spot-on in his humorlessness). The hack replacement (``Rushmore's'' Jason Schwartzman, perfectly absurd) goes down, too, leaving Paul to right the ship and come up with an ending that has some oomph. As he worries over what to do, Paul begins fantasizing about the film's leading lady (supermodel/first-time actress Angela Lindvall), his dreams taking on the surreal quality of the cheesy movie he's supposed to fix. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"119614"	"he"	"has"	" ``I don't see how you can keep him off the All-Star team,'' Dodgers manager Jim Tracy said. ``To me, he has, in absence of Kevin Brown, been the ace of our staff.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"119942"	"it"	"has"	" As for our story, it has, if not a happy ending, at least a happy new beginning: Our daughter Alice was born 11 days ago.

"123947"	"it"	"has"	" In most instances _ like an Austin Powers movie _ this might be taken for humor. In real life, it has, or had, other ramifications. The guy's name was Albrecht Stromeyer and he said he was in love with Serena. He attempted to prove his paean to Cupid by, essentially, scaring the daylights out of her by stalking her on two continents. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"

"131309"	"he"	"has"	" To make it work onstage, he has, in addition to his own ensemble, brought Brazilian group Boca Livre and Celtic piper Eric Rigler. They were all be at the Berklee Performance Center Sunday night. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"132473"	"he"	"has"	" When he took on his post two years ago, Bronstein was no stranger to the area. A staple of the gossip columns since his 1998 marriage to the actress Sharon Stone, he has, in the past, offered to hunt stray alligators plaguing the city. More recently, he has discarded his cowboy boots and gone barefoot into the cage of a Komodo dragon, which promptly attacked his big toe. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"

"133527"	"he"	"has"	" Further, while Gore has never been much of a traditional political player, he has, by every account, not made the kind of preparatory telephone calls a candidate for president might typically place in anticipation of an announcement. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"134761"	"it"	"has"	" And because the city treats the program as an emergency effort, it has, over the years, lightly examined the qualifications of the landlords and agents with whom it has contracted to house the families. As a result, some of the buildings in the program have been repeatedly cited for rat infestations and peeling paint. One complex of buildings, where the city houses 262 families, had so many violations that the courts placed it in receivership. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"137665"	"it"	"has"	" Not surprisingly, the system not only has infuriated umpires, it has, according to Schilling, intimidated them into unnatural strike-zone acts. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200305.gz"
"137716"	"it"	"has"	" But, while Robin Hood may not have flung open the door to the wider world for every Laredo student, it has, at least, let some, like De La Fuente, pass through. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200306.gz"
"139424"	"it"	"has"	" We have tried to bring or entire family closer together. In some ways, it has, he said. A couple of us are having a tough time dealing with it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"140768"	"he"	"has"	" Khan was arrested on July 13 in Lahore, and has cooperated with investigators enough for them to paint the broad outlines of his life. Initially portrayed as a facilitator of communications for al-Qaida who posted messages by e-mail and on Web sites, he has, in recent days, been upgraded in some news reports to a mastermind who was possibly helping to plan attacks abroad. These reports have said his computer yielded information including graphics of the designs of important buildings and computer calculations of the impact of explosions. None of this has been confirmed by senior Pakistan officials. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"147745"	"it"	"has"	" While the Bush administration favors such a cap, it has, to its credit, sponsored research on preventing medical injuries as well. That is the best approach to reducing malpractice payments and doctors' insurance premiums. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"149552"	"it"	"has"	" ART REVIEW: THE CARS AREN'T EXPLODING, BUT THE TERRORIST METAPHOR IS Cai Guo-Qiang: Inopportune remains at Mass MoCA, 1040 Mass MoCa Way, North Adams, Mass., (413)664-4481, through October. NORTH ADAMS, Mass. -- Not every museum has space the size of a football field to allot to a one-person show. But at Mass MoCA, the rambling factory-turned-art center here, Building 5 is where an artist can get carried away. With its several rooms, including a main gallery 300 feet long, 55 feet wide and 28 feet high, it has, like a big movie soundstage, a voracious appetite for spectaculars. And the museum's staff seeks them out, sometimes commissioning works especially for the space, at other times taking shows already put together. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"
"154071"	"it"	"has"	" Perhaps matters will turn quickly again, since they go to San Diego for a return to interleague play, where the Mariners are 9-6 this season. But at the moment, it has, as Boone said, come to this -- after a home shutout loss to a rival's most lightly regarded starter, after scoring nine runs in four games, the Mariners are a half-game out of the cellar of a four-team division in late June, searching a sac bunt for solace. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20050624.0020 type=story > <HEADLINE> TRACK MEET OPENS ON SAD NOTE; ACUFF WINS HIGH JUMP </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> CARSON, Calif. </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"154323"	"he"	"has"	" To President Bush, in fond moments, he is Pootie-Poot. To Peter Baker and Susan Glasser, the authors of Kremlin Rising, Vladimir V. Putin, Russia's president, is a KGB colonel in a modern suit, a reactionary in his instincts and coldly realistic in his assessment of what the Russian people want and will tolerate. Since taking office on Dec. 31, 1999, the authors write, he has, in the name of managed democracy, returned supreme power to the Kremlin, smothered regional autonomy, marginalized the democratic opposition, turned television into a propaganda tool and defanged the billionaire oligarchs who run Russia's largest companies. In March 2004, he won re-election with just over 71 percent of the vote. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"156853"	"he"	"has"	" Since becoming pope, he has, however, made interreligious dialogue a cornerstone of his papacy and has been clear to say that he does not believe that terrorist attacks were specifically anti-Christian, as was stated in a leaked early version of a Vatican press release condemning the London bombings. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"159419"	"he"	"has"	" A Grammy Award winner for iconic comedy albums like FM &amp; AM and Class Clown (both 1972), he has, in recent years, become a best-selling author of books that expand on his comedy routines, including When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?, published by Hyperion last year. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"163575"	"it"	"has"	" While that rhetoric has left Iran more isolated from the West, it has, increasingly found some degree of unity and support in the region. The outrage over the caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, which set off more than a month of demonstrations, helped unite Muslims against a common, perceived enemy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"165356"	"he"	"has"	" There are those who think he has been inconsistent, and yes, he has, said Berg, a longtime Brown watcher. I think the biggest thing about Jerry Brown is he makes some people really mad because of his personality, and for a lot of other people, that's something that appeals to them. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"169574"	"he"	"has"	" So even while he still needles and shouts at his employees privately, he has, over the past three years, made a nearly total retreat from his pugnacious, aggressive and sometimes comic public persona. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
