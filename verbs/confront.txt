Free labor -- c'mon, man, can't get a better deal than that. In actuality, you have to ask: Could Jefferson ever have tried to abolish slavery and been president? No. He couldn't have made it. But by putting Jefferson in France, where slavery is illegal, and by bringing Sally Hemings in, we confront, directly, his heart with the issue of slavery.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"
