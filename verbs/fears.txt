"34239"	"he"	"fears"	" No one knows for sure how far the infestation will ultimately spread. ``I think we can only speculate,'' said Johnson, ``but you probably have to start out with the reasonable assumption that sooner or later it's going to spread downstream'' through the entire Missouri River watershed of which the Madison is a part.

"91673"	"he"	"fears"	" Kepesh returns in Roth's cursory new novel, ``The Dying Animal,'' but while he returns in human form, as a semi-retired teacher and part-time television commentator, he remains as unmoored as ever. Like so many Rothian heroes before him, he finds that his defiance of convention, his refusal to grow up, his unaccommodated pursuit of sex and self-fulfillment have left him floating alone, unbound from family and lasting emotional attachments and perhaps, he fears, secretly longing ``not to be free'' as he approaches his 70th year. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"

"109884"	"he"	"fears"	" To help remedy this lack, Kass refers in his writings to the soul, a word he uses in a nontheological sense to mean that a living organism, even a bacterium, is not just a collection of molecules but a thing with needs, awareness, desires and goal-directed activities. Because the technologists of biomedicine take so narrow a view of their subject matter, they propose remedies that will ultimately violate human nature, he fears, however attractive they may seem to some in the short term. ``We shouldn't kid ourselves that we might not wind up in a degraded place from a collection of free choices,'' he says. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"

But the most serious threat to the stability of human societies is genetic engineering that might alter, by design or inadvertence, the special balance of contrarieties of human nature.

Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said on Friday she would try to push Bush to go farther.

"171015"	"he"	"fears"	" Bob Hayes, president of the Medicare Rights Center in New York City, said Medicare has succeeded because it included both the rich and the poor.
