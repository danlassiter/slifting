CAMERON-INTERNET (Los Angeles) _ In a live on-line Internet conference, cutting-edge filmmaker James Cameron, creator of ``True Lies'' and the mind-blowing special effects action movie ``Terminator 2,'' talks about his latest work, ``Strange Days,'' starring Ralph Fiennes. By Amy Dawes.  CLUB-KIDS (Los Angeles) _ Teen-agers in fishnet stockings shake and shimmy on platform shoes. Music pulsates. Strobes momentarily illuminate sweaty faces. Peanuts, a Hollywood dance club, is jumping. It's time for the ``club kids'' to arrive. Standing a head above the crowd in 12-inch platforms, they enter wearing outlandish costumes _ part Rocky Horror, part Parisian runway, part Halloween and part drag. Club kids like ``Sugar Free,'' ``Cosmetica'' and ``Atomic Tony,'' don't wait on line. They don't pay a cover or buy their own drinks. But club owners love to have them around. They're part of the show. ``I'm a stylistic individual,'' said Gabriel Panduro, 19, who put on a blue lycra top, gloves, black latex pants and 7-inch Adidas platforms before he left his North Hollywood home for a night out. ``They're pretty hip for our club,'' said owner Micheal Stewart, ``It's kind of like a New York vibe. And that's what we try to project, being a little New York and as hip and different as possible.'' By Jenifer Hanrahan.  TVCOLUMN-RICHMOND (Los Angeles) _ To speak to Janeane Garofalo, you would swear that the woman is trapped in some nightmare of a Hollywood downhill spiral, shaking a tin cup on a streetcorner to subsist and busting down doors pleading for an audition. ``I honestly feel like I've already peaked, I swear,'' Garofalo said. Perhaps somebody ought to tell Garofalo that rather than some struggling has-been, she actually happens to be the busiest comedy actress in Hollywood and at 28 a young up-and-comer on the comedy club circuit. The woman is simply everywhere these days. Consider all that Garofalo has done, or is doing, of late: Starring for the second season as Paula the talent book on HBO's ``The Larry Sanders Show''; working as a correspondent for the satirical summertime Fox magazine series ``TV Nation'' with Michael Moore; hosted and co-produced the stand-up comedy series ``Comedy Product'' presently running on Comedy Central; has her own half-hour HBO comedy special on Sept. 21; has her first co-starring role in a film with the forthcoming ``The Truth About Cats and Dogs,'' playing a lonely veterinarian opposite Uma Thurman; had a part as the blind date from hell in the film ``Bye Bye, Love''; has small roles in three other upcoming films: ``She Followed Me Home'' with Bill Murray, ``Gaslight Edition'' starring Demi Moore and ``Coldblooded'' with Jason Priestley.

By DAN LYNCH c.1995 Albany Times Union  ALBANY, N.Y. _ If you still doubt that the best-intended laws can have unintended consequences, just listen to Patty McArdle:  ``Sometime during the course of the summer,'' she told me the other day, ``my 16-year-old daughter, Megan, purchased a pager without parental consent. ... They allowed her to sign all the appropriate paperwork. She doesn't have a checking account, so she paid them cash.''  It's absolutely outlawed in all the schools. The status symbol is to carry them on your belt or, in some cases, on your pants, which causes them to droop down even further and make them hazardous to walking.  Patty McArdle is a business agent for a union. It didn't occur to her that a high school kid could even need a pager. Her kid would grab the bills before she got home from work. Then, one day, the high school in Troy, N.Y., where Patty McArdle lives, called and asked her to keep her kid's pager out of school.  Patty McArdle was not pleased. She called the pager company.  ``I told them,'' she said, ``that they didn't have the authority to let her sign any agreement. She's a minor. Their response was that they can't discriminate on the basis of age.''  All this was confirmed by Kevin King, who runs the New York state operation for a pager company called Page New York in Albany, just across the Hudson River from Troy. Initially, Page New York wouldn't sell to anybody under 18. Then the lawyers got into the act.  ``It's the belief of our organization's attorney,'' Kevin King told me, ``that not to sell to these people would be a discriminatory practice, much as it would be to deny somebody a pager on the basis of race or religion. So we do sell the product. ... And we do have them sign an agreement. But we realize that the enforcement on our end is virtually nil.''  Here's what this boils down to: A kid not legally able to enter into a contract in any state can buy a pager at any mall store and then sign an agreement that obligates a company to supply that kid service.  But if the kid refuses to pay, the company has to eat the loss. Plus, the kid can do this without parental knowledge _ until the school calls to complain about beepers blasting in biology class. All this in the name of anti-discrimination. Go figure.  Kevin King said his company was even solicited for an ad in the student newspaper at Albany High, where these devices are forbidden. Page New York said no thanks. Who wants to sell anything to somebody who doesn't have to pay you? But he's aware of the bizarre demand for pagers among the ``Clueless'' set.  He told me, ``I had my nephew, who at the time was 17, come in here and want a pager. I said, `Did you talk to your mom?'  `Yeah.'  `She said it's OK? I'm not going to get into any dutch over this?' `No, I swear, Uncle Kevin.'  ``So, I sent him home with a pager, and that night I got an angry call from my sister-in-law tearing me a new body part because their son is walking around with a pager.''  Patty McArdle, once she found out, cancelled her kid's service and confiscated the pager. Shortly thereafter, the pager suffered an unfortunate accident involving a hammer.  Which, if Patty McArdle had her way, is precisely the same fate that would befall the originator of the fuzzy law that creates loony situations like this.  ---  Dan Lynch is a columnist for the Albany Times Union.
