Police Officer Eileen Perez, who responded to a call by the hotel at 5:30 a.m., described the scene she found in Room 1410. ``We opened the door and there was Depp sitting there, smoking a cigarette, cool and calm,'' she said. His girlfriend, the model Kate Moss, was with him, the officer said.   ``There was glass all over the place and furniture upside down and broken table legs,'' she continued.   As he was taken to the 19th Precinct station house, she related, Depp said to another officer, referring to Officer Perez: ``I don't think she likes me. But if she saw me at a mall, I bet she would ask me for an autograph.''   ``No, Johnny,'' Officer Perez responded, ``I don't think so.''   c.1994 N.Y. Times News Service   It was not an official stop on her book tour, but when Patricia Cornwell was summoned to the White House last week to meet an admirer of her fifth novel, ``The Body Farm,'' she could hardly refuse.   The unexpected visit has its roots in a letter that Ms. Cornwell, a prize-winning author of crime novels, had sent to Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, two years ago.   ``I was distressed about budget problems at the FBI Academy,'' Ms. Cornwell said Tuesday, ``so I wrote Senator Hatch an impassioned letter asking for his help. We had lunch, and he spent a day with me at the academy in Quantico, Va. As a result, there is $50 million in the new crime bill for the academy.''   In doing research for her books, which center on a female medical examiner and are steeped in forensic science, Ms. Cornwell has spent a lot of time at the academy.   Enter President Clinton. According to Ms. Cornwell, he noticed that the novel, published by Scribner's, was dedicated ``To Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah for his tireless fight against crime.''   ``The president asked him how that happened and said he wanted to meet me,'' Ms. Cornwell said. ``On Thursday, I was in Washington on the book tour, having lunch with Senator Hatch in his office, and he picked up the phone and called the White House.''   Several hours later, she was in the Oval Office.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19940913.0313 type=story > <HEADLINE> UNGERMANN SEEKS TO SOLVE PROBLEM OF HIGH SPEED MIX OF TEXT, IMAGE AND SOUND </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> SAN FRANCISCO  (BC-FIRST-VIRTUAL-ART-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199409.gz"
