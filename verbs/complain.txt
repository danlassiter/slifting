JAPAN-POLITICS (Tokyo) _ Japan's new prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, boldly made good Thursday on his campaign pledge to steer clear of traditional political factions in naming a cabinet that is one of the most eclectic the country has seen and includes a record five women. By Howard French.  WASHINGTON  (Will move in ``w'' news file.)  CONGRESS-FETUS (Washington) _ With a new ally in the White House, the House Thursday renewed the volatile debate over when life begins and approved a bill that would establish new criminal penalties for harming a human fetus during any assault on a woman covered by federal law. The measure was the year's first emotionally charged confrontation between advocates and opponents of abortion rights. Its supporters called it anti-crime legislation designed to ensure that criminals who attack a pregnant woman are charged with murder or manslaughter if she survives but her ``unborn child'' perishes in the attack. The bill's opponents called the legislation a thinly disguised effort by the anti-abortion movement to undermine Roe v. Wade. By Alison Mitchell.  NATIONAL-GENERAL  (Will move in ``a'' news file.)  MIDWEST-FLOODS (St. Louis) _ With near-record floodwaters rolling down the Mississippi once again, a debate is raging in the Midwest about how or even whether governments should try to protect the areas that might lie in rivers' paths. Recently, communities near St. Louis have begun a surge of development across thousands of acres of the flood plain and are seeking federal assistance to raise levees ever higher. Critics say the plan reflects a dangerous hubris about the power to tame mighty rivers, and they say federal money would be better spent keeping structures away from the riverbanks. But new signals from the Bush administration, which has scolded the sodden city of Davenport, Iowa, for not building a permanent flood wall, appear to suggest a preference for development over demolition. By Douglas Jehl.  TOURIST-IN-SPACE (Los Angeles) _ On Saturday, if all goes according to plan, Dennis A. Tito, a 60-year-old, 5-foot-5, 140-pound centimillionaire, will become the world's first paying tourist in space. The estimated pricetag: $20 million to the Russian space program. Tito may be living a dream-come-true, but he is no mere Walter Mitty-in-waiting. By Todd S. Purdum.  SCI-EMBRYO-RESEARCH (Undated) _ Scientists Thursday reported two startling advances in the concept of using embryonic cells to regenerate human tissues. The advances come at a time when the Bush administration, caught between patients' advocacy groups and opponents of abortion, is reviewing its predecessor's policy of allowing government-financed researchers to proceed with the research. By Nicholas Wade.  EDUC-BACK-TO-BASICS (Princeton, N.J.) _ Much attention has been given to parents and educators in Scarsdale, N.Y. and elsewhere in the country who rail against the rote memorization and emphasis on facts they say have resulted from new standardized tests. Their children need critical thinking skills, they complain, not a steady diet of details. But there is an equally strong rebellion taking place in communities like this one and others _ Fairfax, Virginia, the Northwest suburbs of Chicago, Hanover, New Hampshire, to name a few _ where parents say they want the memorization, the emphasis on content and basics so detested elsewhere. By Kate Zernicke.  NY-GUN-LIABILITY (Albany, N.Y.) _ Two years after a shooting victim won a lawsuit against the gun industry, the only verdict of its kind in the nation, New York state's high court Thursday handed down a ruling that lawyers say almost certainly means that verdict will be thrown out. The Court of Appeals ruled unanimously that the plaintiff had failed to show that gun makers had a duty to make sure their weapons were not sold irresponsibly by gun dealers, and that they could not sue the entire industry over the injury caused by a single gun. The decision dealt a severe blow not only to this case, but to the similar suits pending in several courts.

The hospital's X-ray machine, they complain, is idle because there is no one to run it. ``If you had a heart attack right now, you wouldn't have a chance,'' Padro said. ``The protesters and politicians say that the Navy has destroyed Vieques, but no one wants to help us deal with our real problems.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"

"92594"	"they"	"complain"	" Another source of friction is the new curriculum, which critics of the dean say will make the college less distinct from other criminal justice programs.

"115175"	"they"	"complain"	" Even the celebrated resurgence downtown has its detractors. Many residents resent the heavy police presence they say is desperately needed in the wards. New jobs, they complain, often go to better-skilled suburbanites, and many say they cannot afford tickets to performances at the arts center or baseball games at Riverfront Stadium, home of the Newark Bears.
