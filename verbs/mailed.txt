In September, I mailed, as part of my refund, a request to buy Olympic bricks. I got a confirmation of this but received nothing to indicate what I wanted printed on the bricks. These are supposed to be Christmas gifts. The people at 404-222-PARK don't know anything. Will I get them in time for Christmas? (BC-OLY-Q&AMP;A-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
