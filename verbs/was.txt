They gave him cast cozies.   The cast cozies, which are made of a fabric that comes from recycled bottles, were presented to the vice president, who is recuperating from surgery on a tendon, at a dinner of the League of Conservation Voters in Manhattan on Thursday.   ``Because of his Achilles tendon problem, we know that he is apparel challenged,'' said Dennis Sabourin, a vice president of Wellman, which was a sponsor of the evening. ``So we thought, why not help and have cozies made to cover the cast?''   One of the cozies was in black for black-tie events, one in forest green ``for when he meets envrironmental people,'' Sabourin said, and one in red ``for when he goes to meetings on cutting the deficit.''   As Secret Service agents eyed the cozies with suspicion, Gore said his gift was ``terrific.'' ``Just what I need,'' he said. ``Politically correct cozies.''   c.1994 N.Y. Times News Service   Marilyn Bergman, the Oscar, Grammy and Emmy winning songwriter, has been elected the first female president of the International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers. The organization works to protect the intellectual property rights of authors, dramatists, composers and artists. In April, she was elected the first female president of Ascap, the American society.   The international group's election took place in Washington at a four-day meeting that ended Thursday with a performance called ``A Celebration of American Music,'' on the South Lawn of the White House. ``We did it in a foot of mud,'' Ms. Bergman said. ``Because of the weather, it was touch and go whether we would have it or not.''   President and Mrs. Clinton were in the audience, and Ms. Bergman and her husband, Alan, who is also her writing partner, spent the night in the Lincoln Bedroom of the White House.   As if that were not enough, Ms. Bergman is also planning the wedding of her daughter, Julie, on Oct. 9. ``Each time a florist called, I would ask if it was for the meeting or for the wedding,'' she said.   c.1994 N.Y. Times News Service   Twenty-five women will be inducted Saturday into the National Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, N.Y., where the first Women's Rights Convention was held, in 1848, by such feminists as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott.   Among the new members: Bella Abzug, Geraldine Ferraro, Oprah Winfrey, Wilma Rudolph and Antonia Novello.   Ms. Abzug seemed duly honored to be named. ``I am accepting this on behalf of all the women who are never recognized for the things they weren't able to do, for the women who never had a chance, for the victims of violence,'' she said.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19940923.0342 type=story > <HEADLINE> THE NORTH EFFECT ON THE GOP </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-EDIT-NORTH-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199409.gz"

Pope Paul VI went to Jordan and Israel Jan. 4-6, 1964; that was the first time a pope had left Italy since 1809. Later that year, Dec. 2-5, Pope Paul flew to Bombay, India. If you saw him at the World's Fair, you were in the right place at the right time. In the late evening Oct. 4, 1965, after celebrating a low evening Mass for 90,000 people at Yankee Stadium, the pope made a brief stop at the fair's Vatican Pavilion. He left at 10:45 p.m. for Kennedy International Airport, taking off for Rome at 11:29 p.m. The fair ended 13 days later. If you're wondering why the pope visited the 1964 World's Fair in 1965, it's because the fair covered parts of two years: It opened April 22, 1964, and closed Oct. 17, 1965. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"

They're hungry for something new, and they're excited for the films and the filmmakers, so they were into it. You could almost feel your life changing during the hour and a half. And afterwards, when the credits came up, I was, like, mobbed at the stage, and all those guys who were rejecting me, all those agents who wouldn't take my phone calls, were now handing me their business cards and saying, `When are you coming out to LA, we've got to do lunch, we've got to do this, we've got to do that.'

Meanwhile, she's sidestepping into sci-fi, playing opposite Sigourney Weaver in ``Alien: Resurrection,'' now shooting. ``I love science fiction,'' Ryder says. ``When they first approached me, I was, like, `No way,' because I thought Ripley (Weaver's character) was dead. I'm not going to take over the helm _ like, me, 5 foot 4, scrawny little thing! But then they cloned her and brought her back. It's not like a blow-'em-up movie. It's a very lurking kind of thing.

Sure, some of the moments are a bit scatological (what would you expect when 50,000 cockroaches are co-stars?), but that's part of the fun. The musical routines are brilliant, Robert Vaughn is wonderful as a greedy real estate agent, and Don Ho does a cameo.  ``Loaded'' _ Anna Campion, Jane's sister, directs a mixed-bag story about English actors making a low-budget horror film. Campion is in so much of a hurry to show us that the movie is really about jealousy that she forgets to tighten the suspense.  ``The Frighteners'' _ Michael J. Fox, known for his sunny roles, plays it considerably darker in the ghost-hunting murder mystery. The director, New Zealand's Peter Jackson, uses great special effects to marshal the terror.  ``Tin Cup'' _ The likable, but unsurprising, story of life on the professional golf tour wants to be the duffer's version of baseball's ``Bull Durham,'' but it doesn't make it.  ------  CHRISTMAS STOCKING STUFFERS: ``A Christmas Carol'' _ Either the 1951 Alastair Sim version or the 1994 TV movie with George C.

Now, 65 pounds lighter, the Connecticut center has become perhaps the most dominant player in women's college basketball, a tribute to what hard work in the weight room can do. One reason Connecticut is 25-0 and the nation's top-ranked team for the last nine weeks is superb conditioning.

Although Ames joined the agency's operations branch, working as an overseas agent trying to turn Soviet spies into double agents on behalf of the United States, he was, like his father, mediocre in his work.

The drop has prompted the company's critics to suggest that it shows the effect the El Paso contract had in keeping gas prices high. But a lawyer for the company says the decline was largely due to other factors.  VIRGIN MOBILE IN VENTURE WITH SPRINT  In its first foray into the U.S. telecommunications market, Virgin Mobile agreed to a joint venture with Sprint.  EBONY AND GUMBEL IN A DISPUTE  Executives of Ebony magazine have taken issue with remarks made by Bryant Gumbel, the co-host of CBS's ``Early Show,'' who told students at a Howard University graduation ceremony that they were ``entitled to live a rich life'' but that nothing would change if ``all you're going to seek is a superficial Ebony magazine view of life _ one that accentuates only your cars and your clothes.'' Executives of the magazine say it strives to highlight the accomplishments of black people and deny that it promotes materialism.  KOREAS TO PERMIT ROAD TRAVEL  North and South Korea have agreed to open the first regular ground route between the two countries as a result of negotiations between executives of the Hyundai Group and North Korean officials on reducing the costs of trips by tourists to the North.  KOREAN AIR ANTICIPATES STRIKE BY PILOTS  Korean Air, Korea's flagship airline, said that it had canceled 80 percent of its flights scheduled for Tuesday because most of its pilots plan to join a nationwide strike called by the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions. Asiana, Korea's other major airline, was also expected to cancel many flights.  CENDANT NEARS A DEAL FOR GALILEO  Cendant hopes to announce late Monday or early Tuesday that it is buying Galileo International for about $3 billion in cash and stock.  VIRUS SEARCHES FOR PORNOGRAPHY  A rogue computer program, which searches computers for what it suspects may be child pornography and reports file names to the police, has raised legal questions and seems sure to fuel the debate over privacy. Apart from the program's invasive nature, virus experts question the results it sends out.  NBC NEGOTIATOR PLANS TO RETIRE  Ed Scanlon, who is retiring at the end of this month as executive vice president for employee relations at NBC, kept a low profile. But he wielded a significant amount of power. He negotiated all the biggest talent contracts at the network, as well as the contracts for senior management. More than that, he was, several colleagues say, the direct link to the two most important executives, Bob Wright, the chairman of NBC, and Jack Welch., the chairman of GE, NBC's parent.  ARNELL SELLING AGENCIES TO OMNICOM  A month after Peter Arnell, chairman and chief executive at the Arnell Group, bought back a majority stake in the agency from Draft Worldwide, he is selling the entire agency and two siblings to the Omnicom Group.

(The Flesh Fair might be a Dogma 95 pep rally, or a meeting of dyspeptic film critics protesting the movie's lavish and startling special effects, including the computer-enhanced broken-down robots doomed to destruction.) But here Spielberg confronts a crucial and difficult question: Do the virtual selves we project into the world, on screen and elsewhere, bring us closer to knowing who we are, or do they distract us from our search for that knowledge? ``I am, I was,'' Joe says to David as they part company, asserting as a flat fact what the movie takes as unanswerable questions: What are we?

TERROR-DESIGN (Undated) _ Not many months ago, the field of design was enjoying the popularity of a professional lifetime. It appeared on the cover of Time magazine last year. With its titanium coating and colored gels, it was, literally, the bright surface of economic success, the gleam in the eye of a public eager to play with the products of prosperity. In the light of the last month's events, design's sharp flash, as a mirror of public mood, has started to reflect and display a different picture _ a view of an altered world, pocked by new realities.  Earlier this month, seven accomplished designers were presented with the Chrysler Design Award, a prestigious annual award for innovation and achievement in their various disciplines of design. That afternoon, House &AMP; Home invited them to sit and to discuss their responses to September 11th and to the uncoiling situation of the last six weeks. Can _ and should _ design play an important part? And how? By William L. Hamilton.  NY-FIREFIGHTERS-DOCTOR (New York) _ Though she seems a lot like that nice lady next door, Dr. Kerry J. Kelly, 49, is chief medical officer of the New York City Fire Department, responsible for the health care of its 16,000 firefighters and officers, emergency medical technicians and paramedics. The daughter and granddaughter of New York City firefighters, Kelly has been with the department since 1981. In good years, she spends 40 hours a week getting its members to watch their cholesterol and go to the gym. On Sept. 11, when 343 firefighters lost their lives in one day, the department found itself, Kelly said, with ``a couple hundred widows and about 1,000 children without fathers,'' a mental health emergency for hundreds of families whose notions of home were changed forever. By Alex Witchel.  COCOONING (Undated) _ One of the inevitable results of a disaster like Sept. 11 is a profusion of quasiscientific ruminating about the psychic health of the nation. My personal favorite is the notion that the American people have now entered a period of intense national ``cocooning'' that may last anywhere from three months to 10 years. By Joe Qeenan.

For Sunday:  WASHINGTON NEWS (``w'' category)  AIRPORT-SECURITY (Washington) _ As the House prepares to vote next Wednesday on an airport security bill, rank-and-file Republican lawmakers say they feel politically vulnerable because their leaders have stalled for so long on the measure. Under the GOP leadership's bill, federal workers would supervise the screeners who check passengers and bags at airports. Under the Senate's security bill, unanimously passed two weeks ago, all screeners would be federal employees. By LARA JAKES.  FLIGHT15-SCHOLARSHIP (Washington) _ Unbelievable kindness. That's how the stranded passengers of Delta Flight 15 described the response of the people of Lewisporte, a small Canadian town, in the days following the horror of Sept. 11. Townspeople gave the unexpected visitors food, shelter, medicine, even guided tours of the lovely area _ all for free. Now Flight 15 passengers are determined to return the favor. They are raising thousands of dollars to start a college scholarship fund for the town's high school students. By DAVID EGGERT. (1stld-writethru already filed on story that moved Tuesday.)

COMMENTARY (``k'' category)  THOMPSON-COLUMN (Branson, Mo.) _ Most of the people coming here to Branson _ with is many shows, aura of nostalgia and stars and stripes everywhere _ know what patriotism is because they have lived it. They know what it was like to lose a relative or a friend in brutal combat. They know that the human spirit can suffer tragedy and rebound with time and healing. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON.

HOME  (Will move in `l' news category)  TERROR-DESIGN (Undated) _ Not many months ago, the field of design was enjoying the popularity of a professional lifetime. It appeared on the cover of Time magazine last year. With its titanium coating and colored gels, it was, literally, the bright surface of economic success, the gleam in the eye of a public eager to play with the products of prosperity. In the light of the last month's events, design's sharp flash, as a mirror of public mood, has started to reflect and display a different picture _ a view of an altered world, pocked by new realities.  Earlier this month, seven accomplished designers were presented with the Chrysler Design Award, a prestigious annual award for innovation and achievement in their various disciplines of design. That afternoon, House &AMP; Home invited them to sit and to discuss their responses to September 11th and to the uncoiling situation of the last six weeks. Can _ and should _ design play an important part? And how? By William L. Hamilton.  NY-FIREFIGHTERS-DOCTOR (New York) _ Though she seems a lot like that nice lady next door, Dr. Kerry J. Kelly, 49, is chief medical officer of the New York City Fire Department, responsible for the health care of its 16,000 firefighters and officers, emergency medical technicians and paramedics. The daughter and granddaughter of New York City firefighters, Kelly has been with the department since 1981. In good years, she spends 40 hours a week getting its members to watch their cholesterol and go to the gym. On Sept. 11, when 343 firefighters lost their lives in one day, the department found itself, Kelly said, with ``a couple hundred widows and about 1,000 children without fathers,'' a mental health emergency for hundreds of families whose notions of home were changed forever. By Alex Witchel.  COCOONING (Undated) _ One of the inevitable results of a disaster like Sept. 11 is a profusion of quasiscientific ruminating about the psychic health of the nation. My personal favorite is the notion that the American people have now entered a period of intense national ``cocooning'' that may last anywhere from three months to 10 years. By Joe Qeenan.

"98999"	"it"	"was"	" Two senior White House officials said Thursday that while the idea of delaying the test originated with Rumsfeld, it was, in the words of one, ``heavily coordinated here.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"99488"	"she"	"was"	" Over the years, there were vague accounts to those who knew her of a husband she had divorced, a child who had died in a car crash, a cousin in Seattle and a brother who lived in France. But no one saw these people. When neighbors ran into Kathy Nguyen, she was, inevitably, alone. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"100392"	"he"	"was"	" If there is any message in Tarkovsky's work, although as a poet he  would never stoop to anything as banal as a message, it is that life is  an internal affair, played out in one's soul, not in public. By thus  putting the soul beyond the reach of the commissars, he was, of course,  the ultimate subversive. In 1984, he chose self-exile after the Soviet  government refused to allow him a visa extension. (The film title  deliberately echoes Solzhenitsyn's gulag classic ``One Day in the Life  of Ivan Denisovich.'') Tarkovsky and his wife lived in Florence, then in  West Berlin, then in Paris, where he died. His films were poetic,  uncompromising, filled with hermetic lyricism. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"100764"	"he"	"was"	" But when asked why the tree was also regarded as a symbol of peace, he was, well, stumped. ``This is an old expression,'' he said. ``I don't know why.'' </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20011112.0258 type=story > <HEADLINE> 'AIDA' ALL DRESSED UP WITH NOWHERE TO GO </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-AIDA-THEATER-LADN) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"100813"	"it"	"was"	" Fred Kimball, 45, a construction worker who grew up in the neighborhood, said, ``When this happened, it was, `Not again.' The nerves were too raw.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"100822"	"it"	"was"	" Fred Kimball, 45, a construction worker who grew up in the neighborhood, said, ``When this happened, it was, `Not again.' The nerves were too raw.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"100830"	"it"	"was"	" Fred Kimball, 45, a construction worker who grew up in the neighborhood, said, ``When this happened, it was, `Not again.' The nerves were too raw.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"101775"	"it"	"was"	" If the keynote speakers had a single message to their financially shell-shocked comrades, it was, ``Cheer up.'' Bill Gates of Microsoft, Jeff Hawkins of Handspring and Kunitake Ando of Sony, for example, each took the stage to paint a bright picture of technology's near future. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"101776"	"it"	"was"	" If the exhibitors had such a message, it was, ``Think about something else.'' Booth after booth featured sports cars, female models or those 60-inch flat screens, all calculated to catch the eyes of the predominantly male audience. Mercedes even let showgoers drive $120,000 cars around a gigantic test track in the convention-center parking lot. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"102441"	"she"	"was"	" Even at home, she was, ``organized, maybe too organized,'' Mr. Gladstone recalled. In their Forest Hills home she had tax files going back to when they had met, he said, recalling her fondness for her tax work as section chief in Tower Two, 86th floor. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"103026"	"I"	"was"	" Reminded that Policy referred to the 1995 game at Giants Stadium when players and officials were pelted with snowballs, Mara was then asked if he was offended by that reference by Policy. ``Yes, I was,'' he said. ``I just don't think it was any of his business.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"103176"	"it"	"was"	" At Kirna Zabete on Greene Street, the attitude that, after Sept. 11, it was, as Joseph Germonto, the assistant manager, put it, callous to be seen out shopping has been supplanted by a collective effort to ``get back into the day-to-day rigamarole of it all.'' Kirna Zabete is rigamarole central when it comes to obscure designers. It is also well stocked with the truly must-haves. Dedicated shoppers know that the latter rarely go on sale, and yet there last week was an Olivier Theyskens wool boucle jacket, reduced to $448 from $895; and Hussein Chalayan narrow-leg wool trousers at $260, or 50 percent of the original price. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"103862"	"it"	"was"	" ``No cause for panic,'' was the headline in the government-controlled Straits Times the day after the announcement of the arrests. In the paper on Sunday, it was, ``Carry on as usual.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"105965"	"it"	"was"	" ``We were like one of the only cars that made it through. Stuff worked out, there were holes at the right time. Saw the 20 (Stewart) go up. We thought that'd be a good time to go under him because he was pretty high. Right then, it was, `OK, no matter what happens it's already going to be a pretty good day.' '' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"106355"	"I"	"was"	" ``Yes, I was,'' Sinclair replied. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"106714"	"I"	"was"	" ``It was just a constant struggle between fears and doubts, and you are saying, `No, I've trained my (butt) off for years to get here, and I'm not going to give in,' '' Cheek said. ``So, I was, like, shouting at myself. Do you see the tapes of me when I'm getting ready to go to the line? I look like a nut job just mouthing to myself.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"107788"	"it"	"was"	" As for how it was on Feb. 21 when her organization, which works for press freedom worldwide, learned about the murder of Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter who was abducted in Pakistan last month and later killed by his captors, it was, as one would expect, a terrible day. All at once, all the phones were screaming. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"

Yet despite his assertions, Daschle seems to be positioning himself for a possible run for president in 2004. Four of Daschle's confidants said in interviews that they have quietly discussed the subject with him -- and that he has by no means ruled it out.

But two weeks ago, 38 years after he was convicted of killing two Lodi policemen, Trantino walked out of a Camden halfway house and into a world he barely recognizes, and one that is not entirely thrilled to have him back. Since his release, Trantino, 64, has been unable to shed his pariah status and his label as a remorseless cop killer who escaped justice.

But so far there are no takers, given the intense fear of Russians and how they treat Chechen civilians. Roza Girikhanova, a refugee who saw her mother and sister die during the bombing of the Chechen capital in early 2000, said, ``I would rather carry out an act of self-immolation than be forced to go back to Grozny.''

Yet despite his assertions, Daschle seems to be positioning himself for a possible run for president in 2004. Four of Daschle's confidants said in interviews that they have quietly discussed the subject with him -- and that he has by no means ruled it out.

Last week Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, sold all but 27.5 percent of LVMH's stake in Phillips.

"108334"	"I"	"was"	" If we feel sympathy for David, are we betraying our kind (humans) in favor of artificiality? In fact, ``A.I'' raises a number of questions about our own evolving humanity (far too many to address here). Spielberg doesn't try to answer them. ``I am, I was,'' Joe says the last time we see him.

Unlike Berle, however, Loud had only one role to play; and his career exemplified the fragility of small-screen fame. Celebrated for being himself in a documentary, he could never be sure if he had any other talent. His fantasies of rock 'n' roll or literary glory in New York and Los Angeles, the cities where he lived and worked over the last 30 years, never materialized.

Today, the opposite is true. Theater people are going ever more resolutely to the movies, drawn by the need for new stories.

Made up of immigrants and refugees from Russia, the Ukraine and Israel, the members converged in New York four years ago with a mission to make a new kind of rock 'n' roll that reflected their struggles and their peripatetic heritage. Their sound is raucous, sweaty, tuneful and recklessly vibrant, like the punk and Gypsy music that inspired them. By Ben Sisario.

Two hundred years ago, when Beethoven was writing, the European Classical orchestra would have provided some of the loudest and most intense sonic experiences available, exceeded in that respect only by the battlefield.

But the enterprise has delivered a crisis for the museum itself: The Guggenheim's efforts to remake itself in the image of a multinational corporation have reached the point of collapse.

But the industry has managed a gradual recovery; one travel agent attributed the trend to the array of bargains and the desire to escape to a place that's warm, exotic and on American soil. By Edwin McDowell.  TRAVEL-NEWMEXICO (Undated) _ On my frequent trips to New Mexico I usually choose between two types of lodging: a tent when I want to hike and explore the outdoors, and a hotel or bed-and-breakfast when I want a comfortable bed with fine linens, a well-appointed bathroom, attentive service and good restaurants nearby. I got the best of both on a recent visit to Rancho de San Juan, 35 miles northwest of Santa Fe. By Kathryn Jones.

But for all of Churchill's deserved reputation as a brilliant and unswerving leader during one of the darkest eras of the 20th century, he was, in the years before World War II, little more than a burned-out politician, a has-been preaching to empty seats in the House of Commons. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"

Published in 1968, it was, simply, one of the most passionate, authoritative, joyful, definitive, quirky, witty, obsessive, poetic, honest, idiosyncratic and occasionally cranky how-to books ever written.

GERMANY-ELECT (Berlin) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder apologized to President Bush on the eve of a German election thrown wide open by Schroeder's stand against American policy in Iraq. In a letter to the president, he wrote: ``I would like to say how sorry I am that the remarks attributed to the German justice minister may have hurt you.'' The letter illustrates how the United States is now at the center of the closest-fought German election in many years. Schroeder's anti-American stand has rallied not only his own Social Democrats but also his current coalition partner, the Greens. The pro-market Free Democrats, whose had seemed likely to take a place in any future government, have seen their support fade. By Steven Erlanger.

Yet Fiske has still spent more than $4,000 of her own money on classroom books and supplies.

CHINA-DISSIDENT (Beijing) _ China's most prominent advocate for AIDS patients, Dr. Wan Yanhai, was unexpectedly released Friday after nearly a month's detention by China's State Security apparatus. The release comes after an international outcry over his arrest on Aug. 24. Entities as diverse as the State Department of the United States, the United Nations, and ACT UP _ the Aids Coalition to Unleash Power _ each in its own way protested his unexplained detention.

Summers, jumped into the debate over Israel and Palestine this week, condemning what he termed growing anti-Semitism at Harvard and elsewhere and rejecting calls for the university to remove Israeli investments from its enormous endowment. ``Serious and thoughtful people are advocating and taking actions that are anti-Semitic in their effect if not their intent,'' Summers said Tuesday morning in a Morning Prayer address in Harvard's Memorial Church, referring both to divestment efforts and to actions by student organizations at Harvard and other campuses to raise money for organizations found to have ties to terrorist groups.

LEAD-PAINT-SUITS (Providence, R.I.) _ Faced with tens of thousands of children poisoned and brain-damaged by lead paint, the nation's cities have tried to tackle the problem by going after building owners and testing children for lead in their blood. But now, bolstered by their successes in tobacco cases, officials are taking aim instead at the companies that made the paint. By Pam Belluck.  (Scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in ``a'' news file.)  BBN-METS (New York) _ So now the jokes begin _ the Mets, low in the standings and high on marijuana. The team has a meaningless game Friday night at Shea against the Montreal Expos and the focus will instead be on how the team _ and particularly, General Manager Steve Phillips, Manager Bobby Valentine and the team's owner, Fred Wilpon _ responds to reports that more than a half-dozen Mets were smoking marijuana this season and that numerous players in the Mets' minor-league system use the drug and try to devise ways to beat the testing system.

And what did he think of the Oaks Course at the International in Bolton? ``I loved it. It was spectacular,'' he said after playing in a charity event organized by Red Sox announcer Sean McDonough. Designed by Tom Fazio, the Oaks Course opened in July 2001, but it truly got introduced this past summer, playing host to events such as the MGA Four-ball Championship and New England Open, not to mention dozens of charity events. In an area where waiting lists at private clubs are commonplace, the International is one of the few established private facilities with membership openings. It also draws a special vote here as host of the year for all it did for local golf in 2002; McDonough's charity event for children was the latest effort.

In an interview he admitted that he was ambivalent about the subject. With his book, he was, he said, ``countering an image that undeniably travel is always fun.'' Though pocket-size and portable, ``The Art of Travel'' (published by Pantheon) is a kind of anti-guide. It offers no travel tips, but, like a chapbook, it is packed with literary quotations, as is de Botton in conversation. In its wryly subversive way, the book explores the reasons that people go to different places and the disappointments that often have to be endured in the course of a journey.

At a meeting in November, Medicare's advisers will assess one increasingly popular method of weight loss: surgery. Already, Medicare officials have signaled they are open to the idea of covering obesity treatments. In July, they rescinded a policy of refusing to pay for medical care intended only to treat obesity. And coverage for surgery may be only the first step. Already commercial diet programs as well as doctors in academia and private practice say they want coverage for their programs, too. But many obesity experts are raising questions about this movement. At a time when health care cost are soaring and expected to balloon further as the population ages, they ask, are weight-loss treatments the best use of money, or are they unnecessary medicine?

When he ostensibly was out in California the day before the Celtics beat Minnesota Feb. 6, he was, in fact, in New York City for some legal business. When asked about this discrepancy, Payton said, You all can say whatever you want to say. I don't care what you write. I wasn't in New York. You all can call my mom and ask her. When asked for his mother's number, Payton said, No, you don't need to be calling my mom about this. This wouldn't be a big deal had not the Celtics practically canonized Payton for coming back from California after visiting his sick mother to play so well the next day in Minnesota.

There is at least one retail shop in the company's future -- probably on the Upper East Side -- and possibly more. But before Marrus invests in real estate, she needs to finish putting the company's affairs in order.

, they argued,	 Starting in the late 1980s some feminist scholars also began to see porn as a tool that women could appropriate to liberate themselves from patriarchal norms of behavior and beauty. Porn sexuality, they argued, wasn't simply about subjugation. Instead, what pornography is trying to do is create, using real bodies, a fantasy of a kind of idealized and perfectly abundant pleasure, says Linda Williams, a film studies professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and a leading porn theorist. What others might see as basically a masturbatory aid was cast instead as a genre of utopian social criticism. As for the anti-porn crusaders, Williams adds: Really, who are they to tell us where our sexual imaginations should go? </P> 	nyt_eng_200503.gz

As Joshua Cohen, an MIT political science professor who has studied the First Amendment ramifications of the laws, puts it, A lot of the energy that went into the issue during the 1980s was focused on these legal strategies. When they failed, he says, It became pretty clear that legal regulations directed to stop pornography were not going to be accepted by the courts, and that probably sapped some of the energy from the anti-pornography movement. </P> 	nyt_eng_200503.gz

But as the most senior of the living scientists who initiated the atomic age, he urged the United States to renounce all research on nuclear arms and called on scientists everywhere to do likewise. His ultimate dream, he said, his blue eyes calm, was for nations to cut their nuclear arsenals to a few hundred weapons or less.

What gave him the courage to do so, he added, was self-confidence, a strong personality and the support of the community of friends and scientists he nurtured for nearly seven decades at Cornell. </P> 	nyt_eng_200503.gz

, he added,	 Freeman Dyson, a mathematician at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton who was born in Britain, recalled meeting Bethe at Cornell in 1947. The thing that impressed me the most, he said, was that he had very muddy shoes and all the students called him Hans. So he was just the opposite of a European professor. That was part of his greatness. He was totally unpretentious and never tried to be bigger than he was. Bethe, he added, always had lunch with the students and had a real concern for the teaching and all the students he was responsible for. He had a wonderful gift for finding the right problem for them, not too difficult and not too easy. </P> 	nyt_eng_200503.gz
, he added,	 Hans Albrecht Bethe was born on July 2, 1906, in Strasbourg, Alsace-Lorraine, to a family of modest means. His father, a physiologist at the University of Strasbourg, was a Protestant and his mother Jewish. He was their only child. The frail youth showed an early genius for mathematics, which his father discouraged, not wanting his son to get ahead of his peers. The precocious boy took to secretly reading his father's books on trigonometry and calculus. Bethe once said he grew up in the solace of numbers and fairy tales -- things, he added, that a young boy got interested in when he did not have a little sister to beat up. The family moved to Frankfurt, where his father founded a physiology department at the new university. At the nearby gymnasium, or secondary school, his son studied Greek and Latin, French and English, but excelled at math and physics, deciding he wanted to do both. </P> 	nyt_eng_200503.gz
, he held,	 In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Bethe lent his growing prestige to fight the government's plans to deploy anti-missile weapons. Having studied the issue for President Dwight D. Eisenhower, he was convinced that all such systems could be easily defeated. It was just too easy, he held, for an adversary to make decoys and other countermeasures that offensive missiles would jettison to outwit defensive arms. And while militarily futile, he argued, anti-missile arms would succeed extremely well at adding costly new spirals to the arms race as each side struggled for advantage. As before, Bethe found himself strongly opposed by Teller, who this time wanted to shield America from the hydrogen bombs that adversaries had learned how to make. In 1975, at a cost of some $6 billion, the government switched on a limited anti-missile system that was soon abandoned because of its ineffectiveness. </P> 	nyt_eng_200503.gz
, he said,	 Throughout the political activism that marked his later life, Bethe never abandoned his first love -- science. With what might be seen as poetic finesse, he turned his attention to the question of why old stars can suddenly explode with the brilliance of an entire galaxy. An average star like the sun dies quietly. But larger ones can die violently, though no one is quite sure why. They go on a rampage, Bethe said with a smile, the blackboard behind him filled with equations. In a year they emit as much energy as the sun does in 10 billion years of history. Why does this happen? At the start, he said, the central part of a star exhausts its fuel supply, collapsing so fast that the outside of the star stays uninvolved. The small core then bounces back. The question we are studying, he continued, is whether that shock wave is strong enough to go all the way through the star and to expel essentially all its outside, because that is what is observed in supernovas. </P> 	nyt_eng_200503.gz

' He also found that Stallone has turned his home in Beverly Hills into a little piece of the old country.

As for Stallone, Burnett calls him a 'warmhearted man, down-to-earth despite all his success. He even showed me around the house, displaying his collection of Rocky and Rambo memorabilia. More importantly, he agreed to do the show.' Stallone did offer Burnett one invaluable tip about how to make The Contender work: focus on the families, not just the boxers. As he told Burnett, the secret to 'Rocky' was that the movie was really about Adrian, not Rocky Balboa. </P> 	nyt_eng_200503.gz

(United Nations) -- The commission investigating the oil-for-food program in Iraq cleared Secretary-General Kofi Annan of exercising any influence in the awarding of a contract to the company that employed his son. But it faulted him for not taking more aggressive action to look into the company's relationship with the United Nations once conflict of interest questions were raised. The report said that Annan's son, Kojo, tried to disguise his continuing employment with the company, Cotecna Inspection Services, that he had deceived his father about it and that he had been uncooperative with the commission.

IRAQ (Baghdad, Iraq) -- Sharp ethnic and sectarian divisions erupted during a meeting of the constitutional assembly, as some members angrily accused others of betraying the Iraqi people by failing to form a coalition government.

Not two months ago, Riccardo Muti seemed the unshakable master of the Teatro Alla Scala, the legendary opera house in Milan. But now, besieged in the political arena and denounced by the orchestra he so lovingly molded over two decades, he has all but lost his grip on the company. New twists arise almost daily. How long will Muti, 63, who is as proud and stubborn as he is brilliant and charismatic, continue to weather insults intended to force his departure from the position he has held since 1986? The question of what happens next for this celebrated maestro has both immediate and long-range implications not just in Europe but in America, too. By Daniel J. Wakin and James R. Oestreich.  MCDONAGH-THEATER (Undated) -- Martin McDonagh has never killed a kitten. He has never torn the wings off flies, blown up a stove or bludgeoned a woman to death with a fireplace poker. I try to be as nice as I possibly can to people, says McDonagh, smiling meekly. And then, after a perfectly timed pause, he adds, Except journalists. It is exactly that kind of remark that has made McDonagh's work shimmer since he first burst onto the theater scene nearly a decade ago. Acclaimed by critics on both sides of the Atlantic, McDonagh remains a confounding character: A writer of enormous lyrical gifts and sometimes off-putting arrogance; a mild-mannered, soft-spoken vegetarian whose plays depict casual torture, buckets of blood and the occasional decapitation; and a self-described skeptic of the magic of theater who has nonetheless become one of the most successful and produced playwrights in the world. By Jesse McKinley.  HIRST-PAINTING (New York) -- With his first New York show since 2000, Damien Hirst, abandoning his famous menagerie of dead sharks and pharmaceuticals and eight-foot-wide ashtrays, has unveiled 31 photorealist paintings, all heavily assistant-aided and tongue in cheek. The subjects include skulls, crystals, pills, a doctor proffering a brain, an empty hospital hallway -- campy shockers, aimed at Page Six and hedge fund speculators. The show's opening galvanized the predictable mob of ebullient celebrities and tut-tutting rubberneckers. It isn't clear whether anyone noticed, amid the revelry, that a moment had passed. That moment encompasses the laddish phase of Hirst's charmed pop-star trajectory, which first brought him widespread fame more than a decade ago as the clowning, precocious ringmaster of the Young British Artists. By Michael Kimmelman.  Editors, Frank Rich, whose column anchored the Arts &amp; Leisure cover, has moved back to the Sunday Op-Ed page. His once-a-week columns will begin there on April 10.  Theater  DENZEL-WASHINGTON-BROADWAY (New York) -- During his working vacation away from Hollywood, Denzel Washington may be willing to go without the luxury trailer, but the bodyguard stays: a very large bearded man leads the way to the small room in the Belasco Theater where Washington, in a long-sleeved T-shirt and jeans, is relaxing before afternoon rehearsal for Julius Caesar. The show is still in previews, but in the corner, there's already a bin full of letters from fans who have seen the show; the theater had to hire extra security to handle the mob that waits for him each night after the curtain falls. Washington got his theater chops in the late 1970s at Fordham. He eventually put in his time in various off-Broadway productions. Once he was cast in St. Elsewhere, his television and film careers took off, and he's rarely made it back to the theater, except for a short-lived Broadway show called Checkmates and a production of Richard III for Shakespeare in the Park in 1990. Now playing Brutus, Washington is adjusting to the high-wire act of live theater -- and yes, he says, it's a lot more work than film. Susan Dominus talked to him. In Q&amp;A format.  Film  CHOW-FILM (Undated) -- Previous generations of Hong Kong action heroes have flown through the air with the aid of hidden wires and trampolines. But now, Hong Kong filmmakers are following Hollywood into the digital age, using computer technology to manipulate images and make the feats of their protagonists seem even more otherworldly and astonishing. One of the comic (and even poetic) highlights of Stephen Chow's new film Kung Fu Hustle finds Chow leaping so far off the ground that he encounters Buddha in the form of a cloud formation, before he plunges back to earth to deliver a devastating coup de grace to an opponent. At 42, he is East Asia's most popular comedy star, having appeared in more than 50 films since his big screen debut in 1988, sometimes at the rate of six or seven a year. Chow is now looking for new worlds to conquer, both creatively as a writer and director and commercially as a box-office name in the Western hemisphere. By Dave Kehr.  Dance  AMERICAN-DANCE (Undated) -- When George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein set about forming an American ballet company in the 1930s -- an effort that would result in the New York City Ballet -- they encountered resistance. Ballet in this country had been the province of Russian (or Russian-named) ballerinas who espoused a style that would seem theatrically artificial today. There were some, like John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, who felt initially that American dance was modern dance and that ballet represented a regression to what might now be called old Europe. Yet from the beginning Balanchine and Kirstein were determined to form a truly American ballet company. The New York City Ballet was never pure, but eventually, most of the dancers were born and schooled here, and they developed a distinctly American aesthetic. Now look at the rosters of important American ballet companies, many once directed by former Balanchine dancers. At the Boston Ballet, 17 of 20 of the top dancers are foreign-born and at least initially foreign trained. In San Francisco, only four of the 17 principals were born in this country. American Ballet Theater has long welcomed foreign-trained stars. The same pattern prevails in many other big companies. In our era of globalization, is this a problem, or merely a swing of the pendulum from internationalism to nativism and back again? By John Rockwell.  Art and Architecture  ART-PRIZES (Undated) -- For decades now, Robert Rauschenberg has held the highest artistic honors: for starters, pride of place on the walls of institutions like MoMA, the Guggenheim and the Tate. But recently the artist fielded a more obscure accolade: the Premio Internacional Julio Gonzalez, one of a multitude of new art prizes awarded by the museum world to living artists. Over the last few years, museums large and small have started awarding their own prizes, usually named after the institution and sponsored by a corporate donor, to capitalize on the glamour associated with contemporary art. To burnish their appeal, many of the new awards are modeled on the Tate Modern's venerable Turner Prize, which has evolved into a nationally televised event that attracts celebrity presenters like Madonna and habitually polarizes the British press.

Until now, it has never been written down in recipe form; the women in their family have always made it together to pass on the knowledge.

"170838"	"he"	"was"	" Beginning on the morning of Sept. 11, as the terrorists board their planes, the film flashes back to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. It charts the subsequent CIA and FBI investigations, their failure to contextualize ominous discoveries and the vexing way in which al-Qaida snaked its way around the globe, with attacks in Kenya, Tanzania and Yemen. FBI agent John P. O'Neill (portrayed here by Harvey Keitel) is the perfect person around which to frame the story -- despite avidly battling terrorism and fighting to get the government to focus on its threat, he was, bitterly ironically, one of those killed when the twin towers collapsed. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171323"	"it"	"was"	" I didn't hear a lot of sorry's or thank you's in our time together with the 49ers, Reynolds said, so when he did say something like that, it was, 'Wow.'  </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171669"	"it"	"was"	" Absolutely. It was a goal, one I could stick to. Ambitious as it sounded, it was, amazingly, not excessive. I could keep living generally the way I wanted. I gave myself eight hours to lose the weight. In a world where texting passes for conversation and hooking up for a relationship, perhaps I had just defined the new activism: Very little pain, not insignificant gain. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"171778"	"he"	"was"	" My son, poor guy, went about trying to salvage it and talked about how we could glue pieces together, said Greiner, a writer and editor in Palisades, N.Y. But I found that with the demise of my marriage came the end of my sentimental feelings about a lot of things, including my wedding china. I swept it up and put it in the garbage, telling my son that it was just 'things' and not that important. As soon as he saw that I was OK about it, he was, too. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"171908"	"he"	"was"	" James K. Polk does not loom large in the American collective memory. Like Delaware among the states, he is among those most likely to be left off the list in a game of Name the Presidents. Fussy, grim-faced, iron-willed, he was, as Hampton Sides puts it, plodding and colorless. In an age that venerated great oratory, he was a master of the single-entendre. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172128"	"it"	"was"	" The glass-half-full assessment of Greene in Boston was that he had the tools to be a Don Chaney-type player. Defense was, and is, Greene's calling card. His offense? Well, in Boston, it was, to be charitable, on-again, off-again. He shot 39.5 percent from the field and 66 percent from the line. He averaged 3.2 points and 1.6 assists in 15.4 minutes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172687"	"it"	"was"	" That was just his number, Billick said. If we had 12 runs up, he'd come in and go, 'It looks a little short.' If we had 14, it was, 'Looks a little heavy.' I don't think he sat there and counted. That was the number that looked right. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172993"	"he"	"was"	" What may be stalling Thicke's arrival is that when he first came onto the scene, he was, for whatever reason, given the narrow label of soul, a genre that has gone largely unrecognized by mainstream radio, according to Fertig. WERS plays two of Thicke's singles during a show on weekend nights called The Secret Spot, which airs neo-soul singers such as Legend and Jill Scott who don't get much airtime otherwise. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"

"173039"	"it"	"was"	" Strange pick aside, it was, in no disguised terms, a sign that the mystery of Martin has transitioned into the rising-star period. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173398"	"it"	"was"	" For sheer spontaneity, it was, maybe, the most exciting moment at Raymond James Stadium. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173666"	"he"	"was"	" Well, yeah, he was, in Mel Gibson's film. But he can't work any miracles in his new one. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"174165"	"I"	"was"	" When Bis asked me to do Beethoven, I was, 'Why, why?' he said in his idiomatic English. There are probably more than 100 cycles already recorded. Usually I do my decisions very quickly, but that took more than three weeks to think about. I needed many conversations. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
