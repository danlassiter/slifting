VERDI-PLACIDO-DOMINGO (Undated) _ Critic's Notebook: Sometimes it seems that the inexhaustible tenor Placido Domingo is trying to fortify his place in the operatic pantheon simply by doing more than anyone else ever has. So, you might assume that what motivated Domingo's newest recording, ``Verdi/Domingo: The Tenor Arias,'' a four-CD set of the complete Verdi arias for tenor was his desire to set yet another record. But the project is far more than a feat. Domingo has devoted, he estimates, some 40 percent of his professional work to Verdi. By Anthony Tommasini.

ATTACK-MILITARY (Washington) _ Military developments in the Afghanistan war. By Thom Shanker and Eric Schmitt.  PAKISTAN-TERRORISTS (Islamabad, Pakistan) _ The government of Gen. Pervez Musharraf is pushing ahead with its promised crackdown on violent Islamic groups, detaining 1,430 people around the country in recent days and sealing 390 offices of militant organizations, a senior police official said Monday evening. Most of the detentions have occurred since Saturday, when Musharraf, in a televised speech, pledged to Pakistan and the world that he would purge the society of spreading extremism and prevent Pakistan from being used as a base for international terrorism. And for the first time in the current crackdown, police were to begin rounding up militants inside the Pakistan-controlled portion of Kashmir. The targets there will be members of two newly banned groups that have openly recruited fighters and money in Pakistan to wage guerrilla war in the Indian-held part of Kashmir. By Erik Eckholm and Celia W. Dugger.  With a graphic.  MIDEAST (Tulkarm, West Bank) _ Children here wear pictures of Raed al-Karmi on cords around their necks; grown men sing a song praising him as ``the promise.'' On Monday, the strained cease-fire between Israelis and Palestinians appeared to be giving way after Karmi, the charismatic, 27-year-old leader of a local Palestinian militia, was killed by a bomb hidden beside a cemetery wall near his house. Karmi's comrades called his killing an Israeli assassination and a provocation to violence. The Israeli army remained silent about the matter, in keeping with its practice after many mysterious deaths of Palestinian militants. Within hours, Karmi's group struck. Gunmen opened fire a few miles from here on an Israeli car in the West Bank, killing one Israeli and wounding another. By James Bennet.  NATIONAL GENERAL  (Will move in ``a'' news file.)  NJ-POLICE (Trenton, N.J.) _ Nearly four years after they shot three unarmed minority men during a traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike, making racial profiling a national issue, two former New Jersey state troopers were allowed to plead guilty to misdemeanor charges Monday and were spared either jail time or probation.

His replacement will be Steve Spurrier, fresh from resigning from Florida; Spurrier's salary will be $5 million a year, more than any other head coach in the NFL. The Redskin upheaval took place as speculation increased that Tampa Bay is about to dismiss Tony Dungy and hire Bill Parcells. NFL teams are acting quickly in the postseason to dismiss coaches, some of whom had miserable records, and some of whom didn't. In some ways, this is nothing new for the NFL, but in other ways, something different does seem to be going on, where new owners seem to pushing for quick changes when things don't go the way they like.

To their astonishment, scientists at Harvard Medical School recently discovered that in mice, the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas can regenerate.

But in England, the police are pursuing a different path: they want to use facial recognition software to identify crime victims. Using software developed by a Canadian company, Britain's National Crime Squad is creating a database of nearly 3 million pictures seized in raids of child pornography rings. By matching the images against pictures of missing and kidnapped children, investigators hope to find them, or at least generate clues that can help identify the pedophiles making the photos and films.

CULTURE AND ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' code)  VERDI-PLACIDO-DOMINGO (Undated) _ Critic's Notebook: Sometimes it seems that the inexhaustible tenor Placido Domingo is trying to fortify his place in the operatic pantheon simply by doing more than anyone else ever has. So, you might assume that what motivated Domingo's newest recording, ``Verdi/Domingo: The Tenor Arias,'' a four-CD set of the complete Verdi arias for tenor was his desire to set yet another record. But the project is far more than a feat. Domingo has devoted, he estimates, some 40 percent of his professional work to Verdi. By Anthony Tommasini.  SUNDANCE-FILM-FEST (Undated) _ The Park City, Utah, Film Festival is a strange animal this year. The combination of several factors has distorted feelings about the occasion, among them a major anniversary for an event that has visibly altered the shape of film making and the residue of the slumping economy.

LA-SCALA-BALLET (Paris) _ La Scala Ballet has brought ``Excelsior'' to the Palais Garnier, a ballet first performed to the sunny optimism of the late 19th century, when Science was conquering Backwardness for the sake of Humanity and Western nations were celebrating a relatively peaceful European century around the flag of Progress. But times are different. Today, a ballet that confidently portrays Light defeating Obscurantism can at most stir nostalgia for a paradise lost. By Alan Riding.  JAPAN-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ James L.

He also gets royalties from a comic book, ``My New Fighting Technique Is Unstoppable,'' which he published in January. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"115780"	"he"	"estimates"	" Harcourt's description of himself as a novice songwriter, however, is a bit misleading. The new album may be his full-length debut, but Harcourt has written, he estimates, 300 to 400 songs. ``Not as much as the Guided By Voices guy,'' he points out. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"118427"	"she"	"estimates"	" Yusuf's situation is hardly unique in his class. About half of teacher Nikki Faria's kids, she estimates, don't have their biological father in the picture. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"119523"	"he"	"estimates"	" ``It gets better every time you ride it,'' said Joe, who lives in Staten Island. That means it must be pretty good, because, he estimates, he has taken at least 150 trips. ``Every time you go down the first drop, you feel your stomach go into your throat.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"119914"	"he"	"estimates"	" Aronowitz drives himself to campaign gatherings around the state in his 1995 Volvo. He sleeps in the homes of supporters and keeps within his allotted daily campaign travel budget of $50 a day. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who is running without the support of most of the party establishment, has raised millions so far for his campaign. Aronowitz, who has never run for public office, has raised $25,000. The Green Party has no budget for television advertising or to hire campaign workers. The whole campaign, he estimates, will cost about $150,000. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"124781"	"he"	"estimates"	" Then came the warning: Get away from the building! He was helped out through the window, stumbled 15 or 20 yards, and was handed an oxygen mask. Minutes later _ as few as three, he estimates, no more than five _ the entire front of the impact site collapsed. All of it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"131572"	"she"	"estimates"	" Like many people here, Pettway, the mother of seven, barely gets by, living, she estimates, on about $5,000 a year. The art world may herald her ``austere masterpieces,'' as one museum curator put it, but she romanticizes the quilts not a wit. They were hard work, akin to chopping wood, hauling water and making laundry starch from scratch out of boiling water, flour and ``a little kerosene to make the clothes slip.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"131887"	"she"	"estimates"	" Normally, such a sight would not be noteworthy, much less newsworthy, because Jones, the energetic television personality best known as a co-host of the estrogen-laced ABC gabfest ``The View,'' is almost always surrounded by shoes. At home and at work, she has 550 pairs, she estimates, from ``$2.99 flip-flops to $1,500 sandals'' festooned with crystals. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"139747"	"he"	"estimates"	" One late afternoon in the lines of Wal-Mart, Fram spotted a couple of men waiting their turn, a little dressed up for discount shopping. Their suits were slick and, he estimates, worth at least $600. And they were load- ing up on paper towels, he says. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"142754"	"he"	"estimates"	" Barnwell estimates two bushels of apples could be picked off one Pink Lady tree and in the export market, a bushel would bring $20 to $24 each. The apple loss from one tree, he estimates, would be $40 to $50. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"145772"	"she"	"estimates"	" Between Sept. 19 and Oct. 4, she estimates, 213 objects flew back in 20 shipments. Each one had to be accompanied by a curator, registrar or conservator. Anything over 63 inches tall had to go in cargo jets, she said. Only small works could be transported on commercial airlines, and these, too, had to be accompanied by a courier. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"146613"	"he"	"estimates"	" Ribeau's new roadster will be finished, he estimates, sometime after the New Year. He figures he has about $30,000 invested in the car, even though all he has are the body, engine, frame, rear end and wheels. Paint and upholstery will add another $10,000 or more. He will drive the new car for a while, he said, and then sell it for a price he expects to be upward of $60,000. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"148703"	"she"	"estimates"	" Nine out of 10 times, she estimates, the people coming through her door are pet owners giving their animals up. Kirkpatrick can guess their reasons: The're moving; the dog doesn't get along with the other pets; the cat won't use the litter box; the puppy got a lot bigger than they thought it would. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"152576"	"he"	"estimates"	" Ameritrade's share of online trading by individual investors has fallen to 20.8 percent as of the first quarter, he estimates, down from 27.9 percent four years ago. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"

"156394"	"it"	"estimates"	" The company also sells music CDs and, beginning last month, customized stamps through a partnership with the online postage service Stamps.com. In all, it estimates, online consumers can choose from more than 8 million designs -- logos, slogans, cartoons, photos and the like -- to emblazon on shirts, mugs, posters and mousepads. You can't find that kind of variety in a Wal-Mart store, it contends. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"

"164122"	"he"	"estimates"	" He reviews how deregulation, the implosion of American manufacturing, the rising cost of oil imports, and substantial tax cuts have contributed to skyrocketing debt levels and trade deficits, and how the country's net international indebtedness has soared, he estimates, into the $4 trillion range. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"168998"	"he"	"estimates"	" Evans also conducted a controlled burn to clear underbrush. The fire killed some coneflowers, but the calculated gamble paid off. There were just 30 or so coneflowers when he started; now, he estimates, there are 400 to 700. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"
