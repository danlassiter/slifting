"23622"	"I"	"understand"	" We have been allowed to see more high-priced lawyers per square meter in the O.J. fiasco than in all the ``Matlock'' episodes ever filmed.

"24119"	"I"	"understand"	" The trustees in whose care Barnes places the museum and his collection after his death were under orders to keep it closed to the public. But with the building and some of the paintings in need of expensive upkeep, and with money running low, the trustees went to court and received a one-time-only order allowing them to remove a representative group of paintings and put them on a world tour to raise money for the foundation. The tour was an enormous success and, I understand, will ensure the safety of the collection for the foreseeable future. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

"28555"	"I"	"understand"	" The captain and master of the American Queen, John Davitt, gave what was billed as ``The Master's Navigational Seminar.'' Much more interesting than it sounds. Davitt is only 36 (very young, I understand, for a steamboat captain) but does he know this river! </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"29946"	"you"	"understand"	" I say this with all due respect, you understand, and with a dawning realization that, on the degree-of-difficulty chart, playing offensive line in the NFL may rate right up there with finding a cure for the common cold. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"29963"	"you"	"understand"	" Newton, you understand, is concerned about the sanctity of the game, although he doesn't minimize the safety of the quarterback he's expected to protect. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"33315"	"we"	"understand"	" When the Celtics players took a straw poll the first time around on whether to stay with the NBA union or opt for decertification, the vast majority, we understand, chose decertification, with Dominique (The Greek) Wilkins leading the charge. Wonder how the local lads voted this time, when it was for real. Is there any way we can get the local Greek ambassador to help us get rid of about a half-dozen more of these guys to join 'Nique and Xavier McDaniel in Greece? </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"33422"	"I"	"understand"	" ``Bill, I understand, made a speech after we made our presentation,'' said Shover, who is director of public affairs for Phoenix Newspapers Inc., publishers of ``The Arizona Republic'' and ``The Phoenix Gazette.''

"34342"	"you"	"understand"	" Kotite, you understand, was a master architect of 4-0 starts, the Mr.September of the clipboard-and-whistle set. In his four years as Philadelphia's coach, his overall record for the first four games of a season was 14-2. He made the playoffs only once in those years. True, Randall Cunningham was hurt two of those seasons, but in the other two, Kotite lost faith in his franchise quarterback and benched him. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"36451"	"I"	"understand"	" His own promise was not to be fulfilled. He left the employ of our company and, I understand, began to drift. The woman we found so sweet could take no more; she asked him to move out. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"

"39611"	"you"	"understand"	" But it was only after ``Clueless,'' he says, that audiences actually became aware of him. In that film _ a droll comedy about teen-agers in Beverly Hills _ he plays an abrasive lawyer who is hilariously overprotective of his spoiled daughter. (``Let me tell you something,'' he barks at a frightened boy about to take his daughter on a date. ``If anything happens to my daughter, you understand, I have a .45 and a shovel. And I'm sure nobody's gonna miss you.'') </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"
"41480"	"you"	"understand"	" Patterson, Carter and Co. say that in response to the efforts of local governments to restrict handguns within their jurisdictions, the Legislature will rewrite the concealed-weapon law at the earliest opportunity. They will rewrite the law not to meet the concerns of local officials and citizens, you understand, but to strip local governments of their right to ban guns on public property. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
"43071"	"you"	"understand"	" Now he is left with the matter of Medicaid. If he surrenders on the need and right of poor people _ just plain poor, you understand, not immigrants, welfare recipients or other such miserable specimens of humanity _ he will have jettisoned not just the poor but his own political honor. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
"44681"	"they"	"understand"	" Her more easygoing friends sometimes wonder how Hillary could be so close to Susan Thomases, a tough-talking, take-no-prisoners New York litigator. The short answer, they understand, is that Thomases would do ``anything'' for Hillary. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"

"46557"	"they"	"understand"	" Yet even as the Steelers are disguising their blitzes and coverages to play with Aikman's head, it is his body they will be after. His and that of Smith, the marvelous running back Pittsburgh knows it must stop to have a chance to win. To do that, they understand, will not be a mental issue. It will be physical, confrontational and, quite likely, hostile. In other words, Steelers football. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"

Their base last year was about 11,000, and the FleetCenter had another 3,500 seats per night available through luxury boxes and preferred seating. The Celtics will drop to 10,000 in their season ticket base but hope to make it up by attracting new customers with their ad campaign and by lowering prices on some balcony seats.

Plenty of real-life Tracey Flicks win Academy Awards _ but not, you understand, for playing Tracey Flicks. Too broad. Too stylized. Too cynically conceived. Oscars go to movies that touch, ennoble and inspire.

My God, as I read this material it was just the most thrilling thing. And then I'd talk to people like the widow of Sen.

"170539"	"you"	"understand"	" Another well known teacher, Christopher Bayes, and several other clowns noted that more graduate acting programs were offering classes in clowning and physical theater than they did just a few years ago. We have been ensconced in a playwright-centered form for so long that I think it can be refreshing to find the actor at the creative center once again, said Bayes, who has taught at Yale, New York University, Julliard and Brown. Many actors out there have been inspired by the work and the possibility of actor-created theater. For the audience the appeal stems from the vulnerability of the actor. Despite the humor and goofy outfits, the actual performance is often moving, even sad. When you look at the clown, you understand, Bayes said. He's like a skinless grape. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
