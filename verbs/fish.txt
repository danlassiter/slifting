"98026"	"I"	"fish"	" On my trips to the Grant, I fish, hunt grouse or deer or just muck about. My plan this year was to put in my canoe just below Hellgate Gorge and explore the upper portion of the river from the gorge downstream about five miles. That exploration would include fly-fishing all of the likely-looking trout water I found along the way. The Dead Diamond and its lower-end tributary, the Swift Diamond, are two of the few remaining sizable streams in New Hampshire where one may find truly wild brook trout, fish with no hatcheries in their ancestry. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
