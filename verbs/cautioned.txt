"4443"	"he"	"cautioned"	" Part of the problem, said Steve Wagner, vice president of Luntz Research Co., a Republican polling and consulting firm, is that ``the public no longer sees gun control as a serious crime-control measure.'' He acknowledged polls that show voters favoring the ban on assault weapons. But, he cautioned, ``Even in places where the ban enjoys a presumptive popularity, people don't think it will help,'' mainly because guns are already so plentiful. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199409.gz"

BOMB-SURVIVORS-$ADV03 (Seattle) _ It was hot and sunny, and Tonoyo Mary Fujita was looking for a seat on the streetcar. Then it was dark, and buildings were burning, and people were running. Some wore only the seams and waistbands of their clothes, which flapped as they ran. The fabric had burned away. ``I thought maybe I died and went to a different world,'' she recalls. Fujita, Rikuko Tanaka and Yoshimi Chinen are among the hundreds of people who survived the atomic bomb in Hiroshima 50 years ago and now make their home in America. They are telling the story of the worst day of their lives because they want everyone to understand that this must not happen again.  By Tina Kelley. (Story will move in the ``a'' category, for use Thursday, Aug. 3, and thereafter.)  BOMB-NEWERA-$ADV03 (Washington) _ Fifty years ago this week, when the Enola Gay dropped a single atomic warhead on Hiroshima, it not only propelled Japan toward surrender in World War II, but sent the United States on a course of unprecedented world dominance. The attack was the ultimate symbol of America's arrival as a superpower willing to work its will by force or the threat of force _ a role it continued to play in the Cold War against Moscow. How times have changed.  By Christopher Hanson. (Story will move in the ``w'' category for use Thursday, Aug. 3, and thereafter.)  BOMB-LEGACY-$ADV03 (Washington) _ The development of the atomic bomb and its use at Hiroshima and Nagasaki to end World War II was widely seen at the time as a triumph of science, with little thought given to the dangerous side effects of nuclear weapons production. But today those side effects loom as one of the bitterest legacies of the Manhattan Project.  By Christopher Hanson. (Story will move in the ``w'' category for use Thursday, Aug. 3, and thereafter.)  BOMB-VET-$ADV03 (Seattle) _ Fifty years after heroism off Okinawa earned him a Medal of Honor, Dick McCool has been reading how some historians now believe that America need not have used the atomic bomb to force the surrender of Japan. McCool, 72, isn't buying it.  By Joel Connelly. (Story will move in the ``a'' category for use Thursday, Aug. 3, and thereafter.)  BOOKS-BIGFOOT (Undated) _ He was warned, oh Robert Michael Pyle was warned. Friends and loved ones tried to dissuade the Grays River, Wash., writer from doing a book on Bigfoot. The subject was fraught with danger, they cautioned, and not just danger of the hairy primate kind. Pyle listened, but was not persuaded.  By John Marshall. (Story will move in the ``e'' category.)  CDROM-MAPS (Undated) _ Cast off those tour books! Forget about those unwieldy maps! The CD-ROM is here to change your life! Well, it hasn't come to that. Not yet, anyway. But increasingly, Americans are turning to CD-ROMs, those silvery, data-laden discs, to prepare for vacations, weekend trips and even for getting around town.  By David Lyman.

BBO-LABOR (New York) _ Baseball's players and management bargained through the night on Thursday, and late on Friday morning they agreed on a new, four-year labor agreement that will enable the 2002 season to proceed to its conclusion. The agreement was reached just in time to prevent any of Friday's games from being postponed, and it marked the first time in decades that the two sides were able to arrange a new labor pact without first going through a work stoppage.

GLF-MASTERS-WOMEN (Undated) _ In a stunning rebuke to demands that it quickly add female members, the Augusta National Club decreed on Friday that the 2003 Masters golf tournament will be shown commercial-free to shield sponsors from any pressure. By Richard Sandomir.  WTO-U.S.-TRADE (Washington) _ The World Trade Organization, using its authority to settle international trade disputes, ruled Friday that Europe can impose $4 billion in penalties on the United States because an American tax break to promote exports is illegal. The verdict is the biggest penalty ever handed down against a country since the Geneva-based trade organization came into being in 1995. But the ruling is probably less important for the actual money involved than for the diplomatic and political repercussions. European leaders have made it clear they will give the United States time to change its law, but trade experts said the Europeans will now have what amounts to a Damoclean sword they can hold over the United States in a wide range of other trade negotiations.

JAPAN-NKOREA (Tokyo) _ Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, announced Friday that he will meet North Korea's leader in Pyongyang in September, a surprise move that may help ease strong regional tensions and could speed progress toward better relations between North Korea the United States. Japan and both North and South Korea have a bitter history, which includes Japanese colonial rule in the first half of the 20th century and continuing discrimination against Koreans within Japan. North and South Korea, meanwhile, announced an agreement to reconnect their road and rail links, which are currently severed at the most fortified frontier in the world. By James Brooke.

CITIES-WELFARE (New York) _ During the boom years of the late 1990s, when the 1996 welfare law was still sending public assistance rolls plummeting nationwide and more recipients were leaving for jobs than anyone had expected, critics of the law had one big warning: wait until the economy sours, they cautioned, the poor will come back. But despite the economic downturn, it has not happened in New York City, which has the largest number of public assistance cases of any city in the nation. Nor has it happened in many other large urban areas. By Leslie Kaufman.  9-11-CLASSROOMS (Undated) _ The anniversary of Sept. 11, which many educators thought would be the ultimate teachable moment, has become the latest skirmish in the classroom culture war. Districts like New York and a host of national organizations are putting out a curriculum that encourages teachers to avoid direct discussion of the attacks, but to talk about tolerance and hope. Critics, largely conservatives, say this is moral relativism and psychobabble, and are putting out alternatives that argues for teaching how, for instance, President Bush was strong and decisive after Sept. 11, and encouraging teachers to use President Reagan's speech to the nation following the 1987 shuttle disaster.
