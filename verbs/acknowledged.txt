"19872"	"we"	"acknowledged"	" We considered the timeliness of a review petition where there is a motion to reconsider or reopen an agency's order in ICC v. Locomotive Engineers, 482 U. S. 270 (1987). The Interstate Commerce Commission's governing statute provided that, with certain exceptions, judicial review of ICC orders would be governed by the Hobbs Act, 28 U. S. C. s2341 et seq. See Locomotive Engineers, 482 U. S., at 277. We held that ``the timely petition for administrative reconsideration stayed the running of the Hobbs Act's limitation period until the petition had been acted upon by the Commission.'' Id., at 284. Our conclusion, we acknowledged, was in some tension with the language of both the Hobbs Act, which permits an aggrieved party to petition for review ``within 60 days after (the) entry'' of a final order, 28 U. S. C. s2344, and of 49 U. S. C. s10327(i), ``which provides that, `(n)otwithstanding' the provision authorizing the Commission to reopen and reconsider its orders (s10327(g)), `an action of the Commission . . . is final on the date on which it is served, and a civil action to enforce, enjoin, suspend, or set aside the action may be filed after that date.''' Locomotive Engineers, 482 U. S., at 284. We found the controlling language similar to the corresponding provision of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. s704, which provides that ``agency action otherwise final is final for the purposes of this section (entitled `Actions Reviewable') whether or not there has been presented or determined an application for . . . any form of reconsideratio(n)'' ``language (that) has long been construed . . . merely to relieve parties from the requirement of petitioning for rehearing before seeking judicial review . . . but not to prevent petitions for reconsideration that are actually filed from rendering the orders under reconsideration nonfinal.'' Locomotive Engineers, supra, at 284-285.In support of that longstanding construction of the APA language, we cited dicta in two earlier cases, American Farm Lines v. Black Ball Freight Service, 397 U. S. 532, 541 (1970); CAB v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 367 U. S. 316, 326-327 (1961), and the holding in Outland v. CAB, 284 F. 2d 224, 227 (CADC 1960), a decision cited with approval in both Black Ball and Delta. Outland justified treating orders as nonfinal for purposes of review during the pendency of a motion for reconsideration in terms of judicial economy: ``(W)hen the party elects to seek a rehearing there is always the possibility that the order complained of will be modified in a way which renders judicial review unnecessary.'' Outland, supra, at 227. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"

Then along came the Boston Red Sox. By winning their first World Series in 86 years, the Red Sox did more than just reward their long-suffering fans; they set up what could be the closest four-network ratings race of all time.  While Fox's overall ratings this new season are down about 6 percent from last year, the network has moved into first place among viewers between the ages of 18 and 49, which all the networks other than CBS define as the only competition that counts.  Now, Fox needs to maintain that momentum. And it plans to compete with an onslaught of reality programming never seen before in network television.  Beginning this week, Fox is unveiling a schedule that no scriptwriter could love. Although the drama The O.C. and comedies like Arrested Development and The Simpsons are returning, nine of the network's weekly 15 hours of programming -- 60 percent of its total schedule -- will be reality shows.  This Wednesday, a ferocious nanny will begin teaching a family how to behave, in Nanny 911. My Big Fat Obnoxious Boss, a spoof of NBC's The Apprentice in which a fake boss makes a group of contestants all but grovel for his approval, makes its debut Tuesday. And beginning on Nov. 9, the British entrepreneur Richard Branson will try to teach a group of young people how to risk life and limb to become wealthy in The Rebel Billionaire.  Fox is banking on reality to hold the ratings fort until January. That is when some new scripted series and returning shows like 24 -- along with the network's reality life preserver, American Idol -- go on the air.  The strategy is a risky one. Reality shows tend to be less attractive to advertisers, and by introducing so many reality series, the network might kill off a genre that has all but saved network television over the last five years.  It's flying in the face of what is happening elsewhere, said Steve Sternberg, senior vice president of the media buying company Magna Global USA, referring to the failure of several new reality shows (like The Next Great Champ) and the success of new dramas (like Desperate Housewives).  But Fox, which announced its intention last spring to reconstruct the whole nature of the television season, is simply playing its own game.  I don't even know what's normal anymore, said Preston Beckman, executive vice president of program planning for Fox.  Fox has been among the most aggressive networks in moving away from the classic September-May television season, staggering the premieres of shows so it can run original programming throughout the year. That approach allows broadcast networks to avoid repeats, which have a tendency to send viewers to the original programming playing on cable channels.  In addition, the baseball playoffs have put Fox at a disadvantage in starting new shows in September, because it must then pre-empt episodes through much of October.  Beckman said Fox decided this year it needed to take a different approach coming out of baseball.  That meant not trying to start up a batch of new series, some clearly aimed at women, as it did last year with dramas like the ill-fated Skin. Instead, Fox larded its baseball coverage with promotions for man-friendly reality fare like the Branson series (a combination of The Apprentice, Amazing Race and Fear Factor) and especially Obnoxious Boss in an attempt to create a kind of obnoxious franchise.  Last year, Fox scored with an obnoxious fiance; this year an actor playing an ersatz business mogul systematically humiliates some hapless contestants, all in good fun. Fox, viewing the show as a comedy, has placed it on Sunday at 9 p.m., after four sitcoms.  That night is one of the few where Fox has any concentration of scripted series. The only other night where two hours of scripted shows run back to back is Thursday, where Fox has placed its most promising series, The O.C., putting it up against CBS's Survivor and NBC's Joey in the hopes it can finally reap some of the lucrative ad money spent on Thursday night by movie companies and car dealers.  I'm feeling optimistic that we may finally get a toehold on the most important night of the week, Beckman said.  Monday, meanwhile, has two reality hours, Trading Spouses, the wife-swapping experiment, and The Swan, the beauty contest for post-cosmetic-surgery ugly ducklings. Wednesday has Nanny 911. Friday has two half-hour video-clip shows, followed by Renovate My Family, a makeover show for entire family units. And Saturdays have the hoary Fox reality duo, Cops and America's Most Wanted.  Part of the rationale for this heavy dose of reality is boldness: Beckman noted that Fox was trying to deconstruct the traditional television season. Another part, he acknowledged, is pure necessity. Fox saw one returning scripted show, Bernie Mac, put on hiatus.  But some critics and industry executives suggest another explanation: Fox is all but bereft of strong scripted series.  They don't have the scripted guns anymore, said Stacey Lynn Koerner, executive vice president of Initiative Media. They had 'Ally McBeal,' they had 'X-Files.' Those shows don't exist anymore.  Fox has a few newer scripted shows like the comedy Quintuplets, and the soap North Shore. But Sternberg said that neither of these elicited much more than a tepid response in tryouts earlier. In addition, several long-running Fox shows, like Malcolm in the Middle, King of the Hill and That 70's Show are showing signs of wear.  In some other publication, I accused Fox of creative bankruptcy, said Jon Mandel, the chairman of MediaCom US, the media service division of Grey Global. Although he said that Beckman had disputed that characterization, he said two of Fox's new reality series, Trading Spouses and Nanny 911 are copies of ABC shows.  Mandel added, I think I stand by my line about creative bankruptcy.  The other potential downside to a reality-centric schedule is that it almost surely can not make as much money as a schedule skewed toward scripted series, said Mandel, whose MediaCom clients include such big television advertisers as Procter &amp; Gamble, Mars Inc. and BellSouth.  In general, advertisers are still more reluctant to back reality shows, Mandel said, or at least certain reality shows. 'American Idol' is OK for any advertiser, he said. It's when you get to the schlocky stuff, like 'The Swan' and 'Obnoxious Boss' that it becomes a problem for some advertisers.  The style of Fox reality, he said, tends to have a negativity that unfortunately a lot of people don't find very entertaining.  Although the idea of a cohesive schedule may be a relic, Mandel added: I think there will be such a thing as a cohesive brand. With CBS, for example, you pretty much know what you're going to get. With Fox, you don't really know. I wonder if those negative, put-down reality shows don't affect the traditional scripted shows.  When you do a great show like 'Arrested Development,' it can't get arrested, he said. Maybe it's because nobody expected it on Fox.  Koerner, however, praised the network. I applaud them for sticking by what they said they were going to do, she said. They have rolled out their schedule just as they said they would.  And Sternberg, pointing to previous midseason successes like The Simpsons and Malcolm in the Middle, said that Fox should never be counted out.  They have a long history of being able to come up with new hits when they really need them, Sternberg said. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20041031.0144 type=story > <HEADLINE> NUMBERS SHOW A TIGHT RACE </HEADLINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz

, he allowed,	 An impassioned army of activists, thinkers, fund-raisers, and candidates flocked to Goldwater's standard. The party's center of power began to shift from the Northeast to the West and the South. Four years later Nixon was in the White House. Sixteen years later Reagan, Goldwater's ideological heir, swept to victory. And 30 years later, the Republicans, led by Newt Gingrich, their teddy-bear Robespierre, took control of both houses of Congress for the first time since 1954. Today, of course, conservatives control the Republican Party, and the Republican Party controls all three branches of the federal government and the majority of statehouses. The funny thing is, Goldwater lost -- and badly -- in 1964. In one of the most lopsided presidential contests in American history, Johnson won 486 electoral votes to Goldwater's 52. As Rick Perlstein recounts in Before the Storm (2001), his well-regarded history of the Goldwater campaign, the conservatives were seen as finished, and the Republican Party doomed to further electoral futility. (Goldwater) has wrecked his party for a long time to come, declared The New York Times' James Scotty Reston, and is not even likely to control the wreckage. So are there lessons to be learned from 1964? Although nobody is predicting a landslide this time around, one thing is certain: On Tuesday night (provided the whole electoral process doesn't collapse in a tangle of lawsuits) either George W. Bush or John Kerry will win, and his opponent will lose. And, perhaps inspired by Goldwater's ghost, a few commentators have suggested that it might be the losing party that looks back more fondly on this election. In the current issue of The American Conservative, executive editor Scott McConnell endorses John Kerry out of the belief that a Bush defeat would allow traditional conservatives to wrest control of the Republican Party from their neocon step-siblings and then in 2008 knock off a Kerry still reeling from Bush's legacy of deficits and an unruly Iraq. Back in July, John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge, reporters for The Economist and coauthors of the recently published The Right Nation: Conservative Power in America (Penguin Press), made a similar point in an op-ed in The Los Angeles Times. Ditto for historian Niall Ferguson, who penned an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal in August titled Republicans for Kerry. From the other side of the aisle, Rick Perlstein, in an article in the Boston Review, argued that however imperative a Bush defeat was this year the Democratic Party urgently needed to extend its mental horizon to, say, the 2018 midterms. Losing now, he allowed, might be the price f To skeptics, this may seem nothing more than preemptive Pollyanna-ism. The idea that defeat is the crucible of future victory is a hoary sports cliche. But is it also a helpful -- or even an appropriate -- way to look at the evolution and mutation of American political parties? </P> 	nyt_eng_200411.gz
, he believes,	 . . It's not surprising that Micklethwait and Wooldridge and Ferguson, all Brits, see virtue in the well-timed loss. Recent British history provides the clearest example of a poisoned electoral victory. The 1992 election, by nearly all accounts, was one the Conservative Party deserved to lose. Prime Minister John Major was deeply unpopular, and it was only because Neil Kinnock, the Labour Party challenger, was even less impressive that the Tories squeaked by with a surprise victory. Their reward was a humiliating five years plagued by sexual and financial scandals and a deep recession resulting from an earlier decision to put Britain on the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. It was ample fodder for Tony Blair and New Labour, who swept Major's party from office in a 1997 landslide and look to stay in power for some time to come. If Kinnock's inexperienced Labour Party had inherited the exchange-rate recession, Wooldridge said in a recent interview, it would have been the end of the Labour Party for a generation There are, the thinking goes, a few ways that a party can end up grateful for a loss. The first is simply by getting out of the way of unpleasant events. The Democrats are probably damned glad that Al Smith lost in 1928 because otherwise they would have been saddled with the Great Depression, says Philip Klinkner, associate professor of government at Hamilton College and the author of The Losing Parties, a look at how party national committees react to electoral losses. The Democrats, by this logic, were ill-served by Jimmy Carter's being in office for the Iran hostage crisis and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and a President Kerry might have reason to regret being left holding the bag on Iraq. A loss can be galvanizing, as well, especially if there are grounds to cry foul. In 1824 Andrew Jackson handily won the popular vote but failed to win a majority in the Electoral College. He was denied the presidency when Henry Clay, the fourth-place finisher, threw his support behind John Quincy Adams, who had come in second. Adams won, appointed Clay Secretary of State, and four years later the still-seething anger of Jackson's supporters over what they denounced as the corrupt bargain helped Old Hickory trounce Quincy Adams. Princeton history professor Sean Wilentz believes the 2000 election might end up working in a similar way. If you want to talk about a party learning a lot from a loss, he says, that's a really good example. As he sees it, the 2000 defeat did three things for the Democrats: It stirred up fears of disenfranchisement among black voters, spurring them to vote in what are predicted to be higher numbers this year; it weakened the Naderite left; and it catalyzed the rise of extra-party groups like Moveon.org -- all of which may end up making a crucial difference on Tuesday. Meanwhile, serving as the loyal opposition, some argue, can occasion necessary self-examination. When a party holds power for too long, says Wooldridge, it grows fat and happy, (and) it also grows corrupt. The classic example, he believes, is the Democratic Party of the 1970s and '80s, which, spoiled by generations of congressional power, became a party of insiders and deal makers without any sense of the principles they stood for, and eventually collapsed when they were turned out in 1994. The more common explanation for the 1994 Republican Revolution, though, is that liberal Democratic ideals -- or at least the way they were presented -- no longer resonated with the majority of Americans. According to Ruy Teixeira, a fellow at the Center for American Progress and at the Century Foundation, the danger for the dominant party isn't ideological bankruptcy but ideological drift. Certainly you can make the argument that, if a party's far enough away from the mainstream, if they don't lose they don't get enough impetus to correct their behavior, he says. The hunger that comes with time spent in the wilderness can also spur ideological innovation. Kenneth Baer, a former speechwriter for Al Gore and author of Reinventing Democrats: The Politics of Liberalism from Reagan to Clinton (2000), paraphrases Samuel Johnson on the concentrating power of the hangman's noose: Nothing clarifies a party's focus on their political agenda, their message and the political direction they're going in like defeat. Fred Siegel, a history professor at Cooper Union, cites the example of the Republican adoption, in the early 1990s, of the mantle of an electoral reform party. Of course, he adds, the reforms they focused on -- like term limits -- were half-baked, but there was this sense of invention. They weren't in control, so they were willing to roll the dice. The Democrats, he predicts, could go a similar good-government route should Kerry lose, targeting the Electoral College and congressional gerrymandering. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"

"153500"	"he"	"acknowledged"	" True, he acknowledged, roughly one-fifth of children wound up with severe mental retardation, but it was difficult to predict which ones.

"154846"	"she"	"acknowledged"	" Her study, she acknowledged, could not track the most-touted benefit of over-the-counter access, which is that there may be an advantage in terms of time: Women may be able to access the method more quickly, which would make it more effective. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"

"160436"	"she"	"acknowledged"	" But another reason, she acknowledged, was because she is an ovarian cancer survivor. Urban was diagnosed in 1971, when she was 24 years old. It was a less-aggressive form that was caught in time. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"160467"	"he"	"acknowledged"	" Lee Crum, a commercial photographer who has been vacationing in Seaside for more than 20 years, said that he could not believe prices would continue to increase.

"162553"	"she"	"acknowledged"	" The main problem of preserving Roe intact, is that the feminist movement, with its emphasis on women's rights and self-determination, is a generation away from mine, and nearly another generation away from that, the time factor, yet again. The women of Malveaux's generation are tired of the struggle, she acknowledged, a little weary of the fight, of the sell and re-sell routine to the young sisters on reproductive freedom. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"

"163569"	"he"	"acknowledged"	" But the next season brought the replacement of Friends with Joey, which Trump summed up as a disaster. It did not help, he acknowledged, that the third edition of The Apprentice, which concluded last spring, contained a cast full of marshmallows, a result, he said, of his not taking a stronger hand in casting. For the fourth go-round, last fall, and the fifth, starting Monday night, he said he had been extremely hands-on with casting. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"

But in March, Reyes failed to meet his parole officer and was sent to prison for three and a half months.
