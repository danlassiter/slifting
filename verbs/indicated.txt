Times News Service  ISRAEL BLASTS SYRIA OVER GUERRILLA SUPPORT  JERUSALEM (NYT) _ The Israeli government blasted Syria and Iran Tuesday for their support of the Party of God guerrillas in southern Lebanon who killed nine Israeli soldiers in the past week, but it appeared that Israel did not intend to launch a major retaliatory attack.  And even as Israel buried the six soldiers killed in Sunday's attack in emotional funerals around the country, there were questions whether the Israeli army still needed to maintain the costly buffer zone inside Lebanon that it established 10 years ago against Palestinian attacks.  ''The Cabinet condemns the government of Iran which directly aids the Hizbullah (Party of God) terrorists and denounces the government of Syria which, althouth it is capable of doing so, does not prevent but rather gives backing to the terrorist activity of this organization,'' the government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said in a statement issued after a special session.  c. 1995 N.Y. Times News Service  BIHAC, Bosnia Herzegovina (NYT) _ Now, after three years, the siege by Bosnian Serbs is broken, and the 50,000 people of Bihac, almost all Muslims, are no longer being shelled, and there is the expectation that life will improve quickly.  But, in a preview of what the rest of Bosnia might expect, life is likely to remain extremely difficult and replete with confusing changes for a long time.  In Bihac, one of Bosnia's major cities and the capital of the country's northwest, there is no industry, and almost no commerce. There is little electricity, no natural gas or mail service, scant running water. Only a handful of telephones can make calls outside the immediate area, and those calls, over terrible lines, are generally more frustrating than useful.  Aside from about one-third of the city's residents and the army, there are almost no jobs.  IRAQIS CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE  BAGHDAD (NYT) On Monday, about the time Saddam Hussein was celebrating his 99.96 rate of approval in Sunday's referendum on his presidency, 25-year-old Malek was loitering outside a hospital here, looking for a customer who would buy his kidney for a transplant.  The gaunt, bearded unemployed young man seemed oblivious to the enormous fanfare surrounding the official celebration with television, radio and the government-controlled media lavishing every imaginable praise over Saddam Hussein.  Malek's major preoccupation was an elusive Libyan client who needed a kidney transplant, put down a payment of $ 50, but failed to show up for the operation and the balance of the money: $ 500 for a healthy kidney. In the depressed Iraqi economy this is a small fortune.  ``At first my parents were opposed, but I have to support them and two brothers and a sister,'' Malek said as he sat at a teahouse near Al Kazem mosque in a shiite neighborhood of Baghdad. ``I have been out of work for two years. Now they see the necessity.''  Malek said he was laid off his job in a car parts shop when the business, like thousands of other samll service-related businesses in Iraq, collapsed as economic sanctions bit deeper into the Iraqi economy.  Next to him was a man identifying himself as Maher, the owner of the business, who said he had just abandoned his apartment to move into a one-star hotel with his family of five, after selling all the furniture in several installments during the past two years, as well as his business inventory ``for next to nothing.''  FRANCE RIPPED BY ANOTHER BOMB  PARIS (NYT) _ Terrorists believed linked to the struggle between Islamic fundamentalists and the military government in Algeria brought the war home to its former colonial masters in France again early Tuesday morning with a bomb that ripped open a commuter train, wounding 28 people, five of them seriously.  The bomb, made of a camping gas canister packed with heavy metal parts, was of the same design as seven others thought to have been planted by sympathizers of the Armed Islamic Group to demonstrate opposition to French ties with the military government in Algiers. The Algerian regime refused to recognize a victory by the Islamic Salvation Front in elections there four years ago.  As hundreds of police converged on the center of Paris a few hundred yards from where an identical bomb on an underground train killed seven people and wounded 86 in the first such attack July 25, Prime Minister Alain Juppe came to the scene and , after the injured were evacuated, addressed the French National Assembly:  ``Since the 25th of July, this is the eighth attack committed on our soil,'' he said. ``Our fellow citizens are taken hostage in their daily lives, on the way to work, in school, in the marketplaces.  ``France will not allow itself to be intimidated, will not flinch under pressure, and will not capitulate to barbarism,'' he said.  BRITAIN MAY PULL BACK ON CALL FOR IRA TO DISARM  DUBLIN (NYT) _ In an apparently significant shift in British policy, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, suggested clearly for the first time Tuesday that the Irish Republican Army might not have to actually disarm before its representatives were permitted to participate in a new round of talks on a peace settlement in the British province.  For months the peace effort has been stalled by British insistence that the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, could not enter formal talks until the IRA had begun to disarm. Sinn Fein has insisted that this is an unacceptable pre-condition, that they could not persuade the IRA military command to lay down, or destroy any arms before new talks.  But Tuesday, Sir Patrick, the highest British official in the North, reached formal agreement with the Irish government that the next step in the peace effort would be the establishment of a disarmament panel and the proposed start of bilateral talks involving the two governments and all the parties in the North, including Sinn Fein.  He seemed clearly to be proposing a compromise to the disarament dispute by saying that the disarmament agency might find a way for Sinn Fein and the IRA to give assurances that they are permanently committed to non-violence. Such assurances, he indicated, could result in a place for Sinn Fein at a negotiating table. He spoke sitting symbolically at a large, new, shiny rectanglar table in Stormont, the British administrative headquarters in Belfast, a table that officials said could one day be used for full-fledged talks . </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19951017.0413 type=story > <HEADLINE> FED'S MINEHAN SEES HIGHER GROWTH, `STABLE' INFLATION (UPDATE2) </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> North Andover, Massachusetts, Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) (BC-FED-MINEHAN-UPDATE2-BLOOM) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"

But the performance _ a mock negotiation by a venture capital firm and an entrepreneur that the law firm staged one recent workday _ held the attention of an audience of about 50 lawyers, venture capital managers and business executives.  As the play made clear, in the current economy the venture capitalists get the best parts.  The negotiation involved the future of Terrapin Technologies, a fictional business startup with promising financial software. Having nearly used up the $1 million raised in 2001 by the president and his co-founder and chief technology officer, Terrapin needed money to finish its product development and hire marketers.  So the entrepreneur, a character called the Founder, and his adviser, Wily Counsel, agreed to yield chunks of control and potential wealth to the managing general partner of the fictitious venture firm, the Capital Gang, and its lawyer, Crafty Counsel, in return for a $4 million investment.  During the negotiations, the Founder, played by Geoffrey W. Smith, managing director at the Ascent Group, a real venture capital firm, won a few concessions. But he went nowhere on some major issues, like the composition of the boardor a provision that would annually dilute the founders' holding by 5 percent.  The entrepreneurs were hardly in the strong negotiating position that entrepreneurs often found themselves in during the 1990s. ``I'm nostalgic for what used to be,'' said Joseph Bartlett, who played Wily Counsel and who in real life is a partner at Morrison &amp; Foerster.  It became clear that the Founder would be required to get rid of his co-founder. And, while the Capital Gang professed its great admiration for the Founder, Bartlett stepped out of character to explain that many founding entrepreneurs emerge from such negotiations on very shaky ground.  ``If you ask a VC what value they add, and you get them after a few drinks, they'll say, `We replace the CEO,''' he said. And that, he indicated, does not vary with the economic climate.  SOMETHING FUN: A TORTURE CHAMBER FOR SPAMMERS  The onslaught of spam has become a torture to millions of Internet users worldwide. Now the tables can be turned, at the Web site www.tortureaspammer.com.  The ``Torture a Spammer'' game enables disgruntled Internet users to retaliate from a menu of punishments that include a spam-alanche, boiling oil and virtual death by flying monkeys.  In the game, various emblems represent spammers: a blond in a red bikini (for pornography solicitations); a purple and white pill (``Viagro''); a man in a trenchcoat (spam-list salesmen); and a house with dollar bills (mortgage offers).  ``Torture a Spammer'' has attracted more than 14,000 players in its first two weeks, based almost entirely on word-of-mouse e-mailing (players are encouraged to e-mail their friends after they play the game). The most popular combination of target and weapon so far? Using the killer monkeys on the girl.  The game seems to be developing a following in Japan, where people are subject to cell phone spam as well as e-mail spam.  The torture game is presented by Marketing Sherpa, a marketing company in Portsmouth, R.I., that says it developed the game after becoming a victim of spam theft. Marketing Sherpa said that more than 10 million of its customers' e-mail addresses were stolen when the company that maintained its mailing list host, SparkLIST.com was sold to a rival company. Spam investigators hired by Marketing Sherpa said they found that a backup copy of e-mail addresses from March 2002 had been sold to spammers by disgruntled former SparkLIST employees.  ``It was absolutely mortifying to get e-mail from people telling us, `Your list must have been stolen,''' said Alexis D. Gutzman, a newsletter technology editor at Marketing Sherpa, which started hearing complaints about spam from customers in August.  ``We were livid,'' said Gutzman. ``We decided we should put up a game to torture a spammer because that's what we wanted to do right now.''  The company hired Cyber NY to create a multimedia torture experience, complete with sound effects. The monkeys screech, the man cackles, the girl moans. And the sounds themselves have received a lot attention. ``We have gotten so much e-mail about that girl and her funny noises,'' said Gutzman.  A DIGITAL VIDEO FORMAT IS CATCHING IN TELEVISION  The Sony 24P digital video format used in ``Star Wars: Episode II _ Attack of the Clones'' is catching on in TV production, too. Sony says more than a quarter of the prime-time comedies and dramas on the major broadcast and cable networks this season are being shot on 24P digital video. Many such shows have traditionally been shot with 35-millimeter motion picture cameras.  Twenty-six of the 97 prime-time comedies and dramas on ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, UPN and WB are using the digital video format _ largely because of time and cost savings.  ``The whole production work flow is expedited,'' said Laurence J. Thorpe, senior vice president for content creation at Sony Electronics. ``You're not loading film cartridges. You're not dealing with transfer of film, which is an overnight process.''  Among the new series this fall in the 24P format are ABC's ``8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter.'' Bruce Finn, director of photography for the show, said he experimented with a 24P camera last fall on ``One and One'' on UPN. ``I was very afraid of the medium because I thought it would compromise my art and craft,'' he said. ``But now I like it better.''  He calculated the weekly savings on the sitcom to be from $35,000 to $45,000, compared with the cost of 35 millimeter.  But some behind the lenses are concerned that art could be sacrificed to savings. George Spiro Dibie, national president of the International Cinematographers Guild, says that TV studios and production companies are too focused on the bottom line. ``We are the ones who keep the shows looking beautiful,'' he said. ``To them, it's strictly money.''  But TV cinematographers say they are adapting to 24P technology. ``At first, there were some tricky issues with lighting,'' Finn said. ``But with 24P, you're able to see what your final image will look like as you're shooting.''  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020929.0102 type=other > <HEADLINE> COLLEGE TOP 25 </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 09-29-02 17:59:00EDT (BC-FBC-RANKINGS-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> The New York Times's computer football ranking is based on an analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition.

"148713"	"he"	"indicated"	" Unless the critics have proof of wrongdoing, the lawsuit investigation shouldn't be allowed to proceed, he indicated, because presidential consultations are protected from such intrusion by the separation of powers defined by the Constitution. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"152935"	"he"	"indicated"	" Cristian Mendoza, a brother of one of the victims, said that when he was finally allowed to see his brother's body, it was still purple and caked in snow, and the pupils of his eyes had been singed by the extreme cold. Mendoza was indignant, he indicated, to see that his brother and the others had been issued only light clothes for the drills in the Andes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"158640"	"he"	"indicated"	" According to Stovall, the market is concerned about the prospect of more Federal Reserve interest rate increases and is especially focused on when the Fed's policy of rate increases might end.

"167894"	"he"	"indicated"	" The congressman who represents most of the Friant district on the Valley's east side, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., bluntly distrusts environmentalists. Nor does he want to release water from Friant for the purpose of saving the long-dry San Joaquin; at most, he indicated, he may not oppose the final deal. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
