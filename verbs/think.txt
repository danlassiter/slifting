"2025"	"I"	"think"	" Underneath all the underbrush, not a lot, but for the film's first half, it's done exceedingly well, with Noyce moving the action ever-forward like a mercenary cutting through a jungle. He manages to make scenes we've seen hundreds of times before seem fresh and vital, and with neither he nor Ford able to do much with the story itself, it's easy to understand why they would turn to a civics debate on national interest and public trust.

They move weekly to clients of the New York Times News Service.   G: General audiences. Nothing that would offend parents if viewed by children.   PG: Parental guidance suggested. May contain some material parents consider inappropriate for young children.   PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for preteens.   R: Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking children.   NC-17: No one under 17 admitted. Replaces the X rating.   NR: Not rated.   Above the Rim R   A perfectly commendable above-average after-school special, except for one problem: It thinks it's a real movie, aimed, perhaps, at the ``New Jack City'' crowd. Duane Martin (a Knicks prospect-turned-actor) stars as a high school hotshot who sees a college athletic scholarship as his ticket out of Harlem and into the NBA. Directed by Jeff Pollack. Rated R for language, sexual innuendo and some violence.   The Adventures of Priscilla,   Queen of the Desert R   The boys on the bus would rather be thought of as the girls on the bus in this spirited Aussie froth about two drag queens (Hugo Weaving and Guy Pearce) and a transsexual ('60s stud Terence Stamp) on a cross-country jaunt through the Outback. The titular Priscilla is their vehicle -- a battered, unreliable bus that takes them from the sophistication of big-city Sydney to the wilds of Alice Springs where they've been asked to perform their act. Rated R for sex-related situations and language.   Andre PG   Predictable but sweet, this seal saga is a decent primer for kids learning some basic lesson about family and friendship. But be forewarned: Andre's best trick is to blow derogatory raspberries. Don't be surprised if your kids pick up the habit. Starring Keith Carradine. Rated PG for scenes of animal endangerment. -- Steve Murray, staff writer   Angels in the Outfield PG   This kid-pleasing baseball fantasy about a lonely boy, a slumping baseball team and some divine intervention is a winged victory for Disney, thanks to a strong cast and heart- tugging plot. Think ``Free Willy'' with the California Angels instead of a whale. Starring Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd. Directed by William Dear. Rated PG for mild adult themes.   Baby's Day Out PG   A very long day indeed, for Baby and for the audience. This John Hughes-ian spin on ``The Ransom of Red Chief'' is best recommended to die-hard slapstick fans who've always wanted to see a remake of ``Three Men and a Baby,'' starring the Three Stooges. Three bumbling crooks (Joe Mantegna, Joe Pantoliano, Brian Haley) kidnap a troublesome 9-month-old Bennington August Cottwell IV, a.k.a., Baby Bink. They learn that grabbing a curious tot is easier than holding onto him. Directed by Patrick Read Johnson. Rated PG for comic violence.   Barcelona PG-13   Set in Spain, Whit Stillman's literate, witty romantic comedy takes place within the socio-political context of ``the last decade of the Cold War.'' Starring Taylor Nichols and Chris Eigemann. Rated PG-13 for language and violence.   Black Beauty G   A beauty. This adaption of the classic 19th-century horse story offers a classy cast (headed by David Thewlis) and a sublime period setting, along with the expected equine enchantments. Directed by Caroline Thompson.   Blankman PG-13   Daman Wayans stars as a nerdy inventor who becomes a bargain-basement superhero. The movie has a few humorous moments, at least enough to fill a five-minute ``In Living Color'' sketch, but stretched out to feature-film length, the joke wears more than a bit thin. Directed by Mike Binder. Rated   PG-13 for profanity, some violence, and some sexual situations.   Bullets Over Broadway PG   It's as if Woody Allen decided to make a movie like the movie- within-the-movie in ``The Purple Rose of Cairo.'' Working in his Runyon-esque ``Broadway Danny Rose'' mode, he takes us back to the Great White Way of the Roaring '20s, for a theater-centric farce that ends up debating the artist vs. the man (something Woody's probably heard a lot of recently). John Cusack is the ardent young playwright who believes in Art and Jennifer Tilly is the no- talent moll whose gangster-boyfriend bankrolls his play so she can go onstage. The rest of the cast includes Dianne Wiest as a Norma Desmond-ish grand damme; Tracey Ullman as a chirpy, life-of-the-Green-Room type; and Chazz Palminteri as Tilly's thug-like bodyguard who turns out to have a playwright's soul. The disturbing thing about ``Bullets'' is how safe it is. How it presents a moral dilemma but tackles it in a blinkered wish-fulfillment style. That the uncouth Palminteri could be a better writer than the artsy Cusack is a surprise to NYC intelligentsia, but not to most of us. There are some great acting opportunities here (may both Wiest and Palminteri reap Best Supporting nominations), but as a Woody Allen film, this one is a bit disappointing.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941104.0070 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(2ndtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Cafe au Lait NR   A very strong cup of coffee might help you through this fumbling French romantic comedy, but I wouldn't bet on it. Writer/director/star Mathieu Kassovitz has a bad case of the Spike Lee wannabes. That he's white and French isn't the problem; that he doesn't have one-tenth of Spike's talent is. Kassovitz casts himself as one of two guys (the other is a Parisian Sidney Poitier-type played by Hubert Kounde) who learn, one, that their girlfried Lola (Julie Maudeuch) has been sleeping with both of them and, two, that she's pregnant, but doesn't know by whom. If this sounds a whole lot like ``She's Gotta Have It,'' it should.   Clear and Present Danger PG-13   Even when this new installment in the Tom Clancy film-adaptation franchise is far from clear, it's dangerously entertaining. Reteaming director Phillip Noyce and star Harrison Ford as CIA analyst Jack Ryan, it's more convoluted than ``Patriot Games.'' But also more gripping. Rated PG-13 for some intense action, violence and language. -- Steve Murray, staff writer   Clerks R   Quirky, irreverent and about as off-the-cuff casual as a movie can be (even a $27,000 movie), this black-and-white no-budget-er has been a prize winner at Cannes and Sundance. Filmmaker Kevin Smith (who also appears in the picture as an enigmatic hanger-on named Silent Bob) gives us a day in the life of a couple of twentysomething Jersey guys named Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson). The two hold down dead-end jobs at, respectively, a Quick Stop convenience store and the neighboring hole-in-the-wall video store. Somewhere beyond slackers, they spend their days discussing the merits of ``The Empire Strikes Back'' vs. ``Return of the Jedi'' (``Justa bunch of Muppets'') while waiting on the usual eccentric crew of customers (like the guy who gets his hand stuck in a Pringle's potato chip can). The film looks just as raw as you'd expect, but it's also brimming with personality, humor and a genuine independent spirit. Absurdist, smutty and completely comfortable with itself, ``Clerks'' is grunge cinema at its best.   The Client PG-13   Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones are wonderful together in yet another John Grisham story. Unfortunately, they play supporting roles to a kid actor who's very impressive, but can't outshine them. Directed by Joel Schumacher. Rated PG-13 for violence and language.   Corrina, Corrina PG   In this beautifully acted, wonderfully perceptive comedy-drama, Whoopi Goldberg plays a '50s housekeeper who makes Mrs. Doubtfire look like W.C. Fields. Directed by Jessie Nelson. Rated PG for adult themes.   Crooklyn PG-13   Spike Lee's affectionate return to the Brooklyn of his youth is a sweet and funny change of pace. Starring Alfre Woodard, Delroy Lindo and Zelda Harris. Rated PG-13 for some profanity, scenes of neighborhood drug use, splintering family unit, kids pranks that include death of dog.   The Crow R   The true-life tragedy hanging over this action film -- a misfired prop gun that killed star Brandon Lee on the set -- is a lot creepier than anything in the movie itself. Still, it's more than a morbid curiosity, thanks to the young star himself. Lee plays a dead rock musician who rises from the grave to avenge the murders of himself and his fiancee. Directed by Alex Proyas. Rated R for violence and language.   I Don't Want to Talk About It PG-13   The ``It'' in this strangely affecting Argentinian film is the physicality of the daughter of a wealthy South American widow named Dona Leonor (Luisina Brando). Her teenager, Charlotte (Alejandra Podesta), is smart, loving, well-read, an accomplished pianist and a devoted daughter. She is also vertically challenged -- or, as they used to say, a dwarf. However, Dona Leonor won't say it (she also burns copies of ``Tom Thumb'') and she won't allow her neighbors to mention it either. The movie takes an odder-still twist when a mysterious roue (Marcello Mastroianni) comes to town and falls for Charlotte. The picture benefits from its bizarre set-up, a poetically Fellini-esque finale and Brando's chilling portrayal of a manipulative, overprotective parent. But director Maria Luisa Bemberg lets things go a bit flat in the middle and it's only thanks to Mastroianni's decades of expertise and innate courtly charisma that we remain interested during the slow spots. Still, the movie deserves points for acting, tone and originality; after all, how many movies try to mix psychotic denial and magic realism in one story?   Double Dragon PG-13   This film version of the popular video game is a cynical attempt at duping young fans into paying to watch a 93-minute commercial for the game and its inevitable sequels. Yet it's also surprisingly grim, considering the target audience. Set in the year 2007, the film blithely presents a nightmarish city ravaged by smog, earthquakes and marauding gangs straight out of ``The Warriors.'' The plot -- less complex than a Pong tournament -- involves a futuristic struggle for a magic Chinese talisman that grants its possessor vague powers over the ``body and soul.'' Half of the ``Double Dragon'' is being guarded by the wise- cracking, kick-boxing Lee brothers -- played in an interesting bit of casting by Mark Dacascos (who looks Asian) and TV's ``Party of Five'' star Scott Wolf (who looks like Tom Cruise). The evil tycoon who holds the other half is played by Robert Patrick, best known as the mighty morphin' cyborg in ``Terminator 2.'' Once again Patrick plays a character who shape-shifts, begging the question: Exactly what kind of typecasting is going on here? Can the guy do this in real life? -- Mark Binelli, free-lance writer   Drop Squad R   Drops a bombshell squarely in the middle of the African-American community. Produced by Spike Lee, directed by David Johnson and filmed in Atlanta, this fiercely engaging drama/satire looks at the highly- charged and often confusing issue of what it means to be African American. However, while it deals with the black experience in particular, the film has a tremendous universality. Daring and fall-down-funny, it ought to provoke a lot of debate, discussion and talk-show programs. The plot is part ``The Colored Museum,'' part ``Man From U.N.C.L.E'' episode. The Drop Squad, led by Vondie Curtis-Hall and Ving Rhames, is a secret militant group that specializes in Deprogramming and Restoration of Pride, i.e., working on blacks -- in this case, buppie Bruford Jamison (Eriq LaSalle) -- too willing to sell out. The film has its flaws -- the in-your-face deprogramming espoused by Rhames would work better on stage and the TV ad for ``GospelPak'' chicken dinners, while hilarious, is too broad; corporate America is far more insidious in its co- opting of ``Diversity,'' etc. This movie says out loud that being black is no longer a matter of being nonwhite (if, indeed, it ever was). Johnson and his expert cast tackle this disturbing reality head-on, with vividness and humor.   Eat Drink Man Woman NR   Master chef Chu (Sihung Lung) doesn't believe in fast food -- any more than the film's director Ang Lee believes in fast movies. As in his hit ``The Wedding Banquet,'' Lee brings an expansive humanist tone and leisurely pacing to familiar obsessions -- food, love and the idiosyncrasies of the heart. -- Steve Murray, staff writer   Ed Wood R   Tim Burton's hilarious and superbly crafted tribute to Ed Wood, the filmmaker who was once named the worst director in film history. Tim Burton concentrates on Wood's (Johnny Depp) '50s career, when he turned out such beyond-bad opuses as ``Plan 9 From Outer Space.'' Rated R for language and adult themes.   Exit to Eden R   Exit FROM Eden. Better still, don't go anywhere near it in the first place. Based on Anne Rice's soft-core S&AMP;M novel about a kind of leather-bar Fantasy Island, the film version has been ``improved'' by director Garry Marshall who's turned it into a kind of ``The Story of O'' meets ``Police Academy III.'' Marshall leavens Rice's kinky stuff with a made-up comic subplot about a pair of cops (Rosie O'Donnell and Dan Aykroyd) on the trail of a handsome photographer (``Strictly Ballroom's'' Paul Mercurio) who's inadvertently snapped some jewel thieves. Rated R for adult themes and language.   The Flintstones PG   Hits rock bottom. The plot follows Fred's (John Goodman) precipitous ``Hudsucker Proxy''-ish rise from quarry worker to vice president of Slate and Co. when a villainous exec (Kyle Mac[DH] Lachlan) and his shapely assistant (Halle Berry) need a fall guy for their greedy schemes. Directed by Brian Levant. Rated PG for mild violence. .  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941104.0071 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(3rdtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Forrest Gump PG-13   Tom Hanks is clueless in America in Robert Zemeckis's half-baked fable about an idiot-savant of sorts, skimming through the last half of the 20th century and colliding ``Zelig''-like with history. Rated PG-13 for adult themes.   Fresh NR   The boy in this hood really is a boy -- a 12-year-old named Fresh (Sean Nelson) who divides his time between junior high and running drugs. The most important person in his life, however, is his near-derelict dad (Samuel L. Jackson) who passes along his passion for chess and, in doing so, teaches Fresh the strategy and mental agility he needs to pull off a revenge- scenario that Michael Corleone would envy. First-time director Boam Yakin has made a powerful and involving film. Not rated, but there is drug use, violence, profanity and adult themes.   Hoop Dreams PG-13   Three hours of basketball may sound like 21/2 hours too much for most movie-lovers. But trust me -- this extraordinary documentary is about much more than backboards and rebounds. Filmmakers Steve James, Frederick Marx and Peter Gilbert have delivered a richly observed, superbly nuanced slice of the American Dream -- a film that uses the particular arena of NBA-prospect high school and college basketball to explore and reflect a larger American experience.   I Like It Like That R   Not just another girl-in-the-hood flick. This is a smart, vivid comedy/drama about inner-city relationships under difficult circumstances. In her debut film, Darnell Martin has fashioned a knowing serio-comic look at a young woman who -- as they love to say on talk shows -- turns her life around. Rated R for language, adult themes and sex.   Imaginary Crimes PG   Almost all the crimes in this low-key affecting film are crimes of the heart. Harvey Keitel stars as a widower in the late '50s/early '60s, trying to make a life for himself and his two daughters (Fairuza Balk and Elisabeth Moss). Unfortunately, as the teenage Balk, a fledgling writer, notes, ``Never has a man so ill-equipped for parenthood tried so hard.'' The trouble with Harvey is he's a small-time con man who's always trying to sell somebody something. Though he's more a self-centered dreamer than a maliciously dishonest man, the result is the same: a family on the run from landlords and creditors and two daughters deeply embarrassed by their seemingly shameless dad. This is a refreshingly different female coming- of-age story; instead of being about the usual first love or lost virginity, it's about a girl who must grow up because her father can't. Director Anthony Drazan sometimes has trouble with pace and he could use more of a sense of humor, but Keitel and Balk save his skin. Eyeing each other with a mix of wariness and love, expectation and dismay, they remind us how rarely the punishment fits the crime, imaginary or not.   It Could Happen to You PG   This sweet nothing of a film pairs Nicolas Cage and Bridget Fonda in an appealing romantic fairy tale of love and the New York lottery. The film is too slight to be a grand romance, but it's definitely a winning one. Rated   PG for mild language, adult situations.   Jason's Lyric R   It starts with the promise of something invigorating and fresh. It's the story of an African-American family living outside the usual inner-city setting of gangsta flicks. But director Doug McHenry carries urban cliches with him into the suburbs: drugs, guns and a whore-madonna view of women that's not very different from a rap video. Rated R for violence, sex, language and drug use. -- Steve Murray, staff writer   Little Giants PG   This time, the Bad News Bears . . . I mean, the Mighty Ducks . . . mean . . . Let's start over. This time, a gang of lovable kiddie misfits pull together and become a heck of a Pee Wee League football team. The only discernable twist is that the Giants' coach (Rick Moranis) and the coach (Ed O'Neill) of the all-star opposing team are brothers wtih a long- standing rivalry. Given a fourth-down-and-long situation, director Duwayne Dunham punts for formula and lets his cast fumble along as best they can. Rated PG for mild language.   Little Rascals PG   Rent the originals. The idea of turning Hal Roach's famed ``Our Gang'' shorts into a feature for '90s audiences is a dubious one at best. And it's been done in the worst possible way. Director Penelope Spheeris has found a remarkable cast of look-alikes who seem to have been cloned from some hidden source of Little Rascals DNA. But as well- trained and well-made-up as these kids are, they are pod-Rascals -- an artful semblance of the real thing but totally devoid of freshness, naturalness or spontaneity. Rated PG for smutty language.   Love Affair PG-13   If this timeless tale of true romance worked for Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne in 1939 (``Love Affair'') and for Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr in 1957 (``An Affair to Remember''), then why shouldn't it work in 1994 for Warren Beatty and Annette Bening? Well, it does. To a point. This is a first-class effort and while it isn't quite the heartbreaker one hopes for, it still manages to jerk a few tears. Maybe they don't make 'em like they used to, but as long as they keep making 'em for Bening, who is irresistible, they're on the right track.   The Mask PG-13   Forget the superhero plot of this live-action cartoon and focus on the Looney-Tunes special effects, the immensely likable Jim Carrey and Milo the mighty Jack Russell terrier. Directed by Chuck Russell. Rated PG-13 for mild violence.   Maverick PG-13   In the parlance of its poker-playing hero, this dumb-fun western draws a winning hand. A solid three-of-a-kind -- Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and James Garner -- glide smoothly over the movie's rougher spots. Rated PG for mild violence and sexual innuendo.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941104.0072 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(4thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Mary Shelley's Frankenstein R   In Mary Shelley's classic 19th-century novel, medical student Victor Frankenstein learns that some things are better left to God. In this opulent, fever-pitched movie, director-star Kenneth Branagh learns that some thngs are better left to James Whale, the man who made the 1931 Karloff version. Not that Branagh's version is a total dud. But in its own way, it's as deliriously misguided as Shelley's mad-scientist protagonist. The problems begin with the casting of Robert De Niro as the Monster. His stitched-together mass of scar tissue may be closer to the novel than Karloff's plug-necked proletariat, but Karloff was an unknown and De Niro, well, is De Niro. Everytime he appears, you think, gee, Travis Bickle's been run over by his own taxi. Also, Branagh has chosen to return to the original's Gothic-romance roots by emphasizing the relationship between Victor (Branagh) and his beloved Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter). That's fine as far as it goes -- and in these actors' talented hands, it goes pretty far -- but it has the effect of reducing the Monster to a bothersome interruption. Brimming with talent and dedication, the Branagh version never bores, but it never truly chills either.   Natural Born Killers R   Oliver Stone is a natural born moviemaker and a natural born troublemaker and this anarchic, almost surreal film shows both sides at their best. As emblematic of the disaffected, media-overload '90s as ``Bonnie and Clyde'' was of the '60s, ``Killers'' celebrates sex, violence and celebrity with a vengeance that's both visual and visceral. Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory (Juliette Lewis) are young, in love and they kill people. About 52 people before they're put in Tommy Lee Jones' jail. Rated R for extreme violence, gore, language, nudity and sexuality.   The Next Karate Kid PG   The new ``kid'' is a sullen teenaged girl named Julie, played by newcomer Hilary Swank. It's not a bad idea to show that a teen can have lips like Claudia Schiffer's and still beat the stuffing out of a bothersome guy. Noriyuki ``Pat'' Morita returns as Mr. Miyagi. Rated PG for violence.   Only You PG   If only Hollywood would make more movies like this fanciful Roman holiday, starring Marisa Tomei as a bride-to-be on a quixotic romantic quest in Italy and Robert Downey Jr. as a gallant suitor who may or may not be her only one. Rated PG for mild sexual themes.   Princess Caraboo PG   A fascinating, fanciful and altogether delightful social satire/romance, lightly based on a true story. A gorgeous exotic (Phoebe Cates) shows up outside Bristol, England, in 1817. Speaking little English, she manages to convey to the wealthy gentry (Jim Broadbent and Wendy Hughes) who take her in that her name is Princess Caraboo and she has escaped from pirates who kidnapped her and took her away from her native land. Is she real or a fraud? Rated PG for adult themes.   Pulp Fiction R   Pop goes the pulp in this smashing sophomore effort by Quentin ``Reservoir Dogs'' Tarantino. Winner of the Golden Palm at Cannes and already subject to Oscar-time whispers, the picture is a gleefully lurid mix of hardboiled gangster-movie conventions and hip post-Warhol irony. It's an exceedingly violent genre flick with a twist -- everyone is in on the joke. Everyone, that is, except the characters on screen. The film consists of three expertly interwoven vignettes that take place before during and sometimes after one another (meaning, a major character in one story can turn up as a minor nobody in another). The first tale centers on a couple of hit men (beautifully played by John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson) and Travolta's job baby-sitting his big, bad boss's (Ving Rhames) babe-licious wife (Uma Thurman). The second focuses on a boxer (Bruce Willis) who's been asked to take a dive. The third goes back to Travolta and Jackson who need Harvey Keitel's help disposing a dead body. Flashy, smart, daring and full of itself, the movie sometimes suggests ``Short Cuts'' with shootouts. But it's very much an original -- from the second-chance career it gives Travolta to the bits of brain matter in Jackson's Jheri-curls. And when Travolta and Urman start a slo-mo dance, the film achieves a moment of pure pop culture/movies-in-our-mind madness. Let's twist again, like we did in another lifetime. Rated R for violence, language, nudity and drug use.   The Puppet Masters R   NASA scientist Dr. Mary Sefton (Julie Warner) has a unique test to determine whether a man is a full-blooded human or if he's possessed by an alien: She shows him her cleavage. This sexist device is one clue that ``The Puppet Masters'' originated as a 1951 Robert A. Heinlein novel. The premise is dated, the latest in a long line of sci-fi paranoia thrillers: Outer-space beasties leach onto human hosts and plot to overwhelm the world. Deduct points for freshness. But ``Masters'' bops with a brisk, nab-those-critters attitude. And the critters are a treat: gloppy manta rays that latch onto your back, jam a tether in your brain, and fuse with your nervous system. Like a good cigarette. Donald Sutherland and Eric Thal also star as estranged father-son federal agents, who with Warner find themselves menaced by dead-eyed townsfolk. Directed by Stuart Orme, ``Masters'' operates like a '50s automat. It's clean, straight-edged and impersonal. But it delivers some fun scenes, if you can get past the inconsistencies and an ending that's an FX letdown. -- Steve Murray   Quiz Show PG-13   Robert Redford's dazzlingly entertaining movie is set in the late '50s, when Americans were as hooked on quiz shows as later generations would be on Watergate or O.J.'s white Bronco. When the sponsor tires of ``Twenty-One's'' current wonder-boy, Herb Stempel (John Turturro), a schlemiel from Queens, he's replaced by Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), the handsome scion of an aristocratic, academic family. Van Doren becomes the nation's most adored egghead and Stempel spills the beans -- that the game is rigged -- to a congressional investigator (Rob Morrow). Rated PG-13 for adult themes.   Radioland Murders PG   Just plain murder to sit through. This fiasco is the latest missive from the hermit-like George Lucas. Produced and written by Lucas and directed by Mel Smith (``The Tall Guy''), the movie means to be a farcical murder mystery set in 1939 at the art deco studios of WBN, a radio station trying to go national. Running around the overcrowded halls are a bickering husband-and-wife team (headwriter Brian Benben and executive-assistant-turned-de-facto-producer, Mary Stuart Masterson); a femme-fatale radio star (the late, very talented Anita Morris); a philandering director (Jeffrey Tambor), a no-nothing executive president (Ned Beatty) and a libidious announcer (Corbin Bernsen) . . . among others. While the show goes on (and everything falls into chaos), someone behind-scenes is murdering the staff. The story, which Lucas has been sitting on for twenty years, has been turned into a screenplay by Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz (of ``Howard the Duck'' fame). Whatever affection or fun the filmmakers mean to have comes off as frenetic and witless. With all his power and money -- he could bankroll Julie Dash and a dozen like her -- this is what Lucas comes up with. Boy, what's the frequency George?  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941104.0073 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(5thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Renaissance Man PG-13   A bummer, man. Director Penny Marshall proves she can do predictable military schmaltz just as well (badly?) as the guys, with this Danny DeVito inspirational comedy that might well be subtitled ``Dead Poet's Platoon.''   Reservoir Dogs R   As in, one assumes, meaner than the junkyard variety. This is an electrifyingly vicious caper flick, soaked in blood, obscenity and incongruous black humor. Most of the movie takes place immediately before and after a robbery gone terribly wrong. Dressed in identical Blues Brothers suits and cloaked in the anonymity of color-coded aliases (Mr. Orange, Mr. Brown), the rattled crooks rd. Playing cereal czar and health nut John Harvey Kellogg, Hopkins creates a grand, blustery caricature. Unfortunately, Parker's adaptation of T. Coraghessan Boyle's novel has flurry in place of a plot. The welter of characters include a young cornflakes entrepreneur (John Cusack); Kellogg's prodigal son George (Dana Carvey); and Will and Eleanor Lightbody (Matthew Broderick and Bridget Fonda), whose physical ills cloak deeper marital problems. Fonda comes off as a mall rat in her great-grandma's clothes. Cusack goes over the top. Broderick gamely endures a lot of enema and bowel jokes, and shows off ab muscles more gym-developed than might be credible for a man of 1907. The movie blows its opportunities to score points about our own health- conscious age. It remains undernourished and dramatically anemic. -- Steve Murray   The Rocky Horror Picture Show R   Let's do the Time Warp again. . . . Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon are lost travelers at Tim Curry's castle. Rated R for adult themes and sexual innuendo.   Sankofa NR   Haile Gerima, one of the founding members of the New Black Cinema, has directed a uniquely powerful film about a modern-day African-American who learns to embrace her painful heritage when she's sent back to the 18th century to experience slavery firsthand. Not rated, but contains nudity and scenes of rape and torture.   The Shawshank Redemption R   There are two excellent reasons to see this involving movie and their names are Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. Based on a Stephen King novella, this is a stone-walls-do-not-a-prison-make story, in which hope flourishes in horrifying surroundings and a unique friendship is forged inside a human purgatory.   Silent Fall R   When a prosperous couple is found brutally murdered in the bedroom of their Maryland mansion, the only witness is their 9-year-old son (Ben Faulkner). Unfortunately, the boy is also autistic, which prompts the local sheriff and the boy's protective older sister (model Liv Tyler) to bring in a once-prominent child shrink (Richard Dreyfuss), who quit treating kids after a tragedy befell a patient. While the movie goes to great lengths to stress that autism isn't an easily understandable condition, it also uses the boy's state as a plot contrivance -- not only to get Dreyfuss involved, but also as a kind of freak circumstance that bestows everything from superhuman strength to an uncanny gift for mimicry. As suspense dramas go, this one is more solid than inspired. Still, director Bruce Beresford brings his usual quality treatment to the material and the autumn color on Maryland's Eastern Shore is so spectacular that you'll want to rush out to the area's nearest B&AMP;B.   The Specialist R   Sylvester Stallone's specialty has been to turn a one- note act into a multimillion-dollar career. But the specialist specified here is a former CIA explosives expert hired by a rich lovely (Sharon Stone) to wipe out the bad guys who killed her parents when she was just a kid. That means taking on Miami mobsters led by patriarch Rod Steiger (doing an embarrassing Jose Jimenez accent), his sleazy son (Eric Roberts) and his equally sleazy consigliere (James Woods, who used to be in the CIA with Sly until they had a falling out over innocent bystanders). At its best, the film is like ``Death Wish'' warmed-over, with hints of ``The Bodyguard.'' However, the expected sparks between the two stars never ignite and the clumsy double- entendre dialogue (Stone to Stallone in phone-sex whisper: ``I heard you control your explosions, that you shape your charges'') doesn't help. There's a glimmer of a good script here, with even a surprise or two. But onscreen, there's nothing but the same old explosions, the same old movie-star glistening skin and grunt-and-moan simulated sex.   Speed R   The perfect summer-movie rush. The gimmick is simple: A wacko (Dennis Hopper) has put a bomb on a city bus. When the bus hits 50 mph, the bomb goes on; if it slows below 50, the bomb goes off. And so the chase is on -- with a busload of terrified passengers, a hurt driver, a spunky civilian at the wheel (Sandra Bullock) and a very determined cop (Keanu Reeves) in pursuit. Directed by Jan De Bont. Rated R for violence and language.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941104.0074 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(6thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Stargate PG-13   An engaging sci-fi yarn with a flying pyramid, three moons and Jaye Davidson in a dress. Again. We start on Earth, where a linguist named Daniel (James Spader) deciphers Egyptian hieroglyphics on a circular mechanism unearthed near the Pyramids. It's the Stargate, a thingamajig that, when uncoded, becomes a portal to a twin gate on a sandy planet across the universe. Daniel gets enlisted for a space-jumping expedition, led by gruff Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell), since he's the only one who can crack the code on that second Stargate. But first they have to face the sun god Ra (Davidson), a cosmic vampire. Like a Tintin adventure set in the cosmos, the movie has an enjoyable retro feel. But it's harder to get revved up by it. Director Roland Emmerich turns out serviceable action scenes, but it's Spielberg minus Spielberg. The movie's MVP is Spader, normally typecast as yuppie slime, here reinventing himself as an adorable egghead. The big letdown is Davidson's villain. He pouts prettily, but that's it; it's like finding out the universe is run by a waiter-slash-model. -- Steve Murray   Terminal Velocity PG-13   A free fall into silliness, this sky-diving thriller plays like Hitchcock Lite. It's preposterous. And a lot of fun. Charlie Sheen stars as Arizona sky-diver Ditch Brodie whose latest student, a blond airhead named Chris (Nastassja Kinski), takes an early tumble out the plane door, and makes like a pancake. Then again, is that really her body on the desert floor? Rated PG-13 for violence, language.   Timecop R   A good rule of thumb: the less sense a Jean-CLaude Van Damme movie makes, the more fun it is. Happily, this futuristic actioner is a welcome return to the sci-fi silliness of his most successful film to date, ``Universal Soldier.'' Van Damme plays a time-traveling cop who tries to stop a corrupt senator from changing history. Rated R for violence, language, brief sex and nudity.   True Lies R   True trash. Too long, too loud and too expensive, this action farce is a pointless exercise in abuse of power, Hollywood-style. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis. Directed by James Cameron. Rated R for violence and language.   The War PG- 13   A big-hearted bore from the maker of ``Fried Green Tomatoes.'' Director Jon Avnet returns to the South of a few years past, in this case small-town Mississippi, 1970. (It was mostly shot in Georgia.) Kevin Costner plays Stephen Simmons, a vet trying to hold a job while haunted by memories of 'Nam. We see him through the eyes of his kids, Stu (Elijah Wood) and Lidia (Lexi Randall), who spend the summer months building a treehouse -- and trying to avoid the white-trash Lipnicki clan. Unlike the plot-driven ``Tomatoes,'' ``War'' ambles with the humid sleepiness of one of its summer days. Somebody's always a- sittin' on a porch, talkin' about love and family and duty and dreams. Late in the movie, when a turf battle turns the kids' treehouse into an obvious anti- war allegory, you might have already tuned out due to the platitudes and melodrama. -- Steve Murray   Wes Craven's New Nightmare R   Wes Craven reclaims Freddy Krueger in this postmodern, Pirandellan funhouse of a movie -- a ``Player'' for the slasher set. When the execs at New Line (the actual makers of this movie) ask original ``Elm Street'' heroine Heather Langenkamp (as Herself) to reprise her role for the ``definitive `Nightmare,' '' she has doubts: She's been having these bad Freddy nightmares. So has her son (Miko Hughes, the scalpel baby from ``Pet Sematary''). Seems that the malevolent force behind the Krueger movies -- the real Freddy -- wants to cross into Real Life. Fun premise. Robert Englund, John Saxon and Craven pop up as Themselves. And it's nice to see Krueger returned to the roots of the first film -- a pre- wisecrack, hellish fiend. But writer-director Craven has turned into a Joseph Campbell-ite. He now takes the mythic archetypes that drive horror movies, and overstates them. (Here he turns ``Hansel and Gretel'' into holy writ.) He's followed his bliss and forgotten to give us good shocks (except for a couple of nasty bits reprised from the first ``Elm Street''). Rated R for gore, language. -- Steve Murray   Wolf R   Who's afraid of Big Bad Jack? You probably won't be, but you're likely to have a howlingly good time at this A-list treatment of old Lon Chaney Jr. werewolf movies. Starring Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer. Directed by Mike Nichols. Rated R for sex, violence and language. .  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941104.0075 type=story > <HEADLINE> BOOKS: COFFEE TABLE GEMS: BOOKS ON SOUTHWEST DISPLAY DEPTH </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> PHOENIX  (BC-BOOKREVIEWS-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"

They move weekly to clients of the New York Times News Service.   G: General audiences. Nothing that would offend parents if viewed by children.   PG: Parental guidance suggested. May contain some material parents consider inappropriate for young children.   PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for preteens.   R: Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking children.   NC-17: No one under 17 admitted. Replaces the X rating.   NR: Not rated.   The Adventures of Priscilla,   Queen of the Desert R   The boys on the bus would rather be thought of as the girls on the bus in this spirited Aussie froth about two drag queens (Hugo Weaving and Guy Pearce) and a transsexual ('60s stud Terence Stamp) on a cross-country jaunt through the Outback. Rated R for sex-related situations and language.   Andre PG   Predictable but sweet, this seal saga is a decent primer for kids learning some basic lesson about family and friendship. But be forewarned: Andre's best trick is to blow derogatory raspberries. Don't be surprised if your kids pick up the habit. Starring Keith Carradine. Rated PG for scenes of animal endangerment. -- Steve Murray, staff writer   Angels in the Outfield PG   This kid-pleasing baseball fantasy about a lonely boy, a slumping baseball team and some divine intervention is a winged victory for Disney, thanks to a strong cast and heart-tugging plot. Think ``Free Willy'' with the California Angels instead of a whale. Starring Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd. Directed by William Dear. Rated PG for mild adult themes.   Baby's Day Out PG   A very long day indeed, for Baby and for the audience. This John Hughes-ian spin on ``The Ransom of Red Chief'' is best recommended to die-hard slapstick fans who've always wanted to see a remake of ``Three Men and a Baby,'' starring the Three Stooges. Rated PG for comic violence.   Barcelona PG-13   Set in Spain, Whit Stillman's literate, witty romantic comedy takes place within the socio-political context of ``the last decade of the Cold War.'' Starring Taylor Nichols and Chris Eigemann. Rated PG- 13 for language and violence.   Blankman PG-13   Daman Wayans stars as a nerdy inventor who becomes a bargain-basement superhero. The movie has a few humorous moments, at least enough to fill a five-minute ``In Living Color'' sketch, but stretched out to feature-film length, the joke wears more than a bit thin. Directed by Mike Binder. Rated PG-13 for profanity, some violence, and some sexual situations.   Blue Sky PG-13   Tommy Lee Jones and Jessica Lange give Oscar-worthy performances in this riveting family drama set against a backdrop of military coverups and abuse of power. Directed by Tony Richardson. Rated PG- 13 for sex, brief nudity and adult themes.   Bullets Over Broadway R   It's as if Woody Allen decided to make a movie like the movie-within-the-movie in ``The Purple Rose of Cairo.'' Working in his Runyon-esque ``Broadway Danny Rose'' mode, he takes us back to the Great White Way of the Roaring '20s, for a theater-centric farce that ends up debating the artist vs. the man (something Woody's probably heard a lot of recently). John Cusack is the ardent young playwright who believes in art and Jennifer Tilly is the no-talent moll whose gangster-boyfriend bankrolls his play so she can go onstage. Rated R for language, adult themes.   Clear and Present Danger PG-13   Even when this new installment in the Tom Clancy film-adaptation franchise is far from clear, it's dangerously entertaining. Reteaming director Phillip Noyce and star Harrison Ford as CIA analyst Jack Ryan, it's more convoluted than ``Patriot Games.'' But also more gripping. Rated PG-13 for some intense action, violence and language. -- Steve Murray, staff writer   Clerks R   Quirky, irreverent and about as off- the-cuff casual as a movie can be (even a $27,000 movie), this black-and-white no-budget-er has been a prize winner at Cannes and Sundance. Filmmaker Kevin Smith (who also appears in the picture as an enigmatic hanger-on named Silent Bob) gives us a day in the life of a couple of twentysomething Jersey guys named Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson). The two hold down dead-end jobs at, respectively, a Quick Stop convenience store and the neighboring hole-in-the-wall video store. Somewhere beyond slackers, they spend their days discussing the merits of ``The Empire Strikes Back'' vs. ``Return of the Jedi'' (``Justa bunch of Muppets'') while waiting on the usual eccentric crew of customers (like the guy who gets his hand stuck in a Pringle's potato chip can). The film looks just as raw as you'd expect, but it's also brimming with personality, humor and a genuine independent spirit. Absurdist, smutty and completely comfortable with itself, ``Clerks'' is grunge cinema at its best.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941111.0058 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(2ndtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> The Client PG-13   Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones are wonderful together in yet another John Grisham story. Unfortunately, they play supporting roles to a kid actor who's very impressive, but can't outshine them. Directed by Joel Schumacher. Rated PG-13 for violence and language.   Corrina, Corrina PG   In this beautifully acted, wonderfully perceptive comedy-drama, Whoopi Goldberg plays a '50s housekeeper who makes Mrs. Doubtfire look like W.C. Fields. Directed by Jessie Nelson. Rated PG for adult themes.   Crooklyn PG-13   Spike Lee's affectionate return to the Brooklyn of his youth is a sweet and funny change of pace. Starring Alfre Woodard, Delroy Lindo and Zelda Harris. Rated PG-13 for some profanity, scenes of neighborhood drug use, splintering family unit, kids pranks that include death of dog.   Double Dragon PG-13   This film version of the popular video game is a cynical attempt at duping young fans into paying to watch a 93-minute commercial for the game and its inevitable sequels. Yet it's also surprisingly grim, considering the target audience. Set in the year 2007, the film blithely presents a nightmarish city ravaged by smog, earthquakes and marauding gangs straight out of ``The Warriors.'' The plot -- less complex than a Pong tournament -- involves a futuristic struggle for a magic Chinese talisman that grants its possessor vague powers over the ``body and soul.'' Half of the ``Double Dragon'' is being guarded by the wise-cracking, kick-boxing Lee brothers -- played in an interesting bit of casting by Mark Dacascos (who looks Asian) and TV's ``Party of Five'' star Scott Wolf (who looks like Tom Cruise). The evil tycoon who holds the other half is played by Marietta native Robert Patrick, best known as the mighty morphin' cyborg in ``Terminator 2.'' Once again Patrick plays a character who shape-shifts, begging the question: Exactly what kind of typecasting is going on here? Can the guy do this in real life? -- Mark Binelli, free-lance writer   Drop Squad R   Part ``The Colored Museum,'' part ``The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,'' this fiercely engaging drama/satire looks at the often confusing issue of what it means to be African American. Directed by David Johnson; produced by Spike Lee. Starring Eriq La Salle (NBC's ``E.R.''). Rated R for violence, language and adult themes.   Ed Wood R   Tim Burton's hilarious and superbly crafted tribute to Ed Wood, the filmmaker who was once named the worst director in film history. Tim Burton concentrates on Wood's (Johnny Depp) '50s career, when he turned out such beyond-bad opuses as ``Plan 9 From Outer Space.'' Rated R for language and adult themes.   Exit to Eden R   Exit FROM Eden. Better still, don't go anywhere near it in the first place. Based on Anne Rice's soft-core S&AMP;M novel about a kind of leather-bar Fantasy Island, the film version has been ``improved'' by director Garry Marshall who's turned it into a kind of ``The Story of O'' meets ``Police Academy III.'' Marshall leavens Rice's kinky stuff with a made-up comic subplot about a pair of cops (Rosie O'Donnell and Dan Aykroyd) on the trail of a handsome photographer (``Strictly Ballroom's'' Paul Mercurio) who's inadvertently snapped some jewel thieves. Rated R for adult themes and language.   Forrest Gump PG-13   Tom Hanks is clueless in America in Robert Zemeckis's half-baked fable about an idiot-savant of sorts, skimming through the last half of the 20th century and colliding ``Zelig''-like with history. Rated PG-13 for adult themes.   Fresh NR   The boy in this hood really is a boy -- a 12-year-old named Fresh (Sean Nelson) who divides his time between junior high and running drugs. The most important person in his life, however, is his near-derelict dad (Samuel L. Jackson) who passes along his passion for chess and, in doing so, teaches Fresh the strategy and mental agility he needs to pull off a revenge-scenario that Michael Corleone would envy. Not rated, but there is drug use, violence, profanity and adult themes.   A Good Man in Africa R   A good deal of talent is wasted in this satire about the end of colonialism in a fictional African country. Starring Colin Friels and Sean Connery. Rated R for language, adult themes.   Hoop Dreams PG-13   Three hours of basketball may sound like 21/2 hours too many for most moviegoers, but this extraordinary documentary is about so much more than backboards and rebounds. It's a richly observed, superbly nuanced look at the American Dream through the eyes of two teenage NBA hopefuls. Directed by Steve James. Rated PG-13 for profanity and drug use.   I Don't Want to Talk About It PG-13   The ``It'' in this strangely affecting Argentinian film is the physicality of the daughter of a wealthy South American widow named Dona Leonor (Luisina Brando). Her teenager, Charlotte (Alejandra Podesta), is smart, loving, well-read, an accomplished pianist and a devoted daughter. She is also vertically challenged -- or, as they used to say, a dwarf. However, Dona Leonor won't say it (she also burns copies of ``Tom Thumb'') and she won't allow her neighbors to mention it either. The movie takes an odder-still twist when a mysterious roue (Marcello Mastroianni) comes to town and falls for Charlotte. The picture benefits from its bizarre set-up, a poetically Fellini-esque finale and Brando's chilling portrayal of a manipulative, overprotective parent. But director Maria Luisa Bemberg lets things go a bit flat in the middle and it's only thanks to Mastroianni's decades of expertise and innate courtly charisma that we remain interested during the slow spots. Still, the movie deserves points for acting, tone and originality; after all, how many movies try to mix psychotic denial and magic realism in one story?  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941111.0059 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(3rdtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> I Like It Like That R   A strong debut by young African-American filmmaker Darnell Martin, who deftly guides us through the mean streets of the Bronx and the complexities of the human heart. Rated R for language, adult themes and sex.   Interview With the Vampire R   As richly textured as a dark brocade, threaded with existential dread and drenched in plasma, Neil Jordan's film will disturb more viewers than just Oprah. It's filled with snapping necks, slit throats, rats and wrists draining crimson into goblets, and other bloody bits of necro-fun. But it's likely to thrill Anne Rice fans and seduce those unfamiliar with her books. Interviewed by a San Francisco journalist (Christian Slater), reluctant vampire Louis (Brad Pitt) goes back 200 years to torchlit New Orleans, recalling his role in the ultimate dysfunctional clan: himself, sadistic Lestat (Tom Cruise) who made him a vampire; and their ``child'' Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), whose golden curls mask a fierce hunger. Lestat is driven by appetite. Louis wants answers. His quest to find others of ``our kind'' drives the film into 19th- century Paris, introducing a clique of decadent undead (including Antonio Banderas and Stephen Rea). As a screenwriter, Rice doesn't hit her points as hard as she might, especially Louis' motivations. If you're unfamiliar with the book, you might find the going slow. And here's what you've been wondering: Cruise's Lestat is a dandy dandy; he could be more frightening, but the role hasn't been stretched into a vanity star turn. Pitt provides the eloquent heart of the movie. And Dunst, older than the novel's Claudia, conveys the character's anguish at being trapped in childhood. But the film's biggest triumph is its visual design, an opulent fusion of costumes (Sandy Powell), production design (Dante Ferretti) and cinematography (Philippe Rousselot). This ``Vampire'' has bite. -- Steve Murray   It Could Happen to You PG   This sweet nothing of a film pairs Nicolas Cage and Bridget Fonda in an appealing romantic fairy tale of love and the New York lottery. The film is too slight to be a grand romance, but it's definitely a winning one. Rated PG for mild language, adult situations.   Jason's Lyric R   It starts with the promise of something invigorating and fresh. It's the story of an African-American family living outside the usual inner-city setting of gangsta flicks. But director Doug McHenry carries urban cliches with him into the suburbs: drugs, guns and a whore-madonna view of women that's not very different from a rap video. Rated R for violence, sex, language and drug use. -- Steve Murray, staff writer   Lassie PG   Lassie comes home to the big screen in an engaging family film directed by Daniel Petrie. Set in rural Virginia, this savvily updated version (by ``Paper House's'' Matthew Jacob) has a lot more in common with the TV series than the novel or the 1943 movie. But even after 50 years, it's still the same old story: a boy and his wonder-dog. The boy is Matt (Thomas Guiry), an angry adolescent who resents his new stepmom (Helen Slater) almost as much as he resents his dad's (Jon Tenney) relocating the family from Baltimore to a sheep farm. The wonder-dog, of course, is Lassie who latches onto Matt when her owner is killed. Rated PG for mild violence.   Little Giants PG   This time, the Bad News Bears . . . I mean, the Mighty Ducks . . . I mean . . . Let's start over. This time, a gang of lovable kiddie misfits pull together and become a heck of a Pee Wee League football team. The only discernable twist is that the Giants' coach (Rick Moranis) and the coach (Ed O'Neill) of the all- star opposing team are brothers with a long-standing rivalry. Given a fourth- down-and-long situation, director Duwayne Dunham punts for formula and lets his cast fumble along as best they can. Rated PG for mild language.   Little Rascals PG   Rent the originals. The idea of turning Hal Roach's famed ``Our Gang'' shorts into a feature for '90s audiences is a dubious one at best. And it's been done in the worst possible way. Director Penelope Spheeris has found a remarkable cast of look-alikes who seem to have been cloned from some hidden source of Little Rascals DNA. But as well-trained and well-made-up as these kids are, they are pod-Rascals -- an artful semblance of the real thing but totally devoid of freshness, naturalness or spontaneity. Rated PG for smutty language.   Love Affair PG-13   If this timeless tale of true romance worked for Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne in 1939 (``Love Affair'') and for Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr in 1957 (``An Affair to Remember''), then why shouldn't it work in 1994 for Warren Beatty and Annette Bening? Well, it does. To a point. This is a first-class effort and while it isn't quite the heartbreaker one hopes for, it still manages to jerk a few tears.   Mary Shelley's Frankenstein R   In Mary Shelley's classic 19th-century novel, medical student Victor Frankenstein learns that some things are better left to God. In this opulent, fever-pitched movie, director-star Kenneth Branagh learns that some things are better left to James Whale, the man who made the 1931 Karloff version. Not that Branagh's version is a total dud. But in its own way, it's as deliriously misguided as Shelley's mad-scientist protagonist. The problems begin with the casting of Robert De Niro as the Monster. His stitched-together mass of scar tissue may be closer to the novel than Karloff's plug-necked proletariat, but Karloff was an unknown and De Niro, well, is De Niro. Every time he appears, you think, gee, Travis Bickle's been run over by his own taxi. Also, Branagh has chosen to return to the original's Gothic-romance roots by emphasizing the relationship between Victor (Branagh) and his beloved Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter). That's fine as far as it goes -- and in these actors' talented hands, it goes pretty far -- but it has the effect of reducing the Monster to a bothersome interruption. Brimming with talent and dedication, the Branagh version never bores, but it never truly chills either.   The Mask PG-13   Forget the superhero plot of this live-action cartoon and focus on the Looney-Tunes special effects, the immensely likable Jim Carrey and Milo the mighty Jack Russell terrier. Directed by Chuck Russell. Rated PG-13 for mild violence.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941111.0060 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(4thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Natural Born Killers R Oliver Stone is a natural born moviemaker and a natural born troublemaker and this anarchic, almost surreal film shows both sides at their best. As emblematic of the disaffected, media-overload '90s as ``Bonnie and Clyde'' was of the '60s, ``Killers'' celebrates sex, violence and celebrity with a vengeance that's both visual and visceral. Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory (Juliette Lewis) are young, in love and they kill people. About 52 people before they're put in Tommy Lee Jones' jail. Rated R for extreme violence, gore, language, nudity and sexuality.   The Next Karate Kid PG   The new ``kid'' is a sullen teenaged girl named Julie, played by newcomer Hilary Swank. It's not a bad idea to show that a teen can have lips like Claudia Schiffer's and still beat the stuffing out of a bothersome guy. Noriyuki ``Pat'' Morita returns as Mr. Miyagi. Rated PG for violence.   Oleanna R   Cinematic saltpeter, it's a guaranteed date-night dampener. David Mamet's film of his off-Broadway power play can send men and women up the theater aisle, fuming for separate reasons. Charting a trio of disastrous meetings between a college professor (William H. Macy), and a student (Debra Eisenstadt) who's failing his class, the film is a paranoid reaction to the shifting sexual politics of the '90s: Patricia Bowman, Anita Hill, Tailhook, etc. We first meet Carol arriving sans appointment at John's office. The words that rain most often from her mouth are, ``I don't understand.'' But by their second encounter, she has morphed from a stammering coed to a coolly poised virago, equipped with a militantly drab wardrobe, a notably improved vocabulary, and the support of a student cabal whom she refers to as ``my group.'' The personality shift is abrupt, unexplained. Instead of a two-person, full-bodied drama, the movie turns into a symbolic standoff between an innocent man and a misogynist's nightmare. Sexless, anti-intellectual, tract-spouting, Carol becomes the sort of woman Rush Limbaugh and Camille Paglia would take turns hating. Mamet keeps the focus simple; he hardly ``opens up'' the play. And it's easy to admire the deft dialogue and the strong performances. Macy summons a natty self-satisfaction (you wouldn't mind seeing him deflated, but not crucified). Eisenstadt does as fine a job as possible with the role's limitations. In the end, Mamet comes up with Molotov cocktail that's almost too successful in making audiences see red. -- Steve Murray   Only You PG   If only Hollywood would make more movies like this fanciful Roman holiday, starring Marisa Tomei as a bride- to-be on a quixotic romantic quest in Italy and Robert Downey Jr. as a gallant suitor who may or may not be her only one. Rated PG for mild sexual themes.   Pulp Fiction R   Pop goes the pulp in this smashing sophomore effort by Quentin ``Reservoir Dogs'' Tarantino. Winner of the Golden Palm at Cannes and already subject to Oscar-time whispers, the picture is a gleefully lurid mix of hardboiled gangster-movie conventions and hip post-Warhol irony. It's an exceedingly violent genre flick with a twist -- everyone is in on the joke. Everyone, that is, except the characters on screen. The film consists of three expertly interwoven vignettes. The first tale centers on a couple of hit men (beautifully played by John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson) and Travolta's job babysitting his big, bad boss's (Ving Rhames) babe-licious wife (Uma Thurman). The second focuses on a boxer (Bruce Willis) who's been asked to take a dive. The third goes back to Travolta and Jackson who need Harvey Keitel's help disposing a dead body. Flashy, smart, daring and full of itself, the movie sometimes suggests ``Short Cuts'' with shootouts. Rated R for violence, language, nudity and drug use.   The Puppet Masters R   NASA scientist Dr. Mary Sefton (Julie Warner) has a unique test to determine whether a man is a full- blooded human or if he's possessed by an alien: She shows him her cleavage. This sexist device is one clue that ``The Puppet Masters'' originated as a 1951 Robert A. Heinlein novel. The premise is dated, the latest in a long line of sci-fi paranoia thrillers: Outer-space beasties leach onto human hosts and plot to overwhelm the world. Deduct points for freshness. But ``Masters'' bops with a brisk, nab-those-critters attitude. And the critters are a treat: gloppy manta rays that latch on to your back, jam a tether in your brain, and fuse with your nervous system. Like a good cigarette. -- Steve Murray   Quiz Show PG-13   Robert Redford's dazzlingly entertaining movie is set in the late '50s, when Americans were as hooked on quiz shows as later generations would be on Watergate or O.J.'s white Bronco. When the sponsor tires of ``Twenty-One's'' current wonder-boy, Herb Stempel (John Turturro), a schlemiel from Queens, he's replaced by Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), the handsome scion of an aristocratic, academic family. Van Doren becomes the nation's most adored egghead and Stempel spills the beans -- that the game is rigged -- to a congressional investigator (Rob Morrow). Rated PG-13 for adult themes.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941111.0061 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(5thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Radioland Murders PG   Just plain murder to sit through. This fiasco is the latest missive from the hermit-like George Lucas. Produced and written by Lucas and directed by Mel Smith (``The Tall Guy''), the movie means to be a farcical murder mystery set in 1939 at the art deco studios of WBN, a radio station trying to go national. Running around the overcrowded halls are a bickering husband-and-wife team (headwriter Brian Benben and executive-assistant-turned-de-facto-producer, Mary Stuart Masterson); a femme- fatale radio star (the late, very talented Anita Morris); a philandering director (Jeffrey Tambor), a no-nothing executive president (Ned Beatty) and a libidious announcer (Corbin Bernsen) . . . among others. While the show goes on (and everything falls into chaos), someone behindthe scenes is murdering the staff.   Red Rock West R   In this low-budget comic noir about greed, lust and cheatin' hearts, Nicholas Cage is a nice-guy drifter taught by the likes of Dennis Hopper and J.T. Walsh that no good deed ever goes unpunished. Directed by John Dahl. Rated R for violence, profanity and sex.   Renaissance Man PG-13   A bummer, man. Director Penny Marshall proves she can do predictable military schmaltz just as well (badly?) as the guys, with this Danny DeVito inspirational comedy that might well be subtitled ``Dead Poet's Platoon.''   Reservoir Dogs R   As in, one assumes, meaner than the junkyard variety. Quentin Tarentino's debut is an electrifyingly vicious caper flick, soaked in blood, obscenity and incongruous black humor. Most of the movie takes place immediately before and after a robbery gone terribly wrong. The ensemble cast -- headed by Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn and Tim Roth -- is a marvel, worthy of a Mamet play (which this film's profane energy often evokes).   The River Wild PG-13   Meryl Streep is a former white-water river guide, who views a rafting excursion in her old splashing grounds as more than a family vacation. It's a chance to spend quality time and heal rifts with workaholic husband Tom (David Strathairn) and son Roarke (Joseph Mazzello). Slithering into the family's domestic Eden, Kevin Bacon is a fellow rafter who turns vacation into hell, taking the family hostage and forcing Streep to pilot him safely down the river. The actors and the scenery keep your mind off a predictable plot; this is a B-movie graced with members of the Hollywood A- list. But the trip is worth it. Rated PG-13 for violence. -- Steve Murray, staff writer   The Road to Wellville R   Paved with good intentions. Like that other road. Alan Parker's health-craze comedy is an art-design folly with little more going for it than spectacle: Edwardian clothes, Anthony Hopkins with buckteeth, and cruel spa machines Jules Verne might have forged. Playing cereal czar and health nut John Harvey Kellogg, Hopkins creates a grand, blustery caricature. Unfortunately, Parker's adaptation of T. Coraghessan Boyle's novel has flurry in place of a plot. The welter of characters include a young cornflakes entrepreneur (John Cusack); Kellogg's prodigal son George (Dana Carvey); and Will and Eleanor Lightbody (Matthew Broderick and Bridget Fonda), whose physical ills cloak deeper marital problems. Fonda comes off as a mall rat in her great-grandma's clothes. Cusack goes over the top. Broderick gamely endures a lot of enema and bowel jokes, and shows off ab muscles more gym-developed than might be credible for a man of 1907. The movie blows its opportunities to score points about our own health-conscious age. It remains undernourished and dramatically anemic. Rated R for nudity, sexual situations. -- Steve Murray   The Santa Clause PG   The movie's moral is a peculiar one, even by Hollywood standards: The best way for a father to gain his son's respect is to pack on 50 pounds, grow a white beard and consort with elves. Thus it goes with Scott Calvin (Tim Allen), a divorced dad whose 8-year-old, Charlie (Eric Lloyd), would rather spend Christmas Eve with Mom (Wendy Crewson) and her new therapist hubby (Judge Reinhold). That is, until Santa tumbles off the roof, Scott straps on St. Nick's suit, and goes across the globe popping in and out of chimneys (aided by some computer effects that aren't as special as you'd hope). Amiable Allen wisecracks his way past snarling mutts and spying moppets (``Do you want this doll or not?'' he asks one recalcitrant tot). Then, at the North Pole, he finds out from the rainbow-coalition elves that -- gulp -- once you put on Santa's suit, you're Santa. For good. From here, the movie unreels as a cross between ``Miracle on 34th Street'' and a paranoid delusion. As the new year unfolds, Scott bloats up and goes white-haired and bewhiskered. Call it Clausitis: Santa overcomes his nervous system like an incurable disease. Allen's normal-guy shtick is terrific, but once he disappears inside the fat-suit, the movie's personality goes with him. Cuteness happens, magic doesn't. And if you have kids, be prepared to tell them something the movie never explains: What the heck happened to the original Santa, who evaporates into thin air? Ho ho huh? -- Steve Murray   The Shawshank Redemption R   There are two excellent reasons to see this involving movie and their names are Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. Based on a Stephen King novella, this is a stone-walls-do-not-a-prison-make story, in which hope flourishes in horrifying surroundings and a unique friendship is forged inside a human purgatory.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941111.0062 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(6thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Silent Fall R   When a prosperous couple is found brutally murdered in the bedroom of their Maryland mansion, the only witness is their 9-year-old son (Ben Faulkner). Unfortunately, the boy is also autistic, which prompts the local sheriff and the boy's protective older sister (model Liv Tyler) to bring in a once-prominent child shrink (Richard Dreyfuss), who quit treating kids after a tragedy befell a patient. While this solid suspense drama goes to great lengths to stress that autism isn't an easily understandable condition, it also uses the boy's state as a plot contrivance to get Dreyfuss involved. Rated R for violence, language and adult themes.   The Specialist R   Sylvester Stallone's specialty has been to turn a one-note act into a multimillion-dollar career. But the specialist specified here is a former CIA explosives expert hired by a rich lovely (Sharon Stone) to wipe out the bad guys who killed her parents when she was just a kid. That means taking on Miami mobsters led by patriarch Rod Steiger (doing an embarrassing Jose Jimenez accent), his sleazy son (Eric Roberts) and his equally sleazy consigliere (James Woods, who used to be in the CIA with Sly until they had a falling out over innocent bystanders). At its best, the film is like ``Death Wish'' warmed-over, with hints of ``The Bodyguard.'' However, the expected sparks between Stallone and Stone never ignite.   Speed R   The perfect summer- movie rush. The gimmick is simple: A wacko (Dennis Hopper) has put a bomb on a city bus. When the bus hits 50 mph, the bomb goes on; if it slows below 50, the bomb goes off. And so the chase is on -- with a busload of terrified passengers, a hurt driver, a spunky civilian at the wheel (Sandra Bullock) and a very determined cop (Keanu Reeves) in pursuit. Directed by Jan De Bont. Rated R for violence and language.   Stargate PG-13   An engaging sci-fi yarn with a flying pyramid, three moons and Jaye Davidson in a dress. Again. We start on Earth, where a linguist named Daniel (James Spader) deciphers Egyptian hieroglyphics on a circular mechanism unearthed near the pyramids. It's the Stargate, a thingamajig that, when uncoded, becomes a portal to a twin gate on a sandy planet across the universe. Daniel gets enlisted for a space-jumping expedition, led by gruff Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell), since he's the only one who can crack the code on that second Stargate. But first they have to face the sun god Ra, (Davidson), a cosmic vampire. Like a Tintin adventure set in the cosmos, the movie has an enjoyable retro feel. But it's harder to get revved up by it. Director Roland Emmerich turns out serviceable action scenes, but it's Spielberg minus Spielberg. Rated PG-13 for violence. -- Steve Murray   Terminal Velocity PG-13   A free fall into silliness, this sky-diving thriller plays like Hitchcock Lite. It's preposterous. And a lot of fun. Charlie Sheen stars as Arizona sky diver Ditch Brodie whose latest student, a blond airhead named Chris (Nastassja Kinski), takes an early tumble out the plane door, and makes like a pancake. Then again, is that really her body on the desert floor? Rated PG-13 for violence, language.   Timecop R   A good rule of thumb: the less sense a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie makes, the more fun it is. Happily, this futuristic actioner is a welcome return to the sci-fi silliness of his most successful film to date, ``Universal Soldier.'' Van Damme plays a time-traveling cop who tries to stop a corrupt senator from changing history. Rated R for violence, language, brief sex and nudity.   Trial By Jury R   Jury tampering takes on a whole new dimension in this solid thriller- melodrama that replaces 12 angry men with one very angry woman. Juror Joanne Whalley-Kilmer doesn't start out mad; she feels jury duty is part of truth, justice and the American Way. However, when she's chosen by prosecutor Gabriel Byrne to sit in judgment on a smoothie mobster (Armande Assante), she learns otherwise. Rated R for violence, language and adult themes.   True Lies R   True trash. Too long, too loud and too expensive, this action farce is a pointless exercise in abuse of power, Hollywood-style. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis. Directed by James Cameron. Rated R for violence and language.   The War PG-13 A big-hearted bore from the maker of ``Fried Green Tomatoes.'' Director Jon Avnet returns to the South of a few years past, in this case small-town Mississippi, 1970. (It was mostly shot in Georgia.) Kevin Costner plays Stephen Simmons, a vet trying to hold a job while haunted by memories of 'Nam. We see him through the eyes of his kids, Stu (Elijah Wood) and Lidia (Lexi Randall), who spend the summer months building a treehouse -- and trying to avoid the white-trash Lipnicki clan. Unlike the plot-driven ``Tomatoes,'' ``War'' ambles with the humid sleepiness of one of its summer days. Somebody's always a-sittin' on a porch, talkin' about love and family and duty and dreams. Late in the movie, when a turf battle turns the kids' treehouse into an obvious anti-war allegory, you might have already tuned out due to the platitudes and melodrama. -- Steve Murray   Wes Craven's New Nightmare R   Wes Craven reclaims Freddy Krueger in this postmodern, Pirandellan funhouse of a movie -- a ``Player'' for the slasher set. When the execs at New Line (the actual makers of this movie) ask original ``Elm Street'' heroine Heather Langenkamp (as Herself) to reprise her role for the ``definitive `Nightmare,' '' she has doubts: She's been having these bad Freddy nightmares. So has her son (Miko Hughes, the scalpel baby from ``Pet Sematary''). Seems that the malevolent force behind the Krueger movies -- the real Freddy -- wants to cross into Real Life. Fun premise. Robert Englund, John Saxon and Craven pop up as Themselves. And it's nice to see Krueger returned to the roots of the first film -- a pre-wisecrack, hellish fiend. Rated R for gore, language. -- Steve Murray .  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941111.0063 type=story > <HEADLINE> COMMENTARY: REAGAN GENIUS REBORN IN GOP CONTRACT </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WACO, Texas  (BC-NETHAWAY-COLUMN-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"

They move weekly to clients of the New York Times News Service.   G: General audiences. Nothing that would offend parents if viewed by children.   PG: Parental guidance suggested. May contain some material parents consider inappropriate for young children.   PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for preteens.   R: Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking children.   NC-17: No one under 17 admitted. Replaces the X rating.   NR: Not rated.   The Adventures of Priscilla,   Queen of the Desert R   The boys on the bus would rather be thought of as the girls on the bus in this spirited Aussie froth about two drag queens (Hugo Weaving and Guy Pearce) and a transsexual ('60s stud Terence Stamp) on a cross-country jaunt through the Outback. Rated R for sex-related situations and language.   Andre PG   Predictable but sweet, this seal saga is a decent primer for kids learning some basic lesson about family and friendship. But be forewarned: Andre's best trick is to blow derogatory raspberries. Don't be surprised if your kids pick up the habit. Starring Keith Carradine. Rated PG for scenes of animal endangerment. -- Steve Murray, staff writer   Angels in the Outfield PG   This kid-pleasing baseball fantasy about a lonely boy, a slumping baseball team and some divine intervention is a winged victory for Disney, thanks to a strong cast and heart-tugging plot. Think ``Free Willy'' with the California Angels instead of a whale. Starring Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd. Directed by William Dear. Rated PG for mild adult themes.   Baby's Day Out PG   A very long day indeed, for Baby and for the audience. This John Hughes-ian spin on ``The Ransom of Red Chief'' is best recommended to die-hard slapstick fans who've always wanted to see a remake of ``Three Men and a Baby,'' starring the Three Stooges. Rated PG for comic violence.   Barcelona PG-13   Set in Spain, Whit Stillman's literate, witty romantic comedy takes place within the socio-political context of ``the last decade of the Cold War.'' Starring Taylor Nichols and Chris Eigemann. Rated PG- 13 for language and violence.   Blankman PG-13   Daman Wayans stars as a nerdy inventor who becomes a bargain-basement superhero. The movie has a few humorous moments, at least enough to fill a five-minute ``In Living Color'' sketch, but stretched out to feature-film length, the joke wears more than a bit thin. Directed by Mike Binder. Rated PG-13 for profanity, some violence, and some sexual situations.   Blue Sky PG-13   Tommy Lee Jones and Jessica Lange give Oscar-worthy performances in this riveting family drama set against a backdrop of military coverups and abuse of power. Directed by Tony Richardson. Rated PG- 13 for sex, brief nudity and adult themes.   Bullets Over Broadway R   It's as if Woody Allen decided to make a movie like the movie-within-the-movie in ``The Purple Rose of Cairo.'' Working in his Runyon-esque ``Broadway Danny Rose'' mode, he takes us back to the Great White Way of the Roaring '20s, for a theater-centric farce that ends up debating the artist vs. the man (something Woody's probably heard a lot of recently). John Cusack is the ardent young playwright who believes in art and Jennifer Tilly is the no-talent moll whose gangster-boyfriend bankrolls his play so she can go onstage. Rated R for language, adult themes.   Clear and Present Danger PG-13   Even when this new installment in the Tom Clancy film-adaptation franchise is far from clear, it's dangerously entertaining. Reteaming director Phillip Noyce and star Harrison Ford as CIA analyst Jack Ryan, it's more convoluted than ``Patriot Games.'' But also more gripping. Rated PG-13 for some intense action, violence and language. -- Steve Murray, staff writer   Clerks R   Quirky, irreverent and about as off- the-cuff casual as a movie can be (even a $27,000 movie), this black-and-white no-budget-er has been a prize winner at Cannes and Sundance. Filmmaker Kevin Smith (who also appears in the picture as an enigmatic hanger-on named Silent Bob) gives us a day in the life of a couple of twentysomething Jersey guys named Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson). The two hold down dead-end jobs at, respectively, a Quick Stop convenience store and the neighboring hole-in-the-wall video store. Somewhere beyond slackers, they spend their days discussing the merits of ``The Empire Strikes Back'' vs. ``Return of the Jedi'' (``Justa bunch of Muppets'') while waiting on the usual eccentric crew of customers (like the guy who gets his hand stuck in a Pringle's potato chip can). The film looks just as raw as you'd expect, but it's also brimming with personality, humor and a genuine independent spirit. Absurdist, smutty and completely comfortable with itself, ``Clerks'' is grunge cinema at its best.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941118.0070 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(2ndtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> The Client PG-13   Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones are wonderful together in yet another John Grisham story. Unfortunately, they play supporting roles to a kid actor who's very impressive, but can't outshine them. Directed by Joel Schumacher. Rated PG-13 for violence and language.   Corrina, Corrina PG   In this beautifully acted, wonderfully perceptive comedy-drama, Whoopi Goldberg plays a '50s housekeeper who makes Mrs. Doubtfire look like W.C. Fields. Directed by Jessie Nelson. Rated PG for adult themes.   Crooklyn PG-13   Spike Lee's affectionate return to the Brooklyn of his youth is a sweet and funny change of pace. Starring Alfre Woodard, Delroy Lindo and Zelda Harris. Rated PG-13 for some profanity, scenes of neighborhood drug use, splintering family unit, kids pranks that include death of dog.   Double Dragon PG-13   This film version of the popular video game is a cynical attempt at duping young fans into paying to watch a 93-minute commercial for the game and its inevitable sequels. Yet it's also surprisingly grim, considering the target audience. Set in the year 2007, the film blithely presents a nightmarish city ravaged by smog, earthquakes and marauding gangs straight out of ``The Warriors.'' The plot -- less complex than a Pong tournament -- involves a futuristic struggle for a magic Chinese talisman that grants its possessor vague powers over the ``body and soul.'' Half of the ``Double Dragon'' is being guarded by the wise-cracking, kick-boxing Lee brothers -- played in an interesting bit of casting by Mark Dacascos (who looks Asian) and TV's ``Party of Five'' star Scott Wolf (who looks like Tom Cruise). The evil tycoon who holds the other half is played by Marietta native Robert Patrick, best known as the mighty morphin' cyborg in ``Terminator 2.'' Once again Patrick plays a character who shape-shifts, begging the question: Exactly what kind of typecasting is going on here? Can the guy do this in real life? -- Mark Binelli, free-lance writer   Drop Squad R   Part ``The Colored Museum,'' part ``The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,'' this fiercely engaging drama/satire looks at the often confusing issue of what it means to be African American. Directed by David Johnson; produced by Spike Lee. Starring Eriq La Salle (NBC's ``E.R.''). Rated R for violence, language and adult themes.   Ed Wood R   Tim Burton's hilarious and superbly crafted tribute to Ed Wood, the filmmaker who was once named the worst director in film history. Tim Burton concentrates on Wood's (Johnny Depp) '50s career, when he turned out such beyond-bad opuses as ``Plan 9 From Outer Space.'' Rated R for language and adult themes.   Exit to Eden R   Exit FROM Eden. Better still, don't go anywhere near it in the first place. Based on Anne Rice's soft-core S&AMP;M novel about a kind of leather-bar Fantasy Island, the film version has been ``improved'' by director Garry Marshall who's turned it into a kind of ``The Story of O'' meets ``Police Academy III.'' Marshall leavens Rice's kinky stuff with a made-up comic subplot about a pair of cops (Rosie O'Donnell and Dan Aykroyd) on the trail of a handsome photographer (``Strictly Ballroom's'' Paul Mercurio) who's inadvertently snapped some jewel thieves. Rated R for adult themes and language.   Forrest Gump PG-13   Tom Hanks is clueless in America in Robert Zemeckis's half-baked fable about an idiot-savant of sorts, skimming through the last half of the 20th century and colliding ``Zelig''-like with history. Rated PG-13 for adult themes.   Fresh NR   The boy in this hood really is a boy -- a 12-year-old named Fresh (Sean Nelson) who divides his time between junior high and running drugs. The most important person in his life, however, is his near-derelict dad (Samuel L. Jackson) who passes along his passion for chess and, in doing so, teaches Fresh the strategy and mental agility he needs to pull off a revenge-scenario that Michael Corleone would envy. Not rated, but there is drug use, violence, profanity and adult themes.   A Good Man in Africa R   A good deal of talent is wasted in this satire about the end of colonialism in a fictional African country. Starring Colin Friels and Sean Connery. Rated R for language, adult themes.   Hoop Dreams PG-13   Three hours of basketball may sound like 21/2 hours too many for most moviegoers, but this extraordinary documentary is about so much more than backboards and rebounds. It's a richly observed, superbly nuanced look at the American Dream through the eyes of two teenage NBA hopefuls. Directed by Steve James. Rated PG-13 for profanity and drug use.   I Don't Want to Talk About It PG-13   The ``It'' in this strangely affecting Argentinian film is the physicality of the daughter of a wealthy South American widow named Dona Leonor (Luisina Brando). Her teenager, Charlotte (Alejandra Podesta), is smart, loving, well-read, an accomplished pianist and a devoted daughter. She is also vertically challenged -- or, as they used to say, a dwarf. However, Dona Leonor won't say it (she also burns copies of ``Tom Thumb'') and she won't allow her neighbors to mention it either. The movie takes an odder-still twist when a mysterious roue (Marcello Mastroianni) comes to town and falls for Charlotte. The picture benefits from its bizarre set-up, a poetically Fellini-esque finale and Brando's chilling portrayal of a manipulative, overprotective parent. But director Maria Luisa Bemberg lets things go a bit flat in the middle and it's only thanks to Mastroianni's decades of expertise and innate courtly charisma that we remain interested during the slow spots. Still, the movie deserves points for acting, tone and originality; after all, how many movies try to mix psychotic denial and magic realism in one story?  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941118.0071 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(3rdtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> I Like It Like That R   A strong debut by young African-American filmmaker Darnell Martin, who deftly guides us through the mean streets of the Bronx and the complexities of the human heart. Rated R for language, adult themes and sex.   Interview With the Vampire R   As richly textured as a dark brocade, threaded with existential dread and drenched in plasma, Neil Jordan's film will disturb more viewers than just Oprah. It's filled with snapping necks, slit throats, rats and wrists draining crimson into goblets, and other bloody bits of necro-fun. But it's likely to thrill Anne Rice fans and seduce those unfamiliar with her books. Interviewed by a San Francisco journalist (Christian Slater), reluctant vampire Louis (Brad Pitt) goes back 200 years to torchlit New Orleans, recalling his role in the ultimate dysfunctional clan: himself, sadistic Lestat (Tom Cruise) who made him a vampire; and their ``child'' Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), whose golden curls mask a fierce hunger. Lestat is driven by appetite. Louis wants answers. His quest to find others of ``our kind'' drives the film into 19th- century Paris, introducing a clique of decadent undead (including Antonio Banderas and Stephen Rea). As a screenwriter, Rice doesn't hit her points as hard as she might, especially Louis' motivations. If you're unfamiliar with the book, you might find the going slow. And here's what you've been wondering: Cruise's Lestat is a dandy dandy; he could be more frightening, but the role hasn't been stretched into a vanity star turn. Pitt provides the eloquent heart of the movie. And Dunst, older than the novel's Claudia, conveys the character's anguish at being trapped in childhood. But the film's biggest triumph is its visual design, an opulent fusion of costumes (Sandy Powell), production design (Dante Ferretti) and cinematography (Philippe Rousselot). This ``Vampire'' has bite. -- Steve Murray   It Could Happen to You PG   This sweet nothing of a film pairs Nicolas Cage and Bridget Fonda in an appealing romantic fairy tale of love and the New York lottery. The film is too slight to be a grand romance, but it's definitely a winning one. Rated PG for mild language, adult situations.   Jason's Lyric R   It starts with the promise of something invigorating and fresh. It's the story of an African-American family living outside the usual inner-city setting of gangsta flicks. But director Doug McHenry carries urban cliches with him into the suburbs: drugs, guns and a whore-madonna view of women that's not very different from a rap video. Rated R for violence, sex, language and drug use. -- Steve Murray, staff writer   Lassie PG   Lassie comes home to the big screen in an engaging family film directed by Daniel Petrie. Set in rural Virginia, this savvily updated version (by ``Paper House's'' Matthew Jacob) has a lot more in common with the TV series than the novel or the 1943 movie. But even after 50 years, it's still the same old story: a boy and his wonder-dog. The boy is Matt (Thomas Guiry), an angry adolescent who resents his new stepmom (Helen Slater) almost as much as he resents his dad's (Jon Tenney) relocating the family from Baltimore to a sheep farm. The wonder-dog, of course, is Lassie who latches onto Matt when her owner is killed. Rated PG for mild violence.   The Last Seduction R   Probably the sleeper of the year. In the tradition of ``Double Indemnity'' and ``Body Heat,'' director John Dahl (``Red Rock West'') pairs a smart, sexy, no-good dame with a hunky sucker who's not half as smart as he thinks he is. Linda Fiorentino is a one-woman wrecking crew as a tough cookie with a lotta leg and even more nerve who easily gets nice-guy Peter Berg in her thrall. To reveal much more would spoil the movie's many twists, but let's just add that Bill Pullman plays one of her previous patsies and Bill Nunn is the private investigator Pullman puts on her trail. Thanks to their strong, steady work and Dahl's flashy direction, Steve Barancik's imaginative but far-fetched script gains considerable credibility. But the pivotal element here is Fiorentino whose portrayal of a master manipulator makes Sharon Stone look like a Girl Scout. Whether playing mind games or body games, she plays for keeps. Look for her name around Oscar-nomination time and go looking for this superbly entertaining picture immediately.   Little Giants PG   This time, the Bad News Bears . . . I mean, the Mighty Ducks . . . I mean . . . Let's start over. This time, a gang of lovable kiddie misfits pull together and become a heck of a Pee Wee League football team. The only discernable twist is that the Giants' coach (Rick Moranis) and the coach (Ed O'Neill) of the all- star opposing team are brothers with a long-standing rivalry. Given a fourth- down-and-long situation, director Duwayne Dunham punts for formula and lets his cast fumble along as best they can. Rated PG for mild language.   Little Rascals PG   Rent the originals. The idea of turning Hal Roach's famed ``Our Gang'' shorts into a feature for '90s audiences is a dubious one at best. And it's been done in the worst possible way. Director Penelope Spheeris has found a remarkable cast of look-alikes who seem to have been cloned from some hidden source of Little Rascals DNA. But as well-trained and well-made-up as these kids are, they are pod-Rascals -- an artful semblance of the real thing but totally devoid of freshness, naturalness or spontaneity. Rated PG for smutty language.   Love Affair PG-13   If this timeless tale of true romance worked for Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne in 1939 (``Love Affair'') and for Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr in 1957 (``An Affair to Remember''), then why shouldn't it work in 1994 for Warren Beatty and Annette Bening? Well, it does. To a point. This is a first-class effort and while it isn't quite the heartbreaker one hopes for, it still manages to jerk a few tears.   Mary Shelley's Frankenstein R   In Mary Shelley's classic 19th-century novel, medical student Victor Frankenstein learns that some things are better left to God. In this opulent, fever-pitched movie, director-star Kenneth Branagh learns that some things are better left to James Whale, the man who made the 1931 Karloff version. Not that Branagh's version is a total dud. But in its own way, it's as deliriously misguided as Shelley's mad-scientist protagonist. The problems begin with the casting of Robert De Niro as the Monster. His stitched-together mass of scar tissue may be closer to the novel than Karloff's plug-necked proletariat, but Karloff was an unknown and De Niro, well, is De Niro. Every time he appears, you think, gee, Travis Bickle's been run over by his own taxi. Also, Branagh has chosen to return to the original's Gothic-romance roots by emphasizing the relationship between Victor (Branagh) and his beloved Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter). That's fine as far as it goes -- and in these actors' talented hands, it goes pretty far -- but it has the effect of reducing the Monster to a bothersome interruption. Brimming with talent and dedication, the Branagh version never bores, but it never truly chills either.   The Mask PG-13   Forget the superhero plot of this live-action cartoon and focus on the Looney-Tunes special effects, the immensely likable Jim Carrey and Milo the mighty Jack Russell terrier. Directed by Chuck Russell. Rated PG-13 for mild violence.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941118.0072 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(4thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Miracle on 34th Street PG   It would be a miracle indeed if a John Hughes remake could come anywhere close to replicating the whimsical magic of the 1947 original starring Edmund Gwenn and Nathalie Wood. Alas, miracles don't happen every day and one certainly hasn't happened here. Despite a twinkly-eyed performance by Sir Richard Attenborough as The Man Who Would Be Santa and the gravelly voiced charm of little Mara Wilson as a non- believer ripe for conversion, this movie is staler than week-old fruitcake. Elizabeth Perkins plays a harried single mom who doesn't think her six-year-old daughter (Wilson) needs to believe in that ho-ho-ho stuff. Ironically, Perkins is the one who hires a mysterious gentleman named Kriss Kringle (Attenborough) to be her department store's seasonal Santa. As anyone who saw the original knows, Kringle ends up on trial, for claiming he really is Santa. Dylan McDermott is the lawyer who defends him and Robert Prosky is the judge with the hottest case this side of O.J. Though nominally directed by Les Mayfield, the film has the unmistakable Hughes imprint, meaning most of its charm is lost in the Hughesian overkill. This remake is as synthetic as a silver-foil Christmas tree. Harmless, perhaps, but hardly worth seeking out.   Natural Born Killers R Oliver Stone is a natural born moviemaker and a natural born troublemaker and this anarchic, almost surreal film shows both sides at their best. As emblematic of the disaffected, media-overload '90s as ``Bonnie and Clyde'' was of the '60s, ``Killers'' celebrates sex, violence and celebrity with a vengeance that's both visual and visceral. Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory (Juliette Lewis) are young, in love and they kill people. About 52 people before they're put in Tommy Lee Jones' jail. Rated R for extreme violence, gore, language, nudity and sexuality.   The Next Karate Kid PG   The new ``kid'' is a sullen teenaged girl named Julie, played by newcomer Hilary Swank. It's not a bad idea to show that a teen can have lips like Claudia Schiffer's and still beat the stuffing out of a bothersome guy. Noriyuki ``Pat'' Morita returns as Mr. Miyagi. Rated PG for violence.   Oleanna R   Cinematic saltpeter, it's a guaranteed date-night dampener. David Mamet's film of his off-Broadway power play can send men and women up the theater aisle, fuming for separate reasons. Charting a trio of disastrous meetings between a college professor (William H. Macy), and a student (Debra Eisenstadt) who's failing his class, the film is a paranoid reaction to the shifting sexual politics of the '90s: Patricia Bowman, Anita Hill, Tailhook, etc. We first meet Carol arriving sans appointment at John's office. The words that rain most often from her mouth are, ``I don't understand.'' But by their second encounter, she has morphed from a stammering coed to a coolly poised virago, equipped with a militantly drab wardrobe, a notably improved vocabulary, and the support of a student cabal whom she refers to as ``my group.'' The personality shift is abrupt, unexplained. Instead of a two-person, full-bodied drama, the movie turns into a symbolic standoff between an innocent man and a misogynist's nightmare. Sexless, anti-intellectual, tract-spouting, Carol becomes the sort of woman Rush Limbaugh and Camille Paglia would take turns hating. Mamet keeps the focus simple; he hardly ``opens up'' the play. And it's easy to admire the deft dialogue and the strong performances. Macy summons a natty self-satisfaction (you wouldn't mind seeing him deflated, but not crucified). Eisenstadt does as fine a job as possible with the role's limitations. In the end, Mamet comes up with Molotov cocktail that's almost too successful in making audiences see red. -- Steve Murray   Only You PG   If only Hollywood would make more movies like this fanciful Roman holiday, starring Marisa Tomei as a bride- to-be on a quixotic romantic quest in Italy and Robert Downey Jr. as a gallant suitor who may or may not be her only one. Rated PG for mild sexual themes.   The Professional R   French director Luc Besson (``La Femme Nikita'') goes American and his movie goes down the drain. Again, the stylish Frenchman dazzles us with explosions and massacres, killer babes and their world-weary mentors. But this time, the babe really is a babe -- a precocious 12-year-old (Natalie Portman) who takes up with a professional hitman (Jean Reno) after her family is wiped out by a crooked DEA agent (a hilariously hammy Gary Oldman). Initially, the bond formed between the pro and the preteen is tentative and touching; he may be the best killer in Manhattan, but his best friend is a house plant. She offers to clean house if he'll teach her to ``clean up,'' so she can avenge her family. Alas, Besson opts for a superfluous titillation factor, letting Portman walk around in budding-adolescent undershirts and do Madonna impersonations for Reno. He, in turn, stands around with his mouth hanging open, looking slightly stunned. Perhaps the most optimistic way to look at this film is as one exasperated Frenchman's attempt to circumvent the parasitical cycle of American remakes of French films. Besson probably figured that, if he'd made the film in Paris, some Hollywood producer would buy the remake rights, replace him as director and cast Clint Eastwood and one of the ``Full House'' twins.   Pulp Fiction R   Pop goes the pulp in this smashing sophomore effort by Quentin ``Reservoir Dogs'' Tarantino. Winner of the Golden Palm at Cannes and already subject to Oscar-time whispers, the picture is a gleefully lurid mix of hardboiled gangster-movie conventions and hip post-Warhol irony. It's an exceedingly violent genre flick with a twist -- everyone is in on the joke. Everyone, that is, except the characters on screen. The film consists of three expertly interwoven vignettes. The first tale centers on a couple of hit men (beautifully played by John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson) and Travolta's job babysitting his big, bad boss's (Ving Rhames) babe-licious wife (Uma Thurman). The second focuses on a boxer (Bruce Willis) who's been asked to take a dive. The third goes back to Travolta and Jackson who need Harvey Keitel's help disposing a dead body. Flashy, smart, daring and full of itself, the movie sometimes suggests ``Short Cuts'' with shootouts. Rated R for violence, language, nudity and drug use.   The Puppet Masters R   NASA scientist Dr. Mary Sefton (Julie Warner) has a unique test to determine whether a man is a full- blooded human or if he's possessed by an alien: She shows him her cleavage. This sexist device is one clue that ``The Puppet Masters'' originated as a 1951 Robert A. Heinlein novel. The premise is dated, the latest in a long line of sci-fi paranoia thrillers: Outer-space beasties leach onto human hosts and plot to overwhelm the world. Deduct points for freshness. But ``Masters'' bops with a brisk, nab-those-critters attitude. And the critters are a treat: gloppy manta rays that latch on to your back, jam a tether in your brain, and fuse with your nervous system. Like a good cigarette. -- Steve Murray   Quiz Show PG-13   Robert Redford's dazzlingly entertaining movie is set in the late '50s, when Americans were as hooked on quiz shows as later generations would be on Watergate or O.J.'s white Bronco. When the sponsor tires of ``Twenty-One's'' current wonder-boy, Herb Stempel (John Turturro), a schlemiel from Queens, he's replaced by Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), the handsome scion of an aristocratic, academic family. Van Doren becomes the nation's most adored egghead and Stempel spills the beans -- that the game is rigged -- to a congressional investigator (Rob Morrow). Rated PG-13 for adult themes.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941118.0073 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(5thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Radioland Murders PG   Just plain murder to sit through. This fiasco is the latest missive from the hermit-like George Lucas. Produced and written by Lucas and directed by Mel Smith (``The Tall Guy''), the movie means to be a farcical murder mystery set in 1939 at the art deco studios of WBN, a radio station trying to go national. Running around the overcrowded halls are a bickering husband-and-wife team (headwriter Brian Benben and executive-assistant-turned-de-facto-producer, Mary Stuart Masterson); a femme- fatale radio star (the late, very talented Anita Morris); a philandering director (Jeffrey Tambor), a no-nothing executive president (Ned Beatty) and a libidious announcer (Corbin Bernsen) . . . among others. While the show goes on (and everything falls into chaos), someone behindthe scenes is murdering the staff.   Red Rock West R   In this low-budget comic noir about greed, lust and cheatin' hearts, Nicholas Cage is a nice-guy drifter taught by the likes of Dennis Hopper and J.T. Walsh that no good deed ever goes unpunished. Directed by John Dahl. Rated R for violence, profanity and sex.   Renaissance Man PG-13   A bummer, man. Director Penny Marshall proves she can do predictable military schmaltz just as well (badly?) as the guys, with this Danny DeVito inspirational comedy that might well be subtitled ``Dead Poet's Platoon.''   Reservoir Dogs R   As in, one assumes, meaner than the junkyard variety. Quentin Tarentino's debut is an electrifyingly vicious caper flick, soaked in blood, obscenity and incongruous black humor. Most of the movie takes place immediately before and after a robbery gone terribly wrong. The ensemble cast -- headed by Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn and Tim Roth -- is a marvel, worthy of a Mamet play (which this film's profane energy often evokes).   The River Wild PG-13   Meryl Streep is a former white-water river guide, who views a rafting excursion in her old splashing grounds as more than a family vacation. It's a chance to spend quality time and heal rifts with workaholic husband Tom (David Strathairn) and son Roarke (Joseph Mazzello). Slithering into the family's domestic Eden, Kevin Bacon is a fellow rafter who turns vacation into hell, taking the family hostage and forcing Streep to pilot him safely down the river. The actors and the scenery keep your mind off a predictable plot; this is a B-movie graced with members of the Hollywood A- list. But the trip is worth it. Rated PG-13 for violence. -- Steve Murray, staff writer   The Road to Wellville R   Paved with good intentions. Like that other road. Alan Parker's health-craze comedy is an art-design folly with little more going for it than spectacle: Edwardian clothes, Anthony Hopkins with buckteeth, and cruel spa machines Jules Verne might have forged. Playing cereal czar and health nut John Harvey Kellogg, Hopkins creates a grand, blustery caricature. Unfortunately, Parker's adaptation of T. Coraghessan Boyle's novel has flurry in place of a plot. The welter of characters include a young cornflakes entrepreneur (John Cusack); Kellogg's prodigal son George (Dana Carvey); and Will and Eleanor Lightbody (Matthew Broderick and Bridget Fonda), whose physical ills cloak deeper marital problems. Fonda comes off as a mall rat in her great-grandma's clothes. Cusack goes over the top. Broderick gamely endures a lot of enema and bowel jokes, and shows off ab muscles more gym-developed than might be credible for a man of 1907. The movie blows its opportunities to score points about our own health-conscious age. It remains undernourished and dramatically anemic. Rated R for nudity, sexual situations. -- Steve Murray   The Santa Clause PG   The movie's moral is a peculiar one, even by Hollywood standards: The best way for a father to gain his son's respect is to pack on 50 pounds, grow a white beard and consort with elves. Thus it goes with Scott Calvin (Tim Allen), a divorced dad whose 8-year-old, Charlie (Eric Lloyd), would rather spend Christmas Eve with Mom (Wendy Crewson) and her new therapist hubby (Judge Reinhold). That is, until Santa tumbles off the roof, Scott straps on St. Nick's suit, and goes across the globe popping in and out of chimneys (aided by some computer effects that aren't as special as you'd hope). Amiable Allen wisecracks his way past snarling mutts and spying moppets (``Do you want this doll or not?'' he asks one recalcitrant tot). Then, at the North Pole, he finds out from the rainbow-coalition elves that -- gulp -- once you put on Santa's suit, you're Santa. For good. From here, the movie unreels as a cross between ``Miracle on 34th Street'' and a paranoid delusion. As the new year unfolds, Scott bloats up and goes white-haired and bewhiskered. Call it Clausitis: Santa overcomes his nervous system like an incurable disease. Allen's normal-guy shtick is terrific, but once he disappears inside the fat-suit, the movie's personality goes with him. Cuteness happens, magic doesn't. And if you have kids, be prepared to tell them something the movie never explains: What the heck happened to the original Santa, who evaporates into thin air? Ho ho huh? -- Steve Murray   The Shawshank Redemption R   There are two excellent reasons to see this involving movie and their names are Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. Based on a Stephen King novella, this is a stone-walls-do-not-a-prison-make story, in which hope flourishes in horrifying surroundings and a unique friendship is forged inside a human purgatory.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941118.0074 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(6thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Silent Fall R   When a prosperous couple is found brutally murdered in the bedroom of their Maryland mansion, the only witness is their 9-year-old son (Ben Faulkner). Unfortunately, the boy is also autistic, which prompts the local sheriff and the boy's protective older sister (model Liv Tyler) to bring in a once-prominent child shrink (Richard Dreyfuss), who quit treating kids after a tragedy befell a patient. While this solid suspense drama goes to great lengths to stress that autism isn't an easily understandable condition, it also uses the boy's state as a plot contrivance to get Dreyfuss involved. Rated R for violence, language and adult themes.   The Specialist R   Sylvester Stallone's specialty has been to turn a one-note act into a multimillion-dollar career. But the specialist specified here is a former CIA explosives expert hired by a rich lovely (Sharon Stone) to wipe out the bad guys who killed her parents when she was just a kid. That means taking on Miami mobsters led by patriarch Rod Steiger (doing an embarrassing Jose Jimenez accent), his sleazy son (Eric Roberts) and his equally sleazy consigliere (James Woods, who used to be in the CIA with Sly until they had a falling out over innocent bystanders). At its best, the film is like ``Death Wish'' warmed-over, with hints of ``The Bodyguard.'' However, the expected sparks between Stallone and Stone never ignite.   Speed R   The perfect summer- movie rush. The gimmick is simple: A wacko (Dennis Hopper) has put a bomb on a city bus. When the bus hits 50 mph, the bomb goes on; if it slows below 50, the bomb goes off. And so the chase is on -- with a busload of terrified passengers, a hurt driver, a spunky civilian at the wheel (Sandra Bullock) and a very determined cop (Keanu Reeves) in pursuit. Directed by Jan De Bont. Rated R for violence and language.   Stargate PG-13   An engaging sci-fi yarn with a flying pyramid, three moons and Jaye Davidson in a dress. Again. We start on Earth, where a linguist named Daniel (James Spader) deciphers Egyptian hieroglyphics on a circular mechanism unearthed near the pyramids. It's the Stargate, a thingamajig that, when uncoded, becomes a portal to a twin gate on a sandy planet across the universe. Daniel gets enlisted for a space-jumping expedition, led by gruff Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell), since he's the only one who can crack the code on that second Stargate. But first they have to face the sun god Ra, (Davidson), a cosmic vampire. Like a Tintin adventure set in the cosmos, the movie has an enjoyable retro feel. But it's harder to get revved up by it. Director Roland Emmerich turns out serviceable action scenes, but it's Spielberg minus Spielberg. Rated PG-13 for violence. -- Steve Murray   Star Trek: Generations PG   This franchise boldly keeps going and going and going. In this incarnation, the torch is smoothly passed from one cast to the next as the aging members of the orginal '60s show are replaced by the ``Next Generation'' ensemble. Captains Picard (Patrick Stewart) and Kirk (William Shatner) join forces to defeat a mad scientist ('60s bad boy, Malcolm McDowell) who's willing to destroy whole galaxies in his frantic attempt to reach the Nexus, a place of illusionary contentment. In the ``Star Trek'' tradition, ``Generations'' offers a sprinkling of high-minded metaphysical musings along with a hearty dose of high-tech gimmickry (thus, the nature of mortality and Warp 4 come up in the same conversation). Scotty (James Doohan) and Chekov (Walter Koenig) turn up briefly, but most of the story is carried by Stewart's crew (Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Whoopi Goldberg, Michael Dorn, etc.). As for the battle of the starship captains, Stewart is patrician and compassionate, but Shatner's Hollywood-honed hamming steals every scene. Granted, the plot is incomprehensible and the logic nil; but the filmmakers have the proper respect for its characters and for the ongoing ``Star Trek'' mythos. They understand that, under the skin, we're all Trekkies.   The Swan Princess G   It's not Disney, but it's pretty decent. An animated musical from Richard Rich, who once worked for the Mouse, ``The Swan Princess'' tells of a true love that overcomes all obstacles. Prince Derek and Princess Odette, heirs to separate kingdoms, are brought together every summer by their parents, who hope the children's scrappy friendship will someday blossom into love. Nicely, ``Princess'' shows Derek and Odette mutually trying to find each other -- this isn't a damsel-in- distress scenario. The movie's pleasures come through amusing supporting characters (a turtle and frog, with voices by Steven Wright and John Cleese), some adult-friendly humor and songs propelled by clever lyrics that touch on everything from true love to political correctness. Though the animation varies between TV stiffness and Disney opulence, ``The Swan Princess'' is a pleasant holiday surprise that takes wing more often than not. -- Steve Murray, staff writer   Terminal Velocity PG-13   A free fall into silliness, this sky-diving thriller plays like Hitchcock Lite. It's preposterous. And a lot of fun. Charlie Sheen stars as Arizona sky diver Ditch Brodie whose latest student, a blond airhead named Chris (Nastassja Kinski), takes an early tumble out the plane door, and makes like a pancake. Then again, is that really her body on the desert floor? Rated PG-13 for violence, language.   Timecop R   A good rule of thumb: the less sense a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie makes, the more fun it is. Happily, this futuristic actioner is a welcome return to the sci-fi silliness of his most successful film to date, ``Universal Soldier.'' Van Damme plays a time-traveling cop who tries to stop a corrupt senator from changing history. Rated R for violence, language, brief sex and nudity.   Trial By Jury R   Jury tampering takes on a whole new dimension in this solid thriller- melodrama that replaces 12 angry men with one very angry woman. Juror Joanne Whalley-Kilmer doesn't start out mad; she feels jury duty is part of truth, justice and the American Way. However, when she's chosen by prosecutor Gabriel Byrne to sit in judgment on a smoothie mobster (Armande Assante), she learns otherwise. Rated R for violence, language and adult themes.   True Lies R   True trash. Too long, too loud and too expensive, this action farce is a pointless exercise in abuse of power, Hollywood-style. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis. Directed by James Cameron. Rated R for violence and language.   The War PG-13 A big-hearted bore from the maker of ``Fried Green Tomatoes.'' Director Jon Avnet returns to the South of a few years past, in this case small-town Mississippi, 1970. (It was mostly shot in Georgia.) Kevin Costner plays Stephen Simmons, a vet trying to hold a job while haunted by memories of 'Nam. We see him through the eyes of his kids, Stu (Elijah Wood) and Lidia (Lexi Randall), who spend the summer months building a treehouse -- and trying to avoid the white-trash Lipnicki clan. Unlike the plot-driven ``Tomatoes,'' ``War'' ambles with the humid sleepiness of one of its summer days. Somebody's always a-sittin' on a porch, talkin' about love and family and duty and dreams. Late in the movie, when a turf battle turns the kids' treehouse into an obvious anti-war allegory, you might have already tuned out due to the platitudes and melodrama. -- Steve Murray   Wes Craven's New Nightmare R   Wes Craven reclaims Freddy Krueger in this postmodern, Pirandellan funhouse of a movie -- a ``Player'' for the slasher set. When the execs at New Line (the actual makers of this movie) ask original ``Elm Street'' heroine Heather Langenkamp (as Herself) to reprise her role for the ``definitive `Nightmare,' '' she has doubts: She's been having these bad Freddy nightmares. So has her son (Miko Hughes, the scalpel baby from ``Pet Sematary''). Seems that the malevolent force behind the Krueger movies -- the real Freddy -- wants to cross into Real Life. Fun premise. Robert Englund, John Saxon and Craven pop up as Themselves. And it's nice to see Krueger returned to the roots of the first film -- a pre-wisecrack, hellish fiend. Rated R for gore, language. -- Steve Murray .  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941118.0075 type=story > <HEADLINE> TARA FANTASYLAND CLOSER TO REALITY NEAR VILLA RICA </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> VILLA RICA, Ga.

They move weekly to clients of the New York Times News Service.   G: General audiences. Nothing that would offend parents if viewed by children.   PG: Parental guidance suggested. May contain some material parents consider inappropriate for young children.   PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for preteens.   R: Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking children.   NC-17: No one under 17 admitted. Replaces the X rating.   NR: Not rated.   The Adventures of Priscilla,   Queen of the Desert R   The boys on the bus would rather be thought of as the girls on the bus in this spirited Aussie froth about two drag queens (Hugo Weaving and Guy Pearce) and a transsexual ('60s stud Terence Stamp) on a cross-country jaunt through the Outback. Rated R for sex-related situations and language.   Andre PG   Predictable but sweet, this seal saga is a decent primer for kids learning some basic lesson about family and friendship. But be forewarned: Andre's best trick is to blow derogatory raspberries. Don't be surprised if your kids pick up the habit. Starring Keith Carradine. Rated PG for scenes of animal endangerment. -- Steve Murray, staff writer   Angels in the Outfield PG   This kid-pleasing baseball fantasy about a lonely boy, a slumping baseball team and some divine intervention is a winged victory for Disney, thanks to a strong cast and heart-tugging plot. Think ``Free Willy'' with the California Angels instead of a whale. Starring Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd. Directed by William Dear. Rated PG for mild adult themes.   Baby's Day Out PG   A very long day indeed, for Baby and for the audience. This John Hughes-ian spin on ``The Ransom of Red Chief'' is best recommended to die-hard slapstick fans who've always wanted to see a remake of ``Three Men and a Baby,'' starring the Three Stooges. Rated PG for comic violence.   Barcelona PG-13   Set in Spain, Whit Stillman's literate, witty romantic comedy takes place within the socio-political context of ``the last decade of the Cold War.'' Starring Taylor Nichols and Chris Eigemann. Rated PG- 13 for language and violence.   Blankman PG-13   Daman Wayans stars as a nerdy inventor who becomes a bargain-basement superhero. The movie has a few humorous moments, at least enough to fill a five-minute ``In Living Color'' sketch, but stretched out to feature-film length, the joke wears more than a bit thin. Directed by Mike Binder. Rated PG-13 for profanity, some violence, and some sexual situations.   Blue Sky PG-13   Tommy Lee Jones and Jessica Lange give Oscar-worthy performances in this riveting family drama set against a backdrop of military coverups and abuse of power. Directed by Tony Richardson. Rated PG- 13 for sex, brief nudity and adult themes.   Bullets Over Broadway R   It's as if Woody Allen decided to make a movie like the movie-within-the-movie in ``The Purple Rose of Cairo.'' Working in his Runyon-esque ``Broadway Danny Rose'' mode, he takes us back to the Great White Way of the Roaring '20s, for a theater-centric farce that ends up debating the artist vs. the man (something Woody's probably heard a lot of recently). John Cusack is the ardent young playwright who believes in art and Jennifer Tilly is the no-talent moll whose gangster-boyfriend bankrolls his play so she can go onstage. Rated R for language, adult themes.   Clear and Present Danger PG-13   Even when this new installment in the Tom Clancy film-adaptation franchise is far from clear, it's dangerously entertaining. Reteaming director Phillip Noyce and star Harrison Ford as CIA analyst Jack Ryan, it's more convoluted than ``Patriot Games.'' But also more gripping. Rated PG-13 for some intense action, violence and language. -- Steve Murray, staff writer   Clerks R   Quirky, irreverent and about as off- the-cuff casual as a movie can be (even a $27,000 movie), this black-and-white no-budget-er has been a prize winner at Cannes and Sundance. Filmmaker Kevin Smith (who also appears in the picture as an enigmatic hanger-on named Silent Bob) gives us a day in the life of a couple of twentysomething Jersey guys named Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson). The two hold down dead-end jobs at, respectively, a Quick Stop convenience store and the neighboring hole-in-the-wall video store. Somewhere beyond slackers, they spend their days discussing the merits of ``The Empire Strikes Back'' vs. ``Return of the Jedi'' (``Justa bunch of Muppets'') while waiting on the usual eccentric crew of customers (like the guy who gets his hand stuck in a Pringle's potato chip can). The film looks just as raw as you'd expect, but it's also brimming with personality, humor and a genuine independent spirit. Absurdist, smutty and completely comfortable with itself, ``Clerks'' is grunge cinema at its best.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941125.0047 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(2ndtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> The Client PG-13   Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones are wonderful together in yet another John Grisham story. Unfortunately, they play supporting roles to a kid actor who's very impressive, but can't outshine them. Directed by Joel Schumacher. Rated PG-13 for violence and language.   Corrina, Corrina PG   In this beautifully acted, wonderfully perceptive comedy-drama, Whoopi Goldberg plays a '50s housekeeper who makes Mrs. Doubtfire look like W.C. Fields. Directed by Jessie Nelson. Rated PG for adult themes.   Crooklyn PG-13   Spike Lee's affectionate return to the Brooklyn of his youth is a sweet and funny change of pace. Starring Alfre Woodard, Delroy Lindo and Zelda Harris. Rated PG-13 for some profanity, scenes of neighborhood drug use, splintering family unit, kids pranks that include death of dog.   Double Dragon PG-13   This film version of the popular video game is a cynical attempt at duping young fans into paying to watch a 93-minute commercial for the game and its inevitable sequels. Yet it's also surprisingly grim, considering the target audience. Set in the year 2007, the film blithely presents a nightmarish city ravaged by smog, earthquakes and marauding gangs straight out of ``The Warriors.'' The plot -- less complex than a Pong tournament -- involves a futuristic struggle for a magic Chinese talisman that grants its possessor vague powers over the ``body and soul.'' Half of the ``Double Dragon'' is being guarded by the wise-cracking, kick-boxing Lee brothers -- played in an interesting bit of casting by Mark Dacascos (who looks Asian) and TV's ``Party of Five'' star Scott Wolf (who looks like Tom Cruise). The evil tycoon who holds the other half is played by Marietta native Robert Patrick, best known as the mighty morphin' cyborg in ``Terminator 2.'' Once again Patrick plays a character who shape-shifts, begging the question: Exactly what kind of typecasting is going on here? Can the guy do this in real life? -- Mark Binelli, free-lance writer   Drop Squad R   Part ``The Colored Museum,'' part ``The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,'' this fiercely engaging drama/satire looks at the often confusing issue of what it means to be African American. Directed by David Johnson; produced by Spike Lee. Starring Eriq La Salle (NBC's ``E.R.''). Rated R for violence, language and adult themes.   Ed Wood R   Tim Burton's hilarious and superbly crafted tribute to Ed Wood, the filmmaker who was once named the worst director in film history. Tim Burton concentrates on Wood's (Johnny Depp) '50s career, when he turned out such beyond-bad opuses as ``Plan 9 From Outer Space.'' Rated R for language and adult themes.   Exit to Eden R   Exit FROM Eden. Better still, don't go anywhere near it in the first place. Based on Anne Rice's soft-core S&AMP;M novel about a kind of leather-bar Fantasy Island, the film version has been ``improved'' by director Garry Marshall who's turned it into a kind of ``The Story of O'' meets ``Police Academy III.'' Marshall leavens Rice's kinky stuff with a made-up comic subplot about a pair of cops (Rosie O'Donnell and Dan Aykroyd) on the trail of a handsome photographer (``Strictly Ballroom's'' Paul Mercurio) who's inadvertently snapped some jewel thieves. Rated R for adult themes and language.   Forrest Gump PG-13   Tom Hanks is clueless in America in Robert Zemeckis's half-baked fable about an idiot-savant of sorts, skimming through the last half of the 20th century and colliding ``Zelig''-like with history. Rated PG-13 for adult themes.   Fresh NR   The boy in this hood really is a boy -- a 12-year-old named Fresh (Sean Nelson) who divides his time between junior high and running drugs. The most important person in his life, however, is his near-derelict dad (Samuel L. Jackson) who passes along his passion for chess and, in doing so, teaches Fresh the strategy and mental agility he needs to pull off a revenge-scenario that Michael Corleone would envy. Not rated, but there is drug use, violence, profanity and adult themes.   A Good Man in Africa R   A good deal of talent is wasted in this satire about the end of colonialism in a fictional African country. Starring Colin Friels and Sean Connery. Rated R for language, adult themes.   Hoop Dreams PG-13   Three hours of basketball may sound like 21/2 hours too many for most moviegoers, but this extraordinary documentary is about so much more than backboards and rebounds. It's a richly observed, superbly nuanced look at the American Dream through the eyes of two teenage NBA hopefuls. Directed by Steve James. Rated PG-13 for profanity and drug use.   I Don't Want to Talk About It PG-13   The ``It'' in this strangely affecting Argentinian film is the physicality of the daughter of a wealthy South American widow named Dona Leonor (Luisina Brando). Her teenager, Charlotte (Alejandra Podesta), is smart, loving, well-read, an accomplished pianist and a devoted daughter. She is also vertically challenged -- or, as they used to say, a dwarf. However, Dona Leonor won't say it (she also burns copies of ``Tom Thumb'') and she won't allow her neighbors to mention it either. The movie takes an odder-still twist when a mysterious roue (Marcello Mastroianni) comes to town and falls for Charlotte. The picture benefits from its bizarre set-up, a poetically Fellini-esque finale and Brando's chilling portrayal of a manipulative, overprotective parent. But director Maria Luisa Bemberg lets things go a bit flat in the middle and it's only thanks to Mastroianni's decades of expertise and innate courtly charisma that we remain interested during the slow spots. Still, the movie deserves points for acting, tone and originality; after all, how many movies try to mix psychotic denial and magic realism in one story?  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941125.0048 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(3rdtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> I Like It Like That R   A strong debut by young African-American filmmaker Darnell Martin, who deftly guides us through the mean streets of the Bronx and the complexities of the human heart. Rated R for language, adult themes and sex.   Interview With the Vampire R   As richly textured as a dark brocade, threaded with existential dread and drenched in plasma, Neil Jordan's film will disturb more viewers than just Oprah. It's filled with snapping necks, slit throats, rats and wrists draining crimson into goblets, and other bloody bits of necro-fun. But it's likely to thrill Anne Rice fans and seduce those unfamiliar with her books. Interviewed by a San Francisco journalist (Christian Slater), reluctant vampire Louis (Brad Pitt) goes back 200 years to torchlit New Orleans, recalling his role in the ultimate dysfunctional clan: himself, sadistic Lestat (Tom Cruise) who made him a vampire; and their ``child'' Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), whose golden curls mask a fierce hunger. Lestat is driven by appetite. Louis wants answers. His quest to find others of ``our kind'' drives the film into 19th- century Paris, introducing a clique of decadent undead (including Antonio Banderas and Stephen Rea). As a screenwriter, Rice doesn't hit her points as hard as she might, especially Louis' motivations. If you're unfamiliar with the book, you might find the going slow. And here's what you've been wondering: Cruise's Lestat is a dandy dandy; he could be more frightening, but the role hasn't been stretched into a vanity star turn. Pitt provides the eloquent heart of the movie. And Dunst, older than the novel's Claudia, conveys the character's anguish at being trapped in childhood. But the film's biggest triumph is its visual design, an opulent fusion of costumes (Sandy Powell), production design (Dante Ferretti) and cinematography (Philippe Rousselot). This ``Vampire'' has bite. -- Steve Murray   It Could Happen to You PG   This sweet nothing of a film pairs Nicolas Cage and Bridget Fonda in an appealing romantic fairy tale of love and the New York lottery. The film is too slight to be a grand romance, but it's definitely a winning one. Rated PG for mild language, adult situations.   Jason's Lyric R   It starts with the promise of something invigorating and fresh. It's the story of an African-American family living outside the usual inner-city setting of gangsta flicks. But director Doug McHenry carries urban cliches with him into the suburbs: drugs, guns and a whore-madonna view of women that's not very different from a rap video. Rated R for violence, sex, language and drug use. -- Steve Murray, staff writer   Lassie PG   Lassie comes home to the big screen in an engaging family film directed by Daniel Petrie. Set in rural Virginia, this savvily updated version (by ``Paper House's'' Matthew Jacob) has a lot more in common with the TV series than the novel or the 1943 movie. But even after 50 years, it's still the same old story: a boy and his wonder-dog. The boy is Matt (Thomas Guiry), an angry adolescent who resents his new stepmom (Helen Slater) almost as much as he resents his dad's (Jon Tenney) relocating the family from Baltimore to a sheep farm. The wonder-dog, of course, is Lassie who latches onto Matt when her owner is killed. Rated PG for mild violence.   The Last Seduction R   Probably the sleeper of the year. In the tradition of ``Double Indemnity'' and ``Body Heat,'' director John Dahl (``Red Rock West'') pairs a smart, sexy, no-good dame with a hunky sucker who's not half as smart as he thinks he is. Linda Fiorentino is a one-woman wrecking crew as a tough cookie with a lotta leg and even more nerve who easily gets nice-guy Peter Berg in her thrall. To reveal much more would spoil the movie's many twists, but let's just add that Bill Pullman plays one of her previous patsies and Bill Nunn is the private investigator Pullman puts on her trail. Thanks to their strong, steady work and Dahl's flashy direction, Steve Barancik's imaginative but far-fetched script gains considerable credibility. But the pivotal element here is Fiorentino whose portrayal of a master manipulator makes Sharon Stone look like a Girl Scout. Whether playing mind games or body games, she plays for keeps. Look for her name around Oscar-nomination time and go looking for this superbly entertaining picture immediately.   Little Giants PG   This time, the Bad News Bears . . . I mean, the Mighty Ducks . . . I mean . . . Let's start over. This time, a gang of lovable kiddie misfits pull together and become a heck of a Pee Wee League football team. The only discernable twist is that the Giants' coach (Rick Moranis) and the coach (Ed O'Neill) of the all- star opposing team are brothers with a long-standing rivalry. Given a fourth- down-and-long situation, director Duwayne Dunham punts for formula and lets his cast fumble along as best they can. Rated PG for mild language.   Little Rascals PG   Rent the originals. The idea of turning Hal Roach's famed ``Our Gang'' shorts into a feature for '90s audiences is a dubious one at best. And it's been done in the worst possible way. Director Penelope Spheeris has found a remarkable cast of look-alikes who seem to have been cloned from some hidden source of Little Rascals DNA. But as well-trained and well-made-up as these kids are, they are pod-Rascals -- an artful semblance of the real thing but totally devoid of freshness, naturalness or spontaneity. Rated PG for smutty language.   Love Affair PG-13   If this timeless tale of true romance worked for Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne in 1939 (``Love Affair'') and for Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr in 1957 (``An Affair to Remember''), then why shouldn't it work in 1994 for Warren Beatty and Annette Bening? Well, it does. To a point. This is a first-class effort and while it isn't quite the heartbreaker one hopes for, it still manages to jerk a few tears.   Mary Shelley's Frankenstein R   In Mary Shelley's classic 19th-century novel, medical student Victor Frankenstein learns that some things are better left to God. In this opulent, fever-pitched movie, director-star Kenneth Branagh learns that some things are better left to James Whale, the man who made the 1931 Karloff version. Not that Branagh's version is a total dud. But in its own way, it's as deliriously misguided as Shelley's mad-scientist protagonist. The problems begin with the casting of Robert De Niro as the Monster. His stitched-together mass of scar tissue may be closer to the novel than Karloff's plug-necked proletariat, but Karloff was an unknown and De Niro, well, is De Niro. Every time he appears, you think, gee, Travis Bickle's been run over by his own taxi. Also, Branagh has chosen to return to the original's Gothic-romance roots by emphasizing the relationship between Victor (Branagh) and his beloved Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter). That's fine as far as it goes -- and in these actors' talented hands, it goes pretty far -- but it has the effect of reducing the Monster to a bothersome interruption. Brimming with talent and dedication, the Branagh version never bores, but it never truly chills either.   The Mask PG-13   Forget the superhero plot of this live-action cartoon and focus on the Looney-Tunes special effects, the immensely likable Jim Carrey and Milo the mighty Jack Russell terrier. Directed by Chuck Russell. Rated PG-13 for mild violence.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941125.0049 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(4thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Miracle on 34th Street PG   It would be a miracle indeed if a John Hughes remake could come anywhere close to replicating the whimsical magic of the 1947 original starring Edmund Gwenn and Nathalie Wood. Alas, miracles don't happen every day and one certainly hasn't happened here. Despite a twinkly-eyed performance by Sir Richard Attenborough as The Man Who Would Be Santa and the gravelly voiced charm of little Mara Wilson as a non- believer ripe for conversion, this movie is staler than week-old fruitcake. Elizabeth Perkins plays a harried single mom who doesn't think her six-year-old daughter (Wilson) needs to believe in that ho-ho-ho stuff. Ironically, Perkins is the one who hires a mysterious gentleman named Kriss Kringle (Attenborough) to be her department store's seasonal Santa. As anyone who saw the original knows, Kringle ends up on trial, for claiming he really is Santa. Dylan McDermott is the lawyer who defends him and Robert Prosky is the judge with the hottest case this side of O.J. Though nominally directed by Les Mayfield, the film has the unmistakable Hughes imprint, meaning most of its charm is lost in the Hughesian overkill. This remake is as synthetic as a silver-foil Christmas tree. Harmless, perhaps, but hardly worth seeking out.   Natural Born Killers R Oliver Stone is a natural born moviemaker and a natural born troublemaker and this anarchic, almost surreal film shows both sides at their best. As emblematic of the disaffected, media-overload '90s as ``Bonnie and Clyde'' was of the '60s, ``Killers'' celebrates sex, violence and celebrity with a vengeance that's both visual and visceral. Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory (Juliette Lewis) are young, in love and they kill people. About 52 people before they're put in Tommy Lee Jones' jail. Rated R for extreme violence, gore, language, nudity and sexuality.   The Next Karate Kid PG   The new ``kid'' is a sullen teenaged girl named Julie, played by newcomer Hilary Swank. It's not a bad idea to show that a teen can have lips like Claudia Schiffer's and still beat the stuffing out of a bothersome guy. Noriyuki ``Pat'' Morita returns as Mr. Miyagi. Rated PG for violence.   Oleanna R   Cinematic saltpeter, it's a guaranteed date-night dampener. David Mamet's film of his off-Broadway power play can send men and women up the theater aisle, fuming for separate reasons. Charting a trio of disastrous meetings between a college professor (William H. Macy), and a student (Debra Eisenstadt) who's failing his class, the film is a paranoid reaction to the shifting sexual politics of the '90s: Patricia Bowman, Anita Hill, Tailhook, etc. We first meet Carol arriving sans appointment at John's office. The words that rain most often from her mouth are, ``I don't understand.'' But by their second encounter, she has morphed from a stammering coed to a coolly poised virago, equipped with a militantly drab wardrobe, a notably improved vocabulary, and the support of a student cabal whom she refers to as ``my group.'' The personality shift is abrupt, unexplained. Instead of a two-person, full-bodied drama, the movie turns into a symbolic standoff between an innocent man and a misogynist's nightmare. Sexless, anti-intellectual, tract-spouting, Carol becomes the sort of woman Rush Limbaugh and Camille Paglia would take turns hating. Mamet keeps the focus simple; he hardly ``opens up'' the play. And it's easy to admire the deft dialogue and the strong performances. Macy summons a natty self-satisfaction (you wouldn't mind seeing him deflated, but not crucified). Eisenstadt does as fine a job as possible with the role's limitations. In the end, Mamet comes up with Molotov cocktail that's almost too successful in making audiences see red. -- Steve Murray   Only You PG   If only Hollywood would make more movies like this fanciful Roman holiday, starring Marisa Tomei as a bride- to-be on a quixotic romantic quest in Italy and Robert Downey Jr. as a gallant suitor who may or may not be her only one. Rated PG for mild sexual themes.   The Professional R   French director Luc Besson (``La Femme Nikita'') goes American and his movie goes down the drain. Again, the stylish Frenchman dazzles us with explosions and massacres, killer babes and their world-weary mentors. But this time, the babe really is a babe -- a precocious 12-year-old (Natalie Portman) who takes up with a professional hitman (Jean Reno) after her family is wiped out by a crooked DEA agent (a hilariously hammy Gary Oldman). Initially, the bond formed between the pro and the preteen is tentative and touching; he may be the best killer in Manhattan, but his best friend is a house plant. She offers to clean house if he'll teach her to ``clean up,'' so she can avenge her family. Alas, Besson opts for a superfluous titillation factor, letting Portman walk around in budding-adolescent undershirts and do Madonna impersonations for Reno. He, in turn, stands around with his mouth hanging open, looking slightly stunned. Perhaps the most optimistic way to look at this film is as one exasperated Frenchman's attempt to circumvent the parasitical cycle of American remakes of French films. Besson probably figured that, if he'd made the film in Paris, some Hollywood producer would buy the remake rights, replace him as director and cast Clint Eastwood and one of the ``Full House'' twins.   Pulp Fiction R   Pop goes the pulp in this smashing sophomore effort by Quentin ``Reservoir Dogs'' Tarantino. Winner of the Golden Palm at Cannes and already subject to Oscar-time whispers, the picture is a gleefully lurid mix of hardboiled gangster-movie conventions and hip post-Warhol irony. It's an exceedingly violent genre flick with a twist -- everyone is in on the joke. Everyone, that is, except the characters on screen. The film consists of three expertly interwoven vignettes. The first tale centers on a couple of hit men (beautifully played by John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson) and Travolta's job babysitting his big, bad boss's (Ving Rhames) babe-licious wife (Uma Thurman). The second focuses on a boxer (Bruce Willis) who's been asked to take a dive. The third goes back to Travolta and Jackson who need Harvey Keitel's help disposing a dead body. Flashy, smart, daring and full of itself, the movie sometimes suggests ``Short Cuts'' with shootouts. Rated R for violence, language, nudity and drug use.   The Puppet Masters R   NASA scientist Dr. Mary Sefton (Julie Warner) has a unique test to determine whether a man is a full- blooded human or if he's possessed by an alien: She shows him her cleavage. This sexist device is one clue that ``The Puppet Masters'' originated as a 1951 Robert A. Heinlein novel. The premise is dated, the latest in a long line of sci-fi paranoia thrillers: Outer-space beasties leach onto human hosts and plot to overwhelm the world. Deduct points for freshness. But ``Masters'' bops with a brisk, nab-those-critters attitude. And the critters are a treat: gloppy manta rays that latch on to your back, jam a tether in your brain, and fuse with your nervous system. Like a good cigarette. -- Steve Murray   Quiz Show PG-13   Robert Redford's dazzlingly entertaining movie is set in the late '50s, when Americans were as hooked on quiz shows as later generations would be on Watergate or O.J.'s white Bronco. When the sponsor tires of ``Twenty-One's'' current wonder-boy, Herb Stempel (John Turturro), a schlemiel from Queens, he's replaced by Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), the handsome scion of an aristocratic, academic family. Van Doren becomes the nation's most adored egghead and Stempel spills the beans -- that the game is rigged -- to a congressional investigator (Rob Morrow). Rated PG-13 for adult themes.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941125.0050 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(5thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Radioland Murders PG   Just plain murder to sit through. This fiasco is the latest missive from the hermit-like George Lucas. Produced and written by Lucas and directed by Mel Smith (``The Tall Guy''), the movie means to be a farcical murder mystery set in 1939 at the art deco studios of WBN, a radio station trying to go national. Running around the overcrowded halls are a bickering husband-and-wife team (headwriter Brian Benben and executive-assistant-turned-de-facto-producer, Mary Stuart Masterson); a femme- fatale radio star (the late, very talented Anita Morris); a philandering director (Jeffrey Tambor), a no-nothing executive president (Ned Beatty) and a libidious announcer (Corbin Bernsen) . . . among others. While the show goes on (and everything falls into chaos), someone behindthe scenes is murdering the staff.   Red Rock West R   In this low-budget comic noir about greed, lust and cheatin' hearts, Nicholas Cage is a nice-guy drifter taught by the likes of Dennis Hopper and J.T. Walsh that no good deed ever goes unpunished. Directed by John Dahl. Rated R for violence, profanity and sex.   Renaissance Man PG-13   A bummer, man. Director Penny Marshall proves she can do predictable military schmaltz just as well (badly?) as the guys, with this Danny DeVito inspirational comedy that might well be subtitled ``Dead Poet's Platoon.''   Reservoir Dogs R   As in, one assumes, meaner than the junkyard variety. Quentin Tarentino's debut is an electrifyingly vicious caper flick, soaked in blood, obscenity and incongruous black humor. Most of the movie takes place immediately before and after a robbery gone terribly wrong. The ensemble cast -- headed by Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn and Tim Roth -- is a marvel, worthy of a Mamet play (which this film's profane energy often evokes).   The River Wild PG-13   Meryl Streep is a former white-water river guide, who views a rafting excursion in her old splashing grounds as more than a family vacation. It's a chance to spend quality time and heal rifts with workaholic husband Tom (David Strathairn) and son Roarke (Joseph Mazzello). Slithering into the family's domestic Eden, Kevin Bacon is a fellow rafter who turns vacation into hell, taking the family hostage and forcing Streep to pilot him safely down the river. The actors and the scenery keep your mind off a predictable plot; this is a B-movie graced with members of the Hollywood A- list. But the trip is worth it. Rated PG-13 for violence. -- Steve Murray, staff writer   The Road to Wellville R   Paved with good intentions. Like that other road. Alan Parker's health-craze comedy is an art-design folly with little more going for it than spectacle: Edwardian clothes, Anthony Hopkins with buckteeth, and cruel spa machines Jules Verne might have forged. Playing cereal czar and health nut John Harvey Kellogg, Hopkins creates a grand, blustery caricature. Unfortunately, Parker's adaptation of T. Coraghessan Boyle's novel has flurry in place of a plot. The welter of characters include a young cornflakes entrepreneur (John Cusack); Kellogg's prodigal son George (Dana Carvey); and Will and Eleanor Lightbody (Matthew Broderick and Bridget Fonda), whose physical ills cloak deeper marital problems. Fonda comes off as a mall rat in her great-grandma's clothes. Cusack goes over the top. Broderick gamely endures a lot of enema and bowel jokes, and shows off ab muscles more gym-developed than might be credible for a man of 1907. The movie blows its opportunities to score points about our own health-conscious age. It remains undernourished and dramatically anemic. Rated R for nudity, sexual situations. -- Steve Murray   The Santa Clause PG   The movie's moral is a peculiar one, even by Hollywood standards: The best way for a father to gain his son's respect is to pack on 50 pounds, grow a white beard and consort with elves. Thus it goes with Scott Calvin (Tim Allen), a divorced dad whose 8-year-old, Charlie (Eric Lloyd), would rather spend Christmas Eve with Mom (Wendy Crewson) and her new therapist hubby (Judge Reinhold). That is, until Santa tumbles off the roof, Scott straps on St. Nick's suit, and goes across the globe popping in and out of chimneys (aided by some computer effects that aren't as special as you'd hope). Amiable Allen wisecracks his way past snarling mutts and spying moppets (``Do you want this doll or not?'' he asks one recalcitrant tot). Then, at the North Pole, he finds out from the rainbow-coalition elves that -- gulp -- once you put on Santa's suit, you're Santa. For good. From here, the movie unreels as a cross between ``Miracle on 34th Street'' and a paranoid delusion. As the new year unfolds, Scott bloats up and goes white-haired and bewhiskered. Call it Clausitis: Santa overcomes his nervous system like an incurable disease. Allen's normal-guy shtick is terrific, but once he disappears inside the fat-suit, the movie's personality goes with him. Cuteness happens, magic doesn't. And if you have kids, be prepared to tell them something the movie never explains: What the heck happened to the original Santa, who evaporates into thin air? Ho ho huh? -- Steve Murray   The Shawshank Redemption R   There are two excellent reasons to see this involving movie and their names are Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. Based on a Stephen King novella, this is a stone-walls-do-not-a-prison-make story, in which hope flourishes in horrifying surroundings and a unique friendship is forged inside a human purgatory.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941125.0053 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(6thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Silent Fall R   When a prosperous couple is found brutally murdered in the bedroom of their Maryland mansion, the only witness is their 9-year-old son (Ben Faulkner). Unfortunately, the boy is also autistic, which prompts the local sheriff and the boy's protective older sister (model Liv Tyler) to bring in a once-prominent child shrink (Richard Dreyfuss), who quit treating kids after a tragedy befell a patient. While this solid suspense drama goes to great lengths to stress that autism isn't an easily understandable condition, it also uses the boy's state as a plot contrivance to get Dreyfuss involved. Rated R for violence, language and adult themes.   The Specialist R   Sylvester Stallone's specialty has been to turn a one-note act into a multimillion-dollar career. But the specialist specified here is a former CIA explosives expert hired by a rich lovely (Sharon Stone) to wipe out the bad guys who killed her parents when she was just a kid. That means taking on Miami mobsters led by patriarch Rod Steiger (doing an embarrassing Jose Jimenez accent), his sleazy son (Eric Roberts) and his equally sleazy consigliere (James Woods, who used to be in the CIA with Sly until they had a falling out over innocent bystanders). At its best, the film is like ``Death Wish'' warmed-over, with hints of ``The Bodyguard.'' However, the expected sparks between Stallone and Stone never ignite.   Speed R   The perfect summer- movie rush. The gimmick is simple: A wacko (Dennis Hopper) has put a bomb on a city bus. When the bus hits 50 mph, the bomb goes on; if it slows below 50, the bomb goes off. And so the chase is on -- with a busload of terrified passengers, a hurt driver, a spunky civilian at the wheel (Sandra Bullock) and a very determined cop (Keanu Reeves) in pursuit. Directed by Jan De Bont. Rated R for violence and language.   Stargate PG-13   An engaging sci-fi yarn with a flying pyramid, three moons and Jaye Davidson in a dress. Again. We start on Earth, where a linguist named Daniel (James Spader) deciphers Egyptian hieroglyphics on a circular mechanism unearthed near the pyramids. It's the Stargate, a thingamajig that, when uncoded, becomes a portal to a twin gate on a sandy planet across the universe. Daniel gets enlisted for a space-jumping expedition, led by gruff Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell), since he's the only one who can crack the code on that second Stargate. But first they have to face the sun god Ra, (Davidson), a cosmic vampire. Like a Tintin adventure set in the cosmos, the movie has an enjoyable retro feel. But it's harder to get revved up by it. Director Roland Emmerich turns out serviceable action scenes, but it's Spielberg minus Spielberg. Rated PG-13 for violence. -- Steve Murray   Star Trek: Generations PG   This franchise boldly keeps going and going and going. In this incarnation, the torch is smoothly passed from one cast to the next as the aging members of the orginal '60s show are replaced by the ``Next Generation'' ensemble. Captains Picard (Patrick Stewart) and Kirk (William Shatner) join forces to defeat a mad scientist ('60s bad boy, Malcolm McDowell) who's willing to destroy whole galaxies in his frantic attempt to reach the Nexus, a place of illusionary contentment. In the ``Star Trek'' tradition, ``Generations'' offers a sprinkling of high-minded metaphysical musings along with a hearty dose of high-tech gimmickry (thus, the nature of mortality and Warp 4 come up in the same conversation). Scotty (James Doohan) and Chekov (Walter Koenig) turn up briefly, but most of the story is carried by Stewart's crew (Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Whoopi Goldberg, Michael Dorn, etc.). As for the battle of the starship captains, Stewart is patrician and compassionate, but Shatner's Hollywood-honed hamming steals every scene. Granted, the plot is incomprehensible and the logic nil; but the filmmakers have the proper respect for its characters and for the ongoing ``Star Trek'' mythos. They understand that, under the skin, we're all Trekkies.   The Swan Princess G   It's not Disney, but it's pretty decent. An animated musical from Richard Rich, who once worked for the Mouse, ``The Swan Princess'' tells of a true love that overcomes all obstacles. Prince Derek and Princess Odette, heirs to separate kingdoms, are brought together every summer by their parents, who hope the children's scrappy friendship will someday blossom into love. Nicely, ``Princess'' shows Derek and Odette mutually trying to find each other -- this isn't a damsel-in- distress scenario. The movie's pleasures come through amusing supporting characters (a turtle and frog, with voices by Steven Wright and John Cleese), some adult-friendly humor and songs propelled by clever lyrics that touch on everything from true love to political correctness. Though the animation varies between TV stiffness and Disney opulence, ``The Swan Princess'' is a pleasant holiday surprise that takes wing more often than not. -- Steve Murray, staff writer   Terminal Velocity PG-13   A free fall into silliness, this sky-diving thriller plays like Hitchcock Lite. It's preposterous. And a lot of fun. Charlie Sheen stars as Arizona sky diver Ditch Brodie whose latest student, a blond airhead named Chris (Nastassja Kinski), takes an early tumble out the plane door, and makes like a pancake. Then again, is that really her body on the desert floor? Rated PG-13 for violence, language.   Timecop R   A good rule of thumb: the less sense a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie makes, the more fun it is. Happily, this futuristic actioner is a welcome return to the sci-fi silliness of his most successful film to date, ``Universal Soldier.'' Van Damme plays a time-traveling cop who tries to stop a corrupt senator from changing history. Rated R for violence, language, brief sex and nudity.   Trial By Jury R   Jury tampering takes on a whole new dimension in this solid thriller- melodrama that replaces 12 angry men with one very angry woman. Juror Joanne Whalley-Kilmer doesn't start out mad; she feels jury duty is part of truth, justice and the American Way. However, when she's chosen by prosecutor Gabriel Byrne to sit in judgment on a smoothie mobster (Armande Assante), she learns otherwise. Rated R for violence, language and adult themes.   True Lies R   True trash. Too long, too loud and too expensive, this action farce is a pointless exercise in abuse of power, Hollywood-style. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis. Directed by James Cameron. Rated R for violence and language.   The War PG-13 A big-hearted bore from the maker of ``Fried Green Tomatoes.'' Director Jon Avnet returns to the South of a few years past, in this case small-town Mississippi, 1970. (It was mostly shot in Georgia.) Kevin Costner plays Stephen Simmons, a vet trying to hold a job while haunted by memories of 'Nam. We see him through the eyes of his kids, Stu (Elijah Wood) and Lidia (Lexi Randall), who spend the summer months building a treehouse -- and trying to avoid the white-trash Lipnicki clan. Unlike the plot-driven ``Tomatoes,'' ``War'' ambles with the humid sleepiness of one of its summer days. Somebody's always a-sittin' on a porch, talkin' about love and family and duty and dreams. Late in the movie, when a turf battle turns the kids' treehouse into an obvious anti-war allegory, you might have already tuned out due to the platitudes and melodrama. -- Steve Murray   Wes Craven's New Nightmare R   Wes Craven reclaims Freddy Krueger in this postmodern, Pirandellan funhouse of a movie -- a ``Player'' for the slasher set. When the execs at New Line (the actual makers of this movie) ask original ``Elm Street'' heroine Heather Langenkamp (as Herself) to reprise her role for the ``definitive `Nightmare,' '' she has doubts: She's been having these bad Freddy nightmares. So has her son (Miko Hughes, the scalpel baby from ``Pet Sematary''). Seems that the malevolent force behind the Krueger movies -- the real Freddy -- wants to cross into Real Life. Fun premise. Robert Englund, John Saxon and Craven pop up as Themselves. And it's nice to see Krueger returned to the roots of the first film -- a pre-wisecrack, hellish fiend. Rated R for gore, language. -- Steve Murray .  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941125.0054 type=story > <HEADLINE> : BUMPER '94 CORN HARVEST </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> RANDALL, Iowa  (BC-CORN-CORNUCOPIA-ART-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"

She is Elizabeth McCaughey, the Republican lieutenant governor-elect of New York; he is Wilbur Ross Jr., an investment banker who has been a fund-raiser and financial contributor to Democratic campaigns.   Ms. McCaughey, 46, an academic from the Manhattan Institute think tank, earned a spot on the ticket last November for her published attacks on the Clinton health care plan.   Ross, 55, senior managing director with Rothschild Inc., has a spot of his own, on President Clinton's Fund for Large Enterprises in Russia.   The two became engaged discreetly a couple of weeks ago when she gave him a birthday party at La Cote Basque. ``It was a small gathering and Wilbur was swept away, I think, by the wonderful party she threw for him,'' said Lisa Linden, a spokeswoman for Ms. McCaughey (the name is pronounced McCoy).   The official engagement party is set for Feb. 8 -- exactly one year after their first date. ``It will be a big bash,'' Ms. Linden said, ``with all their friends and family.''   The first marriages of both Ms. McCaughey and Ross ended in divorce. No date has been set for the wedding, but the couple said it would take place sometime next year. Since she has three children enrolled in schools in Manhattan, Ms. McCaughey, known as Betsy, plans to divide her time between New York and Albany after she is sworn in.   Asked if Ms. McCaughey planned to keep her name after the marriage, Ross said he did not know, but he rather thought so.   Otherwise, she'd be Betsy Ross.   NEW YORK -- Catherine Dickens will be in the Winter Garden at the World Financial Center this weekend, contemplating Christmas past. Really past. The one of 151 years ago, when her great-great-great grandfather Charles Dickens wrote ``A Christmas Carol.''   She won't be cooking a prize goose, but she and her parents, Christopher Charles Dickens and Jeanne-Marie Dickens, who live in England, will be signing and selling paperback copies of the book.   Proceeds of the sale will go to New York Downtown Hospital's pediatric division, she said.   The family will wax Dickensian in the indoor garden Saturday and Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m. They will also discuss the Charles Dickens Heritage Foundation, which was founded three years ago by Jeanne-Marie Dickens, a Hungarian countess by birth.   The foundation is supported by the sale of American-made Dickensiana. There's a replica of a Dickens desk and a ceramic village with electrified Pickwickian inns and such. One-third of the royalties from the sales will go to the foundation, the family said.   When not keeping Christmas, Catherine Dickens manages a small hotel in the British Virgin Islands with her husband, Jonathan Charles Dickens.   ``Before we got married,'' she recalled, ``I said, `Jon, you'll have to take my name.'

At least 24 people were reported to have died Thursday in Grozny as bombs and shells hit apartment blocks and strategic targets like the Lenin oil refinery, causing panic in the streets.   Some missiles and bombs, the first heavy daylight air attacks on Grozny, hit crowds of people who were working to clear away the debris from nighttime bombing.   Russian officials said the intense bombing raids over Grozny would continue through the night as a prelude to ``resolute steps'' to try to end what has become a full-blown military and political crisis in Moscow.   BETHLEHEM (NYT) -- It was supposed to be a different Christmas season here this year, brimming with the spirit of peace and hopes for the expansion of Palestinian autonomy to the entire West Bank.   But preparations in this town of 50,000 seem joyless during this holiday season, the first since the start of Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho.   The Israeli army still controls security and access to the Manger Square and the Church of the Nativity, venerated as the site of Jesus's birth. The thousands of pilgrims attending Christmas Eve services here will see little change this year aside from the Palestinian flags added to decorations put up by the municipality. The red, green, black and white banners, once outlawed by Israel, were hoisted this week above city hall.   TOKYO (NYT) -- In what could be another step toward reducing its isolation, North Korea announced Thursday that it is planning to allow commercial airlines from other countries to fly over its territory and land at its airports.   The government controlled Korean Central News Agency said that North Korea would offer ``the facilities and services for appropriate airline operation without discrimination'' to foreign aircraft. It said North Korea in particular wants to establish an air route linking Tokyo and Beijing through Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.   Analysts said the move could improve North Korea's international economic relations, but cautioned that it is unclear how far the Communist nation is willing to go.   ROME -- Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi resigned Thursday in the face of a revolt within his ruling alliance, leaving the country in deep confusion only seven months after he took office promising a new era of stability and prosperity.   Italians facing confusion, possible elections and the near-certainty that, whatever their next government, it will not survive for long.   Berlusconi handed his resignation to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who, in turn ''reserved judgement'' on whether to accept it - a formality designed to allow Berlusconi to stay on as caretaker while the president seeks a way out of the impasse.   UNITED NATIONS (NYT) -- About to be stripped of their military protection as the Somalia peacekeeping operation winds down, the international relief agencies working in the country appealed Thursday for $70.3 million in emergency funds to keep Somalis from slipping back into starvation and disease, for at least the next six months.   ``The U.N. agencies are committed to remaining in Somalia during and after the withdrawal of Unosom,'' Peter Hansen, under secretary general for Humanitarian Affairs, told reporters Thursday, referring to the U.N. mission.   But he acknowledged that there were no guarantees that relief and rehabilitation work will be able to continue in all parts of the country and warned that increased fighting was possible. He said that the U.N. agencies -- denied international police support or aircraft for evacuation by the Security Council -- were planning for the worst.   TOKYO (NYT) -- Japan's electronics industry, creeping back from a long slump, registered an increase in production in 1994 for the first time in three years, the Electronic Industries Association of Japan said Thursday.   The gain resulted from a slight improvement in demand for electronics products in Japan, but mainly from strong shipments to the United States and Asia of computer chips and flat panel displays to be made into personal computers and other products.   But production of consumer electronics equipment in Japan fell by nearly 9.7 percent in 1994 as Japanese companies shifted their manufacturing of television sets, video recorders and stereo systems to countries with lower wages, in part to escape the effects of the strong Japanese yen.   MEXICO CITY (NYT) -- On Wall Street and other financial capitals, they told a wonderful tale called ``The Mexico Story:'' Closed, quasi-socialist economy is thrown open by bold, Ivy-trained technocrats. Nationalists embrace privatization and free trade. Investment pours in, inflation is vanquished, democracy takes root. Billionaires proliferate; the poor look up.   Then, in what seemed an instant, the story changed.   After the government's announcement Wednesday night that it would abandon its defense of the peso and let the currency trade freely against the dollar, Mexicans awoke to a country that most of them had consigned to a dark past. It is a place of surging inflation, recession and myriad uncertainties.   The sudden collapse is in fact neither so sudden nor so complete. In the longer run, investors with stakes in Mexico were quick to point out, the economy will have a more solid foundation if the peso can now be wrestled down to a more stable, if weaker level.   WASHINGTON (NYT) -- , Dec. 22 -- With North Korea having released the body of one American pilot, the White House Thursday voiced regret that his heliocpter crossed into North Korea and urged that country to release a second pilot who survived the crash.   ``I think certainly he regrets the incident,'' the White House press secretary, Dee Dee Myers, said of the surviving pilot. ``It was unnecessary, I think, in our view.

"11572"	"I"	"think"	" Liberals make the mistake of identifying Limbaugh as a self-appointed political ... well, ``savant'' was, I think, a word that one writer inserted at this point. That isn't quite right. I don't care for Limbaugh. I think he has a shaky regard for the truth (while some listeners seem to think he is reporting news, which he is not), and he's too mean-spirited for my taste. But it is wrong to miss the point that he mostly makes people laugh by skewering those they already dislike. I may not enjoy the point of the material, but much of it is intended as humor, and for those who think pouring kerosene on cats is a rib-tickler, I guess it hits the mark. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"

"12094"	"I"	"think"	" Not all of Dr. Seuss's steps to glory are to be admired, though, and only time and public opinion will decide which ones Mr. Gingrich really buys.

"12095"	"I"	"think"	" McGurk, I think, like Gingrich, seems a visionary for a good end. But his means of getting to be ringmaster may leave something to be desired. Gingrich says his political strategy wasn't born of Ivy League think tanks or Washington consultants. Maybe there's reason to suspect it was pure Seuss. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"
"12168"	"I"	"think"	" ``Restructuring is going to be difficult,'' said Gene Corrigan, the new NCAA president. ``I'm surprised at how far along they have gotten and how fast they have gotten to where they are. But the next step, I think, is going to be more tedious.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"

"12293"	"I"	"think"	" It has not always been this way. Traditionally, I think, our culture has been a bit suspicious of style, fearing somehow that if you have too much, you must lack substance, and vice versa.

"12398"	"I"	"think"	" Second only to the dog, the horse is humankind's best friend and most useful animate servant. Dogs are smarter, of course. For all their lovable qualities, most horses aren't enormously bright. The term ``horse sense'' refers less, I think, to the IQ of the four-legged beast than to what we bipeds can learn from horses. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"

"12744"	"I"	"think"	" ``But for Marianne and me to have tried in every way we could to be totally honest, for us to have lived on limited incomes, for us to be scrupulous about what we've done and then to have the news media of this city used as a tool of the Democratic Party, to just go out and again and again and again, in a one-sided way, is, I think, a despicable comment on how sick this city got,'' he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"
"12770"	"I"	"think"	" ``That made a difference in the game, I think,'' said tackle Harry Swayne, noting that the offensive front was particularly hard hit. ``We had our chances to score but didn't take advantage of it.

"16123"	"we"	"think"	" The more difficult question in this case is whether the Curtiss-Wright reservation clause contains a ``procedure for amending (the) plan.'' To recall, the reservation clause says in effect that the plan may be amended ``by the Company.'' Curtiss-Wright is correct, we think, that this states an amendment procedure and one that, like the identification procedure, is more substantial than might first appear. It says the plan may be amended by a unilateral company decision to amend, and only by such a decision and not, for example, by the unilateral decision of a third-party trustee or upon the approval of the union. Moreover, to the extent that this procedure is the barest of procedures, that is because the CurtissWright plan is the simplest of plans: a voluntarily maintained single-employer health plan that is administered by the employer and funded by the employer. More complicated plans, such as multiemployer plans, may have more complicated amendment procedures, and s402(b)(3) was designed to cover them as well. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"

Principles of liberty fundamental enough to have been embodied within constitutional guarantees are not readily erased from the Nation's consciousness. A governmental practice that has become general throughout the United States, and particularly one that has the validation of long, accepted usage, bears a strong presumption of constitutionality. And that is what we have before us here. Section 3599.09(A) was enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Ohio almost 80 years ago. See Act of May 27, 1915, 1915 Ohio Leg. Acts 350. Even at the time of its adoption, there was nothing unique or extraordinary about it. The earliest statute of this sort was adopted by Massachusetts in 1890, little more than 20 years after the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. No less than 24 States had similar laws by the end of World War I, (footnote 1) and today every State of the Union except California has one, (footnote 2) as does the District of Columbia, see D. C. Code Ann. s1-1420 (1992), and as does the Federal Government where advertising relating to candidates for federal office is concerned, see 2 U. S. C. s441d(a).

"24454"	"I"	"think"	" Marquis Grissom, who started the season almost as slowly as Klesko, has six hits in the last three days. ``Thanks to extra batting practice and talking to Fred McGriff and (batting coach) Clarence Jones,'' Grissom said. ``That's what teammates and coaches are all about.'' . . . Grissom has has a different view of hitting slumps than Klesko: ``It's all mental, I think, not mechanical.'' . . . As long as this winning streak lasts, don't expect Grissom to budge from the No. 2 spot in the batting order (or rookie right fielder Brian Kowitz from leadoff). Cox moved Grissom from leadoff to No. 2 Monday, and baseball people are far too superstitious to tinker with a winning lineup. . . . Grissom, by the way, says he has no preference where he bats: ``leadoff, second, third, fourth, eighth, whatever.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

"24467"	"I"	"think"	" Time and time again the feathered world went out of its way to welcome us as friends and confidants. A tiny goldfinch hopped onto Jessie's front steps to show us, I think, how a baby bird discovers it can fly. Chickadees built nests in the eaves above our back porch so that whenever I went outside, I heard the song of hungry baby birds. A cardinal startled me one morning by flinging herself against the window of my living room, over and over and over again. Another time, I was astounded to come across a large gull wing in perfect condition on the beach.

Applying Morris' scholarship to the gestures of three would-be Republican presidential nominees:  _ Pete Wilson's Thumb Up means ``Long Live the Basques!''

It is, in effect, an adult version of thumb-sucking.''  SECURITY ADVISER SQUEALS WITH JOY  White House National Security Adviser Anthony Lake told Newsweek that he was so excited last week when he learned of the rescue of fighter pilot Scott O'Grady in Bosnia that he just couldn't contain the news.  After learning that the mission had been successful, said Lake, he left the White House to drive home, stopping at a 7-Eleven at 2:30 a.m. to buy a few celebratory cupcakes.  A policemen pouring himself a cup of coffee was an irresistible confidante. ``Can I tell you something that no one else in the world knows?'' asked Lake.  The cop looked up at him. ``You know that pilot that was shot down over Bosnia?''  ``Yeah?'' said the cop.  ``We just got him home,'' said Lake, on his way out of the store. ``Who are you?'' asked the cop. ``I just work for the government,'' said Lake.  STEVE YOUNG HAS PROBLEMS  When posed the question, ``What is your greatest fashion challenge?'' Steve Young, 49er quarterback, Most Valuable Player of the Super Bowl and Macy's poster boy, was reflective:  ``I think,'' he said, ``to me, people expect now that I'll be able to put some kind of ensemble together _ things that go together, things that make sense. ... The problem now is that as I try to get into nicer suits I ask, `Does this really go?' And I have the confidence that, you know what, I think, but I'm not sure.''  BRYANT GUMBEL ON HIS COLLEAGUES AND HIMSELF  ``Today'' show host Bryant Gumbel tells TV Guide this week that he thinks CBS was right to fire Connie Chung from her job as co-anchor of the ``CBS Evening News.''  ``I'm a big Dan Rather fan,'' said Gumbel. ``It's a better program with him alone. He's the one with credibility.''  Gumbel took a slap at critics who have said he has a big ego. ``I find it odd,'' he said, ``that the charge is never leveled at Ted Koppel or Peter Jennings or anybody else in the business. At that point, you have to start to wonder, why is it only coming at me.''  He went on to speculate. ``I think for a lot of people it's race. To suggest there's no racial aspects to judgment about me is naive. ... There are a lot of people who are uncomfortable with the idea of a black man being their intellectual or economic or social equal or superior.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950611.0117 type=story > <HEADLINE> IBM'S LOTUS ACQUISITION SEEN AS FIRST SHOT IN WAR ON MICROSOFT </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> Armonk, New York, June 11 (Bloomberg) (BC-IBM-MICROSOFT-AIM-BLOOM) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"24870"	"we"	"think"	" As Judge Friendly observed, the Declaratory Judgment Act ``does not speak,'' on its face, to the question whether discretion to entertain declaratory judgment actions is vested in district courts alone or in the entire judicial system. Friendly, Indiscretion about Discretion, 31 Emory L. J. 747, 778 (1982). The Court of Appeals reviewed the District Court's decision to stay London Underwriters' action for abuse of discretion, and found none. London Underwriters urge us to follow those other Courts of Appeals that review decisions to grant (or to refrain from granting) declaratory relief de novo. See, e. g., Genentech, Inc. v. Eli Lilly &AMP; Co., 998 F. 2d, at 936; Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Holbrook, 867 F. 2d, at 1333. We decline this invitation. We believe it more consistent with the statute to vest district courts with discretion in the first instance, because facts bearing on the usefulness of the declaratory judgment remedy, and the fitness of the case for resolution, are peculiarly within their grasp. Cf. First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. ---, --- (1995) (slip op., at 10) (``(T)he reviewing attitude that a court of appeals takes toward a district court decision should depend upon `the respective institutional advantages of trial and appellate courts''') (citation omitted); Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 114 (1985) (``(T)he fact/law distinction at times has turned on a determination that, as a matter of the sound administration of justice, one judicial actor is better positioned than another to decide the issue in question''). Whileit may be true that sound administration of the Declaratory Judgment Act calls for the exercise of ``judicial discretion, hardened by experience into rule,'' Borchard, Declaratory Judgments, at 293, proper application of the abuse of discretion standard on appellate review can, we think, provide appropriate guidance to district courts. In this regard, we reject London Underwriters' suggestion, Brief for Petitioners 14, that review for abuse of discretion ``is tantamount to no review'' at all. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

SECURITY ADVISER SQUEALS WITH JOY  White House National Security Adviser Anthony Lake told Newsweek that he was so excited last week when he learned of the rescue of fighter pilot Scott O'Grady in Bosnia that he just couldn't contain the news.  After learning that the mission had been successful, said Lake, he left the White House to drive home, stopping at a 7-Eleven at 2:30 a.m. to buy a few celebratory cupcakes.  A policemen pouring himself a cup of coffee was an irresistible confidante. ``Can I tell you something that no one else in the world knows?'' asked Lake.  The cop looked up at him. ``You know that pilot that was shot down over Bosnia?''  ``Yeah?'' said the cop.  ``We just got him home,'' said Lake, on his way out of the store. ``Who are you?'' asked the cop. ``I just work for the government,'' said Lake.  STEVE YOUNG HAS PROBLEMS  When posed the question, ``What is your greatest fashion challenge?'' Steve Young, 49er quarterback, Most Valuable Player of the Super Bowl and Macy's poster boy, was reflective:  ``I think,'' he said, ``to me, people expect now that I'll be able to put some kind of ensemble together _ things that go together, things that make sense. ... The problem now is that as I try to get into nicer suits I ask, `Does this really go?' And I have the confidence that, you know what, I think, but I'm not sure.''  BRYANT GUMBEL ON HIS COLLEAGUES AND HIMSELF  ``Today'' show host Bryant Gumbel tells TV Guide this week that he thinks CBS was right to fire Connie Chung from her job as co-anchor of the ``CBS Evening News.''  ``I'm a big Dan Rather fan,'' said Gumbel. ``It's a better program with him alone. He's the one with credibility.''  Gumbel took a slap at critics who have said he has a big ego. ``I find it odd,'' he said, ``that the charge is never leveled at Ted Koppel or Peter Jennings or anybody else in the business. At that point, you have to start to wonder, why is it only coming at me.''  He went on to speculate. ``I think for a lot of people it's race. To suggest there's no racial aspects to judgment about me is naive. ... There are a lot of people who are uncomfortable with the idea of a black man being their intellectual or economic or social equal or superior.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950612.0580 type=story > <HEADLINE> MESA INC.

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Sylvester Stallone as Judge Dredd. By CINDY PEARLMAN Distributed by New York Times Special Features  Sylvester Stallone likes to call himself the Hiroshima of love.  ``When I fall in love, it is always a big catastrophic explosion. No one is left standing,'' he says. ``My private life is almost a theatrical event. And it's not a comedy.''  It's 9 a.m. at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Marina Del Rey, Calif., and Stallone _ the man who played Rambo and Rocky _ has decided to show his vulnerable side. As he discusses his recent breakup with his fiance, model Angie Everhardt, Sly is wearing his heart on his well-muscled sleeve.  ``I tend to live life to the fullest,'' Stallone says, putting on his dark Ray-Ban sunglasses in the dimly lit hotel ballroom where he has come to do interviews for his newest film, ``Judge Dredd.''  ``I believe in that `Mame' song, `Life is a banquet. Live it every day.' I will spare you and not sing. ...  ``I live life too hard, with too much muscle and gusto. I tend to accelerate things. Everything is real fast with me. Relationships go much faster than they should. Sometimes they burn out much faster than they should.''  Is that what happened to his relationship with Everhardt?  ``Angie's a wonderful girl. I think she will go far,'' Stallone says. ``Some of the best-laid plans just don't work out. My motto is, `If it feels right, you give it a shot. If it doesn't, no regrets. You still did it.'  ``My biggest fear is waking up someday and thinking, `I didn't do it.'''  He won't ever have to think that about ``Judge Dredd,'' the futuristic action film based on the popular British comic-book series. Stallone knew right away that he wanted to play the title character, a helmeted lawman who is sort of a cop, a judge and a jury rolled into one.  ``I like to do things that are larger than life,'' he says. ``With this movie, I knew I wouldn't have to play it normal.''  Stallone, a ``big believer'' in the authority of the law, says he liked the fact that his character has the power to dispense instant justice _ or punishment.  ``We're heading toward a much more accelerated process of law,'' he says. ``In fact, I hope punishment is much more intensified in the future. I'm sick of these prolonged appeals year after year. If you're caught red-handed you should just go away.''  Sometimes Stallone would like to go away himself _ away from all the media attention and hype, that is. He says the reporters who chronicle his comings and goings make it impossible for him to live a normal life. He can't even go to the grocery store without being monitored.  ``Every move I make is under a microscope. My life is examined. If my collar is up, the tabloids write, `He's a pig.' The next guy could be standing there naked and it's no big deal.''  It's this sort of scrutiny and reporting, Stallone says, that has made it hard for him to trust members of the opposite sex.  ``People know everything about me. I know nothing about them. I am at the distinct disadvantage,'' he explains.  ``I need the time to get to know women. But then again, do I walk around for my entire life skeptical or do I give women the benefit of the doubt until proven unworthy or guilty?''  And just where does Stallone meet these women? It's not like he can just go to a bar to pick up dates. Or can he?  ``I do go to nightclubs and Planet Hollywood openings,'' Stallone says, referring to the restaurant chain of which he is a part-owner.  ``The women who have the nerve to come over and talk to me are usually so drunk that you can't understand what they're saying. And the other women are afraid to cross over that little barrier and talk to me.''  Stallone did manage to establish a relationship with Everhardt. The two had dated for just a few months when they announced their engagement this spring. Then, in mid-June, they broke it off with no explanation.  It's the latest in a series of failed romances for Stallone. His past includes a divorce from his first wife, Sasha, a brief, rocky marriage to Brigitte Nielsen and a long relationship with model Jennifer Flavin.  Part of the problem, Stallone says, is that it's hard to be his significant other.  ``My dates are scrutinized. That's the really unfair part.''  So when he begins a relationship with a woman, he makes sure she is prepared for what's ahead.  ``I tell them up front, `If you have any skeletons in your life, the tabloids will find them. They will tear your life apart. They will go after your teachers and your old boyfriends. They got all of my past already.'''  Stallone's personal history has been told over and over.  ``I'm like bleached bones out there,'' he says, laughing.  Yes, it's been a long, strange trip since he began writing the script for the first ``Rocky'' movie almost 20 years ago. At the time, he was an unemployed actor living in New York City.  ``I sat down to write Rocky on December 5, 1975,'' Stallone recalls. ``Now I look back and everything seems real quick.  ``But I don't look back in too much anger. Whatever mistakes I've made there seemed to be a reason for it at the time. Now to be here 20 years later and, I think, doing better than ever ... I'm a very lucky man.''  His career has had its ups (the ``Rocky'' films, the ``Rambo'' series, 1993's ``Cliffhanger'') and its downs (1984's ``Rhinestone,'' 1991's ``Oscar'' and other attempts at comedy).  Now he has a new policy about films.  ``I'm sticking to action,'' he says. ``I've learned all you get from stretching is stretch marks.''  Does he still have the eye of the tiger?  ``It's still there. I'm more hungry now than ever. I believe in chasing time. Time moves fast, so you must move fast.''  When he is reminded that his 50th birthday is approaching, Stallone groans. Loudly. And with fury.  ``That definitely bothers me,'' he says. ``You sit there and go, `Oh man. This is it. We're definitely heading into the home stretch here. This is not a rehearsal.'  ``Now I'm living in what I like to call a `controlled spinout.' It's a racing term. It means that you just slide into the future and try not to be too out of control.''  To regain some stability, Stallone moved from Hollywood to Miami, where he tries to live a quiet life in between Planet Hollywood openings and making movies.  In Florida, no one judges him, he says.  ``I think it's an exotic place. I blend in.''  He recently left Miami, however, to join Antonio Banderas and director Richard Donner on the set of ``Assassins'' in Seattle. It's another action film, with Stallone playing a trained killer.  This will certainly provide more fodder for the debate about violence in movies. What is Stallone's position on this issue?  ``I think there is a responsibility there, but I don't agree with (Bob) Dole's comments,'' he says. ``You should allow any film to be made. Sure, some junk will get in there. But it's about freedom.''  Stallone knows all about freedom _ especially freedom of expression. He is reminded of this when he's shown a copy of the 1993 Vanity Fair magazine for which he chose to pose nude.  ``Gee, I wish you didn't show me that,'' he moans as he looks at his incredibly muscular body in the photos. ``That's a lot of work.''  Looking lean and taut in beige pants and a wheat-colored sweater, Stallone says he still works out four and a half days a week. He rises at 5 a.m. and heads straight for his home gym.  But it's not always easy.  ``Some days I get out of bed and think, `Oh man, do I have to work out?' Actually, I think this all the time.''  What does going the distance mean for Stallone these days?  ``It's getting out of bed without my knees cracking. I believe in that Nike ad, `There is no finish line.'''  When it comes to his professional life, he seems to know no boundaries. He says he's thinking of bringing ``Rocky'' to Broadway as a musical.  And as far as his love life goes, there's no finish line there either. He says he really, really wants to get married again someday.  ``Oh yeah, definitely. But I'm very happy right now.''  Above all, Stallone says, he is a hopeless romantic.  ``It beats the alternative. I'd hate to be a hopeless cynic.'' c.1995 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.) ------------------------------------------------- (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448; fax: 816-822-1444.)

"25838"	"we"	"think"	" But this argument, we think, fails in the face of the statutory language itself. The term ``such interception'' is part of the intent requirement in the second clause; the defendant must intend to obstruct the interception made pursuant to the application or authorization of which he has the knowledge required by the first clause. The phrase ``possible interception'' is found in the third clause, which describes the act which offends the statute. A defendant intending to disclose the existence of a pending application would ordinarily have no way of knowing whether the application or authorization had resulted in an interception, and that is doubtless why the third clause uses the term ``possible'' interception. It was not intended to limit the offense to cases where the interception based upon the application or authorization was factually possible, but to recognize the fact that at the time the prohibited notice was given it very likely could not be known whether or not there would be an interception. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"25841"	"I"	"think"	" The Court apparently adds to its ``natural and probable effect'' requirement the requirement that the defendant know of that natural and probable effect. See ante, at 6 (``(I)f the defendant lacks knowledge that his actions are likely to affect the judicial proceeding, he lacks the requisite intent to obstruct''). Separate proof of such knowledge is not, I think, required for the orthodox use of the ``natural and probable effect'' rule discussed in Pettibone: Where the defendant intentionally commits a wrongful act that in fact has the ``natural and probable consequence'' of obstructing justice, ``the unintended wrong may derive its character from the wrong that was intended.'' 148 U. S., at 207. Or, as we would put the point in modern times, the jury is entitled to presume that a person intends the natural and probable consequences of his acts. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

Respondents argue that a ``less intrusive means to the same end'' was available, namely, ``drug testing on suspicion of drug use.'' Brief for Respondents 45-46. We have repeatedly refused to declare that only the ``least intrusive'' search practicable can be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. Skinner, supra, at 629, n. 9 (collecting cases). Respondents' alternative entails substantial difficulties if it is indeed practicable at all. It may be impracticable, for one thing, simply because the parents who are willing to accept random drug testing for athletes are not willing to accept accusatory drug testing for all students, which transforms the process into a badge of shame. Respondents' proposal brings the risk that teachers will impose testing arbitrarily upon troublesome but not drug-likely students. It generates the expense of defending lawsuits that charge such arbitrary imposition, or that simply demand greater process before accusatory drug testing is imposed. And not least of all, it adds to the ever-expanding diversionary duties of schoolteachers the new function of spotting and bringing to account drug abuse, a task for which they are ill prepared, and which is not readily compatible with their vocation.

"29550"	"I"	"think"	" All this stuff about the NFL putting an expansion team in Los Angeles is bogus. Recently, commissioner Paul Tagliabue met with Gov. Parris N. Glendening of Maryland, who wanted a commitment from the league that it would create two more expansion teams, one of them in Baltimore. Tagalibue said the NFL could not make that commitment. The commissioner knows he could not get the team owners to vote for expansion right now. The owners are more concerned about franchises jumping all over the place and want to see how it all unfolds before even thinking about adding two more teams. The Seahawks, for example, are working behind the scenes to slip into Los Angeles, which has always been a pro football bust-out. After the Raiders and Rams both bailed, broadcaster Pat Haden, a former Ram, probably put it best: ``It's not a cultural loss in Los Angeles. There isn't a passion, I think, for the hometown team, because this isn't a lot of people's hometown. I don't think most people are terribly concerned. It's nice to have a team, but there isn't the passion for athletics here that there is in a lot of towns.'' Pro football, especially ...

QUOTABLES FROM AMERICA'S TALKING  ``The secret to all of my success last fall was that I suddenly unleashed all of my blinding charisma.''  _California Governor Pete Wilson jokes about how he won the election to his current office, on the America's Talking program ``Straight Forward with Roger Ailes.''  ``Let's start building prisons in the Alaskan Tundra.

Do your time!''  _Talk show host Montel Williams tells how he would carry out prison reform if he were president, on ``Straight Forward With Roger Ailes.''  AU REVOIR, `SEEKER OF THE FRENCH SOUL' By BILL TAMMEUS A famous retired Harvard professor, of whom, I sadly admit, I had never even heard, died the other day.  I suppose it was not unexpected. Laurence Wylie was, after all, 85 years old, having lived a full and charming existence, according to The New York Times, which keeps pretty fair track of famous retired Harvard professors.  So what struck me wasn't Wylie's actual demise but the wonderful headline on the obituary. It called Wylie ``Seeker of the French Soul.''  Ah, my friends, what a glorious _ if ultimately frustrating _ vocation. It did, of course, make me wonder why you never see a ``Seeker of National Souls'' booth at high school career days, but I have been around long enough to know that you shouldn't tell high school kids everything.  I was so taken with the ``Seeker of the French Soul'' appellation that I am now driven to suggest we live our lives in such a way that, on our passing, newspapers (assuming they themselves aren't all dead by then) will place similarly engaging epitaphs over our obituaries.  It will be hard to top the delicious feel of ``Seeker of the French Soul,'' probably, but surely we can give it a go. (Where, by the way, does one seek for the French soul? In ((blank))? There will be a $5 reward for the best French soul joke or pun. In case of a tie, the judge will keep the dough.)  For instance, wouldn't you love to know someone of whom it could be written, ``Cornerer of the Marketplace of Ideas''? I do not know anyone at the moment to whom such a grandiloquent title could be accurately applied, but I would like to know such a person, if only to see how his or her children are putting up with this condition.  I also would like to know about (though maybe not know personally) people whose obituaries could carry these headlines: ``Titillater of the Greek Libido,'' ``Launcher of New Eras,'' ``Dancer with Wolves,'' ``Keeper of Cosmic Secrets,'' ``Ponderer of Brazilian Mysteries,'' ``E-Mailer to the Cheesemakers'' and ``Sailor of the Brain's Waves.''  The problem, I think, is that our vision of our roles in the ultimate scheme of things is so pinched. We talk about self-esteem and complain that politicians and Hollywood stars (to say nothing of heavyweight journalists) are loaded with ego. But when we think of ourselves, we almost never imagine a memorable phrase of cosmic proportions by which we'd like to be remembered.  Quite simply, we lack vision. And without vision, the people perish. Or, in the alternative, as Laurence Wylie might have said, they go to Paris.  Wylie himself, from what I can tell, did not spend a lifetime in Paris. Indeed, he was born in Indianapolis, which may not be as far from Paris, culturally, as you can get but in Indianapolis the left bank has drive-up windows. And after getting degrees from such non-French places as Brown University and the University of Pennsylvania, Wylie wound up at Harvard for 21 years.  Yet somehow he was able to construct his life so that no less a chronicler of human foibles and achievements than The New York Times was willing to call him ``Seeker of the French Soul.'' Bravo! I say, and I say it because I can't think of the French equivalent for Bravo! right now, despite my having made it through an advanced French reading class in college (no more about that later).  My point is that each of us, Walter Mitty-like (or Laurence Wylie-like), is capable of imagining a life for ourselves that would cause us, at the moment of our departure, to be hailed effusively as, say, ``Launderer of the Canadian Underwear.'' And wouldn't that make our mothers proud?  (Bill Tammeus is a columnist for The Kansas City Star. This article was distributed by The New York Times News Service.)  GOOD DAY, WIRE WANDERERS!!!!!

Do your time!''  _Talk show host Montel Williams tells how he would carry out prison reform if he were president, on ``Straight Forward With Roger Ailes.''  AU REVOIR, `SEEKER OF THE FRENCH SOUL' By BILL TAMMEUS A famous retired Harvard professor, of whom, I sadly admit, I had never even heard, died the other day.  I suppose it was not unexpected. Laurence Wylie was, after all, 85 years old, having lived a full and charming existence, according to The New York Times, which keeps pretty fair track of famous retired Harvard professors.  So what struck me wasn't Wylie's actual demise but the wonderful headline on the obituary. It called Wylie ``Seeker of the French Soul.''  Ah, my friends, what a glorious _ if ultimately frustrating _ vocation. It did, of course, make me wonder why you never see a ``Seeker of National Souls'' booth at high school career days, but I have been around long enough to know that you shouldn't tell high school kids everything.  I was so taken with the ``Seeker of the French Soul'' appellation that I am now driven to suggest we live our lives in such a way that, on our passing, newspapers (assuming they themselves aren't all dead by then) will place similarly engaging epitaphs over our obituaries.  It will be hard to top the delicious feel of ``Seeker of the French Soul,'' probably, but surely we can give it a go. (Where, by the way, does one seek for the French soul? In ((blank))? There will be a $5 reward for the best French soul joke or pun. In case of a tie, the judge will keep the dough.)  For instance, wouldn't you love to know someone of whom it could be written, ``Cornerer of the Marketplace of Ideas''? I do not know anyone at the moment to whom such a grandiloquent title could be accurately applied, but I would like to know such a person, if only to see how his or her children are putting up with this condition.  I also would like to know about (though maybe not know personally) people whose obituaries could carry these headlines: ``Titillater of the Greek Libido,'' ``Launcher of New Eras,'' ``Dancer with Wolves,'' ``Keeper of Cosmic Secrets,'' ``Ponderer of Brazilian Mysteries,'' ``E-Mailer to the Cheesemakers'' and ``Sailor of the Brain's Waves.''  The problem, I think, is that our vision of our roles in the ultimate scheme of things is so pinched. We talk about self-esteem and complain that politicians and Hollywood stars (to say nothing of heavyweight journalists) are loaded with ego. But when we think of ourselves, we almost never imagine a memorable phrase of cosmic proportions by which we'd like to be remembered.  Quite simply, we lack vision. And without vision, the people perish. Or, in the alternative, as Laurence Wylie might have said, they go to Paris.  Wylie himself, from what I can tell, did not spend a lifetime in Paris. Indeed, he was born in Indianapolis, which may not be as far from Paris, culturally, as you can get but in Indianapolis the left bank has drive-up windows. And after getting degrees from such non-French places as Brown University and the University of Pennsylvania, Wylie wound up at Harvard for 21 years.  Yet somehow he was able to construct his life so that no less a chronicler of human foibles and achievements than The New York Times was willing to call him ``Seeker of the French Soul.'' Bravo! I say, and I say it because I can't think of the French equivalent for Bravo! right now, despite my having made it through an advanced French reading class in college (no more about that later).  My point is that each of us, Walter Mitty-like (or Laurence Wylie-like), is capable of imagining a life for ourselves that would cause us, at the moment of our departure, to be hailed effusively as, say, ``Launderer of the Canadian Underwear.'' And wouldn't that make our mothers proud?  (Bill Tammeus is a columnist for The Kansas City Star. This article was distributed by The New York Times News Service.)  GOOD DAY, WIRE WANDERERS!!!!!

"30795"	"I"	"think"	" This may not be a cure, but it's the only way you can try to get them back down and stay down. The tiles are tongued and grooved, so they are locked in place. Ideally, all tiles should be taken up and relaid with new adhesive. But instead, try this: draw a utility knife straight down a seam between two rows of tile; this will cut the tongue so you can lift that row of tiles. The whole row may lift up intact, if you're lucky. Then try to lift the other buckled rows to expose the concrete floor, which is covered with a black mastic. This mastic is a tar emulsion, which holds the tiles in place by staying sticky; it never dries out, or shouldn't. Your mastic has dried out, I think, so scrape it off the concrete and apply more mastic (sold at tile and building supply stores), as thin as practicable, press the tiles back in place and hope for the best. If you can't get the tar emulsion mastic, use any tile mastic and it should work. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"

"32016"	"I"	"think"	" ``He had mercifully escaped from Hitler, from Czechoslovakia, I think,'' said Herbert, unable to recall the chap's name as he poured a little more fine cabernet for his wife, Sue, and their visitor. ``He was trying to live as an English country gentleman and to run Gravetye as a country club.''

Catcher Mike Lieberthal, the Phillies' first-round pick in 1990 out of Westlake High School, was called up from Triple-A Scranton-Wilkes Barre to replace Daulton on the Phillies' roster. ``Mike Lieberthal, I think, is a very fine catcher,'' said Phillies manager Jim Fregosi, who nevertheless plans to start Lenny Webster. ... Through 10 games of the trip, Piazza is 13 for 40 (.325) with 10 runs, six homers and seven RBI. Right fielder Raul Mondesi, who on Saturday had the first four-strikeout game of his career, is 9 for 38 (.237) on the trip with two homers and five RBI. First baseman Eric Karros is 8 for 42 (.190) with three RBI and 11 strikeouts on the trip. And Delino DeShields? He's 14 for 28 (.500) with three homers and six RBI. ...

Entertainment/Lifestyle  GOURMET _ For a cool Labor Day celebration Beverlie Rabinow has a do-ahead, expandable buffet menu that can grow if the guest list expands. Early preparations revolve around a chilled smoked or canned salmon mousse that can be accompanied by a vegetable mold, orzo salad, cheese dilly bread, mandel bread and cherry tarts. To expand this menu, add one or more of the following: chilled shrimp, sliced roast beef or fillet at room temperature, a garnish of asparagus wrapped in prosciutto for the vegetable salad mold, a fruit platter, a bowl of large green and black olives marinated in French dressing and-or a batch of chocolate madeleines. (Harwood).  BRUNSWICK-STEW _ ATLANTA _ In one of those North vs. South food conversations, the question arose about how Northern food differs from Southern food. Someone asserted that one of the big distinctions was that Southerners are not inclined to mix food together, cook it in a casserole and serve as a one-dish meal. ``Macaroni and cheese is as close as we come to those tuna-noodle dishes you all cook up North,'' said one woman. If I hadn't been so busy wrinkling my nose at the thought of tuna-noodle, I would have offered Brunswick stew as an example of a Southern mixture that satisfies as a meal, wholly. And, with the summer's last holiday just around the weekend, the stew, which complements barbecue and benefits from having it as an ingredient, will be filling a lot of bowls and bellies one more time. (May, Two Takes).  RIDES _ Fear is good _ when you want it and especially when you pay for it. Case in point: Orlando. Theme park mecca. Home to Walt Disney World, Disney-MGM Studios and Universal Studios Florida. Orlando offers attractions aplenty for folks who desire dread. So in a sort of Academy Awards for Anxiety, we went on a hunt for manufactured horror. Here are the winners and the number of screams they rated. (Grantham).  MAGIC-BUS _ Now, if you have not heard of the Friz and have never been inside Arnold's stomach, this will be meaningless. But if you're with me on this one, here's a Magic School Bus secret: On the last page of every book, the world's kookiest science teacher wears a dress that hints at the next book's topic. Take the newest edition of the Magic School Bus series, written by Joanna Cole and illustrated by Bruce Degan. On the final page of ``The Magic School Bus Inside a Hurricane'' (Scholastic Inc., $14.95), Ms. Frizzle is wearing a dress decorated with bees. Heck, there are even bees on her shoes. The next book, due out next year: ``The Magic School Bus Inside a Beehive.'' (Minor).  WILSON _ Brian Wilson's music was made for these times. If only the man behind the music was as durable. In the disposable world of pop music, Beach Boys songs such as ``Good Vibrations,'' ``In My Room,'' ``California Girls'' and ``Caroline, No'' are as fresh today as when Wilson created them 30 years ago. The documentary ``Brian Wilson: I Just Wasn't Made For These Times'' attempts to answer the question: Why is Wilson considered a musical genius on a level with Duke Ellington and George Gershwin by many of his peers? For all his genius, Wilson, 53, seems on good days extremely fragile, contradictory and vulnerable in this 72-minute documentary directed by Grammy award-winning record producer Don Was (Bonnie Raitt, Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan). (Lomartire).  LEWIS _ NEW YORK _ These days, Jerry Lewis is shuttling between heaven and hell. He's either a devil or an angel _ the havoc-wreaking hellion Applegate of the musical ``Damn Yankees'' or the Muscular Dystrophy telethonmeister who has raised hundreds of millions of dollars over the past 40 years. Earlier this month, he closed up the revival of the Washington Senators-meet-the-devil baseball musical that he kept running on Broadway, virtually single-handedly, since February. Off with the horns, on with the halo. Since then, Lewis has concentrated on the Labor Day Telethon, getting himself ready for the 20 1-2-hour fund-raising institution to be carried by nearly 200 stations in the United States and Canada. (Erstein, Two Takes).  National  TICKETS _ LAWTEY, Fla. _ The men in blue in this north Florida hamlet take the first three letters of their town's name seriously. Very seriously. Don't mess with the law in Lawtey _ or nearby Hampton or Waldo, either _ unless you want to find yourself at the business end of a gun. A radar gun. The three towns dotting U.S. 301 between Jacksonville and Gainesville have been singled out by the American Automobile Association as ``traffic traps'' _ the first time in seven years AAA has meted out the designation. The association is warning its 37 million members to detour around the towns _ or take the pedal off the metal if they decide to drive down 301. Between April and July of this year, officers in the three towns have written nearly 5,000 speeding tickets. (Williams).  ABORTION-DRUGS _ ATLANTA _ Two drugs already approved for use in the United States may be as effective as the controversial RU-486 for inducing an abortion without surgery, a study suggests. The drugs, methotrexate and misoprostol, administered within five to seven days of each other, caused abortions in 171 of 178 women treated at a New York hospital. Methotrexate is an approved cancer treatment, and misoprostol is an ulcer drug. RU-486, widely available in Europe for more than 10 years, is undergoing testing in the United States as a step toward possible approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Abortion opponents have threatened to boycott any U.S. company that manufactures or distributes it. (Husted).

OLY-ARTS _ ATLANTA _ ``On Translation'' by the Barcelona-born, New York-based artist Antonio Muntadas, next June 7-Aug. 4 at the Atlanta College of Art Gallery, will be an interactive multimedia installation created for and keying to the Olympics. The installation ``promises to shed new light on our notions of public access, cross-cultural conversation and the very nature of mass experience at `international events,' '' said Annette Carlozzi, the Olympiad visual arts producer. The piece, which is still being conceived, will include six ``education stations'' showing nonstop video, a ``translator's booth'' and audio. The Atlanta International Museum of Art and Design will mount ``Ways of Welcoming: Greeting Rituals From Around the World,'' May 24-Nov. 8. (Pousner).  OLY-ROUGHTON-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ Like a hapless nomadic tribe that keeps camping in the path of civilization, the homeless can't seem to stay out of the way of the Olympics. Having ceded their old turf in Atlanta's downtown Woodruff Park and the blocks of old buildings that have been leveled for the new Centennial Olympic Park, many of them have taken refuge in the stoops and alleys of the elegant old buildings in the city's long-forlorn Fairlie-Poplar District. It's clearly the most life the ``Heart of Downtown'' has seen in years, even if it consists mostly of thin, raggedy men hanging on corners raving and/or drinking from brown lunchbags. But now even the sidewalks in Fairlie-Poplar are filling with remodelers' trucks. The squeeze is on again. (Roughton).  OLY-RENT _ ATLANTA _ Despite highly publicized accounts of local renters getting gouged for the Olympics, hundreds more are likely to pocket some extra cash by subleasing their apartments. Atlanta's biggest landlords are making Olympic sublease plans optional for their residents. Most tenants are staying put for the Games, but some tenants, usually just a handful per complex, are taking them up on the deal. With most of the major apartment companies promising their vacant units to the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games' private lodging operation, Private Housing 1996, neither the landlords nor the tenants are going to get rich. (Turner).  OLY-TAXIS _ ATLANTA _ In Germany, they drive Mercedes Benzes. In Finland, their cars are equipped to take credit cards. And in England, cabdrivers never get lost because they complete two years of training before they're allowed behind the wheel. And each country can bet its reputation that the taxis are immaculate. So what will Atlanta cab drivers be remembered for after they chauffeur the world during the Olympics? It won't be credit card machines, because many local taxis don't have them. ``I think people are going to be very upset with the (lack of) cleanliness and the lack of knowledge of the city,'' said Anne Hansen, executive director of the Georgia Council for International Visitors and a critic of local hacks. (Hill).  OLY-TICKETS _ ATLANTA _ More than 326,000 people across America have ordered tickets to the Atlanta Games, far exceeding Olympic organizers' expectations and breaking all records previously set by the 1984 Los Angeles Games. ``We're delighted with the results,'' Scott Anderson, ticket chief for the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, said Thursday. He should be. With orders averaging $1,100 for 17 tickets each, ACOG collected a whopping $358 million. It won't be keeping all of it, of course. Some will have to be refunded once ticket confirmations go out this month and folks find out what they've won _ and lost _ in the ticket lottery. The committee is budgeting $290 million from ticket sales. (Turner).  OLY-MARATHON _ ATLANTA _ Many marathon runners and experts say the Olympic race in the dead of an Atlanta summer could become a trek through hell. That's just what Manuela Machado wants to hear. Jot down the Portuguese woman as an early favorite. With her solid victory at the World Championships last month, run in mid-80s temperatures and under sunny Swedish skies, Machado furthered her reputation as someone who can deal with warm weather. ``I like very much to run in a hot climate,'' Machado said through an interpreter. ``It is more difficult to run in humidity, but I have already done it in the Barcelona Olympics. (Fish).  OLY-TRAFFIC _ ATLANTA _ In the heart of downtown Atlanta, these are the times that try one's soles. When Olympic visitors breeze into town next year, city officials promise that traffic-choked intersections like Peachtree Street and International Boulevard will be pedestrian-friendly corridors with wider sidewalks, new street lights and sheltering trees. But since last week, downtown has been a place only a shoemaker could love. It's a sprawling war zone of hard hats and construction machinery where casualties are measured in scuffed loafers, broken heels and lost patience. The sidewalks have been transformed into minefields of bright orange netting, wobbly plywood planks and muddy gravel that has office worker Bernard Rolax hopping mad. (Harris).  OLY-DIVE _ ATLANTA _ Kent Ferguson was 11 when he bounced from the trampoline to the diving board. He was 29 when he made the Olympic diving team. Now, at 32, he is an elder statesman in a sport usually dominated by younger athletes. He will lead the U.S. contingent into the IX Diving World Cup, the year's biggest meet, beginning Tuesday at the Georgia Tech Aquatic Center. Ferguson earned a spot on the World Cup squad by defeating a slew of younger men on the 3-meter springboard at the U.S. Championships in August. And if he realizes his dream of winning an Olympic medal next year, he would be the oldest U.S. diver in memory to do so. (Walston).  Commentary  MINTER-COLUMN _ The Georgia-Auburn football rivalry, oldest in the South at the age of 103, remains much as it began. A game between friends. When Dr. Charles Herty introduced football to Athens and the South in 1892, he needed an opponent. He called on Auburn professor Dr. George Petrie, an old friend and classmate from Johns Hopkins University, who got a team together and brought it to Atlanta, where the game was played for 10 years before moving to Macon, Montgomery and Savannah. When a Georgia fan says he, or she, pulls for Georgia Tech except when Tech plays Georgia, that person is either a liar or not a real Georgia fan. The same is true of Auburn fans in regard to Alabama. Most Georgia fans, I think, like to see Auburn win, except when Auburn is the opponent. I suspect Auburn fans feel the same way about Georgia. (Minter).  MINTER-COLUMN _ Unlike many of my chauvinist friends I was disappointed to see Shannon Faulkner's Citadel career come to such an early and ignominious end. I'm all for women in the military. Women shouldn't be denied the right to bear arms and fight for their country if that's what they want to do. The truth is misguided males, having read too many stories about chivalrous knights in shining armor, have allowed women to shirk their duties for far too long. I was pleased when our womenfolk decided to shoulder their share of responsibility for the national defense. I've never had any particular desire to sleep on the ground in rain and cold, wade snake-infested rivers and run five miles before a breakfast of whatever on a shingle. I'm generally not anxious to shoot at people and specifically not anxious to be shot at. (Minter).  For questions and resends, contact:  Andrew Alexander, 202-887-8334.  Matt Vita, 202-887-8309.

"34555"	"I"	"think"	" ``I'm hoping he (Williams) will have a chance to reflect on the harm this will do to the city and the harm this will do to the department and the fact, I think, that it would substantially erode his support both in the council and in the public,'' Wachs said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"34561"	"I"	"think"	" ``Asean, I think, has developed some credibility,'' he said. ``It isn't just a question of the countries getting together and agreeing; unilaterally we're seeing liberalization, we're seeing barriers dropped unilaterally. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"34681"	"I"	"think"	" ``I think we have to reach accommodation within our own conference on different views,'' Snowe said. ``Welfare reform, I think, resulted in a consensus of all Republicans' views.

"34685"	"I"	"think"	" Like many others in their 20s who do invest, Ms. Cox does not shrink from aggressive-growth funds and other choices that can produce high returns but also carry high risk. ``I can afford the risk of investing in a mutual fund, I think, because I am young enough,'' she said. ``I like the logic of long-term investing.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"34734"	"I"	"think"	" ``Let me put it this way, I'm not a politician at all,'' Goldstein said during a 90-minute interview Friday afternoon. ``I'm not active in politics, nor do I belong to a political club. I am, I think, politically aware. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"

"34837"	"I"	"think"	" White House chief of staff Leon Panetta said Sunday: ``It certainly appears that something went wrong when an agency hoards this kind of money. There's no reason for that, particularly at a time, as you know, when we're struggling to find resources for a lot of areas that are extremely important to our country. For this to happen, I think, is inexcusable.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"34868"	"I"	"think"	" An engineer would tell you that they are built for different purposes; a table saw is for ripping and a radial arm saw is for crosscutting. But most woodworkers, I think, will tell you that crosscutting on the table saw is a great deal easier and safer than ripping on the table saw. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"

"34989"	"I"	"think"	" ``What do you do about things like this?'' Kotite said at his news conference Monday. ``Well, that's the part, I think, that is hard to answer, and there isn't a cookbook answer _ you just can't look it up and it's there.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"35002"	"I"	"think"	" That's part of the services, too, along with facials, body mud, herbal wrap, rose petal body masque, salt glow rub, not to mention the loofa body scrub. (Loofa, I think, is the Ute word for cellulite.) </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"35077"	"I"	"think"	" The ABL is treading into territory that has been historically hostile. No other women's league has ever succeeded, though the attempt has been made several times.

"35201"	"I"	"think"	" ``There's the opera buffa world of Aldrich Ames, for instance,'' she said, ``the chilly, present-day world of cyberspace, and the tragic world of Angleton, who becomes trapped in a maze of mirrors.

"35224"	"I"	"think"	" ``I need to be certain that I have a new stimulus,'' Ford has said of his relocations. ``New places give me something I can use.'' Today, he admits he likes the freedom. ``I've got a couple of moves left in me, I think,'' he says. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"35274"	"I"	"think"	" Legislation destroying our established and increasingly effective system of protecting the environment is far more important, I think, than the revolutionary changes being made in welfare, Medicaid and other such programs. Particular economic arrangements can always be changed, but the environment is forever. When oil has polluted the Arctic refuge, all the king's horses and all the king's men cannot put it back together again. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"

"35418"	"I"	"think"	" ``It has become apparent that this happened Wednesday night, that there was an equipment failure on Wednesday night,'' said Forman, who is in charge of the authority's building program. ``The assumption is that this problem happened when the equipment failed on Wednesday night. The bottom line, I think, is that the equipment failed and that the equipment operators failed to tell anyone. But at this point, I have to admit, that's hypothesis.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"

"35512"	"I"	"think"	" The cheers that sounded through pockets of Los Angeles at the announcement of his acquittal were the cheers, I think, of people desperate for heroes, of people sick of racism in the Los Angeles Police Department, and of people who, in the wake of the Rodney King verdict and others, wanted to see a black man walk out of court a winner, no matter what. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"35555"	"I"	"think"	" Polsgrove's methodology is, I think, a primary error. For one thing, no reader can be expected to have his own stash of back issues in order to make the connections that Polsgrove's autopsies of research and editing demand. In fact, the individual stories are irrelevant; Polsgrove needed to make a couple stand for the overall, and concentrate on the psychic connection between Hayes, the magazine, and the era. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"35658"	"I"	"think"	" ``If Mondy's in the game, he might catch that ball Barry hits,'' DeShields said. ``These kinds of games should be decided by the players. For a player to be ejected, I think, he almost has to smack a guy.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"35839"	"I"	"think"	" ``This is a cleaner city, this is a city that's having a real revival of its spirit, and the presence of the pope will, I think, add to that, in a very, very significant way,'' the mayor said Tuesday. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"35858"	"I"	"think"	" ``Jerry, I think, has been very good at predicting where the market is,'' said Spinola of the Real Estate Board. ``He's very shrewd and smart in understanding the true value of projects.

"36000"	"I"	"think"	" In Jim Lehrer's new novel, ``The Last Debate,'' a Presidency hinges on a somewhat more severe obscenity uttered during the course of a televised debate.

"36047"	"I"	"think"	" At the end of the F-minor, accelerating power confused the music's metric scheme; it took extra concentration to keep a sense of order in the ear.

"36102"	"I"	"think"	" Lang also spent some time in Los Angeles and in the limelight. Life in the fast lane? ``Living in Hollywood ... going to premieres ... getting into the designer thing,'' says lang. ``I was faced, somehow, after `Ingenue,' with standing in front of this smorgasbord, and I had all these options and temptations and all of these people going, `Oh, you're great! Wear my clothes! Come to this opening! Go out with me because I'm beautiful!' And you have all this stuff laid right out in front of you and, I have to admit, I went into it, I think, because you have to. I had to.

"36159"	"I"	"think"	" ``The notion that they are to be unknown, unseen and unavailable for any inquiry that might make the result of a trial more understandable is, I think, alien to our system and truly troubling,'' Francke said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"

"36537"	"I"	"think"	" ``The most elaborate thing is the lighting, I think,'' Bowie says, because even though ``Outside'' is a concept album with characters and a narrative thread, ``I wanted to keep the songs autonomous and just let them be songs for their own sake.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"36594"	"I"	"think"	" ``I did not think we were in very much control of anything (Saturday),'' Henning said. ``We had a couple of breaks there and Kenyatta made a heck of a return and that got us going a little bit. Brandon King made some plays to get us going a little bit, and the best pass of the day was by Todd Pollack and that put us in a position to get back in it, but they had a 7 1/2-minute drive, I think, and that took us down to the nub.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"36714"	"I"	"think"	" ``In focusing on Lincoln himself _ on what he knew, when he knew it, and why he made his decisions _ I have, I think, produced a portrait rather different from that in other biographies,'' Donald writes. ``It is perhaps more grainy than most, with more attention to his unquenchable ambition, to his brain-numbing labor in his law practice, to his tempestuous married life, and to his repeated defeats.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"

"37139"	"we"	"think"	" What we do have is a thoroughly prosaic performance of one of America's most poetic plays. It is selling O'Neill short to think of the Tyrones as merely the first of America's great dysfunctional families of drama, but there is not much more to Trinity's staging than that.

And that is why -- but, clearly, the United Nations endorsing such an effort by NATO would be very useful and we would welcome it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"37492"	"I"	"think"	" So let me turn it over first, I think, to Bob Gelbard to go through the money laundering and other aspects of the initiative. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"37493"	"we"	"think"	" ASSISTANT SECRETARY GELBARD: We have strongly encouraged Russia and some of the other new republics to undertake these measures. There is, we think, some serious recognition in Russia that they need to undertake some of these measures to strengthen their own financial system. And in fact, a U.S. delegation, which I'll be leading, will be in Russia in the next couple of weeks to discuss, among other things, the need for them to do this to strengthen their financial system. But this is something the Russian government clearly recognizes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"37496"	"I"	"think"	" ASSISTANT SECRETARY GELBARD: Well, that's obviously something we have been investigating and are continuing to try to investigate. There have been some accounts seized in the past. And we're continuing to look. They use a whole series of front companies and false names and go-betweens, so it becomes complicated to try to find it. But the fact that we have now been able to develop this extensive list of individuals and companies, I think, is a demonstration of the amount of information we've been able to accumulate in the last few months, in particular. And we intend to do more. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"37499"	"I"	"think"	" Then there's also this afternoon a meeting with Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia scheduled. That will be a good opportunity with -- he is a formidable and very creative leader of African regional unity, and the President has always enjoyed his encounters with President Meles. It's an opportunity to talk about regional issues in Africa, but the President in this case, I think, was specifically interested in raising the subject with Prime Minister --I called him President -- Prime Minister Meles of Sudanese sponsorship of terrorism. They were going to explore that issue in particular. The President intended to. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"37509"	"I"	"think"	" ``We had some good pictures of Houston, I think, when we were flying over and, for the first time, I was able to spot JSC. It was so clear,'' said Bowersox, who is on his third space flight. ``I couldn't find my house though.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"37905"	"I"	"think"	" ``I have always been impatient with the expression `women's issues.' Any issue that affects any human being is a woman's issue. So if it's taxes, it's a woman's issue. If it's retirement, it's a woman's issue. If it's employment, it's a woman's issue. The only difference, I think, that women have made is that women have forced public dialogue on issues that were hidden before. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"

"38408"	"I"	"think"	" In a role that was a stretch by any standard, he played the American financier Henry Kravis in the HBO production ``Barbarians at the Gate.'' ``I was physically cast wrong to play Kravitz,'' he said. ``He's about 5 foot 4, I think, and he's from Oklahoma and he's Jewish.

The Postal Service plans to issue 93 new stamps in 1996, it's reported. But as far as we know no ``O.J. Trial Commemorative'' is in the works.  There are about 1.7 million more births than deaths each year in the U.S., new figures show. You've got to feel good about the future of a country in which baby showers outnumber funerals.  Officials expect the U.S. population to grow to 392 million by 2050. Or 391,999,999 if we don't make it to age 105.  A new survey shows most Americans say they're too busy to eat three square meals a day. We may have to go from just fast to fantastically fleet food.  If our national forests are properly preserved, says Mr. Clinton, they can ``promise future generations continued benefits.'' Knock on wood.  ``We have tried to give the American people a more modern government,'' the president says. It's worked. When this administration began, our IRS forms said 1993. Now they say 1995.  A new poll shows 63 percent of Americans would support creation of a new political party. The other 37 percent probably would, too _ as long as they didn't have to bring the bean dip.  ``Each of us,'' Mr. Clinton says, ``has a sacred obligation to pass on a clean planet to future generations.'' Even if it's not Earth.  ``Protecting our environment,'' the president says, ``is a fundamental community value for all Americans.'' As long, of course, as it doesn't require us to change the way we live.  Experts say Colin Powell lacked fire in his belly. Apparently the road to the White House goes through a Tex-Mex restaurant.  Powell's decision not to run for president disappointed Aunt Ilse from Oelwein, who hoped he'd come to Iowa to judge her bridge group's annual Christmas centerpiece decoration contest.  With Powell out of the race, there's talk Newt Gingrich may jump in. Makes sense. They have a lot in common. For instance, neither is Bill Clinton.  Powell agonized a long time about his decision. Maybe not as long as Bill Clinton and Bob Dole agonized about Powell's decision, but long enough.  Another question is whether Powell will be asked to be the GOP's vice presidential candidate. Maybe, but why would a guy want to be busted from general to, in effect, assistant buck private?  Powell may have future political options. For instance, he could decide not to run for president again in 2000.  Powell's wife Alma was said to be strongly against his running. So it's just as well he decided not to. The U.S. probably doesn't need a First Delady.  Air pollution is so bad in Mexico City that authorities may forbid residents from driving their cars two days a week. Noneday and Shoesday?  Overheard on our bus: ``Just to see if anyone notices, I think this year I'll put storm windows on the car and snow tires on the house.''

"39483"	"we"	"think"	" Gingrich saw the matter differently, saying the dispute marked a clear-cut fork in the road. The Republicans, he said on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' were offering ``a major choice for America, whether you want to go to a balanced budget, which we do, or whether you want to continue year after year of borrowing money from your children and, frankly, in the long run keeping interest rates higher and, ultimately, we think, breaking the country financially.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"
"39580"	"I"	"think"	" There were two core reasons, I think, why so many world leaders of all stripes came to that mournful hilltop in Jerusalem.

So they saw in Rabin's fate a reflection of their own vulnerability. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"
"39593"	"I"	"think"	" This sense is rooted, I think, in a more general usage of rap, to mean ``to talk freely and frankly.''

"39661"	"I"	"think"	" Slowly things began to come around. Brosnan got roles in ``Lawnmower Man,'' ``Love Affair'' and ``Mrs. Doubtfire'' _ in which he was Heimliched by Robin Williams. With increased employment, Brosnan says, has come increased security. Enough, in fact, that he now can afford to be philosophical about missing out on Bond in 1986. ``I was very angry at the time,'' he says. ``I felt I was being manipulated, jerked around. But nevertheless I've sent a ticket to Brandon Tartikoff for opening night. No hard feelings.

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) By LISA COLLIER COOL c.1995 Child magazine (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  If you think you know all you need to know about babyproofing your home, think again.  Even second-time parents can benefit from a refresher course, especially if you've relaxed your standards or simply forgotten how curious babies are. They eat aspirin, chew on extension cords and pull hot pots and their contents onto themselves.  While nothing can substitute for being extra-vigilant, ``The best way to prevent accidents is to plan ahead,'' says Dr. Mark Widome, a pediatrician in Hershey, Penn. who is chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Council on Child and Adolescent Health.  Test your babyproofing IQ with this 10-question quiz. -0- BABYPROOFING QUIZ  +_ 1. The safest way to secure electrical outlets to prevent your baby from sticking fingers or toes into them is to:  a) Insert a plastic outlet cap in each one.  b) Replace outlet covers with safety plates that will snap shut when the outlet is not being used.  c) Block access to outlets with furniture.  Answer: b) Safety plates that snap shut, instead of having caps that must be reinserted after each use, are best, especially for outlets you use frequently. Plastic caps are easily forgotten or misplaced once they're removed. Blocking outlets with furniture is risky, since your baby may be able to squeeze through anyway.  +_ 2. The most dangerous cleaning apparatus in your home is probably:  a) The vacuum cleaner, because a baby could get an arm or leg stuck in the hose.  b) A string mop, because babies love to put things in their mouths and might be able to pull off a piece of string from the mop, which can cause choking.  c) A small bucket, because an infant might lean over the edge to see what's inside, fall in and possibly drown.  Answer: c) Each year approximately 40 babies drown in five-gallon plastic buckets, according to The National Safe Kids Campaign in Washington, D.C. Before using a pail, put your baby in a safe spot such as a play yard. Empty the bucket immediately after using it. When storing buckets outdoors, turn them upside down to prevent rain from collecting in them. Vacuum cleaners and string mops are not as dangerous, but all cleaning equipment and chemicals should be kept on a top shelf or locked away.  +_ 3. You should install toilet latches in all of your bathrooms because:  a) Your baby might flush toys down the toilet and damage your pipes.  b) Toilet water isn't clean.  c) Babies can drown in just one inch of water.  Answer: c) Unlike adults, babies are top-heavy. A standing baby, leaning forward while holding onto an open toilet, can tumble in and drown. Toilet latches can also keep babies from flushing toys down the toilet or playing with water.  +_ 4. To prevent your infant from rolling off a changing table, you should:  a) Never leave your baby unattended on the changing table, even for a second.  b) Secure your baby with the table's safety strap.  c) Get a changing table with a 2-inch-high guardrail around the sides.  Answer: a) Falling from the height of a changing table could seriously injure your baby, so constant vigilance is essential. Safety straps and guardrails help to prevent falls, but don't guarantee safety.  +_ 5. To keep your baby from falling out of a window, you should:  a) Install a window guard that keeps your windows from opening more than three inches wide.  b) Move away any furniture which your child could use to climb to the window.  c) Be sure that the window has a sturdy screen.  Answer: a) Window guards or plastic stops are the only sure way to prevent a baby from falling out a window. Moving furniture isn't reliable, since in your absence a baby sitter or relative could shift it around. And screens aren't strong enough to keep a baby inside.  Caution: Window guards should not be installed in a window that's also an emergency fire exit. Instead, use a window stop or be sure to keep the window closed and latched.  +_ 6. A hand-me-down crib is safe to use only if:  a) It was made after 1974, when manufacturers stopped producing lead paint.  b) It was made after 1974, when crib slats spaced more than 2 3/8 inches apart (which can trap an infant's head) were banned.  c) It was made after 1991, when corner posts (which can cause strangulation if a baby's clothes get caught on them) were banned.  Answer: c) A crib made after 1991 will meet all current safety standards, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission in Washington, D.C. If you are unsure if a hand-me-down crib has been recalled, call the CPSC's hot line at (800) 638-2772 for details. Older cribs have several potential hazards.  Beware especially of cribs from the '70s, which may have been repainted with lead-based paint, which was allowable prior to 1977. Consider using a Lead Check swab, available at hardware stores or by calling (800) 262-LEAD, to check for lead in paint.  +_ 7. Once your baby starts to crawl, you should secure the top and bottom of staircases with:  a) Pressure gates.  b) Wall-mounted gates with horizontal slats no more than 2 3/8 inches apart.  c) Wall-mounted, accordion-style gates to stairs.  Answer: b) Wall-mounted gates with narrowly spaced horizontal slats give greater protection than pressure gates, which your baby may be able to push over. Accordion-style gates should not be used, because your baby's neck or arm could get caught in the openings.  +_ 8. As soon as your baby can get up on hands and knees in the crib, you should remove:  a) Crib bumpers.  b) A crib gym.  c) Large stuffed animals.  Answer: b) Once your baby can steady him/herself on all fours, remove the crib gym. Babies can fall forward on gyms and become entangled. A cushioned crib bumper or large stuffed animals can remain in cribs until babies can stand or at least pull up, after which they might use them as steps to climb out of cribs, according to the AAP.  +_ 9. Any drawers or cabinets that are off-limits should be secured with:  a) Latches that automatically lock when you close the door or drawers.  b) Baby-safe hooks and eyes.  c) A sturdy lock that can only be opened with a key.  Answer: a) Latches are the most reliable and convenient way to safeguard cabinets and drawers, because you don't have to remember to reclose them, as you do with babyproof hooks and eyes. But although it may be less convenient, keeping really hazardous materials such as strong cleansers, dishwasher soap, furniture polish and other household chemicals not only in high cabinets but also under lock and key may bring extra peace of mind. Your baby might be capable of climbing higher than you thought.  +_ 10. The most important thing you can do to keep your baby safe in the bathtub, besides watching at all times, is to:  a) Set your water heater at 120 degrees Fahrenheit or below to prevent scalding.  b) Place nonskid strips on the bottom of the tub.  c) Cover the faucet with a soft vinyl guard to protect against head bumps.  Answer: a) Water hotter than 120 degrees Fahrenheit can burn a baby in seconds. Lowering the temperature on the water heater or installing an anti-scald device, available in hardware stores and babyproofing catalogs, drastically reduces your baby's risk of being scalded. Nonskid strips and a faucet cover can help avert less serious slips, falls and bumps.

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) By TOBY McERLEAN c.1995 Pensacola Magazine (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  I know better. Really, I do.  But still I answer a direct-mail invitation to attend a home-based business conference, absolutely free of charge and with no obligation whatsoever. The printed come-on is meant to be irresistible, and it is.  Do I want to retire in a couple of years? Not necessarily, but I certainly would like the option.  Do I want to be relieved of money concerns for the rest of my life? Who doesn't?  Can I imagine making more money in a day than most people earn in a week? I can! I can!  Although a relatively Puritanical upbringing and basic good sense convince me that huge sums of money aren't easy to come by, I'm intrigued _ but not convinced. Someone probably gets rich quick at these conferences, I think, but it's probably the conference sponsors.  A few days before the conference, a barrage of TV infomercials hits the airwaves. Programming reaches a crescendo in an advertising blitz during which the word ``free'' is prominently featured.  The half-hour TV spot is saturated with testimonials of the ``I used to be a typical wage slave, but now I'm my own boss'' variety. Not only does the ecstatic witness make vastly more dollars _ tax-free of course _ but her once-dull hair gleams thick and glossy, her plump body has become lean and trim, her age goes backward instead of forward and she's looking ahead to a luxurious retirement at age 29.  The morning of the conference dawns sunny and chilly. When I arrive at the appointed hotel, its parking lot is overflowing with vehicles. Inside, I am flabbergasted to find a huge room filled to overflowing with people, 300 or more, dressed in everything from formal business attire to Bermuda shorts.  The wannabe-wealthies are young to late middle age, with skins ranging in color from palest white to deepest black. There are a surprising number of couples, and perhaps a slight preponderance of males. One woman even has a baby in tow.  All are listening with rapt attention to a young, bland-faced man who is telling them that they don't need charm or intelligence to make a bundle _ only know-how. Easy Money?  It's barely 8 a.m., but already the lecturer has the audience deeply involved, raising hands and shouting responses in a manner reminiscent of a religious revival. ``How many people are interested in learning how to make $1,000 an hour?'' Every hand in the audience shoots up. ``I'm going to teach you how to do that today!'' he promises.  His speech is larded with platitudes: There's something here for everyone in this room. Change your life by learning something and acting on it. Getting rich is a choice _ choose to be rich or by default you'll be poor. Successful people are decisive people _ they see an opportunity and they act. Don't work for money _ let money work for you. Believe you can be successful. And so on. He delivers the kind of short-sentence, punchy platitudes that defy logic.  He explains that the average start-up investment for a small business is $27,000, and that the five-year success rate is under 10 percent. Then he says that 30 million people are involved in home-based businesses, and 30 million can't be wrong.  His shtick is getting us involved in an affordable home business. Minimum effort for maximum reward. Sounds good. But what, I keep wondering, what is he selling?  You need a plan, he explains, one that will provide immediate cash flow plus a continuing income of tax-free dollars. He shares with us the fact that he's a poor Carolina farm boy, not terribly bright, with no college education. If he can do it, he says, anyone can.  Why is he wasting precious time talking to us? Why isn't he out working deals and pulling in millions by the minute? Despite these obvious questions, the audience is on the edge of their seats, ears pricked up attentively. We're going to find out how to make a bundle!  Reduce risk, he tells us, through the sacred principle of using ``O.P.M.'' _ other people's money. Take action! If we apply what we learn, it will surely change our lives.  He offers us ``win/win'' situations, revealing in the most candid and confidential of tones that he makes money by entering into partnership with his audiences.  Our task is to find and secure suitable properties. His part is to close the deal and pay out the money. The audience positively gasps in gleeful anticipation.  He doesn't mention, at least not initially, either the cost of the sign-up or what we would be letting ourselves in for and, astonishingly, nobody asks. We simply listen, hungry for more talk about how we, too, can get rich quick.  After a brief sojourn in real-estate heaven, the lecturer proceeds to auctions where, once again, he brilliantly manages to tell us very little about how to make a lot of money. But, interspersed with numerous success stories, he certainly whets our appetites with promises of further ``insider'' hints. We are panting to know more.  He drops a few possibly practical but innocuous tips: Bring jumper cables to automobile auctions. Look for risk-free, tax-free investments conferring 18 percent to 50 percent interest. Keep the term ``state tax certificates'' in mind. Buy real estate at discount. Subdivide property. Sell things before they're actually paid for. He gives us just enough information, it seems, to keep most people satisfied and asking for more. Getting to the Pitch  After 3 1/2 hours, my attention is beginning to flag, although the instructor's energy level remains at a constant high. At this point, we finally find out what he's selling: membership in his company.  The cost, wrote large in numbers on the projection screen, is almost $3,000. But wait! For us, he can make it a mere $995. Ah, we're so special he'll practically give it away for $599.  But don't think he's charging because he wants to make money. No, sir _ he's charging because otherwise people won't take the program seriously. And anyway, he says, there's a money-back guarantee.  Along with several others, I decline the offer. But a feeding frenzy sweeps through the crowd. Audience members race to the back of the room, practically pushing each other over to get to the tables where a number of young men wait, pens at the ready.  Lest some fear being shut out, the lecturer, as energetic as ever, leaps upon a chair, assuring every individual that they will indeed be allowed to sign up. Why am I not surprised?  At the close of the morning session, I ask other participants what they found most impressive about the conference. With little hesitation, most say, ``The success stories!'' Maybe we deserve what we get.  One annoyed young man likens the conference to a carrot dangled just out of a donkey's reach. Another, a 60-year-old woman who takes care of elderly people in her home, came because she was told everything would be free.  ``And now,'' she complains, ``they're saying it will be $599. 1 don't think it's fair. I wouldn't have come if I'd known I'd have to pay. I thought I'd get the course, and then I'd go on and they would be lending me their money.''  A 43-year-old woman, who is a full-time college student and also holds a full-time job, speaks for many when she says that she wouldn't hesitate to sign up if only she could get the money together.  Sad to tell, I still don't know how to make $1,000 an hour.  But I do know you don't have to go to Las Vegas to gamble. Caveat emptor, folks _ and how!

"42808"	"I"	"think"	" In the title role, Julia Ormond takes on the toughest acting assignment of the year. How could she possibly compete with the ghost of a woman who was born to play gossamer princesses? The key word here, I think, is born. Ormond plays Sabrina _ the chauffeur's daughter contended for by the two rich scions of the family for which her father works _ with a great deal of heart, beauty and, on occasion, the kind of deep glances any man with any sense would plunge into without looking back. In short, Ormond plays Sabrina with the considerable resources of a star in the initial stage of a brilliant career, able to hold the screen against any costar Hollywood in its wisdom might throw against her. Hepburn played Sabrina as if she was born to play her. That's the difference. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"

"43703"	"I"	"think"	" The best-actress race will, I think, spotlight another Hollywood tradition that would be ludicrous if it weren't so ugly. I'm talking about men tending to win Oscars for playing heroes and women tending to win Oscars for playing low-lifes who fall apart or self-destruct. Just so long as they don't have power. Ending up unhappy _ or dead _ always helps. On that theory, let's start by eliminating from serious contention one of the sure nominees _ Emma Thompson's wonderful older sister in Jane Austen's ``Sense and Sensibility.'' Thompson's payoff for a lovely project in which she played several roles likely will be a screenplay award. The real competition will be among the misery brigade. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
"43704"	"I"	"think"	" Best supporting actress is famous as the category where the Academy likes to surprise those who think it too predictably conservative. (Remember Marisa Tomei?)

(Wouldn't it be great to see father-daughter winners in the supporting categories?) But Joan Allen's sympathetic Pat Nixon is going to be a force and, I think, the actual winner. Whoever else gets nominated _ say Rene Russo for ``Get Shorty,'' Annette Bening for ``Richard III'' and Nancy Marchand for ``Sabrina'' _ is just along for the ride. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"

"45658"	"I"	"think"	" What really happened, I think, is that the movie wrapped before the Bullock Express took off _ a suspicion somewhat confirmed by the fact that co-star, Denis Leary, has top billing.

When you're in that environment and feeling that way, I think you play better. I know it's fun going to the rink every day and fun playing the games. But the real season is starting now.

Instead, during a drill, he skates up to the players, one at a time _ Steve Heinze, Dave Reid, Adam Oates _ taps them on the butt with his stick, then confers privately. ``It can be much more effective one on one,'' Kasper explains afterward. ``If you constantly bring people into your office, players get leery _ `Oh, I'm gonna get it again' _ but, I think, on the ice, they are in their environment.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"

It is really an experience in the way, I think, museums probably ought to be,'' said the George Polk Award-winning staff writer for the New Yorker. To describe the experience is not easy.

"47421"	"I"	"think"	" That was, I think, the nub of what my disgusted visitor was saying: food is a sensual pleasure, and in these cold and ugly times, sensuality is more often connected with exploitation (think of the difference between Madonna and Mae West) and revulsion than with pleasure. The message is: to cope with the vagaries of life in an increasingly hostile world, women (and men too) need to develop hard edges. Pleasure, a rarity at any rate, only serves to weaken one; what one really needs is stamina and discipline. In its watered down form, this philosophy becomes a vague, neurotic dislike of gustatory pleasures _ a mistrust of cooking and eating as pastimes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"

But it's water under the bridge. It's five or six years ago. Unfortunately, I took a lot of heat, but that's part of it.

He needs to be mean and tough, too, don't get me wrong. But he needs to relax, play for fun and not worry out there.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"

"50689"	"I"	"think"	" Best Director: Mel Gibson. Many Academy members are industry workers who recognize and respect craft more than most. ``Braveheart'' is a conventional film, but a thoroughly well-crafted and extremely handsome one. Gibson wasn't named in the best-actor category, but with 10 nominations ``Braveheart'' isn't going to go away empty-handed. This, I think, will be its big prize. Although Mike Figgis' ``Leaving Las Vegas'' and Tim Robbins' ``Dead Man Walking'' represent greater daring and reach, the freeze out of each in the best-picture category suggests that Oscar is thinking conservatively again, regarding them as ``bummer films'' because of their respective subject matter. Chris Noonan (``Babe'') and Michael Radford (``The Postman'') got their prizes when they were nominated. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"

He pitched the third inning and allowed two runs on four hits. He is 35.... The Dodgers play the Houston Astros today at Holman Stadium.

HELEN-OSCARS (Los Angeles) _ Before Susan Sarandon played a Catholic nun giving spiritual counseling on Louisiana's death row in Dead Man Walking, Sister Helen Prejean walked death row. Prejean, whose bestselling anti-execution tract Dead Man Walking formed the basis of the Oscar-nominated Tom Robbin's movie, hopes to use any spotlight she grabs at Monday's Academy Awards to focus attention on her campaign against the death penalty. The movie, which stars Sean Penn as a condemned man whose character is a blend of two men Prejean counseled, has rejuvenated sales of her book and thrust the 56-year-old nun into fame, if not fortune. (She is giving the $300,000 share of the film and book proceeds to her order.) Over the next few months, translations of her book will hit the stores in Japan, Latin America, France, Germany and Italy, in time for the film's distribution in those countries. It's no surprise, then, that the 56-year-old crusading nun is booked solid through August, with some speaking engagements scheduled for 1997 and beyond. And the calls keep coming. The message she hopes to bring to the Oscar show? ``The death penalty is not an isolated little peripheral issue of maybe knocking off a few of these criminals,'' she says. ``It has to do, I think, with the three deepest wounds of American society, and that's our racism, our assault on the poor and our penchant for trying to solve social problems through violence.'' By Sara Catania  . BOSTON-COMMON (Los Angeles) Anthony Clark thought he had reached the top when he became the first person in his family to leave the state of Virginia and the first to graduate from college. But these days, those accomplishments pale when compared to Clark's success in the entertainment business: the actor and standup comic has landed his own sitcom. ``It's just thrilling,'' says Clark. ``But I'm also scared. I'm just so incredibly kind of shy.'' ``Boston Common'' is based on Clark's experiences as a fish-out-of-water Southerner attending Emerson College in Boston. It debuts tonight on NBC.

ROSENTHAL-COLUMN _ To see Chita Rivera, at age 63 no less, kick and dance and strut and stride, reprising her 1993 Tony-winning role in the musical ``Kiss of the Spiderwoman'' through April 21 at the Ahmanson Theater downtown, you would never realize how seriously she was injured in a Manhattan car accident 10 years ago next month. Doctors originally weren't sure she would ever walk again, let alone dance. The star of the original Broadway productions of ``Bye Bye Birdie'' and ``West Side Story'' talks about that and other things. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960320.0492 type=story > <HEADLINE> MENENDEZ BROTHERS GUILTY OF MURDER, JURY SAYS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-MENENDEZ-VERDICT-LADN) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"

Times News Service  COMPUTER HACKER PLEADS GUILTY  (NYT) _ Kevin Mitnick, once the country's most notorious computer hacker until he was tracked down and arrested in a high-tech manhunt last year, pleaded guilty Tuesday in Los Angeles to a charge that he used stolen mobile telephone numbers.  Mitnick, who was a fugitive from the law for three years before his capture in February 1995, had been charged with nearly two dozen crimes, including the possession of millions of dollars worth of corporate software, trade secrets, credit card numbers and other electronic information taken from hundreds of supposedly secure computers.  The plea agreement with federal prosecutors appeared to dismiss all but two of the many charges against Mitnick, now 32, who started breaking into computer and telephone systems as an overweight, lonely teen-ager with a talent for manipulating both electronics and people.  HIGH COURT ISSUES PATENT RULING  WASHINGTON (NYT) _ In one of the most important patent decisions in years, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously Tuesday that in a patent infringement suit it is up to judges, rather than juries, to resolve the crucial issue of what a patent means.  While the decision does not completely oust juries from patent cases, it may have that effect as a practical matter in many infringement suits. The determination of the patent claim _ the precise definition of the scope of the patent over which the patent owner exercises a lawful monopoly _is often the most important aspect of the case, and once a judge has decided this question, there is often nothing left for the jury to do.  The decision is likely to strengthen the position of people accused of infringing on a patent, because juries are known for favoring patent holders and for being impressed by expert trial testimony that portrays the scope of a patent in the broadest possible way.  JOBS REPORT RELEASED  WASHINGTON (NYT) _ In a report intended to defuse some of the anxieties surging through the workplace, the Clinton administration Tuesday released a study that refutes a stereotype about the American economy, concluding that most of the new jobs created in the service industries are relatively high-paying executive and management positions.  That conclusion was part of a politically delicate report that the administration released as part of its election year effort to take credit for the growth of 8.5 million jobs, but also to focus new attention on workers caught in transition.  The report also suggests that in the early 1990s, older workers, above age 55, were more likely to be laid off than any other age group, a reversal from the 1980s.  SENATE PASSES HEALTH INSURANCE LEGISLATION  WASHINGTON (NYT) _ The Senate on Tuesday passed legislation to make health insurance coverage portable from job to job, on a 100-0 vote that masked months of uncertainties, compromises and difficult persuasion.  The legislation sponsored by Sens. Nancy Kassebaum and Edward Kennedy still faces a difficult conference with the House, but it appears to have acquired irresistible political momentum.  The core of the bill _ common to both House and Senate versions _ is a provision that requires insurers to cover workers under a new employer's plan if their last job carried insurance. It would also sharply limit any exclusions for pre-existing conditions.  If that core becomes law, it will be at once the palest shadow of President Clinton's failed universal health insurance plan of 1994 and the most sweeping federal health legislation since Medicare and Medicaid were established in 1965.  SALES OF U.S. SERVICE ABROAD SHRINKS TRADE DEFICIT  WASHINGTON (NYT) _ Erasing about half of a huge increase in January, the nation's trade deficit shrank to $8.2 billion in February with record sales of American services abroad, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday.  Exports overall climbed 2 percent to the second-highest total on record while imports fell 0.5 percent, the first time since November that the deficit was narrowed.  Although the deficit was about $400 million less than expected _ and was accompanied by a downward revision of that amount for January _ private analysts noted two main reasons for the contraction, neither of them likely to be soon repeated.  One was a big drop in the nation's bill for imported oil, which tumbled $800 million, to $3 billion. The other was a surge in exports of civilian aircraft in the aftermath of the strike at Boeing Co., which was settled in December.  HEALTH AGENCY: DOCTORS SHOULD TELL PATIENTS TO STOP SMOKING  CHICAGO (NYT) _ Doctors should routinely ask patients about their tobacco use and actively work to get those who smoke, chew or sniff tobacco to quit, according to new guidelines released Tuesday by the U.S. Agency for Health Care Policy and Research.  ``I wouldn't say it's malpractice not to inquire about tobacco, but it is now a standard of care doctors should meet,'' said Dr. Randolph Smoak, secretary treasurer of the American Medical Association, which will publish the new guidelines Wednesday in a special issue of the weekly Journal of the American Medical Association devoted entirely to tobacco. ``It's a whole cultural change for someone to quit smoking and doctors should try to help them.''  SPECIALIST: SOME KEVORKIAN PATIENTS COULD HAVE BEEN TREATED  PONTIAC, Mich. (NYT) _ A nationally recognized specialist on suicide testified Tuesday that two patients of Dr. Jack Kevorkian might not have wanted to take their own lives if they had been treated for clinical depression.  ``Dr. Kevorkian's medical treatment, I think, is improper because he did not make sure they had a full course of treatment for depression,'' Dr. Jan Fawcett, chairman of the department of psychiatry at Rush Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago, said. He took the witness stand as prosecutors in Oakland County finished their case against the retired pathologist, who is on trial for violating Michigan's common law by assisting the suicides of Marjorie Wantz, 58, and Sherry Miller, 43, who died together on Oct. 23, 1991.  Under cross-examination by Geoffrey Fieger, Kevorkian's lead attorney, Dr. Fawcett admitted that he had never examined the women nor seen their complete medical records, but he added ``I think I know enough about depression to know it when I see it.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960423.0581 type=story > <HEADLINE> THARP IS GEM ON `DANCE IN AMERICA' </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-TV-THARP-REVIEW-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"

An adequate remedy in my opinion might be a demonstration by Virginia that its interest in educating men in a single-sex environment is matched by its interest in educating women in a singlesex institution. To demonstrate such, the State does not need to create two institutions with the same number of faculty PhD's, similar SAT scores, or comparable athletic fields. See ante, at 34-35. Nor would it necessarily require that the women's institution offer the same curriculum as the men's; one could be strong in computer science, the other could be strong in liberal arts.

Yates, who drives the McDonald's Firebird owned by Joe Gibbs, leads Johnson by 139 points, or slightly more than one race. But Johnson, a three-time NHRA Pro Stock world champion, has advanced to the final round in four consecutive events, winning two of them. That indicates that Johnson, who won NHRA Pro Stock titles in 1992, 1993 and 1995 in an Oldsmobile Cutlass, is finally coming to terms with the Firebird. ``Powerwise, we have exactly the same motors we ended last season with,'' said Johnson, who is using a 1,200 horsepower//500 cubic-inch GM Drag Race Competition Engine. ``It's trying to figure this car out.'' Here is the short course on the differences between the Cutlass and the Firebird, as delivered by Johnson: ``The Firebird is about an inch lower than the Cutlass, as far as ground to maximum height of the roof. It has a 6-inch-shorter wheelbase and a wider track width. The center of gravity is considerably different. And we run a completely different shock setup, spring rate and weight distribution than in the previous car.'' Johnson said that although the Firebird appears to be a ``slipperier car'' aerodynamically than the Cutlass, wind-tunnel tests indicate otherwise. ``Because we've got a different racehorse, it's a stimulus to our team,'' Johnson said. ``And the championship is definitely not out of the question.''  Lapping in Las Vegas Indianapolis 500 champion Buddy Lazier had never lapped on a 1.5-mile oval until Tuesday. On Wednesday afternoon, Lazier toured the new Las Vegas Motor Speedway at 217.383 mph to pace a handful of Indy Racing League teams testing as part of the track's ``National Media Day.'' Lazier, who drives for Hemelgarn Racing, bumped Mark Dismore of Team Menard off the practice ``pole.'' Dismore turned a lap at 213.532 mph Wednesday morning. Richie Hearn, who finished third in the Indy 500, posted a lap at 212.816 mph. The league's fifth and final race of 1996 is scheduled for Sept. 15 in Las Vegas. Three-time Indy 500 champion Johnny Rutherford of Fort Worth also toured the track, but in a passenger car. ``The track is deceiving because it looks like it has some bumps. But it's smooth as glass and the transitions are nice,'' said Rutherford, the league's special-projects coordinator. ``It looks like it's going to develop a character of its own with the (12-degree) banking. It's big and fast.''  De Ferran to F1? Second-year IndyCar driver Gil de Ferran, who drives for team owner Jim Hall of Midland, has been dousing rumors that he is contemplating a jump to Formula One. De Ferran was spotted at dinner with former Formula One champion Jackie Stewart during the IndyCar Detroit Grand Prix weekend. Stewart and his son, Paul, are assembling an Formula One team for 1997 that will be backed by Ford Motor Company. De Ferran, whose stock rose last weekend with a second-place finish on the road course in Portland, Ore., is fifth in IndyCar points. He won the season finale in Monterey, Calif., and was rookie of the year in 1995. De Ferran's ties to Stewart, Ford's worldwide ambassador, stem from a four-year association with Paul Stewart Racing in Europe. That is where de Ferran, who grew up in Brazil, cut his open-wheel racing teeth. ``It's natural people would connect us. Certainly I have a lot of respect for what Jackie is doing,'' said de Ferran, 28, who has two second-place finishes this season. ``I don't think it's a matter of if they're going to be successful; it's a matter of when. They have shown some interest in myself as a driver. But from there to have a signed contract is a long way. ``I'll certainly consider any formal approaches from them. But there has not been a formal offer. I'm happy here in America. I wouldn't have a problem if I spent the rest of my career racing here.'' De Ferran returns to the Grand Prix of Cleveland this weekend as the defending pole-winner.  Schroeder shreds 'em With victories in three of the past four events and two in a row, road-racing specialist Dorsey Schroeder is the hottest driver in the Sports Car Club of America's Trans-Am Championship. Schroeder, who has completed every lap in seven 1996 races, has opened a 17-point lead on Chevrolet's Jamie Galles. Round No.8 is scheduled for Saturday afternoon in Cleveland, and Schroeder would like to repeat some personal history. Schroeder's run to the 1989 Trans-Am title included a victory on the wide-open Burke Lakefront Airport course, which definitely suits his attack-at-all-angles style. ``I'm optimistic because we have a really, really good race car right now, better than I've had going into a race anywhere,'' Schroeder, 43, said of the Raybestos Ford Mustang owned by former series champion Tom Gloy. ``This car is doing an awfully good job of getting the power down. I've been playing this `inverted five' thing. But I can tell you for sure we're going to go for the outright pole for the first time in a long time at Cleveland.'' Schroeder was referring to a quirky SCCA rule that inverts the top five qualifiers. In other words, the fastest qualifier earns one bonus point for the pole, but has to start fifth and try to work to the front. Schroeder said that on a tight street course such as Detroit, it was smart to lay back and try to qualify fourth- or fifth-fastest in order to sit on the inverted pole. ``But this is an airport course, so you can be a little more aggressive and not worry about wrecking the car, because there's not much to hit,'' he said. ``The gamble's worth it. ``I haven't had a pole in about three years, and you kind of get the reputation you can't do it. I guarantee you, I can do it.''  Truckin' to please At the request of his boss, former NASCAR Winston Cup champion Rusty Wallace plans to work on his ``day off'' Sunday. The Cup series is idle for a weekend, and Wallace has accepted an invitation from business partner Roger Penske to compete in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series event at Penske's one-mile Nazareth (Pa.) Speedway. Although this is a one-shot deal, Wallace said he is not taking his truck-racing debut lightly. ``We're going to do it first-class,'' said Wallace, winner of the Winston Cup Miller 400 on Sunday at Penske's Michigan International Speedway. ``We're not going there just to make an appearance.'' Wallace said most of his Winston Cup pit crew will accompany him to Nazareth. And the meticulous Wallace said his black No. 2 Miller Beer Ford pickup has a killer paint job. ``Looks better than on the race car,'' he said. Wallace anticipates continued growth for the second-year truck series because it reaches an audience heretofore ignored by NASCAR. The series has been limited to tracks of one mile or less, mainly because of concerns about the lack of rear down force and stability of the trucks on super speedways, including the under-construction 1.5-mile Texas Motor Speedway in far north Fort Worth. ``I'm not saying they can't do it,'' Wallace said. ``If they go to Texas and run trucks, they (NASCAR) might say instead of running a 5-inch-tall rear spoiler, let's put a 61/2-inch spoiler on it like the Cup cars. And maybe we'll get all the down force we need, and the trucks will be stable. ``NASCAR can always change the rules. They'd have to, I think, to run the faster tracks.''

"63378"	"I"	"think"	" The Government's remaining arguments are, I think, readily rejected. The scope and force of the ``reserved powers'' and ``express delegation'' defenses which the plurality thinks inapplicable based on its view of the nature of the contracts at issue here, see ante, at 49-51 have not been well defined by our prior cases. The notion of ``reserved powers'' seems to stand principally for the proposition that certain core governmental powers cannot be surrendered, see, e.g., Stone v. Mississippi, 101 U. S. 814 (1880); thus understood, that doctrine would have no force where, as here, the private party to the contract does not seek to stay the exercise of sovereign authority, but merely requests damages for breach of contract. To the extent this Court has suggested that the notion of ``reserved powers'' contemplates, under some circumstances, nullification of even monetary governmental obligations pursuant to exercise of ``the federal police power or some other paramount power,'' Lynch v. United States, 292 U. S. 571, 579 (1934), I do not believe that regulatory measures designed to minimize what are essentially assumed commercial risks are the sort of ``police power'' or ``paramount power'' referred to. And whatever is required by the ``express delegation'' doctrine is to my mind satisfied by the statutes which the plurality identifies as conferring upon the various federal bank regulatory agencies involved in this case authority to enter into agreements of the sort at issue here, see ante, at 51-52. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"
"63379"	"I"	"think"	" Finally, in my view the Government cannot escape its obligations by appeal to the so-called ``sovereign acts'' doctrine. That doctrine was first articulated in Court of Claims cases, and has apparently been applied by this Court in only a single case, our 3-page opinion in Horowitz v. United States, 267 U. S. 458, decided in 1925 and cited only once since, in a passing reference, see Nortz v. United States, 294 U. S. 317, 327 (1935). Horowitz holds that ``the United States when sued as a contractor cannot be held liable for an obstruction to the performance of (a) particular contract resulting from its public and general acts as a sovereign.'' 267 U. S., at 461. In my view the ``sovereign acts'' doctrine adds little, if anything at all, to the ``unmistakability'' doctrine, and is avoided whenever that one would be i.e., whenever it is clear from the contract in question that the Government was committing itself not to rely upon its sovereign acts in asserting (or defending against) the doctrine of impossibility, which is another way of saying that the Government had assumed the risk of a change in its laws. That this is the correct interpretation of Horowitz is made clear, I think, by our two principal cases of this century holding that the Government may not simply repudiate its contractual obligations, Lynch v. United States, 292 U. S. 571 (1934), and Perry v. United States, 294 U. S. 330 (1935). Those cases, which are barely discussed by the plurality's opinion, failed even to mention Horowitz. In both of them, as here, Congress specifically set out to abrogate the essential bargain of the contracts at issue and in both we declared such abrogation to amount to impermissible repudiation. See Lynch, supra, at 578-580; Perry, supra, at 350-354. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"

BILL'S WORLD  By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star  The U.S. unemployment rate is at a six-year low. The issue voters must decide is whether the right people are out of work.  OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN''  ``Earlier today, the blockbuster movie of the summer, Independence Day,' opened all over the country. As you know, the movie is about space aliens -- space aliens come to Earth and destroy the White House. Fortunately, at the time, President Clinton is shacked up at the Marriott, so he's o.k.''  ``If you're like me, do what I do. If you want to spend eight dollars to see a hostile alien...take a New York City cab ride.''  ``All I need I an apron, oven mitts and a spatula, and I'm telling you, I'm ready for sex!''  ``Do you like New York City when it's a little sleepy, when it's kind of empty? Yeah, I enjoy it. As a matter of fact, you know the guy who stands out in front of the Ed Sullivan Theater every day screaming obscenities at me? Well, he's not there today, but early this morning, he faxed me the finger from the Hamptons.''  ``I had a pretty good weekend. I hosted up at my Brentwood estate my anti-speeding fundraiser benefit.''  ``The New York Yankees announced earlier today that they have resigned slugger Daryl Strawberry. If you think about it in terms of baseball, it makes perfect sense because now with Steve Howe gone, on the roster there is room for a designated felon.''  ``Yesterday, Daryl Strawberry, they moved him up from AA to AAA, and he played a minor league baseball game yesterday in Columbus, hit two home runs...and despite the fact that the night before he only got one hour of sleep. Gosh! I wonder how he managed to stay awake?''  ``Earlier this week, Boris Yeltsin was re-elected President of Russia...And you know, I think, by re-electing Yeltsin, the Russian people are sending a very strong message. And that message is, We want a drunk guy in charge!'''  ``Yesterday, Bob Dole was in town here in New York City. He went over to see our good friends, Regis and Kathie Lee...Bob Dole told some stories about Cody...No, no, no, I'm talking about Buffalo Bill Cody.''  ``Ladies and gentlemen, today is the 133rd anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg. A lot of people don't know this: this is the battle that made a war hero of Bob Dole.''  ``The one thing I think that people don't understand about the Fourth of July, when John Hancock was getting ready to sign the Declaration of Independence, Bob Dole said, Here, use my pen.'''  ``Bob Dole is now looking for a running mate. Bob Dole says he wants a running mate who is a ``10.'' Well, that's a very easy number for Bob Dole to remember because it also happens to be his Social Security number.''  ``Bob Dole is looking for a Vice President that is a ``10.'' When President Clinton is looking for a ``10,'' he's talking about a cocktail waitress at Hooters.''  ``People said that Bob Dole when he was on the Today' show continued to be a little cranky. In all fairness, I think I know what happened. He was on the Today' show -- yeah, he was cranky, he was upset. You know what happened -- Willard Scott forgot to wish him a happy 100th birthday.''  ``Here locally, it's a very festive day, Fourth of July. They have, Nathan's, out there in Coney Island, every year, has the hot dog eating competition. And this year's winner meets next week in the finals President Clinton.''  ``Do you know about the book that former FBI agent Gary Aldrich has written? It's just unbelievable! It's an insider look at the White House and the Clintons. And Hillary Clinton is being a little defensive about the book. She's saying that the book is a complete fabrication, should not be taken seriously -- you know, like her account of the Whitewater billing records.''  ``The book claims that Bill Clinton would sneak out of the White House at night to meet women. Right here you have the difference between Bill Clinton and Bob Dole: the only thing Bob Dole has ever been in bed with is the tobacco industry.''  ``This raises an interesting question: what has become of the FBI? A couple of weeks ago, we find out they let the White House have 700 confidential, personal files...And then a former agent, Gary Aldrich, writes the tell-all book about the Clintons.

BILL'S WORLD  By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star  The U.S. unemployment rate is at a six-year low. The issue voters must decide is whether the right people are out of work.  OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN''  ``Earlier today, the blockbuster movie of the summer, Independence Day,' opened all over the country. As you know, the movie is about space aliens -- space aliens come to Earth and destroy the White House. Fortunately, at the time, President Clinton is shacked up at the Marriott, so he's o.k.''  ``If you're like me, do what I do. If you want to spend eight dollars to see a hostile alien...take a New York City cab ride.''  ``All I need I an apron, oven mitts and a spatula, and I'm telling you, I'm ready for sex!''  ``Do you like New York City when it's a little sleepy, when it's kind of empty? Yeah, I enjoy it. As a matter of fact, you know the guy who stands out in front of the Ed Sullivan Theater every day screaming obscenities at me? Well, he's not there today, but early this morning, he faxed me the finger from the Hamptons.''  ``I had a pretty good weekend. I hosted up at my Brentwood estate my anti-speeding fundraiser benefit.''  ``The New York Yankees announced earlier today that they have resigned slugger Daryl Strawberry. If you think about it in terms of baseball, it makes perfect sense because now with Steve Howe gone, on the roster there is room for a designated felon.''  ``Yesterday, Daryl Strawberry, they moved him up from AA to AAA, and he played a minor league baseball game yesterday in Columbus, hit two home runs...and despite the fact that the night before he only got one hour of sleep. Gosh! I wonder how he managed to stay awake?''  ``Earlier this week, Boris Yeltsin was re-elected President of Russia...And you know, I think, by re-electing Yeltsin, the Russian people are sending a very strong message. And that message is, We want a drunk guy in charge!'''  ``Yesterday, Bob Dole was in town here in New York City. He went over to see our good friends, Regis and Kathie Lee...Bob Dole told some stories about Cody...No, no, no, I'm talking about Buffalo Bill Cody.''  ``Ladies and gentlemen, today is the 133rd anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg. A lot of people don't know this: this is the battle that made a war hero of Bob Dole.''  ``The one thing I think that people don't understand about the Fourth of July, when John Hancock was getting ready to sign the Declaration of Independence, Bob Dole said, Here, use my pen.'''  ``Bob Dole is now looking for a running mate. Bob Dole says he wants a running mate who is a ``10.'' Well, that's a very easy number for Bob Dole to remember because it also happens to be his Social Security number.''  ``Bob Dole is looking for a Vice President that is a ``10.'' When President Clinton is looking for a ``10,'' he's talking about a cocktail waitress at Hooters.''  ``People said that Bob Dole when he was on the Today' show continued to be a little cranky. In all fairness, I think I know what happened. He was on the Today' show -- yeah, he was cranky, he was upset. You know what happened -- Willard Scott forgot to wish him a happy 100th birthday.''  ``Here locally, it's a very festive day, Fourth of July. They have, Nathan's, out there in Coney Island, every year, has the hot dog eating competition. And this year's winner meets next week in the finals President Clinton.''  ``Do you know about the book that former FBI agent Gary Aldrich has written? It's just unbelievable! It's an insider look at the White House and the Clintons. And Hillary Clinton is being a little defensive about the book. She's saying that the book is a complete fabrication, should not be taken seriously -- you know, like her account of the Whitewater billing records.''  ``The book claims that Bill Clinton would sneak out of the White House at night to meet women. Right here you have the difference between Bill Clinton and Bob Dole: the only thing Bob Dole has ever been in bed with is the tobacco industry.''  ``This raises an interesting question: what has become of the FBI? A couple of weeks ago, we find out they let the White House have 700 confidential, personal files...And then a former agent, Gary Aldrich, writes the tell-all book about the Clintons. I'm telling you something, J. Edgar Hoover must be turning over in his dress.''  DAVID-LETTERMAN ``LATE SHOW'' TOP TEN  ``Ways Bob Dole Celebrated the Fourth of July''  10. While watching fireworks, was so overwhelmed with emotion he almost had a facial expression.  9. Requested moment of silence for friends he lost at Battle of Bunker Hill.  8. Marched in parade wearing Joe Camel costume.  7. Got confused, spent all morning hiding Easter eggs for the grandkids.  6. Smoked a joint and nailed a campaign worker -- I'm sorry, that's how President Clinton celebrated.  5. Every time Newt Gingrich looked the other way, spit watermelon seeds at his head.  4. Gathered everyone around the microwave to watch his pacemaker spark.  3. Played ``George and Martha'' with Elizabeth.  2. After having a few beers, took out his teeth and played them like castanets.  1. Same as always: kegs n' babes.  (MORE!)

"65330"	"I"	"think"	" A. You could insulate the chimney in the attic, but it won't do much good because its heat is insignificant. Your problem is, I think, the soffit vents; those two-inch holes do almost no good. What you need is a continuous opening two inches wide going the full length of each soffit, and covered with a louvered cover. And, make sure the ridge vent is actually venting. There should be a two-inch-wide opening in the roof on each side of the ridge board. If that isn't done, the vent will not vent. Sounds silly, but it has happened. To check, inspect the ridge from inside the attic; you may not see daylight, but you should see where the cut in the roof was made on each side of the ridge board. Or, light a match, blow it out and hold it near the ridge; the air ciruclation should move that smoke quickly. Naturally, the usual caveat: Be careful using matches in the house, attic or anyplace else. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"

"72754"	"I"	"think"	" You might take several approaches to this problem. The worst, I think, is to position the 403(b) portfolio more aggressively. For example, you might swap the annuity for more stock exposure _ hoping to exceed that 10 percent growth. But with the market sky-high right now, and with you so close to retirement, that is a very risky approach _ in fact, at your age most people are realigning their portfolios in the opposite direction, moving down from growth to growth and income funds, from growth and income to balanced, or from balanced to fixed-income funds. I think you should take that approach. I suggest you move about 40 percent of the 403(b) account to funds in the growth and income, equity income, and balanced category, leaving 20 percent in growth, 10 percent in balanced, and leaving the annuity (and your ongoing contributions to it) as is. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"

Our goal here is not simply to sort of stop the fighting in Bosnia. Our goal is to build a structure which supports peace rather than conflict. And the word structure is a diplomatic word meaning we make it clear to people that they shouldn't do it.

COMMENTARY  MURRAY-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ Most all of us have a book in us. The problem is getting it out of us. Rick Pezdirtz, I think, has found the perfect inspiration. He knew that if he didn't get his book finished God was going to get him. So it is, just in time for Christmas, that we have ``Promises Kept _ Memoirs of a Missionary Priest,'' the autobiography of Father Fred Julien as told to Rick Pezdirtz. The book has been almost 15 years in the making _ ever since Pezdirtz, a fallen-away sportswriter, made a promise to Father Julien, his priest since boyhood, that he would write his life story. Be careful what you promise a man of God. God is listening. (Murray). MOVED.  There are no stories scheduled out of the Cox Washington Bureau at this time.

Mind and mouth racing, he lurches out of the rain into a restaurant late one rainy night, sputtering, we think, incoherently. We quickly realize, however, that he's making perfect sense, delivering a running commentary not only on what he's seeing and thinking, but on himself. Mordant and ironic, shaky after years inside the institution into which he collapsed under the strain of rejection by his tyrannical father, his scattered state actually represents a turnaround, a rejoining of the world. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"

Reflecting this annual cycle, Mexico's highways, airports and bus terminals have become jammed in recent weeks with homeward-bound travelers.(Keith Dannemiller/New York Times Photo)  (NYT13) WASHINGTON -- Dec. 24, 1996 -- PELL-RETIRE-EDUC, 12-24 -- Senator Claiborne Pell, seated before a portrait of himself as a boy with his father, was the impetus behind the Pell educational grants.

They're the ones diving into platters of Dungeness crab. Christine Keff, the owner and chef, has made Flying Fish into one of the most non-traditional, yet popular, new area restaurants. By specializing in fresh seafood with a Pan-Asian flavor, she has set herself apart.

In the 1990s, stock funds have consistently outperformed bond funds, often by a wide margin. Bonds and bond funds make particularly good sense for investors who may need access to their money in a few years and for older people approaching retirement age.

At right, MClam puts a lot of effort into constructing his ``bed'' every night in a corner of the entrance to the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church. McClam commutes to a regular, minimum-wage job in Long Island City. He doesn't absolutely have to live in the box. But he has a clear goal: to save $50 a week so he can reunite with his estranged wife and two daughters who moved to Florida.

While people here voiced little if any sympathy for the rebels, they also expressed little empathy for the well-heeled coterie of hostages, all of whom have wealth unimaginable by Peruvian standards. (New York Times Photo)  (NYT18) CLARK, N.J. -- Dec. 24, 1996 -- KINDERCARE-KKR-CLR, 12-24 -- The chain that operates this Kindercare day care center in Clark, says it promotes ``industry-leading education and quality standards.'' But how many parents can afford it? While more money to subsidize day care is clearly necessary to meet the needs of lower-income families, no level of government is likely to aim much money in the direction of Kindercare and other centers that cater to the middle class.

"82249"	"I"	"think"	" ``It's one of his great gifts, I think, that he, in a sense, acknowledges the past,'' says Jacobi, who directed his friend as Hamlet in a 1988 production by Renaissance Theatre Company, the classical troupe Branagh co-founded in 1987. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"
"82391"	"I"	"think"	" But Freeman, I think, is on the right track with his idea of investing in children, even if he takes the wrong train to get there: more government social programs. The answer, I believe, is better education for at-risk kids. More than any other factor, a good education is the closest thing to a magic bullet to slay our society's assorted economic ills. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"

"82849"	"I"	"think"	" ``I thought it was a good game for us because mentally we lost our confidence and we had to fight through the third quarter where Philadelphia played pretty well and hung with us. Wearing a team down is something we haven't done very well this year and this is, I think, the first time we did that.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"83221"	"I"	"think"	" ``Miller, I think, will bring a sense of the poet's use of language to the public that is both accessible and original,'' said Robert Stewart, a poet and managing editor of New Letters, UMKC's literary magazine. ``Most poets, especially, recognize Miller as one of the great poets of our time, and yet he doesn't have the celebrity status that some other poets and fiction writers have. So this is a great joy that we can bring someone that talented to the public's attention.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"83330"	"I"	"think"	" And too many film makers, I think, would rather talk numbers than talk story. Talking story makes your head hurt. A good story is messy. It doesn't quite add up. Whereas numbers never lie. They are so ... solid. Comforting. Which is why we so often end up with stories that are really numbers in disguise (T2, ID4); certainly we end up with movies that appear to have been made by the numbers. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"83479"	"I"	"think"	" ``Though we are such a relatively young country, we are such a powerful country and, I think, a good model for others,'' she said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"83531"	"I"	"think"	" ``Business will be as usual at Dodger Stadium. This contract, I think, is reflective of that. We need to make the decisions. We do everything that we can to build a championship team. There has been no directive given to me other than, `Do business as you normally do.' '' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"83592"	"I"	"think"	" ``It really started, I think, from a natural feeling of camaraderie,'' he observes. ``The first people who worked at the space were just kind of hanging out.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"83783"	"I"	"think"	" ``Why's he so successful?'' said Corcoran, a '48 graduate of Springfield College who was coached in high school by the legendary Vince Lombardi at St. Cecilia High School in Englewood, N.J. ``Because he's organized, like every good coach has to be. His knowledge of the game is second to none _ X's and O's, there's nobody better. However, what separates him more than anything, I think, is how he has mastered the player-coach relationship. Guys love to play for him because he's honest, straightforward, no baloney. And if you don't have that, the rest of it is nothin'.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"83865"	"I"	"think"	" ``I am told that tens of thousands of prayer meetings are being held on this day, and for that I am deeply grateful. We are a nation under God, and I believe God intended for us to be free. It would be fitting and good, I think, if on each Inauguration Day in future years it should be declared a day of prayer.'' -- Ronald Reagan's first inaugural. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

"83984"	"I"	"think"	" Gov. Fife Symington said, ``Anything that's been around over 100 years is, I think, in the eyes of many of us, just a true institution. It's a part of our culture. . . . It will be missed.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"84040"	"I"	"think"	" Public schools ostensibly didn't allow corporal punishment, but that policy obviously didn't filter down to certain classrooms at Gray School. I was at the receiving end of some stout oak yardsticks, blackboard pointers and other such devices. And the hearing in my left ear was diminished early in life, I think, from being hoisted off my feet as someone used the ear as a handle to take me to the principal's office. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"84098"	"I"	"think"	" Years ago she wrote: ``In my best moments, I think, `Life has passed me by,' and I am content.'' Does she still feel that? ``Well, I feel life is passing. I've always been alone and painting, and I still live alone. But I don't think life has passed me by.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"84099"	"I"	"think"	" ``It's a most wonderful gift, life. You make 50 responses in every minute and every minute is different from every other minute. I once taught art to adults in a night course and I had a woman who painted her backyard, and she said it was the first time she had ever really looked at it. Everyone sees beauty, I think, and art is a way to respond.'' </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19970114.0666 type=story > <HEADLINE> NEW YORK-NEW YORK, IT'S A CASINO'S REPLICA TOWN </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> LAS VEGAS (BC-VEGAS-NY-CASINO-2TAKES-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

"84144"	"I"	"think"	" ``I'm just smarter, I think, about how to work with the other side. I've come to realize litigation should not be war. It's wasteful as a war.'' His old paradigm, he says, was ``to tame the bully by being a bigger bully.'' Now, he says, ``you achieve a true victory by harnessing power, not destroying it.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

"84366"	"they"	"think"	" It's an indictment of today's music biz that the Drifters are not signed. ``We're dealing with a youth-oriented culture,'' says Holsapple. ``When (record executives) see people on stage who aren't 20 years old, they think, `What are we going to do with them?

"84494"	"I"	"think"	" ``The first and, I think, the worst'' is immediate decontrol upon vacancy, he said, because it is ``scattershot, hard to keep track of; in the same building, apartment by apartment, one person's rent is tremendously different by the sheer accident of who moved out.'' And vacancy decontrol spurs some landlords to harass tenants to move, Keating said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

"84654"	"I"	"think"	" The letter writer also ran into some disruption, including a campaign by some teachers to end her work with the school.

"84674"	"I"	"think"	" ``It's hard to criticize David Mamet, I think, because he's an original writer,'' she said. ``He's absolutely an original. Nobody writes like him, nobody has ever written the way he writes. Very few people have such a strongly defined aesthetic in both the films that he makes and the plays that he writes. He's incredibly articulate about his philosophy in the theater and his interest in the theater _ far more articulate than many other playwrights. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

"84915"	"I"	"think"	" ``I find it easy to come here,'' said Sylvia Barash, who lives in New York City's Greenwich Village.

"85192"	"I"	"think"	" Mrs. Halpert is more agile in describing the mission of the school: To ``turn out young women who will be good citizens in a democratic society.''

"85208"	"I"	"think"	" ``If a kid were disruptive, you would either paddle him or call his parents,'' said Ronny White, former Fort Worth school district athletic director. ``Most chose the paddle. Then, of course, you couldn't do that and it became the parents would call and ask what the teacher did (to provoke the student).

"85584"	"I"	"think"	" In fact, Maurer's light show thrilled people in a way the fair could not. The fair was about reason and logic, simplicity and technology. Maurer rediscovered the coherence that once existed between form, function and creative passion. And he did it with romance, drama and mystery. The event was not about selling products (although it provided a wonderful stage set for his work). It was a gift of spirit. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19970129.0437 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-HEARST-NEWS-BUDGET-1STLD-WRITETHRU-HNS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Wednesday, Jan. 29, 1997  Editors  The Hearst News Service will file the following stories for Thursday and Sunday.

BABBIT-GRAND-CANYON-HNS (Berkeley, Calif.) _ At sunrise and sunset, tourists from around the world flock to the rims of the Grand Canyon to see the incredible colors on the layers of stones that rise thousands of feet above the Colorado River. It's a unique moment on Earth. By Carl Irving. Moved 1-28.  BORDER-TOUR-HNS (Tijuana) _ They paid $450 each to be ushered along a rocky, garbage-strewn path. And when they reached their destination _ the steel wall bisecting the border _ they joined a circle of men who regarded them with curiosity. Introductions began. But suddenly, a helicopter with a blinding spotlight burst out of the night. Were these desperate migrants hoping to cross the border? Not exactly. They were American tourists on a ``reality tour'' of the Mexico-California border sponsored by San Francisco's Global Exchange. By Susan Ferriss. Moved 1-27.  EXCLUSIVE-WOODSTOCK-LEGACY-ART-NYT (Bethel, N.Y.) _ Every summer, tens of thousands of pilgrims come to this Catskills town to gaze at what seems to be an ordinary cow pasture but to them is hallowed ground. Now Sullivan County officials have decided that rather than fight the invading hordes, they will acquire the 37-acre field and turn it into a shrine to Woodstock. By Joseph Berger. W/photo.

WINE-TRAVEL-LADN (Los Angeles) _ Forgetting to taste and encountering the occasional poseur is only a minor annoyance on the wine-tasting circuit in and around the rustic epicenter of California's Central Coast wine country, Los Olivos, a paltry 100 miles from Los Angeles up highways 101 and 154.

Not when you consider the fancy minarets of the nearby Tampa Bay Hotel or the real Tiffany windows of the Ponce de Leon Hotel in St. Augustine. No, the Belleview Hotel was never the real Belle of Florida's Gilded Age. But today, 100 years after it opened on Jan. 15, 1897, it is the most amazing of them all for one reason _ it survived.

Feeding the trend are lower fares, new investments in mountain airports and the placement of Denver's new airport on Colorado's eastern plains. By James Brooke. Moved 1-27 for 2-2.  TAHOE-HNS (South Lake Tahoe) _ Top tourism officials held a hasty summit meeting to plot their recovery from nature's second January sucker punch. Their surprising conclusion: Do nothing for now. Despite a second closure of U.S. 50, Tahoe's economic tether to the Bay Area and Sacramento, marketing directors of the top casinos and ski resorts said they didn't see disaster looming.

TRAVEL-CRUISESHIPS-ART-NYT (Undated) _ Heavy bookings for millennium cruises, including cruises whose price and itinerary are not yet established, promise to jump-start the cruise business for the year 2000.

To ensure that popularity, the biggest ships (whose number _ and size _ are growing rapidly) have virtually become floating destinations, competing with resorts for vacationers' dollars.

Despite a second closure of U.S. 50, Tahoe's economic tether to the Bay Area and Sacramento, marketing directors of the top casinos and ski resorts said they didn't see disaster looming. Small hotel owners sing a sadder song. By Michael Dougan. Moved 1-28.  EXHIBITS AND ANNIVERSARIES  JEWELS-OF-THE-CZARS-NYT (Washington) _ Few blockbuster exhibitions have popped into view as suddenly as ``Jewels of the Romanovs: Treasures of the Russian Imperial Court,'' the jewel-studded display of art and artifacts that opens on Jan. 30 at the Corcoran Gallery of Art. By Roberta Smith. Moved 1-28.  BOTTICELLI-ART-NYT (Boston) _ ``Botticelli's Witness: Changing Style in a Changing Florence'' opened in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum 10 days ago and runs through April 6. This elegant show of just 12 paintings and engravings that span Botticelli's life, 1445 to 1510, raises a big issue: the effect of politics and faith on an artist's work. By Deborah Weisgall. Moved 1-28.  TRAVEL-NOTES-BOS (Undated) _ Old Sturbridge Village, a re-created New England town of the 1830s, in Sturbridge, Mass., will hold a Washington's Birthday celebration Feb. 15-17 featuring song, dance and formal toasts to our first president. Moved 1-28.  CONSUMER NEWS  AIRLINE-PILOTS-REVIEW-NYT (Undated) _ Pilots' restiveness is about more than wages. Broad changes have occurred in the nature of the profession and the makeup of the pilot ranks, and those shifts help explain some of the current saber-rattling. Pilots, for example, do not command the respect they once did when air travel was glamorous and only for the well heeled. By Adam Bryant. Moved 1-25.  TRAVEL-CRUISESHIPS-ART-NYT (Undated) _ Heavy bookings for millennium cruises, including cruises whose price and itinerary are not yet established, promise to jump-start the cruise business for the year 2000. But right now the industry is perplexed about 1996, worried about 1997, and wondering whether any of those heady projections about the growing popularity of cruising will be realized before the next century. To ensure that popularity, the biggest ships (whose number _ and size _ are growing rapidly) have virtually become floating destinations, competing with resorts for vacationers' dollars.

By Peter Bodo. Moved 1-27.  KANSAS-PRAIRIE-PARK-ART-NYT (Lawrence) _ Creation of the new Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve in east-central Kansas did not end the debate between ranchers and environmentalists about how to manage what is left of the grassland that once stretched from Pennsylvania to Kansas and from Alberta to Texas. Rather, it left open the possibility of new confrontations, because Congress did not specify how the National Park Service should manage the new preserve. W/photo. Moved 1-26.  WILDERNESS-ROADS-ART-NYT (Arch Canyon, Utah) _ Some Utah environmentalists, when they want a dose of activism, hike into the remote red canyons in the southern part of the state to look at roads that they say are not really there. It is their itinerant tactic in a growing fight over millions of acres in the state, the latest battle in the decades-long struggle over control of federal lands in the West. By John Cushman. W/photo. Moved 1-28.  OUTDOORS-HIKING-NYT (Moshannon State Forest Pa.) _ Three-eighths of a mile doesn't go quickly,'' Ralph Seeley warned me as we hiked through the rugged ridgetop woods of central Pennsylvania.

Whether we get there or not remains to be seen, but they all worked hard as heck in the weight room in the spring and summer, and they all worked on their games.

(And based on some hints you gave, I think I know what it is, and I believe that is the case.) So a better number might be to compare your company's P/E ratio with that of the large-cap market in general, currently about 20. The board of your company might argue, and I would agree, that this is a high price; on the other hand, anything under 15 times earnings would, I think, confirm your feeling that the stock is underpriced. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"

Of course, as one of my running buddies is ever fond of pointing out to me, I look up to most everybody, since I come from a long line of short people, including a midget uncle who repaired bicycles though he couldn't reach the pedals. Still, the folks shooting practice jumpers and routinely slamming the ball into the rim while barely getting off their feet look like giants, even from my seat 20 rows back or so in the Summit.

"88995"	"I"	"think"	" ``The old jail closed in 1929 and sat empty until the 1940s,'' Magoto said. ``The county was going to tear it down for the stones, I think, but Robert Nail bought it instead. I think he paid $25 for it.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199703.gz"
"89126"	"I"	"think"	" ``It's just that all the other events are (contested) in high school, so there's no feeder system (for the javelin),'' Blutreich said. ``The development is just not there. Only 13 states, I think, throw it in high school, maybe less than that. The javelin is something you have to start when you're really young.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200007.gz"
"89212"	"I"	"think"	" Both Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Kerik said Tuesday that the park is safe. ``The reality is that Central Park is very safe in comparison to just about most other places in the city, and it is very safe in comparison to parks in urban areas throughout the country,'' the mayor said, adding, ``Last week was, I think, the lowest week for crime the city has had since I have been mayor,'' meaning the lowest for overall crime in about 36 years, he said. Homicides in the city are down about 20 percent from a year ago, the mayor said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200102.gz"
"89258"	"I"	"think"	" There was a great deal to like about the game _ not least that it allowed me to play as a pacifist. But paramount among Age of Empires II's virtues, I think, was familiarity. I had met these earthly empires in real world histories long before I cracked the seal on the game box. I didn't feel like a stranger in a strange land, but like a relay runner who had just been handed a baton. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200102.gz"
"89314"	"I"	"think"	" In a more recent book, ``The Third Reich: A New History,'' English scholar Michael Burleigh also suggests that intolerance and hatred grew slowly, fed both by a messianic authority and by a frustrated people hungry for a providential power that would give them back their pride.

"89433"	"I"	"think"	" ``Seeing combat really toughened him, I think,'' Novak said Friday. ``He was no longer a society boy. And he didn't want to go back to Yale after that. It had changed him and I think it changed him for life.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200103.gz"
"89453"	"I"	"think"	" ``Right now, we're so focused on trying to win this year, so we're not going to get ahead of ourselves (and discuss the option),'' said Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone, who was asked about Shaw's future. ``His family is his priority, which is admirable. I think Jeff's one of those guys that when he doesn't feel he's the guy he needs to be or wants to be, he will walk away. He's not a guy that, I think, would just play for the money because his family and his time is so important to him, but I think he's going to have a good year for us.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200103.gz"

"89532"	"I"	"think"	" ``A little bit, early,'' he said, asked if he allowed himself a moment during the pregame skate to think about the meaning of the day. ``I didn't want to start looking around . . . at that point, you can't let it go. You have to focus and be businesslike, I think, and not let your thoughts wander.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200103.gz"
"89533"	"I"	"think"	" ``This past race at Atlanta, we were right up against the wall, like Darlington. The speeds these motors carry into the corners over the old motors is a lot greater, like some 10 mph. It takes more track and you've got to find more grip somewhere, and you can run higher to do that. So, the whole race will be different, I think, from our perspective.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200103.gz"
"89606"	"I"	"think"	" ``I'm OK to throw. I could be out there for opening day. I'd have to monitor myself as far as my activities for baserunning and going after bunts, stuff like that. That, I think, is what scares them, that during the heat of competition, you'd do something beyond what you can handle.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200103.gz"
"89698"	"I"	"think"	" ``I'm encouraged by where we're at,'' Malone said. ``We've made a lot of progress. We're getting to a point where we now have options, we have some quality depth. The farm system is about two or three years away from being, I think, one of the best in baseball. We've got a large wave of quality prospects that are at the A-ball level. I believe our scouting department is comparable to any in baseball. Our player development continues to improve, and the biggest thing is, with Jim Tracy on board, we have a very cohesive group. There's a lot of togetherness between major league, minor league and scouting. We're all on the same page. I feel like finally, going into our third season, we're all on the same page.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200103.gz"

"89784"	"I"	"think"	" ``That we were all together when we heard it, I think, is something that will make us a little stronger, that we shared our grief together,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said. ``Guys know there was real emotion there, and a lot of people to share it with.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"89937"	"I"	"think"	" ``Congress sent them the signal in the hearings, which they ignored. Now they receive a letter, which they still don't seem to be responding to. There's a growing sense of frustration, I think, on the part of the folks on the Hill that these guys are not getting it,'' said Harold Feld, associate director of the Media Access Project, a nonprofit law firm in Washington that works on consumer and communication issues. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"89985"	"I"	"think"	" ``There's a lot more to this issue,'' Jones said, adding that the elections laws as enforced last year disenfranchised too many voters, a disproportionate number of whom were black. ``There are some things, I think, that shouldn't be partisan. One person, one vote is one of them. ... That goes right to my heart.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"90077"	"I"	"think"	" ``I was air-guitaring since, I think, when I was in the womb, so it was really fun for me to do this project,'' Dawson reveals. ``We played in front of 7,000 people!

"90096"	"I"	"think"	" The comedian said the award is the one ``we've all been waiting for. What's in this envelope is going to send shock waves through the industry. Oh, yeah.''  THE RITUAL DANCE OF MAKING MOVIES ``There's a party before the movie, there's a pre-movie-party get-together, there's a gift that you're given from the studio, there's a wrap party that happens after it, there's a premiere, there's awards. It is clearly the most self-congratulatory business, I think, on earth other than politics.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"

"90104"	"I"	"think"	" ``Something like this happens and kind of the instinctive reaction of many is 'By Gosh, we've got to show them how powerful we are,''' said Hamilton, who chaired the House International Relations Committee for many years. ``That kind of advice, I think, was clearly wrong and the president rejected it and made the right call.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"

"90312"	"you"	"think"	" If there was one trap that Bowles wanted to avoid, it was the all-too-easy presentation of Kennedy as an icon. ``Initially, you think, Oh, let's get some Warhols up here,'' he said, walking through the expansive upstairs galleries, where the show will be held (rather than in the basement-level Costume Institute). ``Now I'm happy I didn't go that way, because it's stuff that's part of the Jackie industry.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"90489"	"I"	"think"	" ``You feel they don't want to get to know you,'' Daley said of his professors. ``The fact that it's a smaller group of people, I think, will help'' make professors more accessible, he added. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"90506"	"I"	"think"	" Pettitte blamed his loss on his inability to buckle down after the Knoblauch play. ``I knew it was a catch,'' he said. ``They're not perfect; they're going to make mistakes. It's my job to get the next guy, and I didn't do it. I threw Dante (Bichette) a first-pitch curve, I think, and he stayed on it well. They hit a lot of balls that were just out of the reach of our gloves. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"90697"	"you"	"think"	" Ultimately, it doesn't matter what I think, you think, the president of the Bosox Club thinks, or Jimy Williams thinks: Dan Duquette answers to a consttuency of one, and John Harrington appears to be pleased. And despite all the personality negatives, and the fact that he has a way of taking much of the fun out of everything connected with baseball, three out of six isn't bad. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"90819"	"I"	"think"	" ``I like to fish my way down into the pasture,'' he said. ``I like that area and not very many people know about it. You get a lot of good fish there and, I think, the fish tend to spawn there.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"90846"	"they"	"think"	" Seefeldt doesn't even like to see a teacher or parent draw with children. ``You become the model. When their's doesn't look like yours, they think, `I can't do this,' and sooner or later, they stop trying.'' She says stencils are a form of theft: ``You're stealing a child's opportunity to think for himself.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"90866"	"I"	"think"	" ``For years I felt nobody understood what I was doing, that everyone said I was criticizing television because I was making videos. If it was video art it must be about television. These days video is no longer new and people understand this sort of work better, I think, but then here I am doing a whole show with television antennas. So I hope people don't just assume this is about TV. I think it's about conjuring up psychological states, about conjuring up internal spirits, and reimagining ourselves through technology.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"90892"	"I"	"think"	" The original ``Adventures of Tom Sawyer'' is fundamentally a children's story, but it is a story viewed from the distance of adulthood by a sly and skeptical adult. In their new musical version of the novel, Ken Ludwig and Don Schlitz mean, I think, to honor this split personality. But instead of being a layered work with appeal for both kids and grown-ups, the tame, middle-of-the-road show that opened on Broadway at the Minskoff Theater on Thursday feels muddled and torn. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"90893"	"I"	"think"	" Of course, that is the complaint of a finicky theatergoer, the kind who is often accused of being a spoilsport, too eager to find fault and unwilling to yield to simple delight. It's true, I think, that young audience members and other theater beginners will be able to find enough here to hold their attention. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"91012"	"I"	"think"	" ``People are always going to look at the first crisis and say, `How did the president do?' '' she said. ``The China crisis, I think, demonstrated that he did well. You could see some of his personal characteristics coming out in his leadership, his willingness to wait, to not be publicly personally involved. He has always been comfortable with having other people taking the credit or doing things once he's got the operation in motion and when he is comfortable with the way it is going.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"

"91142"	"I"	"think"	" ``One of the hallmarks, I think, of President Bush's administration is he focuses on really big, substantive, important things _ as opposed to a little initiative here and a little initiative there,'' Hughes said. ``One of the things you'll find that characterizes this president is strategic thinking, a new, constructive approach to governing in a way that focuses on results but also focuses on big important reforms that are really fundamental or profound.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"

"91292"	"I"	"think"	" ``There's a difference on hitters because of a little bit of uncertainty, I think,'' Remlinger said. ``There are some balls that are called strikes that, from a pitcher's standpoint, are probably mistakes _ the hanging breaking ball that the guy may not swing at. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"91326"	"I"	"think"	" That these place-particular songs were appealing to Icelandic listeners at precisely a time when Sigur Ros was mesmerizing European rock sophisticates _ and major-label execs _ as an opening act for Radiohead on its big tour last summer is evidence, I think, of a globalization more complicated and more hopeful than the dark prophets of a looming imperial pop-monoculture would have us believe. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"

"91422"	"I"	"think"	" ``It's a dead giveaway. The suit is way over the top. Then you probably are running out of funds.

"91503"	"I"	"think"	" ``I would agree that the attitude in here has been much better this year,'' Brown said. ``It's much more upbeat, I think, and confident. I don't know how to pinpoint what's going on.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"

TEXAS-SCHOLARSHIPS  ARLINGTON _ The University of Texas at Arlington doesn't compete with UT-Austin or Texas A&AMP;M for football players, but it is poised to spend $65,000 to battle for some of Texas' best brains. This week, the university begins campaigning to persuade Texas' National Merit Scholarship semifinalists to consider UT-Arlington instead of UT-Austin, A&AMP;M, Rice University and other schools that typically scoop up large numbers of the state's sharpest test takers for their freshmen classes.

"91983"	"I"	"think"	" The Bush administration has embarked on a campaign to dislodge those ``ingrained views,'' both in Europe and Asia.

"91995"	"I"	"think"	" His outburst also tells us he is deeply insecure. When Bashar succeeded his father, there was at least a hint in his early interviews and speeches that he wanted to build his legitimacy on modernizing Syria and lifting it from backwardness, not on hating Israel. But since taking office, I think, he has become aware of how difficult modernization really is in a country with a skyrocketing birth rate and a crumbling Soviet-era infrastructure. He experimented with some forums for free discussion, and then closed them a month later under pressure from the Syrian secret police. So, failing to build his legitimacy on the basis of real change in Syria, Bashar is opting for the old way. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"

"95450"	"I"	"think"	" ``The thing that impressed me the most, I think, was when he said that he doesn't read the polls, doesn't make decisions by sticking his finger in the wind,'' said Rep.

We grew up in the fact that we live here with people about whom we know almost everything that can be known as a citizen of the same neighborhood or town. We learn significant things that way.

"95638"	"we"	"think"	" ``People don't know how to protect themselves,'' said H Power's chief executive, H.

"95776"	"I"	"think"	" It is not that the opposition to civil unions has gone away. Recent polls show that the state is still split about half and half between supporters and opponents, with the edge going to the opponents. And Diane Gardner, president of Take It to the People, a state group that wants a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman, said, ``There's still a lot of anger, I think, on both sides.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"
"95788"	"I"	"think"	" Rumsfeld, not known for his love of the press, bristled a bit, then replied: ``I don't recall using that phrase. I've heard the last administration talk about strategic partners, and then I've heard others say strategic competitors.

"95873"	"I"	"think"	" ``If we don't get any water this fall, we're going to be completely out, I think, come the first of the year,'' said Jimmy Weingardner, 60, a Hidalgo County farmer who grows cotton and oranges and has reduced watering this summer. ``Two things you always worry about _ the market and the weather. Now there's a third problem, the water problem.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"
"95912"	"I"	"think"	" The White House has never defined explicitly when that not-too-distant future will arrive, saying instead that it is talking in terms ``of months, not years.'' Asked Wednesday night what that meant, Bolton replied, ``By definition, I think, `months less than years' means 23 months or less.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200108.gz"
"95913"	"I"	"think"	" ``The real issue, I think, is the deepening of the political and economic conversations between the two governments, and that alone would be substantial progress. But we'll just have to see what happens by November.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200108.gz"
"96042"	"I"	"think"	" ``There's no question that losing Gary and Daniel is tough on us,'' said senior strong safety Kyle Staudt. ``But we've had young guys like Bobby Hart and Randy Davis and Matt Johnson step up. They're just filling the roles where Gary and Daniel left off. And it's not like we've dropped off a couple of steps because they're gone. We're at the same point, I think, if not higher.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200108.gz"
"96116"	"I"	"think"	" Contemporary artists often seem to work with spiritual themes not because they hold certain beliefs, but because they're in search of them. Turrell, I think, is a genuine exception. A lifelong Quaker, he remembers his grandmother taking him to a meeting, saying to him: ``We're going inside to find the light.'' Decades later, he made that phrase tangible fact in his design for the Live Oak Meeting House in Houston. The roof opens to let light stream into the room. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"
"96224"	"I"	"think"	" ``To say that we're going to do a huge bundle of money and not know what the cost is, I think, would probably be a poor use of American taxpayers' dollars,'' said House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"
"96249"	"you"	"think"	" Having been in a locker room or two, I have learned to dread the moment when the average athlete takes a deep breath, looks skyward, and prepares to offer an opinion on the big picture. Uh-oh, you think, he's going to try to be profound. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"
"96349"	"I"	"think"	" ``The audience, I think, also likes seeing characters who are willing to risk everything for one another, constantly, and there's something very romantic about that,'' she continues. ``You've also got these friends who are willing to miss school, to put their lives in jeopardy to save these kids. I just think `Roswell' is a very positive show that people can watch every week.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"
"96449"	"I"	"think"	" ``We have got to give people the confidence that they can fly with an assurance that they're going to get to the destination they purchased without threat to life and limb,'' O'Neill said. `` And we're going to have to do that by beefing up security, I think, frankly by getting the federal taxpayer to pay for airplane and airport security with marshals and--and--and all of the detection devices and assurances so that the American people can see for themselves and can say to themselves, `I can fly with confidence.''' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"

"96847"	"I"	"think"	" In the Persian Gulf War we rushed to the aid of Kuwait, a monarchy in which women enjoyed approximately the same rights as a 19th-century American slave.

"96905"	"I"	"think"	" Shelley Ross, executive producer of ``Good Morning America,'' said even this measured process might be interrupted by retaliatory attacks involving American soldiers. ``We have to feel, first and foremost, I think, respectful of soldiers in harm's way and all of these families,'' she said. Like its competitors, ``Good Morning America'' has begun to report other news, including the tornado that struck Maryland on Monday, but still remains mostly focused on the attacks. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"
"97001"	"I"	"think"	" She repeated the role the next year in a PBS production, with her father as the White Knight. She met Martin, who played the Dormouse, in the Broadway ``Alice.'' Now the artistic director of the Huntington Theater Company, he has directed her in several other plays, primarily at Williamstown, including ``The Royal Family'' and ``The Matchmaker.'' About Burton's technique, Martin said, ``Sometimes, I think, her very proficiency has affected the perception of her, so that she has been given parts that were workmanlike instead of great.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"

"97078"	"I"	"think"	" ``Two things made it real for people here, I think,'' said Stewart Kwoh, executive director of the Asian Pacific American Legal Center of Southern California. ``There was the indiscriminate nature of the killing, which means anyone could have been affected. And I think everyone realizes it could happen here. It almost did happen here.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"
"97084"	"I"	"think"	" ``Two things made it real for people here, I think,'' said Stewart Kwoh, executive director of the Asian Pacific American Legal Center of Southern California. ``There was the indiscriminate nature of the killing, which means anyone could have been affected.

"97122"	"I"	"think"	" Other current hot sellers are world maps. ``A lot of that, I think, is people are trying to get an idea where the U.S. is distance-wise from the Middle East, that's my guess,'' McCloy said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"
"97154"	"I"	"think"	" The president's greatest achievement, I think, has been to hold the country together behind a careful, patient policy. There has been an extraordinary absence of partisan ideology. Two large exceptions, in their egregious character, prove that rule. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"
"97288"	"I"	"think"	" ``Sales are off _ they're getting worse every year,'' said a saleswomen named Zhao, who wore a long white coat. ``The flavor is better, I think, but people just aren't buying like they used to.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"
"97383"	"I"	"think"	" The Pentagon's top spokesman, Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, said, in retrospect, that ``it would have been pretty petty of us, I think, to have done something like seize the plane, and say when you release ours, we'll release yours.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"97451"	"I"	"think"	" ``The willingness of anyone to capitulate in the face of a threat to our orderly constitutional transition of government ought to raise, I think, a fundamental concern that should give every New Yorker pause,'' he said. ``I believe that anyone running for mayor of New York must be prepared to meet a crisis head-on, and must also be ready for other unforeseen challenges.' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"97530"	"I"	"think"	" Powell alluded to past crimes attributed to al-Qaeda and bin Laden, who has been indicted in the United States for the August 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa and is suspected of masterminding the bombing of the destroyer Cole in Yemen harbor last October. The secretary of state said the briefings spanned ``the history of the organization and the fact that we have every right to go after them because they've already been indicted, al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, for past crimes against the United States and, I think, civilization.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"97542"	"I"	"think"	" Powell described in general terms the cable that has been sent to U.S. embassies around the world outlining the case against bin Laden. He said it describes the history of the terrorist network, and recites existing indictments filed against bin Laden for his alleged involvement in the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa. It also describes evidence of bin Laden's responsibility ``for past crimes against the U.S. and, I think, against civilization,'' presumably including the attack last year on the American destroyer Cole in Yemen. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"97590"	"I"	"think"	" ``There are arguments for both sides,'' she notes. ``But the thing about the movie is that there's nothing cynical in it, nothing ugly about it. It's very much an ethereal fairy tale, and one of the characters in the movie is New York and that kind of odd thing about it, that magical things do happen there. And the fact that this is such a love letter to the city, I think, is a good thing. I hope that people see it as some kind of light relief that, while not skirting around it, is celebrating New York.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"97600"	"I"	"think"	" ``You really can't put a price tag on helping out our families and our children of those who are defending our very liberty and freedom,'' she said. ``But we are talking about 85,000 reservists in the state of Texas and we've had, I think, to date 1,000 National Guardsmen and women called up. We are 20 million strong in this state. I can assure you that whatever cost it is, it is minimal and we will proudly absorb it.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"97646"	"I"	"think"	" ``I've specifically not stated, nor have I even talked to our coaches about any kind of numbers,'' Maurice said. ``I think that would be, in some respects, disrespectful to both goaltenders. Because they're both capable, I think, of handling pretty heavy workloads.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"97730"	"I"	"think"	" ``It would be uncomfortable just being there, I think,'' Jon Seda, the former ``Homicide'' star now appearing in NBC's ``UC: Undercover,'' said in an interview. ``Not for security reasons but for the kind of affair it is _ it just doesn't feel like the right time.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"97784"	"I"	"think"	" ``I'm not saying that it's al Qaeda,'' she said. ``But everyone should know, I think, that we have some real concerns about operations in our country. That's all I'm going to say.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"97844"	"I"	"think"	" ``Underneath both grief and aggression are fear and vulnerability, and, I think, this is where the genders come in,'' Rueth continued. ``Grief and anger are very uncomfortable, but they're different. Grief drains energy. We feel apathetic, overwhelmed. Aggression and anger are painful, but they're energizing. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"97853"	"we"	"think"	" Our goal in general is to be in the top five market share. We're seventh in Georgia and seventh in Atlanta, so we've still got a little more to do. We can do that, we think, through more acquisitions, or we can expand our franchise (by building new branches). </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"97917"	"I"	"think"	" ``They're ready to play somebody, I think,'' Hamblen said afterward. ``They've been going against each other now for what, 10 practices. So I think they're ready to play somebody. They're tired of playing one another.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"97988"	"I"	"think"	" Asked on Saturday if he could remember such strong words volleyed between the two governments, Shimon Peres, Sharon's foreign minister, let out a long sigh. ``There was once, I think,'' he said at last. He said that Menachem Begin once informed the American ambassador that Israel was not a banana republic, to be shoved around. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"

"98055"	"I"	"think"	" ``There are still some great ones out there,'' said Mike Milbury, general manager of the New York Islanders. ``But they were the greatest of the '80s and '90s, no question. Above all of them, though, was Raymond. His unprecedented string of excellence, I think, is unmatched. Gordie Howe had a great run, but he wasn't the All-Star player that Ray was for 20 years. Other sports, maybe Lou Gehrig comes close, but baseball doesn't have the punishing play of hockey.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"98136"	"we"	"think"	" Meanwhile, the chief evildoer sits in his cave, we think, plotting what  evil, we still don't know. What does the cave of a multibillionaire look  like anyway? Does he get CNN?

"98179"	"I"	"think"	" ``We were living too near the airport, I think,'' he said. ``One bomb shattered our windows. It was time to get out.

"98296"	"I"	"think"	" ``Bandits'' was directed by Barry Levinson, who since his jaunty debut film ``Diner'' has wrapped himself completely in the cocoon of mainstream Hollywood moviemaking. He no longer seems capable of thinking in even remotely provocative ways. (''Wag the Dog,'' his only decent film since ``Tin Men,'' was fueled almost entirely by David Mamet's script and Dustin Hoffman's ingenious performance.) Over one scene, Levinson plays ``Just the Two of Us'' _ an uninspired song choice to begin with, made worse because it just keeps playing. The joke is supposed to be that Thornton's character has an obsessive-compulsive disorder that requires him to keep playing the same song on a jukebox. The reality, I think, is that Levinson couldn't think of another song to put on the soundtrack. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"

"98486"	"I"	"think"	" Powell's rueful, fragrant novels have gradually risen in critical estimation, and she's deserving of anthologies, but let's not lose our heads. There's a sameness to Powell's work, and her books are, I think, best seen as one continuing chronicle, in the comedy-of-manners style of Trollope. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"

"98768"	"I"	"think"	" Hemline issues are the most recent in the unprecedented but perhaps predictable fashion crises of my sixth-grade boy. For a decade _ save for a few precious months in his preschool years when he was inclined to wear all green, carry a toy dagger and call me Wendy _ he had absolutely no idea what was on his body at any given moment. He didn't care. He didn't pay attention because he found it boring beyond belief. Every morning, he'd ask me where he could find his underwear, hoping, I think, that fairies had swept through the house in the night, moving around undergarments in a playful game instead of the more boring truth that it was stacked in the left-hand side of his top drawer, as usual. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"98797"	"I"	"think"	" ``When society is trying to deal with the unimaginable, it's interesting how often it is horror films that help them cope with it,'' said Ernest Dickerson, an acclaimed cinematographer turned director, whose first horror film, ``Bones,'' will be released on Wednesday. ``How do you survive when an unimaginable force is trying to destroy you? Seeing how people cope with something like that up on the screen helps prepare us somehow. Just as science-fiction films, I think, become a cushion for future shock, horror films become a cushion for terror shock.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"

On background, which prevents attribution to a specific person, an administration official contra-dicted me; he thought that the RFE crowd, admittedly harder-sell than VOA, was still not tough enough.

"99527"	"I"	"think"	" In the case of ``Va Savoir,'' most of the reviews I've read agree that, in the words of Slate's David Edelstein, it's a ``lovely, momentous piffle.'' But does a 21/2-hour film have the right to be a piffle? If we're giving up that much of our time, don't we want to see something important? The sentiment among the film's champions, I think, can be summed up in an e-mail from a film buff friend of mine who did intellectual backflips to find meaning in the movie. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"

I'm certainly not going to go out there and lose so it makes it look better that someone else is one. At the same time, I've had a pretty consistent year. I'm going for, I think, my eighth title tomorrow. That's a lot of titles. But I would rather be sitting up here with two Grand Slams. That's the bottom line.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"99885"	"you"	"think"	" Of course, some of the great surprises of life live in the pockets of  the self you thought you knew so well, and Munro's unearthing of those  secrets is a vein throughout her stories. In the quietly frightening  ``Post and Beam,'' where a young wife's ideas about love are far grander  than fact, she calmly realizes that her domineering husband provokes ``a  little hum of hate running along beside her love, nearly all the time.''  With the same chilling stillness evoked by Henry James's ``Beast in the  Jungle,'' the plot of this story veers precisely where you hope it  won't. The characters in ``Hateship, Friendship, Courtship'' take  chances and make changes and all kinds of choices, and yet, thinks the  fine, daring, ordinary woman of ``What Is Remembered,'' ``Maybe you  didn't find out so much, anyway.'' There's the truth of it, for better  or worse, and one takes an odd sort of solace from such realism. An  unconscious nod is the accompanying gesture through Munro's stories:  Yes, you think, faced with cruel compromise or a blush of hope, that's  right, that's the way it was; how could she know that? It is the sweet,  silent dialogue evoked only by a particular strain of empathic genius,  and in Munro's luxuriously long stories, it can wield the cumulative  power of a symphony. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"99977"	"I"	"think"	" Swift said Friday: ``I was not as clear as I should have been, but I  think I have cleared up any inconsistencies...Whoever is at fault for  negotiating an agreement that is not acceptable, I think, is less  important than us getting to an agreement that is accceptable.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"

Caroline Gaudette,  19, of UMass, remains incredulous that ``they spent so much time on  stupid things like Monica Lewinsky.

"100623"	"I"	"think"	" Jason Kidd continues to drive the Nets to improbable places (such as 4-1) and also tossed some bonbons at his former team last week. He was asked if he thought things would be easier for Suns boss Jerry Colangelo now that the Diamondbacks have won the World Series (Colangelo also owns the baseball team). ``I think it would make it easier in the fact that Jerry has won a championship in a major sport,'' Kidd said. ``It would be years before they win a championship in the NBA or decades.'' There you have it. Years or decades. He's probably right. The Suns again are perimeter-oriented _ they've started Jake Voskuhl at center, for goodness sakes _ and then there's the simple fact that Shaq and Kobe Bryant are still alive and kicking. ``You've got to look at those two guys in LA,'' Kidd said. ``It goes for the (whole) Western Conference, because the road goes through LA. It's not just the Suns _ it's everybody. You have to beat them. It's no way around it unless those two go on vacation during the playoffs.'' Sad, but true. The two went on vacation last year during the regular season and even then it didn't matter. Kidd also had this interesting tidbit about his new team. ``In a sense, I think, this team down the road would be the best team I probably have ever played on,'' he said. ``Athleticwise and talentwise I think this is the team that by far will be the best team I've ever played on. If we can keep everybody healthy, it would be the most fun team.'' . . . All hope is not lost for Paul Pierce getting selected to the United States team at next summer's world championships in Indianapolis. Seven players, including Kidd, already have been named. Five players will be added in March. On first glance, at least three of those five need to be big guys. As of now, the only size guys are Jermaine O'Neal and Antonio Davis. Selectors point to the size problem, although, truth be told, they could name 12 guys 6 feet 8 inches and under and still win the gold. Here's Pierce's problem: Two small forwards already have been chosen: Michael Finley and Shawn Marion. Among the missing so far are Kobe, Vince Carter, Tracy McGrady, Antawn Jamison, Chris Webber, Tim Duncan, and, well, you get the picture. Most of those just named won't play. There might be a surprise addition based on this year. But Pierce got some sentiment for the first seven and will likely get some more when the talk boils down to picking the rest of the team . . . The Toronto Raptors broke their own NBA record last Tuesday by blocking 24 shots in a win over Golden State. Well, most of them were blocks, anyway. Warriors beat writers were skeptical about some of the calls, and coach Dave Cowens added afterward, ``Maybe some of those layups we missed were just so bad that they made them blocked shots.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"

"100723"	"I"	"think"	" Rebuilding New York the way it was on Sept. 10 and continuing as before would not be an appealing option, even if such a thing were possible. This is a different city now. But we can, as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has suggested, make New York into an even better city than it was. To do that, I think, we have to think about the work of ``reconstruction'' in slightly less literal terms. We must do something that New Yorkers were once famous for the world over but have in recent decades grown unused to: We have to think big about problems, solutions and possibilities. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"

That is just one of the consequences expected as the federal government, airports and airlines grapple with the massive task of enacting the Aviation Security Act that Congress passed this month. By MIKE LEE. Story will move in ``a'' general news category.  FARM-BILL  AUSTIN, Texas _ An official with the Texas Farm Bureau said that passage of the 10-year agriculture bill that is the subject of a snit between Senate Democrats and the Bush administration could mean ``life or death for Texas farmers.'' The state's agriculture industry is likely to received about 20 percent of the subsidies that Congress makes to farmers nationwide. By JOHN MORITZ. Story will move in ``a'' general news category.

ZEN-CLEANING  UNDATED _ Apparently, cleaning out the closets is not enough, and being able to park both cars in the garage is not sufficient either.

"102346"	"I"	"think"	" Rebuilding New York the way it was on Sept. 10 and continuing as before would not be an appealing option, even if such a thing were possible. This is a different city now. But we can, as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has suggested, make New York into an even better city than it was. To do that, I think, we have to think about the work of ``reconstruction'' in slightly less literal terms. We must do something that New Yorkers were once famous for the world over but have in recent decades grown unused to: We have to think big about problems, solutions and possibilities. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"

"102541"	"I"	"think"	" The creations of Walt Disney, the early ones especially, work at a level just short of the mythic. That, I think, is one of the reasons they were so successful. No allegory at all, and a kind of topical allusion that was unjaundiced and non-satiric. In fact, the most powerful myth at Disney was the one that attached to Walt himself, and it was powerful because it was true. It was the story of hard work, a certain genius, and a completely indomitable spirit, a story with rural roots but with an urban fulfillment, and with an ending not yet in sight. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20011206.0046 type=story > <HEADLINE> DISPUTE ERUPTS OVER SEAT ON CIVIL RIGHTS PANEL </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WASHINGTON (BC-CIVIL-RIGHTS-COMMISSION-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"102584"	"I"	"think"	" Sessions indicated that he agreed, and joined in the attack on the attorney general's critics. ``To use irresponsible and reckless language, I think, accusing the Department of Justice prematurely, perhaps without full study, of violating the law and the Constitution, as some have, I think does have the tendency to erode unity in the country and undermine respect for our leadership in a time of war.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"

"103165"	"I"	"think"	" WIEN: From 1995 to 1999, the market went up 20 percent every year. It averaged, I think, pretty close to 25 percent during the five-year period. It had never done that before. It left the market at a level of overvaluation that may not have been corrected yet. So there's nothing to say that we might not have a three-year period where the market is down every year. The price-earnings ratio of the market using Abby's and my numbers is about 23. While you can say that there are flaws in the price-earnings ratio concept, and I would agree with that, it isn't totally irrelevant. And the long-term average is 14 to 21. So it's above the long-term range. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"103166"	"I"	"think"	" So the totally risk-adverse investor, I think, looking forward is going to have to change his or her investment structure. That's why I don't think there's going to be a large exodus of household capital from equities or bonds. I do think there will be more and more pressure to balance portfolios, but I don't see a massive exodus here, because the money rate simply won't be much of an enticement. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"103167"	"I"	"think"	" The second is international reinsurance. This is a story that, I think, has some very powerful fundamentals behind it. Insurance rates and insurance capacity was already contracting before Sept. 11. I think Sept. 11 kind of exacerbated that. So we like the Ace Ltd. and the Principal Financial Group among others in the property casualty sector. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"103168"	"I"	"think"	" Some of the stocks that have rallied way too far and are going to have difficulty, really, creating much in the way of earnings in the years ahead are some of the telecom chip providers. I'm also skeptical about some consumer durables. We do like the housing stocks, but that's because there's a consolidation to larger players there. But some other consumer durables in the mobile home area and even the auto stocks, I think, are going to have trouble ahead. So I look for problems there as well. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"

The first thing you should know _ and this is something that many people may be surprised about _ but there's quite a large reservoir of good will towards Americans among Philippine Muslims, including Philippine Muslim separatists. In general, Filipinos have generally positive attitudes toward the United States and fairly positive memories of the colonial period, the first 50 years of the 20th century. That goes just as strongly for Philippine Muslims. In fact, some older Philippine Muslims have even more positive feelings because they feel they were better treated under the Americans than they were under Philippine government. They consider themselves to still be colonized essentially by the Philippine government. They want to separate. But they say American colonialism was better for them, less exploitative than Philippine colonialism. That's an important point that should be brought out ...

That's where the Bush Administration offers up its 10-year forecast for the nation's economic growth rate, inflation, unemployment and interest rates. Similar projections about future spending levels, taxes and deficits are found throughout the budget that Bush sent to Congress on Monday.  Both Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and OMB Director Mitchell Daniels use the word ``fantasy'' in referring to the so-called ``out-year'' calculations.  So why does the government insist on producing these notoriously unreliable projections and use them to shape major policy decisions?  Because predicting the future is difficult, and educated guesses _ even if wide of the mark _ are better than nothing, experts say.  ``Economists are not terribly good at forecasting and probably never will be,'' said Alice M. Rivlin, a former director of the White house Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office. ``The situation is too complicated and too affected by all kinds of events. It doesn't mean we shouldn't try.''  Robert Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the Bush White House Council of Economic Advisers, acknowledged that economists are ``always stronger'' looking in the rearview mirror than looking forward, but said forecasting still helps guide policymakers.  ``One reason is that it gives us a chance to illustrate what different long-term scenarios mean both for our economy and for the budget,'' he said.  Hubbard also acknowledged a certain defensive political necessity facing the White House. Critics often use the 10-year forecast to attack White House budgets.  ``Given the attention paid in some quarters to 10-year numbers, we as an administration felt it important for us to produce our 10-year numbers as well,'' Hubbard said.  Although he said the council does its best to generate accurate projections, they remain imperfect.  ``We want to be very careful from a budget perspective of putting too much credence to 10-year numbers, because we know that just over the past year revisions in economics have changed the budget forecast a great deal,'' Hubbard said.  But the administration and Congress both continue to base long-term planning on these shaky numbers, and many experts with experience inside the government defend the practice of using them.  ``They are monstrously misleading,'' said former Rep. William Frenzel, R-Minn. But he quickly added, ``We need them, of course.''  Why? Because new programs are often ``seeded with future time bombs'' so that they expand in later years,'' and projections reveal those costs.  ``The question is whether you want no map or a rough map,'' said William G. Gale, who served as senior staff economist for the Council of Economic Advisers ``No map is better if you are interested in hiding the (long-term) costs of your programs.''  Still, the Bush White House said it intends to shift to shorter, five-year projections in future budgets.  ``We have no idea, of course, what's going to happen over 10 years,'' Budget director Mitchell Daniels said.  He pointed to last year's forecast of a $5.6 trillion, 10-year surplus that shrank to about $1 trillion this year. And even this year's projection may be an illusion, he said.  ``The fact is, we don't know. Next year the $5.6 trillion could be back if the economy is back roaring strong again,'' Daniels said. ``Let's get real. It's hard enough, as we learned last year, to be precise about how much money the federal government will take in one or two years out, let alone 10. And too much attention to these fantasy numbers, I think, sometimes leads us down some misleading, some unproductive, cul-de-sacs.''

"105586"	"I"	"think"	" ``The fact is, we don't know. Next year the $5.6 trillion could be back if the economy is back roaring strong again,'' Daniels said. ``Let's get real. It's hard enough, as we learned last year, to be precise about how much money the federal government will take in one or two years out, let alone 10. And too much attention to these fantasy numbers, I think, sometimes leads us down some misleading, some unproductive, cul-de-sacs.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"

"105669"	"I"	"think"	" He added, ``All of us, I think, owe the American people an explanation as to why our intelligence community failed to provide adequate warning of such a terrorist attack on our soil.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"

"105834"	"you"	"think"	" When you think of designers who have had a seismic influence on fashion, at least in our time, you think, of course, of Yves Saint Laurent, and perhaps Halston or Vivienne Westwood. You think primarily of designers with big, brash, occasionally volatile personalities. And none of those words would fit Ghesquiere. He is pleasant, funny, shy but not aloof, with a rush of giggles occasionally breaking through his calm surface. When asked how he maintains his equilibrium in the face of the swoony attention he receives, he said that he relies on some advice his father, a golf links keeper in central France, gave when he was growing up, ``If you want to be happy, then keep yourself a little hidden.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"105885"	"I"	"think"	" Margaret Russell, editor in chief of ``Elle Decor,'' says that softness is the key to a romantic bed. ``It's the idea that you're going to climb into this bed and it's going to be a haven. When we do photo shoots, I think, `God, I just want to get in that bed.' You want to create this feeling.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"

"106206"	"I"	"think"	" ``They were intimidated, I think, by the popularity that the president has almost exclusively because of his handling of this issue,'' Taylor said. ``I think some are finally starting to show some willingness to take on the hard issues, which include the resegregation of American schools and housing, and the perpetuation of enormous concentrations of poverty.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"106231"	"I"	"think"	" ``I feel like Joe DiMaggio today,'' said Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax. ``What a streak. And the end result, I think, is that it's a wide-open race this year. `A Beautiful Mind' had probably been the front-runner going into today, and now `Lord of the Rings' jumps into the lead. It shows that the academy is interested in being diverse, in sharing the wealth. So I think the `Lord of the Rings' showing is good, and it's good for everybody.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"106272"	"you"	"think"	" Once you realize that two chords are going to alternate unchanged awhile, it becomes hard to keep focusing. Then the pattern changes, and your attention revives. You gradually realize that the music has changed, or you suddenly recognize something you heard earlier, you think, but the pieces of that puzzle never make a picture. It's a pleasantly loose mode of listening, better attuned than the linear narrative of the 19th-century symphony to the late 20th century, an era of aural overstimulation and conflicting sound bites. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"106298"	"I"	"think"	" ``It's not right, I think, but you have to look for mistakes sometimes instead of the skill level involved,'' Tanaka said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"106386"	"I"	"think"	" ``They probably have to start over. The company, I think, should seriously consider retooling its business model down to the very roots of the way they are set up today,'' he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"106390"	"I"	"think"	" ``Miscommunication, I think,'' Jackson said Wednesday. ``Although I mentioned both their names in passing, it was one of those funny things. I said, `OK, we'll let it go.' ... I could have gone to the scorer's desk and said that's incorrect. But I wanted to let (Fisher) know it doesn't matter. Starting's not a big deal to me, it's who finishes ballgames that's a big deal to me.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"106445"	"I"	"think"	" Part of the picture's appeal, I think, comes from director Nick Cassavetes' determination not to take things too seriously _ to make this civics lesson as palatable and entertaining as possible. John's motivations are clear and noble. Orlando Jones, as one of John's hostages, tosses off ghetto wisecracks to lighten the gloomy kid-in-peril atmosphere. And the villains are all easily identifiable and instantly hateable (in addition to Liotta and Woods, Anne Heche shows up as the baddie hospital administrator). </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"

"106447"	"we"	"think"	" Discreetly turning his back on the writhing couple, Wretman explained, not missing a beat, that to qualify for the appellation ``mineral,'' a water had to have at least 250 milligrams of minerals per liter (``Pellegrino has a great deal of calcium and that, we think, is important''); that, by federal regulation, water is ``segmented'' into strictly regulated categories like drinking, natural and spring; and that a fizzy water labeled bottled at the source, like Perrier, got its bubbles from sloshing around the holes in porous rocks. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"106454"	"I"	"think"	" The rest of the movie isn't anywhere in the league of this stunning performance _ in part, I think, because it doesn't have the nerve to be as unsentimental and harrowing as Dench is. Based on two memoirs by Murdoch's husband, the literary critic John Bayley, ``Iris'' adopts a back-and-forth structure. We see an elderly Iris and John (Jim Broadbent) as they both struggle to deal with her mental disintegration; then we flash back and see young Iris (Kate Winslet) slowly falling in love with John (Hugh Bonneville). </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"106577"	"I"	"think"	" WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Full disclosure directs me to begin with an admission: I am the daughter of a scientist. My father didn't choose his path any more, I think, than he chose his prominent chin; science is not his job, it's his essence. And as such, he's spent all my life trying to tease out of me a love for chemistry, an interest in physics or a passion for biology. He hasn't done a bad job. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"106590"	"I"	"think"	" ``I guess I'm thinking back that if one had been aware, if I had been aware of how widespread this issue was, I might have had a very different reaction to it, I think,'' Botsford said. ``But this is Monday morning quarterbacking. . . . I just think that we have all learned a lot out of this process, frankly.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"106607"	"I"	"think"	" ``It's a combination, I think, of a lot of things,'' he said at last week's Buick Invitational in San Diego. ``Life is one. Everything's great in my life. I've been working real hard on my game. ... I'm not having to worry about too many other things but just basically playing golf. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"106681"	"I"	"think"	" ``Being appalled, I think, is a very reasonable perspective,'' Perry said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"106742"	"I"	"think"	" ``I haven't seen a good replay of (the wreck),'' said Richard Childress, Harvick's car owner. ``But these rules, I think, are the wrong direction to go. Everybody sits there in line and starts getting impatient.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"106793"	"I"	"think"	" A: One of the striking things is how muted the support for bin Laden has become. Not only because, I think, he was a loser, but also because unprovoked assaults on thousands of civilians can't be justified by any religion. I think bin Laden has shot himself in the foot essentially. I think he wanted to provoke the clash of civilizations; it didn't happen. Instead, the people actually hunting down bin Laden have been overwhelmingly Muslim. The demonstrations in the Muslim world were really pretty penny ante. I think he was a lot more popular on Sept. 10 than he was on Sept. 12. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"

"106822"	"I"	"think"	" ``What sets (our show) apart, I think, is that our audience is intelligent and informed,'' Brown adds. ``Without maligning other shows on UPN _ all aimed at different demographics _ we do stand apart. We're getting that ``Waiting To Exhale'' crowd.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"107030"	"I"	"think"	" ``I've been a pretty good pinch hitter in my career, a pretty good clutch hitter, I think,'' Zaun said. ``I think that will be important. They'll probably use me late in the game off the bench to hopefully drive in some big runs or what not. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"107130"	"we"	"think"	" ``The 10k's are going to make interesting reading,'' said Herbert Denton, president of Providence Capital, an investment firm. He said his firm just bet on a decline in IBM stock. IBM acknowledged last week that it had used a sale of a business at the end of last year to offset general expenses and said it would provide more detailed accounting in future filings. Providence is betting that IBM is ``the tip of the iceberg, we think, or could be,'' Denton said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"107246"	"I"	"think"	" ``We'd been hoping it wouldn't come to this,'' Drohan said. ``But his very close circle of friends here in Berkshire County, I think, have known for a while what the bad news was going to be.''

"107280"	"I"	"think"	" ``They were really ripe for the picking, I think,'' Therese Brisson said. ``There were a lot of people saying, they were just better than you.

"107321"	"I"	"think"	" ``Not true,'' Gittleman interrupts. ``There was a lot of local folklore that made it into the papers. We researched it and we couldn't find it. We went to the Amityville Historical Society and we did not have any photos of this tree with its immense stature. We checked a book called, I think, `Big Trees of New York,' and we found no records, which you'd think we would find if it had been the fifth-largest elm tree in the United States. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"107360"	"I"	"think"	" Here we are, I think, my kids and me, in one of the most beautiful places on Earth. Warm, happy and having fun. A friend has e-mailed me that it's 70 degrees in Fort Worth, and I feel sad to be leaving this spot of winter. This is our last full day in Beaver Creek. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"107482"	"I"	"think"	" ``We're still, I think, uncertain of what type of team we've got here,'' Rick Fox said. ``We've been very free with declaring ourselves a championship team, but this year's team is not a championship team. This team has individuals that have played on the back-to-back championship teams, but there's also a lot of things this team has to build towards. So we've got to quit walking around like this team has won a championship and make sure we prepare ourselves to play like champions.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"107649"	"I"	"think"	" ``They had just basically gotten down to the S's, I think,'' he said. ``They were in sort of a bind. I don't think I even locked in until the last week.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"107765"	"I"	"think"	" ``Comedy is probably the hardest thing to do, because I don't have any sort of natural instinct toward it,'' the actor insists. ``Basically, I just had to ask (``40 Days'' director) Michael Lehmann every day what to do. It was a constant struggle, to tell you the truth, because my instincts were leading me in a completely different direction than the film was taking. When I read the script, I saw this very, very dark, kind of demented story. And it is. But Michael and (distributor) Miramax and, I think, everybody else wanted something lighter that would appeal to more people. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"108078"	"I"	"think"	" Undoubtedly speculators will buy the car looking to make a profit _ it is essentially a full-size collectible die-cast. But fewer, I think, than one might expect. ``I don't buy Earnhardt stuff as an investment,'' said Mike Rulli of Forest Lake, Minn., who like many fans has an Earnhardt shrine at home. ``I buy it because I get off on it,'' he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"108087"	"I"	"think"	" Martha Coakley, the Middlesex County district attorney, said, ``One of the reasons that we did what we did today, I think, was to bring some order to this discussion so that in 10 years anyone convicted in this time period, people won't look back and say, `Well, that was just the church witch hunt.''' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"

"108164"	"I"	"think"	" On Thursday, Daschle said: ``I don't think the success has been overstated, but the continued success, I think, is still somewhat in doubt.'' He said he felt the country had to find Osama bin Laden and other terrorist leaders, ``or we will have failed. I think that it's critical that we keep the pressure on to do what this country is committed to doing.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"108224"	"I"	"think"	" ``He needs us to work with him and help him,'' Lott said, ``and any sign that we are losing that unity or crack in that support will be, I think, used against us overseas.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"108266"	"I"	"think"	" The psychic toll of Sept. 11 will be much greater than that.

"109520"	"I"	"think"	" The new vaudeville may be a throwback to earlier times, but at the same time it's an extension of performance art _ that vast canvas of experimental fare that's dominated fringe theater for the past quarter-century. Before starting BRA a year and a half ago, Beard and her colleagues were creating hypermodern pieces for the downtown collective Mobius. ``It was all very artsy and outside and experimental,'' says Beard. ``One day we realized that there's no law that an art showcase has to be serious and intense.

"109721"	"I"	"think"	" ``It was a fantastic win,'' said Hughes. ``They sacrificed their bodies for each other, they won the one-on-one battles for each other, they worked hard for each other, and we really looked like a team tonight.

"109997"	"I"	"think"	" Though now an American classic, ``Porgy and Bess'' is not often produced, due largely, I think, to the Gershwin estate's stipulation that the opera be performed by an all-black cast. This was the will of its creators, who wanted their depiction of an African-American community in crisis to have authenticity. It cannot be easy for most opera companies to assemble a strong black cast, though City Opera, to its credit, has assembled three rosters of singers who rotate in the solo roles. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"109998"	"I"	"think"	" ``He's a noble figure,'' Howard said. ``For anyone to report behavior that was reported to have occurred at the absolute height of his delusions . . . is, I think, not doing the world, or John Nash, or themselves, any kind of service.

"110146"	"I"	"think"	" Sen. Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader and a prime mover behind the legislation, conceded that without soft money donations, more candidates will have to ``make more phone calls'' soliciting individual donations. ``Nonetheless,'' Daschle said, ``it will bring down, I think, the cost of campaigns because soft money availability has driven up the cost of these campaigns, especially since you can use them for television advertising.

"110215"	"I"	"think"	" So what should be done about the militant Islamists who spew this kind of hate speech? That is, I think, one of the crucial questions for the Arab world _ and for countries like ours that both despise the militants and cherish liberty. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"110274"	"I"	"think"	" Another is the predominance of Buddhist art this spring. Such things aren't planned; they just happen, and they probably don't ``mean'' anything. But somehow it's reassuring to find the same poised, self-contained figure and unflappable face _ along with the fibrous moral thinking it embodies _ wherever you turn these days. At some level, I think, the sustained enthusiasm for Asian art in the West has a lot to do with that. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"

"110664"	"I"	"think"	" ``To me, dance is so ethereal and elusive, so much of an illusion,'' Wyeth said. ``After a performance, that's it. With vocals and music, you have good recordings. Dance looks absurd on film, I think, like little puppets moving around. As Nureyev said: `After a performance, I am one down. I only have so many performances.''' In most of Wyeth's sketches, Nureyev is still. ``I wasn't trying to catch him in midair, trying to do the great leaps,'' Wyeth said. He left that to photographers. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"110795"	"I"	"think"	" Some things are so egregious, so evil, that the humanity in those of us who are reasonably normal cannot help but cry out in both alarm and outrage.

"110904"	"I"	"think"	" Vincent Canby, the longtime chief film critic of The New York Times, once wrote: ``Wilder is often called cynical, mostly, I think, because his movies seldom offer us helpful hints to better lives.

Well, the first question about the superstar guy, I think, if you look at the last number of Stanley Cups that have been won, the team that's won has basically been the best team throughout the playoffs, but they have also had a lot of talented players on their teams. Colorado has, especially if Peter Forsberg comes back, they have got two or three superstar guys, maybe even a half-dozen. Same with Detroit and New Jersey when they won the Cup. I think the team that wins in the end _ you know, you can have a very good team, hard-working, but you do need the top type of players to get over the hump in the end. That's not to say that this year a team that does not have a superstar won't win the Stanley Cup; I think it is possible. But it just seems to me that in order to get to that level, you do have to have those type of players. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"

A priest's commentary on theological issues was gospel truth to a much less educated laity. And if a priest's moral conduct was questionable, the faithful defined faithfulness as remaining silent. But now, as the largest denomination in Christendom is being rocked by sexual scandals involving priests and children, the culture clash between the church hierarchy and the often well-educated and more affluent American Catholic laity has been laid bare. The laity is pushing for the hierarchy, which is not used to giving answers, to do just that. Story has moved. By BRETT HOFFMAN  YOUTH-OBESITY  UNDATED: One in five children nationwide is overweight. Yet in many areas, programs to help them slim down are in short supply. From the classroom to the doctor's office, overweight children often are ignored. If society does not start taking childhood obesity seriously, the long-term effects will be devastating, said Dr. Roger Unger, an internist and professor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. ``There's a reason why you don't see any fat older people,'' Unger said. ``It's because they're all dead.''

They carried bits and pieces of it with them, crosses and icons _ more than 80 years of memories and a thousand years of tradition. The pilgrims turned south when they left St. Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church on Sunday, walking in a ragged line down Fort Worth's Northwest 21st Street past the the modest houses, the middle school, the pickups parked at the curb.It is only a mile from the tiny brick sanctuary built in 1917 on Ross Avenue to the church's new home with the golden Byzantine dome overlooking Fort Worth's once-infamous Jacksboro Highway. But every step took the oldest Greek Orthodox parish in Texas into the future. By MARY ROGERS  CHAPMAN'S-TEXAS  PASADENA, Texas _ On a warm, overcast Saturday in the Houston area, thousands of people filled their ice chests, zipped up their fanny packs and headed to the San Jacinto Monument in nearby LaPorte to celebrate the 166th anniversary of one of the most important battles in our nation's history. But in Pasadena, a few miles west of the battleground, but still along the banks of Buffalo Bayou, there is hardly a stir of emotion. Back off the Pasadena Freeway, a couple of blocks behind the circular-shaped Ramada Inn, and among the army of railroad tank cars that feed off the petrochemical complex, there is a solitary granite marker that says this was an important site in the San Jacinto victory. Its faded message begins, ``Site of Vince's Bridge destroyed by military permission April 21, 1836.'' It goes on to list the men whom Gen. Sam Houston dispatched to destroy the bridge. Primary among them was Erastus ``Deaf'' Smith.

By MELODY McDONALD  WILDFLOWER-CENTER  AUSTIN, TEXAS _ Two decades ago, Lady Bird Johnson provided the inspiration and seed money for a wildflower center that could help promote the kind of beauty Texans enjoy each spring: a landscape blanketed with vibrant color and hardy native vegetation. ``Ugliness is so grim,'' the former first lady said at the time. ``A little beauty, something that is lovely, I think, can help create harmony which will lessen tensions.'' The National Wildflower Research Center had a provincial beginning in 1982. It was established on a small parcel of Johnson-owned property in east Austin. Actress Helen Hayes, who died in 1993, helped found it, and it concentrated on the state's beloved bluebonnets and Indian paint brushes. Now, 20 years later, the center has moved to southwest Austin and a plush 179-acre site with more than 400 native plant species growing on the grounds. It has blossomed into a respected national research facility that has emerged as one of the country's leading advocates for native plant conservation. It has also branched out beyond bluebonnets to embrace landscape restoration, Hill Country culture and ecological education. By ART CHAPMAN  C O M M E N T A R Y  ALDAPE-COLUMN  UNDATED: On a continent where some countries go through multiple presidents in successive days, it's no surprise that a country's commitment to democracy can be rather fluid. Often a resolute voice is needed to remind the region that democracy is key to hemispheric development. Despite the adoption of democracy by almost all governments in the Americas, many countries are subject to interference by the military and weakened by populations that have yet to fully accept the challenges and limitations of a democratic system. The recent political turmoil in Venezuela merely exposed the tenuous hold that democracy has in the region. But what is striking is that unlike past periods of instability, this time Latin America stood with mostly one voice, defending democracy and rejecting the coup in Venezuela. The government that most soiled its reputation by welcoming both the coup and the fall of a freely elected government was the United States. By JAVIER J.

The myth of Eakins as the misunderstood genius is linked to the infamous story of his dismissal as an art school teacher in prudish Philadelphia after he removed the loincloth from a male model in a class that included male and female students. ``My honors are misunderstanding, persecution and neglect, enhanced because unsought'' was his equally famous remark, often repeated as proof of his brave, unshakable character. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"

"120550"	"I"	"think"	" ``People who first listened to it and didn't relate to it began to hear the title, I think, and used the title more often than the entire lyric,'' Gaynor says. ``Then you got away from what the song itself was about and focused on that phrase, `I will survive.'

TERROR-CHINA (Beijing) _ The Bush administration's decision to brand as terrorist the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, an obscure Muslim group with roots in western China has been greeted with skepticism by many Western diplomats and scholars, who say the Americans have offered little hard evidence and appear intent on softening Chinese opposition to an attack on Iraq by handing Beijing a propaganda coup. It has also caused dismay and anger among Uighur exiles, including the majority that reject indiscriminate violence in what they call a struggle against ethnic tyranny. By Erik Eckholm.  The story has moved.  CHINA-WORKERS (Beijing) _ Six months after angry workers massed in a northeastern city, accusing urban leaders of fraud and theft, several of the officials they named have been jailed or fired. The charges shouted by protesters in Liaoyang last March have been largely confirmed by anti-graft investigators from Beijing, who found that officials were indeed milking the assets of fading state companies, even as workers and retirees were denied their meager wages and pensions.

DELHI-STREET (Delhi, India) _ When the Moguls laid out a broad avenue linking the imperious glory of the Red Fort to the Fatehpuri Mosque, they saw it as a sweeping public space, a sedate counterpoint to the grandeur of their monuments. Little did they know what was to come. Four centuries later, Chandni Chowk remains one of Delhi's best known streets, but not for any reason the Moguls imagined. More than any other place in Delhi, and perhaps India, Chandni Chowk has become home to the chaos of humanity trying to sustain itself any way it can. By Amy Waldman.  The story has moved.

"127953"	"I"	"think"	" Come January, Ferrera, who was a valedictorian of her 2002 graduating class, will enter USC on a presidential scholarship. She plans a double-major in international relations and theater.  ACT 1: ``My first play was 'Romeo and Juliet.' I was in third grade, but I went to a junior high school and auditioned for their play. They gave me the part of the Apothecary, the druggist who gives Romeo the drugs to kill himself.''  AND, ACTION!: ``When 'Bring It On' (the cheerleading movie that starred Kirsten Dunst) came out, I went with my mom to watch it. I had so much fun. I was like, 'Mom, I have to be in a movie just like this.' The first movie I got was 'Got to Kick It,' a dancing movie. It was like a dream come true.''  AN ADMIRABLE LEADING LADY: ``Pop culture teaches us to give up our identity and try to mesh in with everybody else, and here was this girl loving herself despite it all. I thought her confidence was really attractive.''  FINDING HER INNER ANA: ``My mom really never encouraged my acting career, so I knew what it was like to pursue something I was really passionate about it without the support of my family. I drew from those experiences of knowing what it's like to stand on your own. I think it's something everyone can relate to.''  THAT'S LIFE: ``The one thing about this movie is that it is a very real portrayal of an immigrant family's life. Family is the essence of Latin culture, I think, because family is supposed to take care of family. And that's kind of the sense you get in the movie. The mother feels almost betrayed, like the daughter is giving up on her family. They need her help and she's being selfish in a way by giving up on them.''  FAT, WHAT FAT?: ``When I leave this movie, Ana's weight problem is the last thing on my mind because there's so much more to the story. It's ultimately about loving yourself. Obviously in our society where you turn on the TV and all you see is diet pills! And a new diet plan! And exercise stuff! And, oh, how to get down to a size 0 in two days! it's such an apparent thing. To make a movie about reality and not factor that in is almost impossible.''  A CONFIDENCE-BOOSTER: ``Yeah, I want to feel good, I want to look good, I'm a person. Everybody wants to feel good about who they are, and that's what this movie is saying.''

"130794"	"I"	"think"	" UNDATED: In a beautifully illustrated book entitled ``The Texas Longhorns: Living Legend of the American West,'' the author writes: ``The mottled hide and the sharp, twisted, spreading, and often lyreshaped horns of the Texas Longhorn are emblematic of one of nature's unique creations.'' The story talks about the longhorn's development; how it can thrive in hostile country, and how it multiplied through the laws of survival of the fittest. And how it was the only cattle breed to ``evolve without human management.'' Those are romantic notions; traditional thoughts that were once true. But in today's harsh business environment, they no longer apply. Money trumps tradition. Saturday, in what longhorn breeders are calling a historic event, the first clone of a Texas longhorn will be sold at public auction. The image of the breed, I think, could suffer.

I immediately think of an agent whose sole ``advice'' was, ``Geez, you don't think you're going to get the price you saw in the paper, do you?''

"132822"	"I"	"think"	" Despite the angst this year, there is still a magic about bookstores and publishing. It is, I think, the wonder of the unexpected. The other afternoon at the Barnes &amp; Noble at 48th Street and Fifth Avenue in midtown Manhattan, there was not the seasonal hyperkinesia that I had seen in a Barnes &amp; Noble at Christmastime several years ago. But there were a good number of people buying ``Prey''; and Bob Woodward's ``Bush at War'' (Simon &amp; Schuster), the sales of which perhaps exceeded expectations; and Pat Conroy's ``My Losing Season'' (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday), also doing better than anticipated; as well as Donna Tartt's ``Little Friend'' (Knopf), which did not do as well as expected, but was still a best seller. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"132859"	"I"	"think"	" I remember the writer Bruce Chatwin telling me that his own trip to see Barragan's house was a disappointment; he liked the photographs, but was disappointed by the reality. I had wondered whether a similar experience was waiting for me. In the event, I found the place even more powerful than the pictures, and the intensity of the visit has stayed with me. This is partly due to the talent and sensitivity of Catalina Corcuera, the director of the museum. It is also, I think, because, as one of his contemporaries, Ignacio Diaz Morales, put it, Barragan ``made us feel at home.'' I found myself half expecting to see Barragan appear from the next room and sit down on one of his club chairs. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"

Let me take the head table, which is where the main interest will be. There, I think, we will have 11 persons at the head table this year. And that will be President and Mrs. Carter. It will be three members of the Nobel Committee. It will be the prime minister. It will be the speaker of parliament. It will be the chief justice of Norway.

"133188"	"I"	"think"	" The New York Philharmonic is like an island that sits off the coast of the city's musical life. One looks back to Boulez's regime in the 1970s to find any real relevance, any true plan or purpose for this magnificent orchestra other than self-containment and survival. It is by nature a great shiny machine, although stubborn conductorial minds can force it to rise above itself. And deep within its collective psyche, I think, a shiny machine is what the Philharmonic wants to be. Maazel is like a mirror. This orchestra, its board, its administration and faithful subscribers look into it and see themselves. They find it a pleasing image. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20021208.0136 type=story > <HEADLINE> A Rose-colored Orange </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> MIAMI  (BC-FBC-ORANGE-BOWL-1209-) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"

"134316"	"I"	"think"	" The problem, I think, lies in Nickelodeon's approach to expanding its TV shows for the big screen. State-of-the-art animation has never been the point of ``Rugrats,'' ``Arnold,'' and ``Thornberrys'' _ their scribbly look is part of their rumpus-room appeal.

Being around him, knowing what kind of person he is, knowing how much the game means to him and how he approaches the game, it would have been very difficult to think that he would fail. And to his credit, he made sure that he didn't waste a minute of preparation so that when the time did come, he was ready to go.

"134778"	"I"	"think"	" Some environmentalists have forgotten, I think, that our aim should be not just to preserve nature for its own sake but to give Americans a chance to enjoy the outdoors.

"134924"	"I"	"think"	" Then came the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

"135540"	"I"	"think"	" ``Was it justified? The preliminary investigation, I think, certainly indicates that,'' Bratton said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"135726"	"I"	"think"	" It is an unusually low-key style, but Logan said that was fine with him. ``AOL has had enough, I think, of the high-profile visionary CEO's who were building the company,'' he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136070"	"I"	"think"	" The inspectors ``have said that they need some time to complete the inspections and therefore, I think, it is highly unlikely that on the 27th we can draw already final conclusions about the work that has been done up to that date,'' Pleuger said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136138"	"I"	"think"	" ``When I'm gone I'm gone, I think,'' the actress says. ``I know they've had Kristine (Sutherland) and Juliet (Landau) on again recently, so I don't think it's fair to put absolutes on anything. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136166"	"they"	"think"	" When he noticed my disorientation, he laughed. ``I know. When people see the movie, they think, `My God, Ray's gone all to hell.' They think that's what age has done to me. That's why I'm getting out there and letting people see it was an illusion.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136225"	"you"	"think"	" ``When you get there, you think, ``We've landed. We're there.''' he said about 6:45 p.m. as he was mercifully about to leave the airport. ``When they turn the engines off, you know you're in trouble.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136231"	"I"	"think"	" _ Why were Trey Junkin's fingers bandaged? When the Fox camera closed in under the posterior of Junkin, the long snapper, it was evident that he wore bandages (Band-Aids with Flintstones characters, I think, but further microanalysis awaits) on both thumbs and two other fingers. Were key parts of his precious hands injured, impairing his ability to snap? Or did he just have boo-boos? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136262"	"I"	"think"	" ``Look, everything I've been doing is a special challenge,'' admits the former ``ER'' star, who in recent years has swung from headlining megahit movies such as ``Ocean's Eleven'' to high-profile flops like last fall's ``Solaris'' -- both directed by Steven Soderbergh, Clooney's partner in the production company Section Eight, which can boast both last year's most acclaimed art-house release, ``Far From Heaven'' and the all-but-unseen ``Welcome to Collinwood.'' ``I'm always in over my head a little bit. I kind of enjoy it there, but every time I do something, I think, 'Uh-oh, I'm in trouble now, I don't know what I'm doing.' '' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"

"136304"	"I"	"think"	" ``He's maintained fairly high ratings at a time when the national tendency would be for the ratings to be falling,'' said Frank Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup Poll. ``That, I think, shows the powers of the existing threat of terrorism and the way he's handled it.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136384"	"I"	"think"	" ``I've never really read the comics,'' Johnson said. ``My wife and mom told me about it. It's kind of an honor, I think, as far as going national with it. It's something that's kinda neat.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136388"	"I"	"think"	" ``We like the direct involvement with nonprofits that we get when we give directly,'' Livingstone said. ``It's one of the rewards of giving, I think, and it's not all that complicated.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136401"	"I"	"think"	" ``We like the direct involvement with nonprofits that we get when we give directly,'' Livingstone said. ``It's one of the rewards of giving, I think, and it's not all that complicated.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136427"	"I"	"think"	" Fox's reader of minds, Mr. Gibson, knew better, of course: ``What you are also saying, I think, is, there cannot be an anti-war demonstration if there is no draft.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136441"	"I"	"think"	" As for Adams, not much is known for sure. He is about 50 years old, heavyset and secretive, people who have met him say. They say he lives in Utah, is a Mormon and frequently does missionary work in Vietnam and elsewhere. He holds doctorates in applied computer science and engineering and is an independent consultant. ``Last I heard, he was in Australia last year, doing some work for the government there, I think,'' said Layfield, the class-action lawyer. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136496"	"I"	"think"	" ``Every country give me medal for peace,'' he says. ``Everybody help me. Everybody nice.'' Baluchi says he was hospitalized for malaria, got hit by a car and had several nasty spills. He ran out of money sometimes, but found work or was taken in by new friends. The album contains a snapshot of a pretty Mexican girl. ``She is my girlfriend, I think,'' he says, shyly. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136526"	"I"	"think"	" I'll admit that plugging into the Internet from a remote village can occasionally be a godsend. On a couple of occasions I've been able to take care of business that otherwise would have kept me home, and I've received news I absolutely needed to know. The trick, I think, is to connect only when it's truly necessary, rather than to make it a regular part of your travel routine. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136581"	"I"	"think"	" ``He is very sensitive to issues involving race and giving opportunities to people from a variety of backgrounds while also giving opportunities in a manner for one and for all in our country,'' he said. ``And so, the president, having been governor of a state that was so ethnically diverse as Texas, I think, is well-versed in many of the sensitivities, the ups and the downs, the ins and the outs, to these issues that are all inherently very complicated.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136594"	"I"	"think"	" Blair said that evidence of how groups and ``rogue states'' were sponsoring trade in chemical and biological weapons and seeking to develop nuclear capability crossed his desk every day. ``Anyone who believes in today's world that you can have these groups and these weapons proliferating and Britain not be involved is, I think, naive and misguided,'' he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136605"	"I"	"think"	" ``We had a bit of a surprise, I think, as a state and as a community over the past several weeks,'' Romney said. ``Clearly if that (budget gap) became very, very large I would anticipate that cuts that would be necessary could cut into essential services, either to cities and towns or into health and human services areas. That is not something I would have anticipated, or I would want to see.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136715"	"I"	"think"	" ``The president has been, I think, very emphatic about his approach. He seeks to make progress on advancing a culture that recognizes and focuses on the importance of life,'' said Ari Fleischer. ``That's been his view, and he will continue to do so and work productively with the Congress to make progress toward achieving that goal.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136866"	"I"	"think"	" Johannesburg's approach of identifying all its nuclear arms programs to inspectors ``demonstrated the will and eagerness of South Africa to be believed by the world, thereby setting an example, I think, for Iraq,'' Blix said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136915"	"I"	"think"	" Since most of us are not as acutely or as persistently aware of those hour-of-the-wolf feelings as Polanski's characters typically are, he has often had to place his tormented protagonists in pretty outre contexts to make their extreme emotional states dramatically plausible. That's why, I think, he has so frequently invoked the supernatural _ in ``Rosemary's Baby,'' of course, and in ``The Fearless Vampire Killers'' (1967) and ``The Ninth Gate'' as well. (And, come to think of it, in ``Macbeth,'' whose witches are close kin to Rosemary's neighbors.) And why, too, so many of his films have been chronicles of madness: ``Repulsion,'' in which Catherine Deneuve, a virginal French girl left home alone in London by her older sister, goes homicidally insane; ``The Tenant,'' clearly; and the tense, disturbing ``Death and the Maiden,'' in which Sigourney Weaver plays a woman who, having survived political torture, remains permanently, incurably, ill at ease in the world, and who finds herself, in the end, on the brink of committing murder. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136996"	"I"	"think"	" ``Maybe you are not comfortable with who you are or what you have done,'' Duval said, but added, ``I am 31 years old. I have played, I think, about 10t the problem is. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200302.gz"
"137000"	"I"	"think"	" ``You learn some things about a player sometimes that you don't necessarily see on film when he comes back off of injuries,'' Holmgren said. ``I always use the example of Brett Favre. It tells you a lot about the athlete, I think, if they can do that.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200302.gz"
"137066"	"I"	"think"	" ``On this team, if we have somebody who is not a winner, he's got to go. He's got to go,'' Perez said. ``This group of guys we have here, we're winners. We want to win. We have winners. We want to win, and everyone here who wears this uniform has to be a winner. His mentality has to be a winner. Everyone here, I think, this is my point of view, we have big hearts. We believe we can win. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200303.gz"
"137273"	"I"	"think"	" ``They looked for three years for the right animal so-eunicator,'' she said from a stop on her book tour. ``I have an edge, I think, because I was born with a great psychic ability, as well as being able to talk to animals. The two things together have given me more of an understanding of the animal kingdom.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200303.gz"
"137285"	"I"	"think"	" ``I feel like I'm getting back to the level I was at before the beginning of the year,'' Capriati said. ``I'm just, I think, slowly rising. I feel confident and that I'm moving a lot better than before in the year.''  </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20030322.0047 type=story > <HEADLINE> Michigan State's physical style an issue for Florida </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> TAMPA  (BC-BKC-GATORS-0323-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200303.gz"
"137312"	"I"	"think"	" ``We're just about to Baghdad,'' Myers said. ``Some of the biggest losses we've taken are due to Iraqis committing serious violations of the law of armed conflict in the Geneva Convention by dressing as civilians, by luring us into surrender situations then opening fire on our troops. So this is a plan that is very well thought out, and that will play out, I think, as we expect.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200303.gz"
"137489"	"I"	"think"	" No, it's highly unlikely that anyone could track the forwarding of an e-mail, says the Doc. But more to the point, ``It's just a waste of your time and a way to clog up other people's e-mail, he laments. So, I think, this actually has a sound purpose . . . I love wasting time and clogging up other people's e-mail, don't you? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200304.gz"
"137561"	"I"	"think"	" ``It is easier, I think, for Tom to manipulate these lines, whether it is Texas or Colorado or Georgia, than it is to win elections,'' said Rep. Lloyd Doggett, another Texas target of DeLay. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200305.gz"
"137593"	"I"	"think"	" Suggs also attracted attention in 1945, playing as Ben Hogan's partner as a 22-year-old amateur, competing in the Chicago Victory Pro-Lady tournament at Medinah Country Club. In the first round Suggs remembered shooting a stroke better than Hogan _ ``72, I think, and he had a 73'' _ staying nearly even with him on a few drives and even startling him with a comment. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200305.gz"
"137693"	"I"	"think"	" ``It didn't help,'' said Rebecca Snyder, Zoo Atlanta panda curator. ``What they need, I think, is more hands-on learning.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200305.gz"
"137700"	"I"	"think"	" That said, Oxygen's president of programming, Debby Beece, hopes ``Hey Monie'' will fill the gender and ethnicit gap. ``That whole renaissance of cartoons that cable has brought about in the whole animation industry, I think, has been inclusive of females,'' she said. ``You just have to tell a different story and tell it differently to appeal to the female sensiilHty. I don't know who else but us would do something like this.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200305.gz
, they complain,	 Many people blame the problems on a political system that has allowed corruption to flourish and criminal neglect to go unpunished. Past government inquiries into scandals and disasters have ended without action, they say. But there is little hope of real change, they complain, without political reform that will allow opposition parties to gain a voice. </P> 	nyt_eng_200305.gz
, he added,	 After reading some of his former colleagues' comments, Bragg backed off a bit Thursday. ``Of course I don't think most correspondents use stringers to the degree I did,'' he said. For most of his stories, he added, he did almost all the reporting. </P> 	nyt_eng_200305.gz
, they say,	 Political analysts and critics on the left say Clinton appears to be modeling herself on her husband, Bill Clinton, who was also criticized for abandoning the Democratic Party's liberal base to win larger political appeal. In Clinton's case, they say, she Atpears to be taking for granted her liberal allies, a strong source of support for her, in favor of cultivating a broader audience. </P> 	nyt_eng_200305.gz
, they say,	 Clinton's aides said her decKr constituency outside New York. Rather, they say, it reflects positions she has held since her days in the White House, such as imposing stiffer restrictions on welfare recipients. </P> 	nyt_eng_200305.gz
, he noted,	 Matt Foreman, a political activist in New York and the executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, said that Clinton was slow to respond to Santorum's comments. And, he noted, she refused to join a chorus of Democrats _ including New York's senior senator, Charles E. Schumer _ who called on Santorum to step down from a leadership post he holds in the Senate Republican caucus. </P> 	nyt_eng_200305.gz
, they say,	 Clinton's aides acknowledge that she was not quick to respond to Santorum's remarks. But when she did, they say, she offered a forceful condemnation. Responding to criticism among gay activists that Clinton should have gone a step further and called for his resignation, Dunn, her spokeswoman, said: ``It is the responsibility of the Republican Party to choose how it wishes to be represented.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200305.gz
, he said,	 ``It's a shareholder value issue for us,'' Ferlauto said. His group's members, he said, were concerned that the company's move would be viewed as an unpatriotic act that would dilute the value of its many brands, including Kryptonite locks and Bobcat backhoes. </P> 	nyt_eng_200305.gz
, I say,	 ``So I would have to say it's because Marty's done it for so long. Maybe that's what people expect of him. I know I do. When I see him make a save, I say, `He's supposed to stop that.'`` </P> 	nyt_eng_200305.gz
, she wails,	 After cradling one of the 475 white nylon sacks laid out on the concrete floor, Um Jassim opens the shroud and sifts through the bones. She strokes a bone attached to a blindfolded body and kisses the teeth. My only son, she wails, beating her chest. Bring him back. </P> 	nyt_eng_200305.gz
, he says,	 When they arrived, 17 were immediately shot. Hundreds more were packed into 40 buses waiting at the side of the road. When the buses had filled up, soldiers flagged down empty trucks and piled the remaining men in. He alone, he says, managed to jump off when the truck stopped at a traffic light. </P> 	nyt_eng_200305.gz
, he said,	 Pasciuto objected and said that the government was acting in bad faith by trying to punish him for his involvement in the book, which, he said, did not violate his cooperation agreement with prosecutors. Shortly before a scheduled hearing last week, prosecutors and Pasciuto agreed that he would be relocated to an undisclosed location until sentencing. </P> 	nyt_eng_200305.gz
, I thought,	 Mysteriously, a couple of the Redwood Hill Crottins I have purchased recently, several weeks apart, did not follow this development pattern. They were molten under the rind and chalkier toward the center, like a Camembert. They were divine, I thought, but Bice tells me those cheeses were flawed _ either wrapped too soon at the dairy or kept too long in a cardboard box at the distributor's warehouse, so they couldn't breathe. If the cheese you purchase smells pungent and feels a little squishy, you may have such a specimen, but I don't consider that a bad thing. </P> 	nyt_eng_200305.gz
, he added,	 Moreover, he added, the United States reserves ``the right to exclude people who we don't think belong here.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200305.gz
, it reasons,	 Others favor a different approach. Keidanren, Japan's largest business lobby, wants to more than triple the national sales tax, to 18 percent, over the next dozen years. This way, it reasons, the entire nation can share the burden of paying for the elderly, not just working families. </P> 	nyt_eng_200305.gz
, it seems,	 The governor who is now declaiming the virtue of fiscal responsibility is the same governor who was running around handing out checks last year as the economy crumpled around him. That may be why Bruno, the Senate's Republican leader, did not hesitate to organize a coup. ``The critical thing about the governor is that nobody believes him,'' one Republican budget expert said. ``The man has no philosophical anchor.'' The only thing deeper in the red than the state's future, it seems, is Pataki's credibility. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20030530.0069 type=story > <HEADLINE> NEW YORK TIMES CORRECTIONS FOR SATURDAY, MAY 1 </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 05-30-03 21:30:00EDT (BC-CORRECTIONS-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200305.gz
, I mean,	 ``I've heard it all my life because I'm a big guy and a first baseman,'' Casey said. ``But I've always been a high-average guy, a guy who hits the ball in the gaps, since I was little. I'm going to hit home runs, but when you have guys like Austin Kearns, Adam Dunn, Aaron Boone and Junior Griffey, I mean, how many power guys do you need? You need guys to get on base for them, score runs, set the table, somebody who can lead off the eighth inning of a game with a hit, not just a home run. Things have to start somewhere, too, and not always with a home run.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200305.gz
, he said,	 Notice he didn't say hit home runs, he said, ``Hit.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200305.gz
, he said,	 As yields on Treasury bonds fall, he said, mortgage rates tend to fall as well. Lower rates lead to refinancing, which often involves replacing partially paid 30-year loans with shorter 15-year loans. </P> 	nyt_eng_200305.gz
, it seems,	 In 1937, an Austin, Minn.-based company called Hormel Foods held a contest. Hormel's Spiced Ham, it seems, needed a new name _ something ``as distinctive as the taste,'' the company's official history goes. The winner was one Kenneth Daigneau, a Broadway actor and, ahem, brother to a Hormel executive. He took home $100 and gave the world Spam. </P> 	nyt_eng_200305.gz

, he said,	 Cutthroat pricing is not the only problem. Opening a pack of his Garnaata-brand cream-filled wafers, Thiab noted gloomily that his wafers had congealed into an unappetizing mess _ a result, he said, of the inferior flour available to him. By contrast, imported Tasteful Wafers from Iran were fresh and crisp. </P> 	nyt_eng_200305.gz

, you know,	 ``The key was to get good contact, and that's what I did,'' he said. ``I hit the ball fast and obviously the ball came straight up in the air, and, you know, it could have ended up in the back bunker. It could have been short of the green. Luckily for me, it just ended up pin-high. It was one of those shots that you hit and hope for the best.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200305.gz

, I believe,	 ``He (Stewart) tried to bump me,'' Newman said. ''I had to run clear up the race track. I guess it's just kind of typical. He was pretty upset, and I'd be upset, too. But he had a fast race car and he would have done the same thing to me, I believe, if the roles were reversed. </P> 	nyt_eng_200306.gz
, you know,	 And yet when Williams talks about tennis there's a world-weariness that is palpable. The other day, she said of Zvonareva. ``I just remember when I was in the same position, you know, starting to be on tour, at least I was having a lot of fun,'' Williams said. ``She's probably having a lot of fun. Always looking forward to the big match, playing the No. 1 players in the world.'' Is Williams having fun yet? More and more it's getting harder to tell. </P> 	nyt_eng_200306.gz
, he said,	 Lieberman called for an investigation into whether China's subsidies to the industry violate international trade rules. Another cause of the increased competition, he said, was that U.S. universities are training foreign students, who then take their expertise back home and compete with U.S. industry. </P> 	nyt_eng_200306.gz

, he said,	 ``By the time I reached the car, the pain had grown and was forcing small moans from my throat,'' Fliss said. ``I looked around and considered heading back, but couldn't walk any further.''

By then, he said, he was gripped with fear at the realization he was having a heart attack. </P> 	nyt_eng_200306.gz
, he said,	 When he was released from the hospital, his frantic traveling schedule was over. In the past, he said, he typically spent at least part of 40 to 45 weeks on the road; last year alone, he traveled 150,000 miles by plane. Today, by contrast, he mostly works from home in a wheelchair, though he is starting to get out more. </P> 	nyt_eng_200306.gz
, he says,	 With less mobility, he says, he is forced to find new ways every day to do business. He has quickly mastered the management maxim that you can achieve a lot if you delegate more.

He added, ``I have accomplished things that before the accident I assumed had to be done in person.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200306.gz
, he said,	 The Bush administration and much of the intellectual property bar filed briefs in support of Dastar's Supreme Court appeal. Peter Jaszi, a law professor at American University who helped write one of the briefs, said on Monday that the decision reflected the court's concern ``that intellectual property rights can get out of hand and that you can have too much of a good thing.'' The concern was well placed, he said, adding that ``the court is properly showing deference to Congress' choices in intellectual property.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200306.gz

, he said,	 Overall, the report said, despite some late and limited Iraqi cooperation, ``the long list of proscribed items unaccounted!fkr and as such resulting in unresolved disarmament issues was neither shortened by the inspections, nor by Iraqi declarations and documents.'' In particular, he said, there was no clear evidence how much anthrax and VX nerve gas Iraq had possessed, and how much it had destroyed. </P> 	nyt_eng_200306.gz

, he said,	 Osser also said that the price difference between the antipsychotics was not as great as the price difference between antidepressants, for example. One of the most expensive antipsychotics, Zyprexa, costs twice as much as one of the cheapest, Risperdal, he said, while the most costly antidepressant is ten times more expensive than the cheapest.

What's behind this trend, writes Fernando Henrique Cardoso, former president of Brazil, is that most of the world's pension systems were created during the 1930s and '40s. They were based on the principle of society's responsibility to support those no longer able to work _ due to advanced age or disability _ and are mostly organized on a pay-as-you-go basis. But the recent wave of pension reform, he explains, has a demographic, rather than ideological motivation. As the number of senior citizens expanded, on a par with diminishing birth rates and increased life expectancy, pension systems have begun to show ever-widening deficits.

But after seven months in Iraq spent escorting Iraqi exiles returning to help the war effort, and six days at home spent helping in the recovery from Hurricane Charley, Cockerham, a full-time recruiter for the National Guard, offers a distinct perspective: The suffering in Florida now may be intense, he says, but it is temporary.

Advertisers wanted to reach young, urban, sophisticated viewers, he said. The type of audience that shows like 'Hee Haw' reached was not what the networks and advertisers were looking for.

Neal, 29, joined the family business eight weeks ago after working as a computer systems administrator for C&amp;F Mortgage in Richmond, Va. He could have stayed in computers, he says, but the opportunity to learn Florida's lucrative home-building business drew him back to where he grew up.

The other reason for the discomfort, I think, is that he called himself an artist. Many critics prefer their art with subtitles or not at all. Cassavetes dared to believe that art and movies were not mutually exclusive, and he never gave up on the movies' capacity to move us, to make us feel, to connect us to the world and to other people. It says something about our age that it actually comes as a shock to hear him talk with such frank sincerity about his films as art, which he does in a French television interview included in the Criterion box set.

And then mixing that up with cinema verite, which was taught to me by a great mentor of mine, (documentary filmmaker) D.A. Pennebaker. That marriage of seeking truth, with a foot firmly planted in the street, and having a world view is, I think, the combination.

TOP  Lede stories: 4-column hed  BUSH (Washington) -- President Bush vowed on Thursday to move quickly and aggressively to enact the plans he set out during the campaign, saying the people made it clear what they wanted. In a 40-minute news conference, Bush said he would begin working immediately on his proposal to overhaul Social Security, called for Congress to move speedily to limit lawsuit awards against doctors and signaled that he had settled on the broad outlines of his ideas for rewriting the tax code. Let me put it to you this way: I earned capital in the campaign, political capital, and now I intend to spend it, Bush said. He repeated that he wants to reach out across party lines after a campaign that emphasized partisan and ideological divisions and left raw feelings on both sides. But he left unclear how much, if at all, he would compromise to achieve some degree of partisan comity, especially after an election that gave him a convincing victory, strengthened conservative Republicans in Congress and left Democrats weaker.

Off-lede:  IRAQ-EXPAT-VOTING (Baghdad, Iraq) -- Iraqi electoral officials said Thursday they would allow millions of Iraqis outside the country to vote in the coming election. The decision appeared certain to increase tensions with Iraq's Sunni minority, since many of the expatriate voters are Shiites. We've decided to allow Iraqis abroad to vote, and the mechanism will be worked out in the upcoming days, said Adel al-Lami, a supervisor for the Iraqi Independent Electoral Commission, which is charged with organizing the elections, scheduled for January. The voting will take place in those countries with a large number of Iraqis. The United Nations and the United States had recommended against allowing expatriate voting, fearing a political backlash from Sunnis as well as the potential for fraud, but leading Iraqi politicians, as well as Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, strongly supported the move. By Edward Wong.  SENATE-SPECTER (Washington) -- When Sen. Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican, faced the toughest primary race of his political career, President Bush came to his rescue, campaigning with Specter at every turn. But when both men were re-elected, Specter's first words to the president were a warning against nominating Supreme Court justices who would overturn the 1973 ruling legalizing abortion. On Thursday, as outraged conservatives tried to block Specter's rise to the chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Pennsylvania senator issued a statement clarifying his remarks, saying, I did not warn the president about anything, and I have never and would never apply any litmus test on the abortion issue. The controversy suggests that despite talk of a political mandate, the long-running battle over federal judgeships will be in full bloom when the new Congress convenes next year under strengthened Republican control.

Most men went to bars to socialize, and it seemed they just didn't want to have anything to do with women, because, I think, they were afraid of them.

But maybe the most important story in Iraq was the fact that while Fallujah was exploding, 106 Iraqi parties and individuals registered to run in the January election. And maybe the second most important story is the relatively quiet way in which Iraqis, and the Arab world, accepted the U.S. invasion of Fallujah. The insurgents there had murdered hundreds of Iraqi Muslims in recent months, and, I think, they lost a lot of sympathy from the Arab street.

, he warned,	 . . Today, showpieces like Frank Gehry's Stata Center or Steven Holl's Simmons Hall, both at MIT, grandly lay claim to Boston's architectural vanguard. The Carpenter Center, on the other hand -- wedged between Harvard's Fogg Museum of Art and the Faculty Club, off the east end of the Yard on Quincy Street -- is familiar mostly to architects and architectural scholars. Not that it isn't arresting. It has been described as looking like two grand pianos copulating, with its two broadly curved wings resting on thin columns and meeting in a geometrical central structure of stacked concrete and glass boxes. A ramp rises from Quincy Street and runs through the building's open center before descending to Prescott Street behind it. When Harvard approached Le Corbusier in 1958, it had already embraced architectural modernism. Twenty years earlier the university had brought Walter Gropius, the father of the Bauhaus, over from Germany to head the GSD. His successor, Sert, was a close friend and collaborator with Le Corbusier. Gropius's Graduate Center and Sert's Holyoke Center and Peabody Terrace had already been built. When Harvard needed a building to house its newly created undergraduate visual arts program, it was Sert who suggested commissioning Le Corbusier. Having America's only building by Le Corbusier, he told Harvard's Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences McGeorge Bundy, would be like having the country's only Picasso. In Le Corbusier, Harvard met a man whose self-regard matched its own. Born Charles Edouard Jeanneret in Switzerland in 1887, he rechristened himself at the appropriate age of 33, conflating an ancestral name, Le Corbesier, with his nickname, 'Corbeau' (Crow). In his 1923 manifesto Toward a New Architecture he wrote rapturously of a supreme determinism under which a just and peaceful society would inevitably flourish. He wanted to raze cluttered neighborhoods like Paris's Marais and replace them with a Radiant City of ethereal skyscrapers and wide greenways. Only enlightened architecture, he warned, could prevent social unrest from boiling over into workers' revolution. But when Sert offered him the job, Le Corbusier was still angry at what he called American officialdom for his treatment during the design process for the United Nations headquarters, where he had been turned down for the commission only to see his ideas incorporated into the final complex. Ultimately, though, he couldn't turn down the chance to build in the United States, a country that early in his career had represented for him the possibility of the machine age. And the Carpenter Center's role in both housing and embodying Harvard's arts program coincided with his idea that architecture should synthesize all the arts, including painting, sculpture, and even music. As the architectural historian William Curtis has written, Le Corbusier wanted the building to be a manifesto. Le Corbusier only visited Harvard twice, but one of his most vivid impressions of the place was the overlapping tides of students that filled Harvard Yard as pealing bells signaled the break between classes. He was fascinated by that, Sekler recalled in a recent interview, how it suddenly came to life. As recounted in Le Corbusier at Work, Curtis and Sekler's definitive account of the building's creation, Le Corbusier was disappointed by the way his given site was closed off from the Yard, but he still sought to incorporate it into his plan, most dramatically with his S-shaped ramp, which he envisioned as an extension of the paths that crisscrossed the campus. In piercing the center of the building, the ramp would draw people in, both conceptually, by collapsing the distinction between internal and external space, and practically, by tantalizing them with a glimpse of the work going on in the glass-walled studios alongside the ramp. Electronic tones would issue from speakers along the ramp, echoing the choreography of bells and movement he had witnessed in the Yard. But the building didn't turn out exactly as Le Corbusier envisioned it. The electronic tones were dropped early on. More significantly, he was forced to abandon his plans to cover the building's external spaces with a garden, an extension of the greenery of the Yard. Unlike the manicured quads, he had wanted it to be a natural, untended garden -- seeded entirely by the wind and birds and insects, watered by the rain and allowed to run riot all over the building's several terraces. The idea didn't particularly appeal to the Harvard administration, and a lack of safety rails rendered most of the proposed space off-limits anyway. Today only the lower front terrace has a garden, and it's a rim of dirt thinly covered in summer with weeds. </P> 	nyt_eng_200411.gz

Times Regional Newspaper Group. For use by member papers only.  We have news from Lakeland and Sarasota.  The goal of PHOTO-BUDGET is to be a forum for exchanging advice, equipment reviews and news about your photo department. Take issue if you disagree with an equipment review, but likewise let us -- and your counterparts at other papers -- know if you agree and have more to add. There's a lot of expertise out there and we are trying to help you share it.  Susan Kille and Stephen G. Reed are at the NYTRENG Wire Desk: (212) 556-1518.  ---  PHOTO EDITORS: Does everyone in your department see the PHOTO-BUDGET? We certainly want this weekly missive to reach photo editors, but any other shooter who sends his e-mail address to nytrengnytimes.com will be added to the list.  QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS: Call us at (212) 556-1518 or zap an e-mail message.  Part of this is repeated from last Tuesday's budget due to the Holiday week. I feel the subject is important and deserves more discussion. Some editors did respond, thanks.  How many NYTRNG papers ran the photo by AP Photographer John Moore in last Wednesday's papers? The image, which I bet is nominated for a Pulitzer, shows an Army Nurse as he tries to save the life of an American soldier by giving him CPR upon arrival at a military hospital in Baghdad, Iraq on Tuesday, Nov. 9, 2004. But the soldier died. The soldier was fatally wounded in a Baghdad firefight with insurgents. He lies on a stretcher and a wedding band is on his left hand that tells you he has a family. If you did run it then you know what I am talking about but the file should still be in your AP Server JBM107. I have archived it.  After being here for 20 years I can't ever remember running an image like this so big on 1A. When I found it in the AP server last Tuesday I made a proof and took it to Editor Skip Perez expecting to have a battle to get any ink on 1A. Skip agreed that the image was extremely powerful and illustrated the effects of war on our troops. We ran it six columns above the fold. Lots of other papers ran it about the same size, like the Tampa Tribune. The calls and the letters started coming in, about 20 calls the best I can figure. We have had Letters to the Editor about the image. At first it was ugly, how dare The Ledger show troops in this manner. How would you like it if it was your son? Then we started getting some positive letters. Skip Perez responded to some of them and his comments really help to explain things to the readers. The following is one of Skip's responses to a reader:  Dear Mr. Williams,  Ledger Publisher John Fitzwater passed along your e-mail critical of our front-page photo showing the dying soldier in Iraq. I respect your point of view.  I don't profess to always be right or certain about my judgments. I have been doing this job for 28 years and have made my share of mistakes. I do know a powerful, heart-grabbing photo when I see one. This was such a rare photo. That is why we used it and played it as we did.  I have also been around this business long enough to know that it's risky for anyone to make judgments about how someone's family might feel about us publishing a photo of a family member in crisis or death. I have spoken to family members about tragic photos we've published and some have thanked me.  We received about 20 phone calls or letters concerning the photo. Most were critical, but if you've been following our letters column, many praised our decision as well. Attached is a copy of one letter, from a military veteran, whose view differs from yours.  Again, thank you for being a longtime subscriber of The Ledger. We value your loyalty. Most days, I hope, you enjoy and are illuminated by what you see and read.  My name is John Carter. I'm retired U.S. Army. I was a first sergeant. I want to say that picture that I saw was not inappropriate. That picture represents what really happens in war. People must be aware that the cost of freedom is so soldiers and marines that are dying. So thank you. You'll get some flack over this, but I support you one hundred percent.  Responses from NYTRNG editors re. the photo:  We opted not to run the CPR photo.....being so close three area military bases, we thought it was a smattering too close to home for many family members.  We ran the photo, but on an inside page in color. I tried hard to get it on Page 1 but was resisted. I was asked if the soldier was already dead, which would have killed it's running here. Cheerios test and all. But the caption said he was still alive when the photo was taken. Our desk editors are pretty squeamish and harsh reality, especially when unpleasantly represented, is a tough sell. But at least we ran it. Kudos to Jim Osteen, our exec, who supported running it at all.  After looking at 75 portfolios over the last two months the following web page best explains my feelings. All of the NYTRNG Photo Editors/Chief Photographers have more experience than me with hiring....Because no shooter has left here in 18 years and I guess I am the closest one to the door because I have a foot in the casket and ride motorcycles. You're going to need high speed cable ... it's a quicktime movie.  http//www.sportsshooter.com/special_feature/2004_luau_video/port_rev  iews/ind ex.html  On the geek side:  I am just starting to use a Sprint Palm Treo650 Cell Phone with Bluetooth. Having all kinds of trouble using the Treo with the Powerbooks simply because Palm and Sprint have not released a real working Mac Desktop Software. So far, I can view Wieck and other Web pages from the phone, it's not real fast or easy but it can be done. I need to spend a little more time with it...

On Friday night photographer Michael Wilson will cover Lt. Col. Hiram Mann who is a featured speaker at Sun 'N Fun's Aviation Expression lecture series. Mann is one of the original Tuskeegee airmen.  On Sunday the Tampa Bay Bucs and their worthless place kicker will play the Atlanta Falcons at Raymond James Stadium at 1PM. Photographer David Mills and one TBA will cover for deadline. All images will be posted to Wieck by 5PM.  The Herald-Tribune in Sarasota last month revived and expanded a photo feature called Life Through a Lens.  We have kicked around the idea for a photo column for quite a while and we finally made it happen, said MIKE LANG, director of photography.  A photo column, like a written column, has a point of view. While visual, photo columns usually include a narrative that pairs with images to express an idea. A photo column can have one image or several and a general goal is to convey an impression that readers haven't seen before.  Life Through a Lens is the name of a photo column that had run in one edition of the paper, but the new version runs prominently in all editions. It began its new life on Oct. 25 with a five-column spread of photos and text by CHIP LITHERLAND. Litherland captured the images after he finished an assignment at Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota and decided to play tourist for an hour.  Litherland wrote that Mote's aquariums provided an opportunity for instant nature photography but he did not take a conventional approach. His choice of black and white images added a sense of mystery to photos that include the fin of a tiger shark cutting through water, a moray eel showing his teeth, the silvery face of a lookdown and X-ray-like images of moon jellyfish.  The feature appears on the cover of the Florida West section every other Monday.  Since the relaunch, Life through a Lens has appeared three more times: THOMAS BENDER visited a group of Civil War re-enactors; PHIL DIEDERICH showed why he was sure a long election season was over; and Litherland looked for and found something different at a groundbreaking ceremony.  Space availability can vary greatly, so we will need to be flexible with the design, Lang said. One week, it might be several photos and a copy block written by the photographer. Another week, it might be a single image with a healthy cutline. Either way, it will be a great showcase for our staff photographers to publish photos that might not get in the paper anywhere else.

"146694"	"I"	"think"	" In the wake of his side's success, El Nino, 18-year-old lefthander Nadal, is the youngest ever to help seize the Cup with a singles win.

Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said Graham's positions on those issues, especially Iraq, are going to ensure he has a very important and significant position in the history of the United States Senate, in particular the history of this current period in terms of American foreign policy.

Children sort of drove the interest, but then mothers read them and realized how literate they were and celebrated the best in children, like their intelligence. What also, I think, makes you feel safe is the fact that there is a baby in the movie. Because Sunny's there, you know nothing too terrible is going to happen to them. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"146947"	"I"	"think"	" It is, I think, wrong and severely damaging to public health in the United States if a company has to go . . . through the FDA approval process -- which for a human drug now costs, according to Tufts University, about $880 million . . . and then to have to fight 50 state court battles to sustain that approval, Crawford said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"147268"	"I"	"think"	" George Jepsen, chairman of the state Democratic Party, said: I'm pleased that the state can start to bring closure. . . .

"147302"	"I"	"think"	" The blow is, I think, in terms of prestige and the identity of the area as not being a colony of the Los Angeles film industry, which was pretty much a fantasy anyway, said Gordon Whiting, a technical consultant to Zaentz. In terms of the studios and post-production facilities, they were the personal playgrounds of three major filmmakers. There wasn't enough industry traffic that was local to the area to really call itself sustaining. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"

"147499"	"you"	"think"	" But early that morning, the Golden Globe nominations had been announced, and the movie hadn't been named in any category. Radford was too upset to hide it. The Globes aren't Oscars, but the Globes create a buzz, and can influence the Oscar vote. I vote for the Oscars, said the director, I know how it is.

Summoning an image of the mythic sea-monster symbolizing Chaos, God asks, Canst thou draw out Leviathan with a hook? The poet-priest's point, I think, is that God is occupied bringing light to darkness and imposing physical order on chaos, and leaves his human creations free to work out moral justice on their own. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"147988"	"I"	"think"	" Aaron Miles cares more about the program, I think, than any kid I've ever coached, Self said. It's almost to the point where he takes responsibility for everything that goes on. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"148076"	"I"	"think"	" What Maya Lin did, says Goldberger, was to help push the design toward a more austere, more modern response rather than the somewhat more flowery and, I think, softheaded approaches being proposed. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"

There's no doubt that future installments are in the offing in the years to come.(There will also be three special Monday episodes in February. In other words: With Fox's history of shifting programming, you're best advised to check weekly listings.)There's a simple reason why some reality shows last while others fade: simplicity.Take MTV's The Real World. The show has 15 seasons in the can, and just re-upped for five more. That longevity is the result of a basic concept ... take (predominantly) good-looking young people of different backgrounds and interests and make them live together.Rule No. 1, I think, is the more gimmicky these things are, the less shelf life they've got, said Robert Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University. In the end, it's the ones with the fewest bells and whistles ... that do the best. It certainly doesn't get any simpler than Idol.

But Molnar said that these storms outdumped even the deepest snows of California's '97-98 El Nino winter, when his dog could sit on the snow and chew on a branch in his yard that is 12 feet off the ground. Now, he said, that branch is buried.

, she said,	 In the Wasatch Range, Park City, Utah, is flirting with record snow depth totals and is 100 percent open. The day after Christmas, up to this past week, it snowed two weeks without stopping, said the Park City spokeswoman Krista Rowles Parry. We've had 138 inches in that time. While main thoroughfares are now clear, she said, Park City has resorted to hauling away its snow and paying a company to melt it. Snowbanks are 20 to 25 feet high around town, she added. It's crazy, because it's like driving around in snow tunnels. </P> 	nyt_eng_200501.gz
, she said,	 Also unusual, she said, was that because of the southerly flow from the most recent storms, the base snow depths in Park City and at the nearby Canyons ski areas rivaled those of the legendarily inundated ski areas of Alta and Snowbird on Little Cottonwood Canyon. And, oddly, there is currently little or no snow on the ground in nearby Salt Lake City. </P> 	nyt_eng_200501.gz

The exotic animal trade, she said, is just as lucrative as the drug trade, and in 2003 she helped get the Captive Wildlife Safety Act passed to prohibit the transportation of exotic cats across state lines. </P> 	nyt_eng_200501.gz
, she said,	 Hedren, who heads the Roar Foundation that established Shambala in 1983, agreed that the court battle was arduous. Her preserve, she said, does not breed, buy, sell or trade animals but is simply a place where exotic cats -- such as African lions, black and snow leopards, Bengal and Siberian tigers and panthers -- can live in peace for the rest of their lives. </P> 	nyt_eng_200501.gz

Now I think we have to rescue our policy from ourselves. U.S. troops, he said, deserve and want a policy -- they ask questions, you know. 'How are we going to do this? How are we going to get out of here?' </P> 	nyt_eng_200501.gz

He said it was the data he turned up investigating the medical student's complaint that got him interested. It was clear to him, he said, that race was the deciding factor and that the university was going beyond what the law allowed and was inviting a lawsuit. </P> 	nyt_eng_200501.gz

He recalls his disappointment as a ticket holder that our seasons were always over at the end of the calendar year, except for rare occasions. Check off that one, too.

Five car bomb blasts rocked Baghdad Wednesday as suicide bombers hit targets that included the Australian Embassy, the latest attacks in an intensified campaign of violence apparently meant to disrupt nationwide elections planned for Jan. 30. (Staff byline TK)  An early lede has moved.  And  IRAQ-ELECT (Undated) -- A look at the mechanics of the Jan. 30 election. From training as many as 200,000 poll workers to tabulating the choices of approximately 14 million eligible voters, the logistical challenges of organizing the election has been lost in the wash of violence and political strife. By James Glanz.  IRAQ-BRITAIN (London) -- Folo on the release of graphic Iraqi prisoner abuse photos at the court martial of British soldiers, which has created an uproar in Britain and put renewed pressure on Prime Minister Tony Blair. By Alan Cowell.  MIDEAST (Gaza City, Gaza Strip) -- Developments. Palestinian security forces will fan out near Gaza's borders with Israel within days to enforce President Mahmoud Abbas' order to halt militant attacks on Israelis, their top commander says. Israel radio says the army has been given permission to launch an invasion of Gaza if rocket attacks by militants don't stop. By Greg Myre.  MEXICO-DRUGS (Mexico City) -- Prosecutors believe the police or possibly federal agents are behind the murder of the brother of former President Salinas Gotari, newspapers here have reported. Reports say the victim, Enrique Salinas, had hired federal agents or police to protect him from the demands of his ex-wife, who was seeking a part of the millions in cash that had been unfrozen in French bank accounts. By James C. McKinley.  PLAVIX-TEST (Undated) -- Plavix, an expensive and popular blood thinner, is no better than a much cheaper alternative, aspirin combined with the over-the-counter stomach protector Prilosec, a study suggests. By Gardiner Harris.  SMALL-STARS (Undated) -- The smallest star ever to be reliably weighed has tipped the scales at more than twice its expected weight, astronomers said today. The work casts doubt on much of what astronomers thought they knew about low-mass bits of cosmic litter, like so-called brown dwarfs, hovering on the edge of stardom, suggesting that astronomers have systematically misidentified these objects, which though faint far outnumber the more luminous stars, and have underestimated their masses. By Dennis Overbye.  BUSH INAUGURAL (w code)  INAUGURAL-POLL (Undated) -- When President Bush is sworn in on Thursday for his second term, he will lead a nation that is generally optimistic about his presidency, but doubtful that he will unite the country or make any real progress on the nation's most pressing problems -- including Iraq, terrorism, the economy, the budget deficit and the cost of prescription drugs, according to the finding of the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. By Adam Nagourney.  INQUGURAL-RELIGION (Washington) -- Incorporating religious elements into inaugural week and inaugural addresses has been the practice of many modern presidents. The visibility of religion and prayers in President Bush's festivities, and among some of his most prominent supporters, seems more conspicuous than in the past, they say, because society at large is more secular. On Inaugural Day, Bush attends a private church service; much of the music at the event will carry a religious theme. But the role of religion in inaugurations probably reached its apex with Eisenhower, who delivered his address in the form of a prayer. By David D. Kirkpatrick.  INAUGURAL-BUSH (Washington) -- President Bush's day as he attends pre-inaugural events and prepares to be sworn in at Noon on Thursday for his second term. By Richard W. Stevenson.  INAUGURAL-LAURA-BUSH (Washington) -- In an interview, Laura Bush talks about her agenda for a second-term and her family's relationships. She said she hoped to focus some on new efforts to pay attention to how boys are raised (pilot programs in Pittsburgh and elsewhere), as well as on other children's issues. Although she usually keeps much of herself hidden, she joked about being friskier than most people suspect. By Todd S. Purdum.

By Adam Liptak.  UNITED STATES -- Other Washington (w code)  RICE-CONFIRM (Washington) -- WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 -- Condoleezza Rice was overwhelmingly endorsed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday to be the next secretary of state, but only after some spirited exchanges signaled that Iraq will be a divisive issue in President Bush's second term. The 16-2 vote by the panel cleared the way for Rice to be confirmed by the full Senate, in all probability in time for the inaugural celebrations on Friday. All 10 Republicans on the committee voted in favor, as had been expected. Six of the panel's eight Democrats also voted in favor, with only Sens. Barbara Boxer of California and John Kerry of Massachusetts in opposition. By Steven R. Weisman.  An early lede has moved.  GONZALES-CONFIRM (Washington) -- After tough questions are raised by Democrats who thought Alberto R. Gonzalez was too evasive in answering questions about torture policies, the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday morning put off the confirmation vote on his nomination to be attorney general. By Eric Lichtblau.  LEAVITT-CONFRIM (Washington) -- President Bush's nominee for secretary of health and human services, Michael Leavitt, gets tough questions on Medicaid at a confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee. He will also be asked about FDA, drug safety, welfare and the new Medicare drug benefit. By Robert Pear.  FINANCIAL (f code)  ECON-FORUM (Undated) -- For a few days each January, Klaus Schwab, a German-born former business school teacher, throws the ultimate A-list party -- gathering chief executives, political leaders, activists, and the occasional rock star for a blend of high-flown talk and down-and-dirty networking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Schwab, 65, has built a thriving business around the conference, housed in a elegant hillside headquarters outside Geneva. But the World Economic Forum still lives and dies on the cachet of Davos. Two weeks before opening day, the planning here has reached a fever pitch. By Mark Landler.  MITSUBISHI-OUTLOOK (Tokyo) -- Mitsubishi Motors is scrambling to secure new financing and outline a strategy for reversing the huge losses it has incurred as a result of a series of management mistakes over the last several years. By Todd Zaun.  PHILIPPINES-ECON (Singapore) -- The Philippines said that the government posted a budget deficit in 2004 of 186.1 billion pesos ($3.35 billion), 7 percent less than its deficit in 2003 and 6 percent below the government's own target for last year. Economists attributed much of the improvement to higher tax receipts by the country's customs bureau, notably on imported oil and petroleum products. By Wayne Arnold.  EU-CHEMICALS-FINES (Brussels, Belgium) -- The European Union head office imposed fines totaling $283 million on the chemical giants Akzo Nobel, Atofina and Hoechst for carving up among themselves the European market for a chemical used to produce detergents, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. By Paul Meller.  GM-EARNINGS (Detroit) -- General Motors reported that its fourth-quarter earnings fell 37 percent because of higher health care costs, losses in its European divisions and accounting charges. The company said earnings came in at $630 million, or $1.11 a share, down from $1 billion, or $2.13 a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue was $51.34 billion, up 5.1 percent from $48.84 billion. By Jeremy W. Peters.  CHASE-EARNINGS (New York) -- J.P. Morgan Chase reported that its fourth-quarter profit declined 11 percent as charges related to its acquisition of Bank One ate into the bottom line.

, they agree,	 Beyond their concerns about the legitimacy of the election lie a host of other disagreements with the president. They express pessimism about the upcoming election in Iraq, ask why no one has been held accountable for prewar intelligence errors, and voice fears that Bush's proposed changes to Social Security will lead to benefit cuts down the road. His educational and economic policies, they agree, are a disaster for the nonrich. This incredible skewing toward the haves, getting people to vote against their own interests: It is incredible, says Rothstein. The president's syntax also comes under fire: It is embarrassing to hear him speak, says Baughman. He can't put two sentences together. </P> 	nyt_eng_200501.gz

, they say,	 INAUGURAL-RELIGION (Washington) -- Incorporating religious elements into inaugural week and inaugural addresses has been the practice of many modern presidents. The visibility of religion and prayers in President Bush's festivities, and among some of his most prominent supporters, seems more conspicuous than in the past, they say, because society at large is more secular. On Inaugural Day, Bush attends a private church service; much of the music at the event will carry a religious theme. But the role of religion in inaugurations probably reached its apex with Eisenhower, who delivered his address in the form of a prayer. By David D. Kirkpatrick. </P> 	nyt_eng_200501.gz

Putting two units together doesn't make it twice as loud, he said. They could be playing on people who know a little but not enough about sound. Comparing the noise levels may be futile because competing manufacturers tend to measure sound differently, Fierstein said. They may measure sound at the front or from the sides, he said, or measure middle-range sounds only and not the lower-frequency hums or rumbles, which are a lot of the problem, Fierstein said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200501.gz

SCI-CRIME-EVIL (Undated) -- Many psychiatrists assiduously avoid the word evil, contending that its use would precipitate a dangerous slide from clinical to moral judgment that could put people on death row unnecessarily and obscure the understanding of violent criminals. In an effort to standardize what makes a crime particularly heinous, a group at New York University has been developing what it calls a depravity scale, which rates the horror of an act by the sum of its grim details. And a prominent personality expert at Columbia University has published a 22-level hierarchy of evil behavior, derived from detailed biographies of more than 500 violent criminals. He is now working on a book urging the profession not to shrink from thinking in terms of evil when appraising certain offenders, even if the E-word cannot be used as part of an official exam or diagnosis. By Benedict Carey.  SCI-MOLE (Undated) -- Researchers at Vanderbilt University have found that the star-nosed mole can eat 10 mouthful-size chunks of earthworm, one at a time, in 2.3 seconds, or 0.23 second a chunk. That is the fastest eating ever measured in any mammal. By Carl Zimmer.  SCI-HELIUM-WHISTLING (Undated) -- In the world of quantum physics, particles leap through impenetrable barriers or exist in two places at once, secret codes can't be broken, electrical currents pass through wires without resistance. Here's another quantum trick: liquid helium that whistles. By Kenneth Chang.  SCI-Q&amp;A (Undated) -- A science question answered: What is the nutritional difference between fresh fruit and the same fruit dried, for example between grapes and raisins and fresh and dried apricots? By C. Claiborne Ray.  SCI-MINI-SOLAR-SYSTEMS (Undated) -- Astronomers have found what they say may be a miniature solar system in the making. In the latest example of the apparent fecundity of nature, astronomers have determined a tiny starlike object too small to be a star is surrounded by a tiny disk of dust that could someday form planets, which could perhaps be able to support life for a short while -- a few million years of so. By Dennis Overbye.  SCI-SATURN-HOTSPOT (Undated) -- More than shimmering rings and a smoggy moon the size of a planet sets Saturn apart in the solar system. It also has an unusual hot spot at the tip of its south pole. By John Noble Wilford.  SCI-WATCH (Undated) -- News and notes on science: Using a 960-kilowatt transmitter, researchers beamed radio waves into the ionosphere during an auroral display and produced speckles of green light that were captured by a camera; role specialization in hunting has now been seen in bottlenose dolphins; Japanese researchers have found living things in sediments in the deepest place on Earth, a Pacific Ocean trench that is 35,750 feet deep. By Henry Fountain.  With  SCI-NAMING-MONKEYS (Undated) -- These days, if you're willing to pay the asking price, you can put your name on just about anything -- a basketball arena, a hospital wing, perhaps even a subway station. How humdrum. The Wildlife Conservation Society, on the other hand, is offering some true naming-rights excitement. The group will be auctioning off the chance to name a new species of monkey. A short by Henry Fountain.  SCI-ALZHEIMERS-DISTRESS (Undated) -- A Side Effects column. Something to worry about with Alzheimer's: researchers have found a clear correlation between the proneness to distress and the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's. By James Gorman.  SCI-MISCARRIAGES (Undated) -- The agony of infertility for thousands of women in the United States is not that they cannot conceive, but that they cannot hold on to their babies beyond the first few weeks of pregnancy -- and that no one can explain why. Doctors say that as many as 3 percent or 4 percent of couples who try to have a child suffer from recurrent pregnancy loss, in which women under 40 experience three or more consecutive miscarriages with the same partner. A quarter of those couples, the doctors say, will probably remain in the don't know why category. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that, of the 6.23 million pregnancies recorded in the United States 1999, a million ended in spontaneous abortion. A 25-year-old has about a 15 percent chance of miscarrying; by 42, that figure is above 50 per cent. Although miscarriages are common, they are often not talked about, nor are they much studied. By Emma Daly.  SCI-DOCTOR-YEARS (Undated) -- Does the practice of medicine have a natural lifespan? Every doctor, every patient (and every insurer) would probably answer differently. An essay by Abigail Zuger, M.D.  SCI-PATIENTS-LANGUAGES (Undated) -- What's a doctor to do when the patient doesn't speak her language, and she doesn't speak his. And, when the hospital translation service doesn't cover a language as basic as French. Then, it takes a little creativity. By Danielle Ofri, M.D.  SCI-REALLY (Undated) -- The Claim: Loud music can cause lasting hearing problems. The Facts: .... By Anahad O'Connor.  .SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) -- News and notes on health and medicine. By John O'Neil:  -- Treatments: Steroid injections are as effective as surgery in treating carpal tunnel syndrome, a new study concludes. The findings, published last week in the journal Arthritis &amp; Rheumatism, also note that the injections appeared to provide faster relief.  -- Behavior: Soothing music may help older people sleep, reseachers in Taiwan determine.  -- Therapies: A new rehabilitation technique has helped patients who lost some of their sight through strokes to recapture parts of their fields of vision, according to a study presented last week at the American Stroke Association's international conference in New Orleans.  -- Patterns: The injectable contraceptive sold under the name Depo-Provera is popular with adolescent girls and young women, but has been shown to reduce bone density during this crucial period of growth. A new study has found, however, that those who stop taking the drug catch up in about a year.  SCI-AUTISM (Undated) -- Within the last year, several laboratories have reported finding important new clues about autism, the mysterious syndrome that robs children of normal brain development. For the first time, they say, a coherent picture is emerging: in autism, subtle brain abnormalities are present from birth. Infants and toddlers move their bodies differently. Between the ages of 6 and 24 months, their heads grow much too fast. Parts of their brain have too many connections while other parts are underconnected. Moreover, their brains show signs of chronic inflammation in the same areas that show excessive growth. The inflammation appears to last a lifetime. By Sandra Blakeslee.  SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) -- The Personal Health column: Total knee replacement is now one of the nation's leading orthopedic operations, and it promises to become even more popular as the population ages (and grows heavier) and the body's most vulnerable joints fail to withstand the punishment of decades of use and abuse. Debilitating wear-and-tear arthritis is the major reason that knee bones are being replaced by two-pound pieces of metal in people who wish to remain mobile, pain-free and physically active in their later years. But the recovery, the writer confirms with personal experience, is prolonged and painful. By Jane E. Brody.  Photos, where indicated, are being sent to NYT photo clients.

, she says,	 Lichtenberg, president of New York-based Clear Peak consulting, also believes that a woman's brain is different from a man's. Because of those differences, she says, women tend to be more articulate, and they're able to juggle several tasks.

, he said,	 The sheer pace of the campaign left him unable to follow up on hurried requests to aides, he said, causing mistakes to occur at crucial moments. On Aug. 9, while campaigning at the Grand Canyon, Kerry answered yes to a question about whether he would have voted to give the president the authority to go to war in Iraq knowing what we know now - that there were no weapons of mass destruction. Kerry said the question was poorly phrased and he thought he was only reiterating why he had voted to give Bush the authority in the first place. </P> 	nyt_eng_200502.gz
, they say,	 However, they say, the daily business of the church will largely continue as usual, overseen by a sizable Vatican bureaucracy whose leadership was almost entirely installed by John Paul II, who has been pope for an extraordinary 26 years. </P> 	nyt_eng_200502.gz
, they say,	 Furthermore, they say, the 84-year-old pope's illness provides a powerful, and highly visible, demonstration of several core Catholic teachings about the value of human life at all stages and the importance of suffering as part of the Christian journey. </P> 	nyt_eng_200502.gz
, they say,	 Scholars note that John Paul II has always preferred to focus on the big picture; the delegation of the daily administration of the church to others was a characteristic of his papacy even while he was healthy. And, they say, the men who appear to have assumed the most power as a result of his infirmity are longtime close aides whose views closely reflect the pope's own. The pope's most important aide is his longtime private secretary, Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz, but he also closely relies on Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith; Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, prefect of the Congregation for Bishops; and Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Vatican secretary of state. </P> 	nyt_eng_200502.gz

Even the reputedly horrific postoperative pain associated with this surgery, he added, is now fully controlled with morphine through epidural anesthesia supplemented by extra doses that the patients can administer. </P> 	nyt_eng_200502.gz

, he said,	 Doctors forget to order the very basic tests, check the uterus, said Dr. William H. Kutteh, a specialist in immunology and reproductive endocrinology at Fertility Associates of Memphis.

, he said,	 We are talking about people who commit breathtaking acts, who do so repeatedly, who know what they're doing, and are doing it in peacetime under no threat to themselves, said Dr. Michael Stone, the Columbia psychiatrist, who has examined several hundred killers at Mid-Hudson Psychiatric Center in New Hampton, N.Y., and others at Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in Queens, where he consults and teaches. We know from experience who these people are, and how they behave, and it is time, he said, to give their behavior the proper appellation. </P> 	nyt_eng_200502.gz
, they say,	 Checklists, scales, and other psychological exams are not blood tests, however, and their use in support of a concept as loaded as evil could backfire, many psychiatrists say. Not all violent predators are psychopaths, for one thing, nor are most psychopaths violent criminals. And to suggest that psychopathy or some other profile is a reliable measure of evil, they say, would be irresponsible and ultimately jeopardize the credibility of the profession. </P> 	nyt_eng_200502.gz
, they say,	 The doctors who argue that evil has a place in forensics are well aware of these risks, but say that in some cases they are worth taking. They say it is possible -- necessary, in fact, to understand many predatory killers -- to hold inside one's head many disparate dimensions: that the person in question may be narcissistic, perhaps abused by a parent, or even charming, affectionate and intelligent, but also in some sense evil. While the term may not be appropriate for use in a courtroom or a clinical diagnosis, they say, it is an element of human nature that should not be ignored. </P> 	nyt_eng_200502.gz
, she said,	 Dr. Angela Hegarty, director of psychiatry at Creedmoor who works with Stone, said she was skeptical of using the concept of evil but realized that in her work she found herself thinking and talking about it all the time. In 11 years as a forensic examiner, in this country and in Europe, she said, she counts four violent criminals who were so vicious, sadistic and selfish that no other word could describe them. </P> 	nyt_eng_200502.gz
, he added,	 The only way you can look at this budget is to look at the supplementals with it, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said Monday. Taken together, he added, they would include funds for major changes in the Army, which has borne the brunt of fighting in Iraq. </P> 	nyt_eng_200502.gz
, he said,	 Sabel said that after six months, the 24 patients in the study were able to detect 63 percent of the peripheral signals, compared with 54 percent when they began.

, he said,	 Looking back, he said, Watergate laid the foundation for the partisanship, bitterness and venom in today's politics. Disclosure is generally a good thing but can be used as a weapon.

Amplified music at a concert can reach 120 decibels and climb to an ear-rattling 130 decibels, rivaling the sound of a jet taking off. Sound from headphones can reach 100 decibels -- louder than a lawn mower. </P> 	nyt_eng_200502.gz
, they calculated,	 The extra heat, they calculated, was coming from a disk of dust and perhaps larger materials, extending 300,000 to 900 million miles from the dwarf star, about a tenth the size of the disk that formed our own solar system. They estimated that there was enough material in the little disk to make a planet like Jupiter or several smaller Earthlike planets. </P> 	nyt_eng_200502.gz
, he said,	 Dr. Alan Boss, a planetary theorist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, said, The biggest impact of this discovery may be to force theorists to consider the possibility of planet formation around objects which are so low in mass that they are on the verge of being called planets themselves. It is not too soon, he said, to start worrying about what to call some of these things. </P> 	nyt_eng_200502.gz

, he added,	 For Ralph Samuelson, director of the New York-based Asian Cultural Council, which has helped finance training and teaching for Chinese modern dancers and choreographers in the United States and in China, China is very different from what it was.

, she added,	 To this day, Abraham cannot define why she broke away from Hasidism. It will always remain a mystery, she said. She may have gotten some of her independence, she added, from her father Hersh Ber Abraham, a Satmar rabbi she described as an antinomian -- one who goes his own way. Hersh Ber Abraham is not a traditionalist in that he is not allied with the teachings of a single rabbi, she said, but he embraces the works of many. </P> 	nyt_eng_200502.gz
, she said,	 Another reason for leaving the fold, she said, was an accident of geography: Monsey, during the '60s, was still farmland. There were relatively few Hasids, and no Hasidic schools for girls. So her parents sent her to an ultra-Orthodox girls' school. The curriculum was more secular than it would have been in a typical Hasidic school of the time, she said. She read the full texts of some of Shakespeare's plays and Hawthorne and Dickens, for instance. She also got a driver's license. </P> 	nyt_eng_200502.gz

A day after the 84-year-old pope made his first public appearance since this latest of his health crises -- appearing at his window at the Gemelli hospital -- Navarro-Valls said that he continues to improve medically but that doctors have recommended a continued stay as a precaution. The pope, he added, is eating regularly, sitting up in a chair for several hours, saying Mass every day, and reading the newspapers 'to see how my illness is going.'

Some purists will complain that the art spoils a sanctuary, that the park is perfect as it is, which it is. But the work, I think, pays gracious homage to Olmsted's and Vaux's abiding pastoral vision: like immense Magic Marker lines, the gates highlight the ingenious and whimsical curves, dips and loops that Olmsted and Vaux devised as antidotes to the rigid grid plan of the surrounding city streets and, by extension, to the general hardships of urban life. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"

"149511"	"I"	"think"	" A. There's no dispute. The accounting literature is quite clear on how this decision is evaluated. We are required once a year and have been for a number of years going through the calculation that is associated with valuing the basis of the goodwill asset that is on our balance sheet -- a noncash asset, by the way.

Our ability to perceive quality in nature begins, as in art, with the pretty, he wrote in the late 1940s, when, to most scientists, the extinction of the whooping crane seemed imminent. It expands through successive stages of the beautiful to values as yet uncaptured by language.

"153750"	"I"	"think"	" Patriots receiver P.K. Sam faces a paradox. The harder he tries to forget 2004, the more he wants to remember it. The title-winning year for the Patriots proved quite forgettable for the rookie receiver. It began when Sam, acting on dubious advice, elected to leave Florida State after his junior year. The Patriots grabbed Sam with the 164th pick, a spot where riches are unlikely and a roster spot isn't even a certainty. A fifth-round pick - the last pick of the fifth round - is nowhere close to being financially secure, said Sam, who earned a little over $350,000 last year. Sam said the draft-day disappointment began a season-long funk that included being placed on injured reserve in the middle of the season, and low-lighted by a suspension from the team prior to the Super Bowl. Not only was that embarrassing, but it hurt, Sam said. I think that's finally when I hit that wall and I said, 'P.K. you got to turn this around. This league is going to move on without you, so you either turn around now or you're just going to be out of luck.' Sam has latched onto Deion Branch, picking his brain about the offense, and it has helped him relax. A couple of nice leaping catches at last week's minicamp could be a sign of things to come. Once you get more relaxed, it opens up opportunities, I think, Sam said. I still have a long way to go, but at least I have something to build on now. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"

"155854"	"they"	"think"	" NASA's accident investigators believe air trapped inside voids in the foam, like holes in Swiss cheese, warmed as Columbia lifted off.

"155855"	"I"	"think"	" In every confirmation hearing, nominees have declined to answer questions virtually identical to those like Senator Schumer's, said Sen, John Cornyn, R-Texas, who is on the Judiciary Committee.

"155906"	"I"	"think"	" We started off as, I think, a more conventional drama, he says. If you look at the episodes early on, we had some straight, linear, serious dramatic storylines and they were fine, but they could have played just as easily, I think, on The Practice. And this show, as it sort of found itself, really wanted to be more of a comedy. Will there be dramatic storylines? Absolutely. But we may be more of a comedy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"

"156029"	"I"	"think"	" There is still, I think, not enough understanding of the delicate nature of the Quarter, said Jane Brooks, a professor of historic preservation at the University of New Orleans who has written extensively about illegal hotel expansions. It is a finite resource, just like the Grand Canyon or Yosemite, with a carrying capacity. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"156049"	"I"	"think"	" The records had been similar. Six and six, 7-5, 5-7. South Carolina was 5-7, I think, a couple of years ago. But records were a little bit similar (the) prior three years. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"156052"	"I"	"think"	" A. There were some waves that came in that I didn't go on. I was like, 'Wow, I can't believe I'm out here dealing with this.'

Thousands of people were watching, and I had Tony Moniz, Johnny-Boy Gomes, Peter Mel and, I think, Clyde Aikau in the heat. It was just this crazy lineup of big-wave surfers and me.

"156216"	"I"	"think"	" Almost prophetically, he added: The thing about the court that's so interesting is the way the interactions between the justices affect the way the court goes, and a very articulate person who gets along with the other justices ...

"156469"	"we"	"think"	" Because of the work of the committee and the promises made as of Aug. 1, prisoners began receiving three bottles of bottled water each day - one with each meal - compared to what they had previously gotten, which in some instances was only one a month, Kirsch said, citing his notes. The fact that they are getting three bottles of clean water is, we think, a significant improvement over the horrible water they got before. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"156491"	"I"	"think"	" The hubris issue, I think, is what is most significant here, said Ornstein. There was a sense (at the White House) ... that they had suspended the normal rules of politics and didn't have to worry about those things that had plagued previous second terms. And now they've discovered almost all of them are there. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"156515"	"I"	"think"	" There's an old country-western song by Merle Haggard where he's talking about wanting to quit the smoking and the drinking, I think, because 'the lows keep getting lower than the highs.'

"156544"	"you"	"think"	" It's like anybody: If you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you you're sick, you think, 'Well it's a doctor, so he must know (what he's talking about),'  said Abdur-Rahim, who never has missed games because of the knee. But I'd always go back to the fact that I knew how I felt, I knew I hadn't hurt myself, I hadn't missed games. ... I'm happy, I'm thankful, I'm grateful that this situation was here for me. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"156584"	"I"	"think"	" The forecast was, I think, for more of a chance of scattered showers, he said. We were just unfortunate that it came too close and right on top of (the course). </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"

"156694"	"I"	"think"	" I certainly feel a little bit different, I think, entering the majors, Mickelson said. Certainly, I'm a little bit more patient with myself and realize that as the course gets tougher, it's not just my score that goes up, but everybody else's does, too. So I think that makes it a little bit easier to deal with and play through. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"156740"	"I"	"think"	" Investment in technology is, I think, necessary, but there will be no actual the large-scale implementation of the technology until it is cheaper to put it underground than to pay the tax to emit it, he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"156763"	"I"	"think"	" His rhetoric, I think, has been rather unfortunate, Castaneda said, and perhaps it would be useful for the State Department and Ambassador Garza to concentrate on the substance rather than grandstanding in public.

"156781"	"I"	"think"	" A wide receiver, if he wasn't very good here, he's probably not going to be very good at the other place, Spurrier said.

"156835"	"I"	"think"	" They knew I was upset, Torre said, while providing no specifics of the postgame meeting. Just the carelessness, I think, more than anything else -- that ball thrown away. It just didn't sit right with me. And the kid, you don't drop it on his shoulders. But you don't think in terms of rookie when you're in a pennant race. You think in terms of, you know better.

"156881"	"I"	"think"	" Bullies are actually easy to spot because they answer questions with questions. What exactly are you looking for? they say when you ask about a listing.

"156887"	"I"	"think"	" It was deeply moving, said Weisz, 34, because all your preconceptions were that you were going to feel sorry for them, and I wondered if it was they who should feel sorry for us, because we have all this material wealth but, I think, there comes a kind of spiritual poverty with that. It's a complicated subject that's hard to talk about, but it would have been patronizing to say, 'Oh, these poor people.' We didn't feel that. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"

"157035"	"I"	"think"	" He was clocked at 90-92 miles per hour for Memorial and when his breaking ball was working, he was overpowering. You could definitely see a lot of his dad in him, says York.

"157332"	"I"	"think"	" I would say that probably she just needs to be a little more consistent, Venus said of Serena. She definitely is on the verge of more great things for sure.

"157346"	"I"	"think"	" If the White House wants to elevate him to an even higher position as chief justice, I think it's a higher standard of inquiry and we would, I think, be adamant that we would need to have the information, said Sen. Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill., and a member of the judiciary panel. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
"157383"	"I"	"think"	" It was the sense, I think, of wanting to use what you were trained to do, what you know, who you are, wanting to fight that battle, in which the stake of a single life matters so surpassingly, even in the setting of overwhelming disaster. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
"157557"	"I"	"think"	" Historically, Chevies and Fords have been the most competitive for us, Joeris said. Toyota, I think, has a good truck. But their base cost in the past has always been higher than the Chevy and the Fords. Hopefully, since they're down here in Texas utilizing better labor rates, then maybe their manufacturing costs will be a little better. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
"157628"	"I"	"think"	" If I win the race, that answers all the questions, so that's our main goal, he said. We're one point out, so if we finish ahead of McMurray by one spot, provided he doesn't lead a lap, we're in. Gordon, I think, it's four spots and I think Sadler is 12 spots. I know the math, but you can't help that when you have a loose lug nut or a tire going down or a situation that's outside your control, so you just try to perform as best you can each and every lap. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"

"157770"	"we"	"think"	" That, we think, continues to be a sensible approach.

They were encased in the airplanes and the (World Trade Center) buildings, says Dr. John Casada, director of the emotional trauma program at the University of Texas Health Science Center.

"157850"	"I"	"think"	" And he said this: It is the obligation of the courts to decide particular cases. Often that means acting on the side of justice, as we understand it -- enforcing the Bill of Rights, enforcing the equal protection clause. But it has to be in the context of the case, and it has to be in the context of interpreting a provision that's implicated in that case.

, she says,	 If Schulman works so hard to reach her students, perhaps that's in part because the world, as she sees it, has not always done as much for her. She has not, for instance, been as successful as she feels she deserves to be. Oh, she's been recognized; her seven published novels and two works of nonfiction have won many awards (she was a finalist for the Prix de Rome), while her playwriting has earned her most of the plum residencies and fellowships available. But there is still that sixth-floor walkup and that two-hour-each-way commute and the constant effort to get theaters to mount her work, while some writers she considers her peers struggle far less and have, she says, more personal choice about which of their plays will be produced. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, she said,	 Schulman feels there's a simple reason she isn't among them: She's a lesbian who writes openly about lesbians in an industry largely run by men. Often, works that reinforce dominant fantasies about oppressed people are inflated beyond their merit, she explained in an e-mail message, judiciously omitting the names of the works she meant. Whereas works like hers, she said, address oppression from a more authentic perspective and are therefore ruthlessly marginalized. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, she said,	 In that, I got off lightly. Though she won't discuss them, her feuds and pyrotechnic fallings-out are well known. No one I contacted would comment on the record, except to praise her as an artist. (I wish her nothing but success, she truly deserves it, the playwright Craig Lucas said.) It's hard to know how many of these relationships foundered on professional instead of personal shoals; in any case, Schulman laughed when I told her how much she is feared. Their fear, she said, is actually anger: the anger of privileged people being forced to question the source of their privilege. Anyway, she said, making an incredulous face, what can I do to these people? Apparently she meant what could she do beyond attacking them in public and alluding to them unflatteringly in her novels and plays. Two of the less likable characters in Manic Flight Reaction clearly allude to -- or are named for -- former friends. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, she said,	 But that effort, she said, has been worth it. Artistically, she has emerged from the process as a senior writer with a very wide palette who can handle, she added, pretty much anything. She now has nine plays in various stages of development; it is perhaps most telling that one of them, a 1920s farce called The Lady Hamlet, will have its first reading, starring Kate Burton, on Oct. 27 at the New York Theater Workshop -- where the reviled Rent originated. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, she said,	 If Schulman is trying to put her past behind her, it's a difficult past to dismiss. She has, she said, suffered from other people a lot. The outlines of an awful upbringing are easily discernible in some of her novels, and many of her friends died of AIDS. She does not like to discuss any of this, except through her work; as a typically pithy line in Manic Flight Reaction has it: When people find out that something truly horrible has happened to you, they show no mercy. Nevertheless, she feels optimistic, rather like her character Marge, struggling to settle into normalcy at the last minute. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz

HINDU-MULSIM-HOLIDAYS (Undated) -- This week, in a rare coincidence of calendars, Hindus and Muslims from all over India, Pakistan and Bangladesh are celebrating their most joyous holidays of the year. Hindus observe Diwali and Muslims end Ramadan with Eid ul-Fitr. And both holidays are utterly soaked in sugar. Festive piles of pink, green, yellow, orange and white sweets, some shimmering with silver leaf, others snowy with shreds of coconut or crunchy with nuggets of pistachio, are integral to many religious celebrations and social rituals in South Asia.

NEW-ORLEANS-DINING (Oxford, Miss.) -- Officially, the theme of the eighth annual Southern Foodways Symposium that ended here at the University of Mississippi on Sunday, was the region's lasting love affair with sugar and sweets. But like other people in the American food world, the 250 people in attendance talked mostly about New Orleans and the Gulf Coast and their culinary future. John T. Edge, the director of the Southern Foodways Alliance, which runs the symposium, said he was confident that nearly all the nationally known New Orleans restaurants would eventually reopen. What troubles him, he said, is the po' boy shops, oyster bars, red-beans-and-rice joints and other mom-and-pop businesses that have given New Orleans dining so much of its zest. For every bit of cheerful news about a restaurant reopening, there were worried questions, especially about the small, often black-owned places in hard-hit parts of town. By R.W.

SCIENCE (a code)  BUSH-FLU (Washington) -- President Bush on Tuesday unveiled a plan to combat the threat of an avian flu pandemic, calling for $7.1 billion in emergency spending to stockpile reserves of medicines and to press ahead with the development of a new vaccine. While no cases of the H5N1 avian flu virus have been detected in the United States, more than 60 people have died from the virus, all of them in Asia, and 140 million birds have been killed worldwide to try to stop its spread. By Gardiner Harris.  With photo and graphic.  An early lede has moved.  GLOBAL-WARMING (Undated) -- If emissions of heat-trapping gases continue to accumulate in the atmosphere at the current rate, there may be many centuries of warming and a near-total loss of Arctic tundra, according to a new climate study. By Andrew C. Revkin.  CERVICAL-CANCER (Undated) -- A program for cervical cancer in which screening was coupled with quick treatment for high-risk women has very good results, a study in JAMA reports. By Denise Grady.  UNITED STATES -- National General (a code)  NEW-ORLEANS-SAINTS-DAY (New Orleans) -- The cemeteries of New Orleans, where many interred coffins were forced to the surface in the flood, drew thousands of Catholics on Tuesday observing the annual rite of All Saints Day. It was a day tinged with fresh mourning, when still-struggling residents cleaned the graves of loved ones, some of whom died in the storm, honoring lives lost this year and in the past. The confluence of All-Saints Day and Halloween is always keenly felt here, because more than any other American city, New Orleans is a place where the spiritual and secular worlds are spicily entwined. It's a place where the prevailing Catholic fervor lives with the mysticism of Voodoo in an atmosphere of neighborly tolerance, a place that reveres its ancestors, a place where food and music and sex and death are viewed as the fundamentals of existence. By Bruce Weber.  With photo.  DELAY-TRIAL (Austin, Texas) -- A judge here is to rule on a change of venue request by Rep. Tom Delay's defense team. By Ralph Blumenthal.  With photo.  NY-PRINCE (New York) -- Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, and his new wife visit New York. By Joyce Wadler.  ALIOTA-CONFRIM (Washington) -- Developments on the selection of Judge Samuel A. Aliota Jr. as he heads to Capitol Hill to begin meeting with senators. By Karl Hulse and David D. Kirkpatrick.  With photo, NYT4.  With  ALIOTA-ABORTION (Undated) -- A closer look at cases related to the issue of abortion that Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr. handled. By Adam Liptak.  And  ALIOTA-IDEOLOGY (Washington) -- If everyone agrees that Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr. is a good, smart, well-qualified candidate for the Supreme Court, is it legitimate for the Senate to reject him based purely on ideological issues? By Scott Shane.  SCOTUS (Washington) -- The Supreme Court heard arguments on Tuesday in the hallucinogenic tea case, with the question being whether a church's need to import an illegal hallucinogenic substance for its sacred rituals trumps federal drug law. By Linda Greenhouse.  CHENEY-ADDINGTON (Washington) -- A profile of David S. Addington, the new counsel for Vice President Dick Cheney. By Douglas Jehl.  BUSH-TAXES (Washington) -- The Bush advisory commission on taxes issues its final report, recommending that many popular deductions be limited or abolished to generate enough money to allow the alternative minimum tax to be repealed. By David E. Rosenbaum.  ABRAMOFF-INQUIRY (Washington) -- The congressional and Justice Department investigations of lobbyist Jack Abramoff have broadened to include scrutiny of Abramoff's efforts to pressure senior officials at the Interior Department, including Secretary Gale Norton. On Wednesday, Sen. John McCain's Indian Affairs Committee holds the last of his public hearings. By Phillip Shenon.  FINANCIAL (f code)  FED-RATES (Washington) -- The Federal Reserve continues its series of 0.25 percent interest rate increases. By Edmund L. Andrews.  With graphic.  AUTO-SALES (Detroit) -- Auto makers report sales for October. By Micheline Maynard.  DYNEGY-FRAUD (Houston) -- Former Dynegy executive Jamie Olis' 24-year accounting fraud sentence was overturned by a federal appeals court, which found that the trial court overstated the loss caused by Olis's crimes. The decision upholds the conviction and sends the case back to a federal district court for re-sentencing. By Simon Romero.  BRITAIN-SHIPPER (London) -- It had been a sinew of empire, a shipping line that ferried soldiers and diplomats, even royalty, on the Victorian mail runs that tied Britain to its outposts far to the east and beyond. But when the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co. became the object of a likely bidding war on Monday after a takeover approach from Dubai Ports World, it seemed as if the 165-year-old company might be heading the same way as so many other onetime jewels in the British economic crown -- into foreign hands. And, as P&amp;O stock has soared on speculation that Danish and Hong Kong contenders might enter the bidding, pushing the price above $5 billion, the contest invited perhaps a more philosophical question: what makes Britain so relaxed about selling companies to outsiders in a way that many in continental Europe -- France, Italy and Germany in particular -- seem reluctant to emulate? By Alan Cowell and Heather Timmons.  UBS-EARNINGS (Undated) -- UBS reports record third-quarter profit, showing how institutions with large wealth management businesses are starting to reap the benefits from a boom in oil-related wealth in the Middle East and Asia. Unlike Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch, whose profit surged on rising global stock and bond markets, Swiss banks are making themselves less reliant on trading profits. By Tom Wright.  SUN-EARNINGS (Undated) -- Sun Microsystems will post first-quarter earnings after the market closes. By Laurie J. Flynn.  VIACOM-EARNINGS (New York) -- Viacom Inc. swung to a $708.5 million net profit in the third quarter amid strong performances at its cable and entertainment segments, bouncing back from a loss in the year-ago period when results were hit by a charge for the Blockbuster Inc. video-rental business. By Geraldine Fabrikant.  SMART-ELEVATORS (New York) -- Elevators of the future have started to arrive in New York. At the Marriott Marquis, for instance, riders will no longer have to cope with a widespread pet peeve: doors that open at floor after floor once the car is full. By Fred A. Bernstein.  Editors, the News Service will file these briefs, except when all items are from other news agencies:  In addition, many clients receive condensed versions of 15-20 major news stories, summarized in the TIMES-EXPRESS-BUDGET.  ENTERTAINMENT/ARTS (e unless otherwise indicated)  BANVILLE-BOOKER-PRIZE (Dublin, Ireland) -- Not everyone was thrilled by the decision last month to give the Man Booker Prize to The Sea, by the Irish novelist John Banville. For starters, two of the five Booker judges vehemently preferred another book, Kazuo Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go. But all this is grist for the mill to the author himself, who seems to relish a good literary dust-up, or at least not to mind being at the center of one. Frankly, I am gratified to see myself vilified and the jury being vilified, he said happily over lunch recently. It cheers me up. I must have done something right to annoy so many people. By Sarah Lyall.  HESSE-EXHIBIT (Undated) -- The Hesses, best known to Americans for supplying mercenaries to England's George III, have one of the best art troves in Germany. But unlike some German princely families, like the Hanovers who are selling things at Sotheby's this fall, they are striving to keep this collection together. On Saturday in Oregon, Americans will get a taste of these riches when the Portland Museum of Art opens Hesse: A Princely German Collection, presenting more than 400 paintings, decorative objects, an elaborate gilt bronze Schinkel centerpiece, a carriage, etc. The star of the show is Holbein's Madonna, which has never been seen on these shores and rarely outside Germany since at least the 19th century. By Judith H. Dobrzynski.  ART-AUCTION (New York) -- The art auctions season kicks off Tuesday night. By Carol Vogel.  TWO-LIVES-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) -- William Grimes reviews Two Lives by Vikram Seth.  DINING (d code)  MICHELIN-GUIDE-NY (New York) -- Michelin announces the star ratings for its New York City guide to restaurants. This is Michelin's first guide outside Europe. The book will include 500 restaurants. By Florence Fabricant.  HINDU-MULSIM-HOLIDAYS (Undated) -- This week, in a rare coincidence of calendars, Hindus and Muslims from all over India, Pakistan and Bangladesh are celebrating their most joyous holidays of the year. Hindus observe Diwali and Muslims end Ramadan with Eid ul-Fitr. And both holidays are utterly soaked in sugar. Festive piles of pink, green, yellow, orange and white sweets, some shimmering with silver leaf, others snowy with shreds of coconut or crunchy with nuggets of pistachio, are integral to many religious celebrations and social rituals in South Asia. But these sweets, called mithai by Indians, have an almost religious significance in everyday life. By Julia Moskin.  With recipe.  NEW-ORLEANS-DINING (Oxford, Miss.) -- Officially, the theme of the eighth annual Southern Foodways Symposium that ended here at the University of Mississippi on Sunday, was the region's lasting love affair with sugar and sweets. But like other people in the American food world, the 250 people in attendance talked mostly about New Orleans and the Gulf Coast and their culinary future. John T. Edge, the director of the Southern Foodways Alliance, which runs the symposium, said he was confident that nearly all the nationally known New Orleans restaurants would eventually reopen. What troubles him, he said, is the po' boy shops, oyster bars, red-beans-and-rice joints and other mom-and-pop businesses that have given New Orleans dining so much of its zest. For every bit of cheerful news about a restaurant reopening, there were worried questions, especially about the small, often black-owned places in hard-hit parts of town. By R.W. Apple Jr.  WINE-TIMES (Undated) - The fortnightly feature: The Wines of the Times panel drinks California Rhone blends. This package includes an essay on tasters' impressions of the wines, a tabular report rating the wines and a recipe for a dish that goes with the wines. By Eric Asimov.  SPORTS (s code)  RUN-MARATHON-TERGAT (New York) -- Profile of Paul Tergat, the world-record holder in the marathon who, at 36, is running Sunday's New York race for the first time. He's considered the father of Kenyan distance running, having won five cross country world championships before converting to the marathon. He set the world record in 2003 in Berlin, but he might not be in top form anymore; he dropped out of two marathons in England recently because of an injury. By John Eligon.

OLY-KOREA (Dateline TK) -- In a step toward reconciliation, North and South Korea agree to form a joint team for the 2006 Asian Games and the 2008 Beijing Olympics.  MIDEAST (Jerusalem) -- An Israeli air strike near Gaza City today killed two wanted Palestinians, including one that Israel had singled out as a top priority. An Israeli missile destroyed the car carrying Hasan al-Madhoun, 32, a senior figure in the Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades who had organized a suicide bombing and several other deadly attacks against Israelis in the past two years, according to the military. For the past 10 days, the Palestinian factions and the Israeli military have clashed repeatedly, with the Palestinians firing rockets from Gaza into southern Israel and the Israelis staging airstrikes in the coastal territory. By Greg Myre.  KYRGYZSTAN-UNREST (Moldovanovka, Kyrgyzstan) -- Special forces soldiers stormed prisons in this Central Asian nation today, restoring at least the appearance of order to a federal penitentiary system that had partly slipped from government control last month. Four prisoners were killed, the authorities said. By Ethan Wilensky Lanford and C.J. Chivers.  U.N.-HOLOCAUST (United Nations) -- The U.N.

NY-PRINCE (New York) -- Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, and his new wife visit New York. By Joyce Wadler.  ESSAY-EDUC (Undated) -- It is the bane of college admissions officers -- the highly polished, professionally edited personal essay that barely reflects the thinking or writing, let alone the personality, of a 17-year-old high school student. If it sounds like it was written by a 42-year-old attorney, chances are it was written by a 42-year-old attorney, said Lee Stetson, dean of admissions at the University of Pennsylvania. Now colleges have another tool to help them discern how much help students are getting on their applications -- the SAT. By Kate Stone Lombardi.  EDUCATION-COLUMN (Undated) -- A look at the lack of alignment between state and federal tests and the questions it raises about how accurate and useful all these testing and assessment systems are. For example, national test results say that fourth grade reading proficiency dropped in Florida, but the Florida state test show it going up substantially. The weekly column, by Michael Winerip.

, he said,	 Meanwhile, booksellers at the prize dinner grumbled that the novel was the least commercial of the six finalists (only 3,721 hardback copies had been sold before Booker night on Oct. 10; the total has since risen to just over 9,100). Banville subsequently appeared on a radio arts program with three critics who all, he said, hated his book. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, I wondered,	 The more I pondered it, the more outraged I became. At what point, I wondered, does something warrant Save The Date status instead of just a regular old no-warning invitation? Save The Dates, I began to think, were simply clogging up my mailbox and more than subtly suggesting that I would have no excuse for not going to an event, because I'd have plenty of time to get ready. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, I thought,	 Or were they? Who would know better than Peggy Post, I thought, as I dialed her home office in Florida. As the great-granddaughter-in-law of Emily Post, Peggy is, after all, one of the nation's pillars of politeness. She's the spokesperson for the Emily Post Institute, writes an Etiquette for Today column for Good Housekeeping, recently rewrote and revised Emily Post's Etiquette and does a whole lot of other things she probably won't tell you about because she's too polite to be boastful. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 What was the sin Galatoire's committed? Melvin Rodrigue, its general manager, announced recently that the restaurant hoped to open its first branch in November, in Baton Rouge. The flagship restaurant, he said, will reopen later, sometime early in the new year. That cut no ice with die-hards here, who looked askance at anything that might symbolize inadequate devotion to rebuilding New Orleans quickly and completely. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz

Uglesich's, one of the most beloved neighborhood places, closed before the storms; Austin Leslie, the fried-chicken wizard, was evacuated after Katrina struck and died in Atlanta. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz

As a result, so many people tuned in, 130,000 in one day, that the server crashed, Martinez said. We had to get a bigger server to accommodate more listeners.

, he said,	 In suburban communities like Pasadena, residents often fear that denser development will increase traffic. People make a fundamental mistake, Polyzoides said. They see them as purveyors of gridlock. But instead, he said, people who live near stores will more likely do their errands on foot, thereby reducing traffic. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, she said,	 The key thing is the way they integrate density very carefully into the neighborhood, said Gloria Ohland, a vice president of Reconnecting America who is based in Los Angeles. Because of the variety of architectural styles, she said, it looks like it could have been several projects. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz

, he insisted,	 Tuesday's results reassured some analysts that the company was on the right track.

COVER STORIES  TV-TELEMUNDO (Undated) -- Eduardo Porter reports on how Telemundo's move toward producing its telenovelas in-house is fostering a whole new Spanish-language TV industry centered on Miami.  With:  TV-TELENOVELAS (Undated) -- Telenovelas are booming because their appeal crosses generational lines: young Hispanics who mostly watch English-language TV will still tune in for telenovelas. By Mireya Navarro.  THEATER  THEATER-JERSEY-BOYS (New York) -- Jesse McKinley talks with John Lloyd Young, who is starring as Frankie Valli in Jersey Boys. opening Dec. 6 at the August Wilson Theater on Broadway.  HOLIDAY MOVIES  FILM-DAWSON-RENT (Los Angeles) -- It has been nearly two months since Rosario Dawson, who plays Mimi in the film adaptation of the musical Rent, opening Nov. 23, left her native New York for Los Angeles, and already she is sounding like a changed woman. By Lola Ogunnaike.  FILM-MATCH-POINT (Undated) -- A Q&amp;A with Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, a standout in Woody Allen's Match Point. By Sharon Waxman.  FILM-GEISHA (Los Angeles) -- The challenge was daunting for any Hollywood studio: an $80 million-plus historical romance, a wartime saga with no special effects or bursting bombs, and nothing to put in the toy store to merchandise -- no small consideration for executives accustomed to the ancillary revenue streams of family-fun franchises like Spider-Man. Then there was the little matter of race. The film version of Arthur Golden's novel, Memoirs of a Geisha, would, after all, require an all-Asian cast, something that Hollywood has rarely ventured, and never in a big-budget, epic love story. Small wonder, then, that it took eight long years for this best-selling book to make it to the screen. By David Halbfinger.  FILM-PRODUCERS (Undated) -- It's a scheme so crazy it just might work. Make a movie about a pair of disreputable Broadway producers out to make a killing by opening a surefire flop and stealing their investors' money. Turn said movie into a musical and open it on the real Broadway. Turn around and make a film of the musical of the film, adding a couple of Hollywood names, about $50 million in production frills and a healthy dollop of faith in the power of old-school musical comedy. That, in sum, is the story of The Producers, Version 3.0, which will open in New York on Dec. 16 and nationwide on Christmas Day. By Jesse McKinley.  FILM-NARNIA (Undated) -- At the beginning of 2001, Perry Moore embarked on a forbidding quest. Moore, an executive with an untested movie company called Walden Media, dispatched an impassioned letter to the chief executive of the C.S. Lewis Co., seeking movie rights to the much-loved Chronicles of Narnia fantasy novels. He vowed that Walden would be able to accomplish what one of the most prolific and successful producing teams in Hollywood -- Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall of Jurassic Park fame -- had already failed to do: turn The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, the first book published in the series, into a movie. Almost five years later, Moore's promise will be kept. By Lorne Manly.  FILM-PRIDE&amp;PREJUDICE (London) -- In Pride &amp; Prejudice, Matthew MacFadyen has a gentler take on Jane Austen's brooding romantic hero. By Sarah Lyall.  FILM-HANEKE-CACHE (Paris) --In photographs, Michael Haneke could easily pass for a taciturn philosophy professor weighed down by gloom and doom. Indeed, his movies are hardly more optimistic: Guilt and tension pervade the bleak stories he brings to the screen. It is something of a relief, then, to discover that this tall, bearded Austrian director, now 63, is talkative and can even be quite jolly. True, he is best known for dark tales like Funny Games and The Piano Teacher. And true, Haneke conceded, he could never make a comedy -- Don't ask a cobbler to make hats, he quipped. But, yes, he insisted, he does make movies to distract audiences and -- why not? -- to disturb them a little too. His latest movie, Cache (Hidden), the French-language psychological thriller that earned him the best director's prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival, does both. By Alan Riding.  Bestseller Lists  BESTSELLERS-HARD-L (Undated) -- Best-selling hardbacks, long-form list.  BESTSELLERS-HARD-S (Undated) -- Best-selling hardbacks, short-form list.  BESTSELLERS-PAPER-L (Undated) -- Best-selling paperbacks, long-form list.  BESTSELLERS-PAPER-S (Undated) -- Best-selling paperbacks, short-form list.  BESTSELLERS-CHILDREN (Undated) -- Best-selling children's books.  NOTEWORTHY-PAPERBACKS (Undated) -- Short summaries of other paperbacks.  ON-LANGUAGE (Undated) -- The weekly language column. By William Safire.  Editors, this column moves on the Monday or Tuesday before publication.  TRAVEL (t code)  TRAVEL-WILMA-MEXICO (Undated) -- In recovering from the devastation of Hurricane Wilma, hard-hit Mexican resorts like Cancun face two equally daunting challenges. The first, to physically restore and rebuild this part of Mexico's Caribbean coast, which was battered by torrential rains and winds of more than 110 mph for 60 hours, is expected to take at least several months. The second, to repair the public relations damage that was inflicted during the recovery process (or, according to some bitter vacationers, the lack thereof), could take much, much longer. By Elisabeth Malkin and James McKinley.  TRAVEL-ISRAEL-SPAS (Undated) -- Spas and Israel -- let alone relaxation and Israel -- might seem an unlikely pairing. Israelis are known for their aggressive driving, living and politics, in addition to the very real stress connected to terror and military maneuvers. But Israel has fully embraced the worldwide interest in spa vacations: Well beyond the famous Dead Sea mud, hotels across the country now offer spa services, and a number of full-service spas have opened or expanded over the last decade. By Sara Wildman.  TRAVEL-HOLYLAND (Undated) -- After the Palestinian intifada began in the fall of 2000, traveling to Israel became a statement of sorts. The Israeli tourism industry came to survive on a demographically narrowed but ideologically committed clientele: Christian pilgrims and American Jews. Leisure travel slowed to a trickle, with the overall number of visitors falling from a high of 2.8 million in 2000 to less than a million in 2002, according to the Israel Ministry of Tourism. But after half a decade of empty hotel rooms, Israel seems to be drawing diverse crowds once again. By Boris Fishman.  TRAVEL-SIERRA-LEONE (Undated) -- Sierra Leone is a stunningly beautiful place. But it is also a heartbreaking one. In Freetown, the capital, the signs of the 11-year civil war that ravaged this West African nation are everywhere. Children who had their limbs lopped off by rebel soldiers loiter on dusty trails. Garbage is piled high on the streets during the day, only to be set ablaze at night, providing the only light, as electricity is still rare. There is a reason this country has not yet found itself on the itinerary of even the most intrepid backpackers. Despite its beauty, it is very much on the edge of civilization. The civil war left at least 50,000 civilians dead. Children as young as 10 were forced into military conscription forming platoons called Small Boy Units, learning how to use an AK-47 before learning how to read. And most notoriously, during the later stages of the conflict, men, women and even children had their hands and legs amputated in a campaign of terror and violence. But it has been four years since the fighting ended and there is new hope within Sierra Leone. By Marc Santor.  Regular Features  PRACTICAL-TRAVELER (Undated) -- When everyday chemicals cause illness during travel. By Fred A. Bernstein.

, they said,	 Guinan said on Saturday that Elliott had agreed to pay him a percentage of his earnings from the book and would credit Guinan's creation in future editions. The two negotiated a settlement themselves, both said, sharing a desire to keep lawyers out of it. They were both surprised, they said, that at no point in the publication process did anyone at Miramax raise questions about the legal standing of Boilerplate. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, I guess,	 We had what we thought was a questionable call on the fumble that they decided not to review, I guess, Morriss said. You don't get a good clear answer as to what is and what isn't (reviewable). I can't ever seem to understand ... why they review what they do. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, they said,	 Addington has also played a central role in efforts to expand the legal authority of clandestine intelligence officers to detain and interrogate suspects in terrorism investigations, those officials said. Among other efforts, they said, he helped to shape an August 2002 opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel that said torture might be justified in some cases. In an unusual step, the White House formally repudiated the memorandum after it became public last year. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz

, he said,	 The new model creates different challenges, but certainly the revenues are there, Bois said, noting that larger vendors like IBM Corp. and Siebel Systems Inc. are moving to capitalize on the services model. If you capture the business upfront, you can get a stream of recurring revenue. At the same time, he said, services customers have fewer barriers to dropping a vendor than they do with licensed software. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz

Still, he said, building reserves of the pills makes sense - at least for now. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, they said,	 After poring over a sampling of Alito's 300 published opinions from his 15 years on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia, liberals painted a picture of a results-oriented conservative activist who has trampled on individual rights and made it more difficult for ordinary people to gain access to the courts. In some cases, they said, Alito fell to the right of Justice Antonin Scalia, one of the high court's staunchest conservatives. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, she said,	 The high court's opinion made it clear, she said, that those few women were the ones the lower court should have focused on to determine whether their rights were protected. O'Connor wrote in the case that women do not lose constitutional protection when they marry. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 Ciongoli defended Alito's decision, saying the case must be viewed in its historical context. It came at a time, he said, when the Supreme Court had issued a series of opinions in which O'Connor tried to devise a test for deciding when the government was interfering with a woman's ability to get an abortion. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 Consult with the leader so he can stop me from moving on this? What do you mean, consult him? Reid snapped, answering a reporter's question. The failure to move ahead with the Iraq investigation, he said, is a slap in the face to the American people. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, they said,	 Since then, Democrats complain, the intelligence panel has deliberately ignored the matter. Calling the executive session, they said, was the only way to force the Republicans' hand. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 In addition to those nonmilitary aspects of counterinsurgency, he said, it is essential in battling insurgents -- and in teaching tactics -- to attack militants as precisely as possible to avoid alienating large numbers of Iraqi civilians. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 Roberts denied he had done anything to slow the inquiry. In fact, he said, Intelligence Committee staff was aggressively working on what is known as the phase two intelligence inquiry, so named because the panel completed its initial work on the quality of the intelligence in July 2004. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, you know,	 I'm astounded by this, said Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., a former majority leader. I don't really know what the tenor of this is, or what is the justification for it, and why this extreme, you know, approach was used. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, she says,	 Patti Freeman Evans, an analyst with JupiterResearch, doesn't think that will stop the trend toward marketing free shipping. Freeman Evans says some online retailers have been emphasizing fuel savings in their pitches, including eBags, which specializes in purses, with e-mails that talk about paying too much at the pump. Higher shipping costs may squeeze margins, she says, but many companies will manage it. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz

, I think,	 I anticipate we're going to hit a stride and play very well over the course of the season, Jackson said. But we may not be able to jump out in November and get to that stride, I think, from what I've seen to this point, when the gun sounds. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz

If necessary, he said, the bowl can dip into its reserves to meet expenses, which include payouts of about $14 million to each of the participating teams. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 It has fallen on his father, S. Muthulingam, to seek his release. Relentlessly, the father has gone to the police, only to be told to talk to the Tigers directly. He has gone to the Monitoring Mission, to be offered the same advice. He has written to at least nine foreign embassies; only the Netherlands has bothered to respond, he said, suggesting that he turn to the Red Cross. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, she said,	 All that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act did, she said, was to give every religious organization, minority and majority, the opportunity to go into court and make their claim. She said the government's position was fundamentally and structurally incompatible with the statute. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz

, they charged,	 About half of the stranded tourists ended up in emergency shelters, while others fled the area or managed to get rooms at low-rate hotels downtown. Those trying to leave after found the Cancun airport was wrecked. After days of living on tuna fish and crackers, dozens of angry tourists said they were disgusted with tour companies and hotels, which, they charged, failed to warn them about the storm, then, after it was over, gave them little or no information. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz

, we swam,	 On the beach in Sierra Leone, the bonfire was growing. Aside from our group, made up mostly of U.N. and relief workers, there was no sign of human activity for miles. The perfect white sand, the pounding of the waves, the burnt sky that felt close enough to touch -- it was ours alone. When the sun was gone and the moon was bright, we swam, and each stroke was illuminated by brilliant phosphorescence. It was like Hawaii without the tourists. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 Franco came to Sierra Leone in the 1960s for the scuba diving, he said. An acquaintance of Jacques Cousteau, he found his bit of paradise and never left. During the war, he was beaten up by soldiers and decided to wait out the fighting by spending most of his time offshore on his boat. The rebels, he said, don't swim. Luckily, it is not necessary to communicate with Franco to have a fabulous dinner. He keeps a refrigerator stocked with a wide variety of French and Italian wines and makes a savory fish carpaccio with fish caught that day ($10 to $15 for a meal with a bottle of wine). </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, she said,	 Last year, Mary Lamielle, of Voorhees, N.J., traveled to Washington for a business meeting. Her room at the Grand Hyatt was perfect, she recalled. But when she ventured into the conference area, she experienced vertigo and breathing problems, which she believed were caused by chlorinated water in the hotel's decorative pools. Within a day she was so sick, she said, that she couldn't attend the session she had organized on healthy housing for people with disabilities. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, she said,	 Lamielle said that sufferers are best off finding a hotel that they can tolerate and sticking with it. In Washington, she said, she generally chooses the Capital Hilton, where her linens and towels are washed in baking soda before her arrival. She asks for a room away from renovation work (which often involves chemical compounds) and on a corner, where there are more windows: Not that the D.C. air is so great, but sometimes it's best to let the inside air dissipate, she said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, she said,	 She added that with a couple of exceptions, hotels have been willing to answer her questions about their use of chemicals. But those instances of a lack of cooperation, she said, illustrate a need to educate the hospitality industry to the requirements of chemically sensitive travelers. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, she added,	 It helps, she added, that those needs overlap the preferences of millions of Americans who don't have the disease. There are plenty of other people who, when they open the door to a hotel room, don't want to smell perfume, she said. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20051101.0341 type=story > <HEADLINE> IN ISRAEL, TOURISTS START TO WALK AMONG THE PILGRIMS </HEADLINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, she explained,	 Intrigued by the holistic options, which seemed to be offerings at a number of spas, I persuaded her to perform spiritual energy healing. Noa was leery; she prefers to do energy healing only with her regular clients who come from Tiberias or Rosh Pina. For the most part, she explained, plying me with mint-infused water after our session, Vered Hagalil guests come for relaxation: the hot stones or Thai massages, occasionally reiki or reflexology. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, she explained,	 The spa itself is the draw. At quarter to each hour, terry-robed spa-goers begin to congregate in the sunny room that faces the indoor pool, waiting for their treatments. At the hour mark, the specialists emerge, also dressed in white, whispering the names of their charges, who shuffle up to meet them. My first afternoon I had Liat, a facialist from Haifa, who talked to me about the guests who came to Carmel during the intifada -- mostly religious people, she explained, if they were foreign, or Israelis. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz

And what people here routinely call the hunger season has barely begun. Malawi is the epicenter of Africa's second hunger crisis in five months, and the second in which the developed world has responded with painful slowness. More than 4.6 million of Malawi's 12 million citizens need donated food to fend off malnutrition until the next harvest begins in April. In Zimbabwe, at least 4 million more need emergency food aid. Zambia's government issued an urgent appeal for food on Wednesday, while 850,000 need food in Mozambique; 500,000 in Lesotho at least 300,000 in Swaziland. By Michael Wines.  With photo and map.

ESSAY-EDUC (Undated) -- It is the bane of college admissions officers -- the highly polished, professionally edited personal essay that barely reflects the thinking or writing, let alone the personality, of a 17-year-old high school student. If it sounds like it was written by a 42-year-old attorney, chances are it was written by a 42-year-old attorney, said Lee Stetson, dean of admissions at the University of Pennsylvania. Now colleges have another tool to help them discern how much help students are getting on their applications -- the SAT. By Kate Stone Lombardi.  EDUCATION-COLUMN (Undated) -- A look at the lack of alignment between state and federal tests and the questions it raises about how accurate and useful all these testing and assessment systems are. For example, national test results say that fourth grade reading proficiency dropped in Florida, but the Florida state test show it going up substantially. The weekly column, by Michael Winerip.  FINANCIAL  (Coded f)  HYDROGEN-CAR (Los Angeles) -- You would never guess that Jon Spallino drives what is probably the most expensive car in this city known for automotive excess. Or that he is the world's most technologically advanced commuter. He was at the wheel of his silver Honda FCX, a car worth about $1 million that looks like a cross between a compact -- say, a Volkswagen Golf -- and a cinder block. The FCX is powered by hydrogen fuel cells, the futuristic technology that many automakers see as an eventual solution to the world's energy woes, though their viability is a subject of vigorous debate inside and outside the auto industry. By Danny Hakim  BRITAIN-CAPITALISM (London) -- It had been a sinew of empire, a shipping line that ferried soldiers and diplomats, even royalty, on the Victorian mail runs that tied Britain to its outposts far to the east and beyond. But when the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co. became the object of a likely bidding war on Monday after a takeover approach from Dubai Ports World, it seemed as if the 165-year-old company might be heading the same way as so many other onetime jewels in the British economic crown -- into foreign hands. And, as P&amp;O stock has soared on speculation that Danish and Hong Kong contenders might enter the bidding, pushing the price above $5 billion, the contest invited perhaps a more philosophical question: what makes Britain so relaxed about selling companies to outsiders in a way that many in continental Europe -- France, Italy and Germany in particular -- seem reluctant to emulate? By Alan Cowell and Heather Timmons.  SMART-ELEVATORS (New York) -- Elevators of the future have started to arrive in New York. At the Marriott Marquis, for instance, riders will no longer have to cope with a widespread pet peeve: doors that open at floor after floor once the car is full. By Fred A. Bernstein.  COPPER-MARKETPLACE (London) -- For much of the year, copper prices climbed steadily, driven by a housing boom in the United States and demand from the rapidly industrializing economies of India and China. Supply disruptions further fed the price gains. If that sounds similar to the story of crude oil futures this year, it should. Like oil, copper has attracted a wave of new money from hedge funds and other big investors seeking to ride the rally. But with the copper rally stuttering in recent weeks, and prices down as much as 3 percent from their October highs, some analysts and investors say they see signs that a bubble is about to burst.

PANASONIC-AD-COLUMN (New York) -- Panasonic is betting that offbeat characters called Oxymites can help pull off a mighty feat: persuade younger consumers to buy a new brand of battery. To introduce the battery, Oxyride, which promises to deliver more power than alkaline batteries in devices like digital cameras, the North American unit of the Panasonic Corp. is rolling out a campaign featuring several nontraditional elements. The campaign, which began last week, has a budget estimated at $5 million to $10 million. By Stuart Elliott.

He's considered the father of Kenyan distance running, having won five cross country world championships before converting to the marathon. He set the world record in 2003 in Berlin, but he might not be in top form anymore; he dropped out of two marathons in England recently because of an injury. By John Eligon.

BANVILLE-BOOKER-PRIZE (Dublin, Ireland) -- Not everyone was thrilled by the decision last month to give the Man Booker Prize to The Sea, by the Irish novelist John Banville. For starters, two of the five Booker judges vehemently preferred another book, Kazuo Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go. But all this is grist for the mill to the author himself, who seems to relish a good literary dust-up, or at least not to mind being at the center of one. Frankly, I am gratified to see myself vilified and the jury being vilified, he said happily over lunch recently. It cheers me up. I must have done something right to annoy so many people. By Sarah Lyall.  HESSE-EXHIBIT (Undated) -- The Hesses, best known to Americans for supplying mercenaries to England's George III, have one of the best art troves in Germany. But unlike some German princely families, like the Hanovers who are selling things at Sotheby's this fall, they are striving to keep this collection together. On Saturday in Oregon, Americans will get a taste of these riches when the Portland Museum of Art opens Hesse: A Princely German Collection, presenting more than 400 paintings, decorative objects, an elaborate gilt bronze Schinkel centerpiece, a carriage, etc. The star of the show is Holbein's Madonna, which has never been seen on these shores and rarely outside Germany since at least the 19th century.

HINDU-MULSIM-HOLIDAYS (Undated) -- This week, in a rare coincidence of calendars, Hindus and Muslims from all over India, Pakistan and Bangladesh are celebrating their most joyous holidays of the year. Hindus observe Diwali and Muslims end Ramadan with Eid ul-Fitr. And both holidays are utterly soaked in sugar. Festive piles of pink, green, yellow, orange and white sweets, some shimmering with silver leaf, others snowy with shreds of coconut or crunchy with nuggets of pistachio, are integral to many religious celebrations and social rituals in South Asia. But these sweets, called mithai by Indians, have an almost religious significance in everyday life. By Julia Moskin.  With recipe.  NEW-ORLEANS-DINING (Oxford, Miss.) -- Officially, the theme of the eighth annual Southern Foodways Symposium that ended here at the University of Mississippi on Sunday, was the region's lasting love affair with sugar and sweets. But like other people in the American food world, the 250 people in attendance talked mostly about New Orleans and the Gulf Coast and their culinary future. John T. Edge, the director of the Southern Foodways Alliance, which runs the symposium, said he was confident that nearly all the nationally known New Orleans restaurants would eventually reopen. What troubles him, he said, is the po' boy shops, oyster bars, red-beans-and-rice joints and other mom-and-pop businesses that have given New Orleans dining so much of its zest. For every bit of cheerful news about a restaurant reopening, there were worried questions, especially about the small, often black-owned places in hard-hit parts of town. By R.W.

But as the new world of flavor has evolved over the last 40 years, the simple chicken may have changed more than anything else on the American dinner table.

"159757"	"I"	"think"	" And that is because of the light. The Pantheon is defined by its oculus, a bright opening in the center of the dome. It renders the space an inside-out sundial: the shaft of light that shines through the oculus slowly moves across the dome over the course of the day. A well-trained eye can tell the month and the hour by the slant of light -- but not, I think, the year. Time collapses inside the Pantheon. While most Roman architectural achievements are meant to communicate the civilization's mastery over nature, the Pantheon maintains a deep connection to it, to the essential elements of light and sky. Rain pours through the oculus and collects in a drain in the center of the floor, as does snow, on the rare and wonderful occasions when it snows in Rome. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"

SKOREA-CLONE (Seoul, South Korea) -- South Korea's pioneering stem cell scientist apologized on Thursday that two members of his team had donated their egg cells for research, saying his rush to advance science may have clouded his ethical judgment. Hwang Woo-suk, who became a hero in South Korea after major developments in cloning research, has been caught in a swirl of allegations over his work after a U.S. collaborator left the group, saying Hwang unethically procured human eggs. Hwang also said he was stepping down as the head of a global stem cell hub, established last month in South Korea. (Summary from wires) By Choe Sang-Hun.

CHINA-WATER (Harbin, China) -- The Chinese government on Thursday blamed the country's biggest oil company for a pollution spill that allowed a 50-mile slick of toxic benzene to reach this northern city of almost 4 million people. In an increasingly unwashed and unflushed city, residents continued to stockpile bottled drinking water on the second day after authorities shut down the municipal water system and stopped pumping from the Songhua River to minimize the risk of poisoning.

RUSSIA-NGOS (Moscow) -- President Vladimir V.

Putin said he would consult with parliamentary leaders on new legislation that would place all private organizations under strict state control and threaten others with closure. The continuing financing of the political activity from abroad should be, I think, in the state's field of vision, he said in remarks broadcast on state television, especially if this financing is carried out through the state channels of other countries and these or those organizations functioning in our country and involved in the political activity are, in fact, used as a tool of the foreign policy of other states.

THANKSGIVING-PARADE (New York) -- Two people were injured Thursday at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade as it traveled through Times Square after a gust of wind sent a giant balloon crashing into a lamppost along the crowded parade route, knocking the lamp onto spectators below. One of the injured, a 26-year-old woman who witnesses said was struck on the back of the head and the shoulder by a falling lamp, was taken to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. Her 11-year-old sister, who was watching the parade from a wheel chair, appeared to have less serious injuries, the police and witnesses said.

FINANCIAL (f code)  EURO-ECON (Frankfurt, Germany) -- The European Central Bank has settled the debate over when it plans to tighten credit in Europe, signaling a rate increase next week. The debate over whether it should do so rages on. On Thursday, an influential survey of German businesses reported a larger-than-expected decline in confidence in November, suggesting that Europe's biggest economy, while growing, remains fragile. That followed two other troubling economic reports on the Continent - one showing a decline in consumer spending in France last month, the other a drop in business confidence in Belgium. Taken together, these indicators seem to challenge one of the European Central Bank's key justifications for its first interest-rate increase in five years: that Europe is finally on a sustainable growth path. By Mark Landler.  TRADE-TALKS-LAMY (Hong Kong) -- The new director general of the World Trade Organization, Pascal Lamy, faces global trade talks that are deadlocked. Lamy does not even plan to propose a comprehensive agreement before trade ministers from 149 nations and customs territories gather here on Dec. 13. Instead, he intends to issue a fairly broad outline of where the different sides stand on a range of issues. By Keith Bradsher.  FRANCE-NORRIS-COLUMN (Undated) -- The weekly column: French investors take hope. Maybe the Socialists will bail you out of your folly and buy back the shares you so eagerly purchased. The largest initial public offering in Europe this year, Electricite de France, raised 7 billion euros, or $8.2 billion. It reinforced stereotypes of French workers and disappointed the buyers of shares in France's dominant electric utility. French capitalism is, of course, a little different from the Anglo-Saxon variety. In the United States, employees celebrate when their companies sell shares to the public, hoping that will make them rich. In France, the workers stage protests. By Floyd Norris.  RUSSIA-OIL (Moscow) -- The Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft on Thursday reported a huge jump in profit of about 600 percent for the first half of 2005, reflecting its takeover last year of the largest production unit of the private Yukos company.

GRAND-CAYMAN-REBUILD (Undated) -- The worst of this year's horrific crop of Atlantic storms brought only heavy rain and some wind gusts to the island of Grand Cayman. But in 2004 Ivan damaged or destroyed 74 percent of the homes and left $3 billion in damage and losses. While this year's hurricane victims are still mopping up, Grand Cayman is a study in the recovery process on a resort island heavily dependent on its beauty and tourist allure. By Michelle Higgins.

FEATURES  NUTCRACKER-BALLET (New York) -- The Nutcracker, a ritual of the holiday season, is still handsomely sustained by the New York City Ballet. The little girls of our childhood are there (or their children or maybe even grandchildren), dressed up and bright-eyed and eagerly expectant. A few years ago one of those little girls was mine. There are beautiful children on the stage, too, part of the horde of youngsters that George Balanchine -- recalling his own childhood in St. Petersburg in the late 19th century -- choreographed into the production. Year after year, in town after town, that twinkling Christmas tree rising to gigantic heights, or the dizzying onslaught of snow at the end of the first act, or the elegance of the Sugar Plum Fairy and her Cavalier and the Dewdrop -- and all the charming dancers of the delicious treats (hot chocolate, coffee, tea, candy cane, marzipan, ginger) -- awaken wonder in children and their parents alike.

XBOX (Undated) -- There is a saying in technology circles, often delivered with rueful respect, that if you give the folks at Microsoft enough chances, they will eventually deliver a compelling result. They did it with spreadsheets. They did it with Web browsers. And now, with the new Xbox 360, the Bill Gates team has delivered a legitimately excellent gaming and home media system. Certainly, the graphics are incredibly detailed, lifelike and vivid, far beyond anything on the current generation of game consoles.

, he notes,	 The bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, has invoked the specter of rising inflation as the main reason to lift rates from 2 percent -- a level, he notes, that is historically low. Inflation in Europe is running at roughly 2.3 percent, above the bank's threshold of 2 percent. Some economists, however, forecast that it will fall back below 2 percent by next summer. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he added,	 The bank's plan to raise rates, probably by a quarter-point, when it meets on Dec. 1 is a done deal, said Lorenzo Codogno, an economist at Bank of America in London.

, he argues,	 This all changed after World War I, he argues, as it became clear that a system of selection focused solely on scholastic performance would lead to the admission of increasing numbers of Jewish students, most of them of eastern European background. This development, he notes, occurred in the midst of one of the most reactionary moments in American history, when the nationwide movement to restrict immigration was gaining momentum and anti-Semitism was on the rise, and the Big Three administrators began to worry that the presence of 'too many' Jews would in fact lead to the departure of Gentiles. Their conclusion, in Karabel's words: given the dependence of the Big Three on the Protestant upper class for both material resources and social prestige, the 'Jewish problem' was genuine, and the defense of institutional interests required a solution that would prevent 'WASP flight.' </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he notes,	 Karabel reports that on the eve of President John F. Kennedy's election, the three schools were still de facto segregated institutions -- less than 1 percent black and, in the case of Princeton, enrolling just 1 African-American freshman in a class of 826. And while anti-Semitism was officially taboo, he notes, Harvard rejected three-quarters of the applicants from the Bronx High School of Science and Stuyvesant that year (compared to just 31 percent from Exeter and Andover) while Yale limited the Jewish presence in the freshman class to one student in eight. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he added,	 Reading those publications is what middle America does to live out its dreams, said Staffen, whose agency is part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners division of Havas.

, he said,	 Stefano Silvestri, president of Italy's Institute for International Affairs, described the closing as a good coup for Berlusconi before the elections, though he doubted that politics played a role in the decision. Rather, he said, it represents a dimension of the end of the Cold War, noting that the United States has little use for nuclear submarines in its effort to curb terrorism.

AXA-IMAGES (New York) -- In 1515 the German artist Albrecht Deurer made a woodcut of a rhinoceros, an ominous-looking creature with a sharply pointed horn on its snout. Duerer had never seen the real thing; neither had most other Europeans. But his widely distributed image, conjured up from descriptions of an actual beast, served as definitive in Europe for more than 200 years. The Duerer distortion is one example of the power of printed illustrations, fantastical or not, in forming public concepts. It is among nearly 90 works by artists and other image-makers, from William Blake to the Flash Gordon comic strip artist Alex Raymond to NASA, that appear at the AXA Gallery in Imagined Worlds: Willful Invention and the Printed Image 1470-2005.

BOLIVIA-COCA (Chipiriri, Bolivia) -- In nearly 50 years of growing coca, Jose Torrico has seen army soldiers swarm across his fields to pull up his plants and heard threats from successive Bolivian governments determined to destroy his crop. And like thousands of other coca farmers Torrico has refused to stop growing coca, the main ingredient in cocaine. Now, after years of persistence, he and his fellow farmers say they are eagerly anticipating the advent of a new era, one in which growing coca will finally be made legal again. That is, they say, if Evo Morales is elected president on Dec. 18. Morales, a one-time leader of the coca-growers federation, is revered by the left around Latin American as an unbending opponent of globalization. That is worrisome enough to the Bush administration. But more alarming is that a man American officials accuse of promoting coca farming -- annation.  IRAN-FILMMAKER (Tehran, Iran) -- For years, Massoud Dehnamaki was known widely as the feared enforcer of conservative rules that restricted freedom for women and society. In recent years, however, he has emerged as Iran's Michael Moore, having directed a documentary on the taboo issue of prostitution and another forthcoming film on soccer as a metaphor of political struggle. Reformists and conservatives alike harshly criticized Dehnamaki for making the first movie, Poverty and Prostitution. Conservatives were furious that one of their own had not only highlighted an un-Islamic social pathology but seemed to sympathize with the prostitutes. Reformists believed he deliberately exaggerated the problem to make a case against easing Islamic law. In an interview, Dehnamaki said both camps had gotten it wrong, and denied that his views had undergone a radical transformation. The Saturday profile, by Nazila Fathi.

People have been known to drive 90 miles to hear the slight 33-year-old read from the Torah and lead prayers. That Kassoff is so popular is less a testament to her wisdom and insight -- though her congregants agree she has both -- than it is to her availability. This year, Kassoff will travel to 28 temples in 12 states throughout the South to provide leadership to small-town congregations, some with fewer than a dozen members. Although visiting rabbis are not uncommon, Kassoff is believed to be the only full-time circuit rabbi in the United States. By Brenda Goodman.

CALIF-WILLIAMS-HOUSE (Los Angeles) -- In 1936, Paul Revere Williams, one of Southern California's preeminent architects, designed the Morris Landau house in Holmby Hills, a neighborhood where he, as an African American, would not have been permitted to live. The Landau house, named after the South African merchant who commissioned it, passed from owner to owner, among them the former Los Angeles Kings impresario Bruce McNall, and Revlon's chairman, Ronald O. Perelman. When it became clear that the house would be an impediment to the expansion plans of its current owner, the elite prep school Harvard-Westlake, preservationists and neighborhood residents joined forces with school officials to find a buyer willing to move the 10,000 square-foot structure to a location in Pasadena.

THEATER-SHUBERT (New York) -- Somewhere inside the offices of the Shubert there's an 81-year-old man who may know the answer to the biggest question on Broadway. His name is Gerald Schoenfeld and he is by most accounts the most powerful person in American theater. Schoenfeld is the chairman of the Shubert Organization, the largest Broadway theater chain. He took over sole leadership of the organization in 1996, when Bernard B. Jacobs, its president, died.

Meanwhile the music industry is cranking out thousands of new CD's each year and only the luckiest new artists will manage to score a spot on a radio playlist. What you might need is someone to open doors. A trusted ally who could put his arm around you and introduce you to his friends. Say, a million or so of them.

And she would not be embarrassed, she said, to insist that a man submit to the test. I really think we've got what they want, she explained. And if they want it, they can have it on our terms.

, he contends,	 But Medina did not really make all that money. Instead, he contends, he was a conduit for his employer, Olympic Painting &amp; Roofing, which made payments through Medina, who was on the books, to a dozen other employees who were not. Time sheets and copies of checks reviewed by the Globe show that the owner of Olympic, George Vasiliades, gave Medina checks to cover the whole team's wages. Medina then wrote personal checks to the workers he oversaw, some of whom he says were undocumented immigrants, and none of whom, he added, are in the company's official records. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz

The dead man had not even gone to trial, yet most of the people I heard from at the time believed that he got what he deserved.

, he said,	 According to Washington's testimony, she and Jackson danced and shared a bottle of champagne at the Roxy, but later got into an argument. Washington said Jamal shoved her, so she left the club. Shawn Davis was waiting outside, and the two of them shared a cab back to her salon, where they retreated to a small bedroom in the back. Howard also arrived there sometime after 2 a.m. because, he said, he had misplaced his keys to his aunt's house where he was staying. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz

Sharon, who viewed Jamal's body, wanted to know how it was that her brother used excessive force, which accounted for Howard's self-defense plea, when it was Jamal's body, she said, that was covered with scratches and bruises. No one else had a mark on them, she said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 Sox pitching coach Dave Wallace worked with Mota in the Los Angeles organization. It's always great to acquire depth in your bullpen, said Wallace. He's got an excellent fastball and a swing-and-miss changeup that is a bit unconventional in that he turns it over and he has good movement on it. He set up for Eric Gagne for us and he did a great job with us for a couple of years. We had Mota, Paul Quantrill, and Gagne, and we had one of the best bullpens in the National League. I know he had elbow inflammation last year in Florida, so hopefully that's behind him. He's a good setup man and if your closer has gone three or four days, he can close for you. He's a quiet guy on a team, a converted infielder, so he doesn't have the wear and tear on his arm that guys his age would normally have. Wallace has had experience with pitchers like Beckett who have had recurring blisters. I had Ismael Valdes in Los Angeles and he got them all the time, said Wallace. It's one of those situations you have to manage. I don't know that there's a dermatologist around who has a cure or else the problem would have been solved. Maybe it's the humidity in Florida. I don't know if pitching up here will help that situation. But we're happy to have Josh, who's a quality young pitcher. Wallace, who has been apprised by the front office of all moves concerning pitchers, said he's flattered to be asked for his input. Asked whether he'd throw his hat into the ring for GM, he said, No, I don't think so. I'm glad to help whoever gets the job. If they wanted me to do it in a pinch and needed me to be the GM on a temporary basis, I would certainly help in that regard. But not for the long term. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz

, I mean,	 There's definitely a little bit of a connection, said Tim, the 27-year-old backup to Eli Manning for the Giants. The difference for those guys, I mean, Peyton was the No. 1 overall pick. There were so many comparisons because his father played quarterback. And then Eli, being the No. 1 pick, and all the drama around that. For us, it was different. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz

EXP-CASPIAN-STURGEON (Nardaran, Azerbaijan) -- No resource is more richly associated with the Caspian basin than the sturgeon -- its briny eggs are among the most valuable wildlife commodities on earth. International and domestic regulations are in place to protect the surviving stock, but the region's manifest lawlessness and graft undermine rules to the point of uselessness. By C.J.

EXP-WHITEHOUSE-LETTER (Washington) -- Steve Schmidt, 35, is more of a subtle tactician than his appearance suggests.

People like Gitai's father, who died when the filmmaker was 20, created a visual memory for Israel in modern terms and shaped the imagery of the future state, Gitai said. In some sense, he concedes, that's what he is trying to do with his films, both fictional and documentary, in a more complicated society.

SCI-MOUNT-ST-HELENS (Undated) -- Mount St. Helens is quietly erupting, and for the scientists at the volcano observatory there, the past year has been an unexpected bonanza, one that is giving them new insight into Mount St. Helens, the youngest and most active of the volcanoes in the Cascades Mountains, and perhaps into the 60 other volcanoes on the United States mainland that have erupted in the past 10,000 years and are thus presumed to have the potential to erupt again. By Kenneth Chang.  With photo and graphic.  SCI-CANCER-STRESS (Undated) -- The question of whether there is a link between stress and cancer has puzzled and intrigued researchers as well as patients. Study after study has asked whether people who developed cancer had more stress in the years before the diagnosis, and conversely, whether people who experienced extreme stress were more likely to develop cancer. What has emerged is a tenuous connection between stress, the immune system and cancer, with a surprising new insight that is changing the direction of research: It now appears that cancer cells make proteins that actually tell the immune system to let them alone and even to help them grow. By Gina Kolata.  Second in a series, Preventing Cancer. The first article discussed whether diet matters in prevention. Later ones will look at the effects of stress and the roles of genetics and the immune system.  With photo and graphic.  SCI-ATHLETES (Undated) -- Athletes on a hot streak often describe warps in space-time that even Einstein did not anticipate: basketball hoops appearing as wide as hula-hoops, tennis balls that seem to move in slow motion, golf outings in which the cups seem as easy to hit as open manholes. Now an experiment at the University of Virginia suggests that the changes in perception are apparently real, if sometimes exaggerated. A short, by Benedict Carey.  SCI-ANSETH-TISSUE (Undated) -- A Conversation With feature on Kristi S. Anseth, professor of chemical and biological engineering at the University of Colorado. She discusses the barriers she is breaking in tissue engineering. In terms of progress, she says, products for tissue in the cartilage, bones and skin are likely to be available within 5 to 10 years. Major progress, like treatments for Parkinson's disease and diabetes, will be available within her lifetime. By Claudia Dreifus.  With photo.  SCI-Q&amp;A (Undated) -- A science question answered: How long does it take for a fractured skull to heal? By C. Claiborne Ray.  SCI-INSECTS (Undated) -- In the annals of life, insects are one of the great success stories. A little over 400 million years ago, their six-legged ancestors came out of the water onto dry land. They have evolved into an estimated 5 million living species -- dwarfing the diversity of all other animals combined. Even if you throw in all the known species of plants, fungi and protozoans, insects still win. And that path to progress began when they started sprouting wings. By Carl Zimmer.  With photo.  SCI-WATCH (Undated) -- News and notes on science: Ants lay down chemical do not enter cues to keep other ants off paths that don't lead to food; removal of selection pressure causes adaptation in African village weaverbirds; 11 migratory species added to endangered list. By Henry Fountain.  With  SCI-MOON-FORMATION (Undated) -- Using a new technique, scientists have obtained a more precise date for the formation of the moon after the earth was struck by an object the size of Mars. The impact and ensuing crystallization of the moon occurred from 4.517 billion to 4.537 billion years ago, which is 30 million to 50 million years after the solar system was formed. A short, by Henry Fountain.  SCI-NANOTECH-RISK (Undated) -- As nanotechnology research explodes, the much smaller field that investigates the technology's possible risks is also growing. The primary worry about the potential health and safety risks of nanotechnology is simply that far too little is known about the behavior of the tiny nanoscale materials in various environments. A short, by Barnaby J. Feder.  With photo.  SCI-TYLENOL-RISK (Undated) -- A consumer column: Despite more than a decade of research showing that taking too much of a popular pain reliever can ruin the liver, the number of severe, unintentional poisonings from the drug is on the rise, a new study indicates. The drug, acetaminophen, is best known under the brand name Tylenol. But many consumers don't realize that the medicine is also found in widely varying doses in several hundred other common cold remedies and combination pain relievers. By Deborah Franklin.  SCI-REALLY (Undated) -- The claim: Green tea helps prevent cancer. The facts: .... By Anahad O'Connor.  SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) -- News and notes on health and medicine. By Nicholas Bakalar:  -- Progression: Drugs for high cholesterol may slow the progression of Alzheimer's.  -- Patterns: Extended breast-feeding appears to lower the risk of Type 2 diabetes for the mother.  -- Testing: Drinking decaffeinated coffee can raise the level of LDL, the bad cholesterol associated with cardiovascular disease risk, new research suggests.  -- Twins: Researchers in Scotland have found that twins have substantially lower IQ's than their singleton siblings, based on a sampling of more than 10,000 Scottish children born in the 1950s.  SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) -- The Personal Health column: Unless there is a drastic change in the way research is organized, the only hope for people with rare disorders is that one of the few researchers exploring a disease will stumble on a way help. The plight of a young woman with a fatal lung disease known as LAM, for lymphangioleiomyomatosis, illustrates the point. By Jane E. Brody.  SCI-FEELING-THIN (Undated) -- Within seconds, people could actually feel their waists begin to shrink. It would have been a great advance in the world of weight loss -- if only it had been real. But the shrinking feeling was just an illusion, created by scientists who wanted to study how the brain creates body image, people's perceptions of their own size and shape. The British researchers fooled 17 people into feeling as if they were getting skinnier by outfitting them with gadgets that stimulated a tendon in each wrist to create the false sensation that both hands were moving inward.

, he said,	 Besides, Harrison said, the script he eventually wrote bears little resemblance to Lux Vide's original version, which he said was a little too liturgical. When he arrived in Rome last June, he said, he spent two days talking to Ettore Bernabei, who has pretty firm opinions about Catholicism, Christianity, politics, and all of it. I realized that either they were going to trust me to make the movie or I was going to have to patch things together and make some coordinated effort to please everybody, and that wouldn't be any fun at all. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz

, he added,	 At the same time, a debate has roiled the American Psychological Association. The organization is unequivocally opposed to torture of any kind, its ethics director Stephen Behnke emphasized in a recent interview. However, he added, the American Psychological Association has approached this issue with an appreciation of its complexity. That means, for example, setting up a task force to look at the psychological research literature to determine which interrogation techniques are most effective-a decision that some of the association's members see as sullying the whole profession by associating it with breaking people rather than helping to cure them. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he says,	 According to Jonathan Moreno, a bioethicist at the University of Virginia who is writing a book on neuroscience and national security, there has also been a renewal of interest on the part of the Pentagon in truth drugs. Instead of hallucinogens, he says, the focus is on compounds that disarm the subject by targeting the levels of neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin. We may be getting to the point, Moreno says, where you could actually administer a drug with a protein that helps to stimulate a certain neural center, and that might create an attitude of confidence and trust and low stress in the person being interrogated. It would be much faster than doing it the old-fashioned good cop/bad cop way. It would also, Moreno argues, be more humane, or at least more gently coercive. (Many psychiatrists and neuroscientists are skeptical about the possibilities for such drugs.) </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he argues,	 There are, Kassin readily concedes, fundamental differences between criminal and military interrogations. The former are meant to elicit confession, the latter to extract information. In both, though, reliability is important, and in both, he argues, coercion leads to unreliable information. Everyone has a breaking point. You can certainly get people to talk. But interrogators, he argues, are not nearly as good at determining if what they're getting is true or not. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he believes,	 For Grodin, the answer is simple. It's bad. Don't do it. Just say no. There needs to be, he believes, a bright line and a big wall between using psychiatry as an agent of the state versus using psychiatry to benefit patients. A psychiatrist is a doctor, and a doctor's Hippocratic oath, he argues, makes the choice clear. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he emphasizes,	 Kassin is less categorical. Part of this may reflect the fact that he is a psychologist, not a psychiatrist. I don't define psychology as a mental health profession, he says. I define psychology as the science of human behavior. But, he emphasizes, there is a social as well as scientific benefit in his work. In interrogations, he believes, effective and humane may not in the end be contradictory. His job is to figure out how. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, they say,	 New Hampshire political observers say it is unclear whether Ayotte, who is appointed by the governor with the approval of an executive council, has aspirations for elected office.

Until now, he said, using the technique on lunar rocks has been a problem. That's because cosmic radiation bombarding the airless moon converts another element in the rocks, tantalum, into the same tungsten isotope. So it's impossible to tell how much tungsten came from the hafnium. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz

An Egyptian town where the local Imam, a member of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, won a parliamentary seat, defeating the incumbent member of Mubarak's dominant party.

TEEN-REPELLENT (Barry, Wales) -- When Howard Stapleton was 12 and visiting a factory with his father, they came to a room where workers were using high-frequency welding equipment, and he found he could not bear to go inside. The noise! he complained. What noise? the grownups asked. Now 39, Stapleton has taken the lesson he learned that day -- that children can hear sounds at higher frequencies than adults can -- to fashion a novel device that he hopes will provide a solution to the eternal problem of obstreperous teenagers who hang around outside stores and cause trouble. The device, called the Mosquito, emits a high-frequency pulsing sound that, he says, can be heard by most people younger than 20 and almost no one older than 30. A journal by Sarah Lyall.

Despite the prejudiced arguments of anticlerical Enlightenment thinkers, free inquiry and faith in human reason were intrinsic to Christian thought. Christianity, alone among the world's religions, conceived of God as a supremely rational being who created a coherent world whose inner workings could be discovered through the application of reason and logic. Consequently, it was only in the West, rather than in Asia or the Middle East, that alchemy evolved into chemistry, astrology into astronomy. </P> 	nyt_eng_200512.gz

The church of piety, run by dedicated, poorly paid and ascetic clergy, gave way to the church of power, which was far less likely to impede the growth of commerce. Had the church of piety prevailed, he writes, Christianity probably would have continued to denounce usury and to oppose profit and materialism in general, just as Islam still does. </P> 	nyt_eng_200512.gz

She and other postulants were welcomed, then assigned beds, places at the table, seats in chapel. It seemed, she says, like summer camp. Five years later, she decided not to take her final vows, but her time in the convent had transformed her into a woman who was strong enough to leave it. This lovely and affectionate memoir reflects the allure of religious life in an era when girls read Kathryn Hulme's novel The Nun's Story and saw themselves in it. Writing in short sections with headings (Black Becomes Us, Custody of the Eyes, A Grapefruit Incident), Larsen creates a vivid picture of those years, from the clothes she wore to her longing for cigarettes (she gave the last of hers to the cabbie) to the comforting presence of her fellow postulants.

Theater  GUNN-THEATER (Undated) -- By any measure, this is a breakout season for the American baritone Nathan Gunn at the Metropolitan Opera. On Dec. 28, he finished a demanding run of performances in An American Tragedy, by Tobias Picker. On Jan. 21, Gunn gives his first Met performance as Papageno, in Mozart's Zauberflote, in a revival of the 2004 production by Julie Taymor. Some of his many fans in the New York area tossed makeshift confetti of ripped-up programs from the balconies during his curtain calls for An American Tragedy. But is it possible that Gunn's appearance has drawn attention away from his fine vocal artistry? By Anthony Tommasini.  Movies  BRAZIL-FILM (Rio de Janeiro) -- Over the years, Zeze di Camargo and Luciano, the brothers who are a leading country music duo in Brazil, had grown accustomed to people saying that their life story would make an inspiring movie. Theirs is a classic rags-to-riches tale. But nothing in their experience in the music business prepared them for what happened after just such a film based on a true story was made and was released here in August. Two Sons of Francisco (2 Filhos de Francisco) has not only won new respect for an often overlooked musical genre, it has also gone on to break box office records and become Brazil's Oscar nominee for best foreign-language film. By Larry Rohter.  BUJALSKI-FILM (Undated) -- At 28, Andrew Bujalski has already made two homespun, micro-budget features, both set deep within the befuddling gray zone of post-collegiate life. In his first, Funny Ha Ha, Marnie, a 23-year-old recent graduate, floats between dead-end temp jobs while nursing an unrequited crush and fending off an unwelcome suitor. His latest, Mutual Appreciation, centers on a more ambitious but equally restless protagonist: Alan, an indie rocker who arrives in Brooklyn with a gig but no band mates. Though still an industry outsider, Bujalski is emerging as a critics' favorite. By Dennis Lim.  Television  LEE-TV (Undated) -- Four months into his run as the title character on NBC's My Name Is Earl, Jason Lee understands that the boundary between his on-screen alter ego -- a likable loser determined to make amends to everyone he's ever wronged -- and his own identity has been obliterated. Fans of the sitcom who don't know Lee's name now feel perfectly comfortable addressing this 35-year-old actor in public as Hey, Earl! And now NBC has moved My Name Is Earl (on which Lee also serves as a producer) into the 9 p.m. Thursday time slot that has traditionally served as the cornerstone of the network's prime-time lineup. By Dave Itzkoff.  Pop Music  ANGEL-MUSIC (Undated) -- Do you have any skills? A likable guy with shaggy blond hair is sitting in a cafe with his girlfriend, and she wants to know. MTV is betting that a few hundred thousand viewers will want to know, too. The blond is Ashley Parker Angel, once a minor pop star and now, well, a former minor pop star. He was featured on the semisuccessful reality show Making the Band, on which he was recruited into the boy band O-Town. The group managed a few small hits before the boy-band bubble burst, destroying the market for synchronized shamelessness. And now Angel is the star of Ashley Parker Angel: There and Back, a new series on MTV. By Kelefa Sanneh.  Bestseller Lists  BESTSELLERS-HARD-L (Undated) -- Best-selling hardbacks, long-form list.

Editors, this column moves on the Monday or Tuesday before publication.  TRAVEL-GALAPOGOS (Undated) -- It can be tough deciding which wildlife encounters are worthy of pause after only a few days in the Galapagos. Nearly any tour that cruises this isolated yet popular chain, 600 miles west of Ecuador, comes packaged with extreme close-ups of washer-size tortoises, swimming lizards and crabs the color of rainbows. But this is not one of those tours. It's late November, and Peter Grubb is leading a small group of guides, naturalists and reporters on a weeklong exploratory sea kayaking trip. When Grubb's Galapagos sea kayaking trips open to the public in February, a dozen adventurous clients at a time will experience these islands and wildlife in an enticing new way: by paddling to deserted beaches and camping overnight in sand that bears few five-toe footprints. By Tim Neville.  TRAVEL-MEXICO (Undated) -- A Cancun in the making? Once dotted by cabanas, the nearby Mayan Riviera is sprouting family-friendly megaresorts. By Marek Fuchs.  TRAVEL-PUERTO-RICO (Undated) -- A new youthful beat pulses through Puerto Rico as reggaeton, a kind of salsa-flavored hip-hop, gyrates San Juan and the hills beyond. By Julia Chaplin.  TRAVEL-THE-HAGUE (Undated) -- Time was if you mentioned The Hague to someone from Amsterdam, the most likely comment you would have received would have been stately, followed closely by boring (if not the reverse). The Hague, site of the 13th century Binnenhof, where the Dutch parliament meets, has long labored in the shadows of its supposedly hipper sister city. Now thanks to a recent cultural and culinary renaissance in the area of the Denneweg and the Lange Voorhout, The Hague, which remains as stately as it ever was, has cast off its boring reputation. By Gordon F. Sander.  Regular Features  PRACTICAL-TRAVELER (Undated) -- Hyatt is one of several hotel chains that are upgrading their exercise facilities and programs. Most of the renovations feature new workout equipment. But some are going a step further, adding personal trainers or exercise classes, or building entirely new facilities to accommodate guests who are reluctant to take a day off from their exercise schedule.

I'm not really sure how the two of them agreed to do this. But Alan was very interested in musical biography.

"161656"	"I"	"think"	" Great suggestion from someone who attended the baseball dinner: The writers should think about adding a new piece of hardware and give it to the player who makes the greatest contribution to the community. Call it the Tim Wakefield Award and make Wakefield the first recipient. This guy's devotion to Boston and the ball club, and the genuine humility he projects in everything he does, makes him a very special person in this town. And since now Tim and Stacey Wakefield's son and new daughter Brianna have been born here, Wakefield is the first to admit his Boston ties are a lifetime commitment ... Wakefield, who knows what it's like to go through an offseason wondering whether he'll be traded, on how Matt Clement must feel about being shopped this winter: It's not fun, because he came here for a specific reason. He had his choice between three or four different teams and he came here for a reason - mainly, I think, because of Jason [Varitek]. He wanted a catcher that would lead him in the right direction and take a lot of the thinking process out of his mind. That's what a lot of starting pitchers want. They want a guy back there who takes the thinking part out of it for you. To have your name mentioned in a trade, it's disappointing and it's difficult, especially if it doesn't happen and you come back. Your feelings are kind of hurt; they want to get rid of you. You could look at it two ways. You can look at it that way or you can look at it that you're well wanted by other organizations. Like the Doug [Mirabelli] situation. It's not that we didn't want Doug. San Diego wanted Doug badly and we could get something for him. ... One of the sweeter moments of the dinner was the heartfelt remarks from former Sox catcher Rich Gedman, who won the Former Red Sox award and is now managing the independent Worcester Tornadoes. Gedman stood before a full house and said that, even as an ex-player, he is now at a stage in his life where he appreciates the game as a fan, through the eyes of his children. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"

"161798"	"I"	"think"	" Earth tones are comforting, Walch adds, and the palette has been broadened far beyond the ochers, browns and rusts most associate with the Southwest. Today's earth tones include humbler metallics, like pewter, bronze and brass, Walch says. Blues and greys are part of it, too. It isn't just linguistic nonsense; we're talking about water and sky and actual soil. All these colors, I think, have a softness to them.

"161891"	"I"	"think"	" But she conceded that there were people, and industries, that were inevitably going be left behind. The trick was not to protect the jobs, but to protect the people -- by stressing education and retraining, delinking health care from employers, and, in general, helping people make the transition from a declining industry to a growing one.

Here are some assurances: Gallego's novel - - it's actually a series of autobiographical vignettes - - is not depressing. It's not horrifying, despite the appalling conditions it reveals. It's stunning, but not for the reasons you'd expect. Gallego was born with cerebral palsy in Moscow in 1968. When he was 1, for reasons too twisted to relate here, Soviet authorities separated him from his mother (she was told he had died) and placed him in an institution, and then another and another. That is how he grew up, severely handicapped, often in squalor, with little tenderness or regard. It was, he says, cruel and terrible, yet he writes of those years with a clarity that is almost clinical, and in a voice so matter-of-fact that it seems nonchalant. Today, he has been reunited with his mother and has a life in the world. But his point of view was born of heroic survival, and he raises questions, not by asking them, but by making us ask ourselves: What is luck? What is hope? What is pity?

When they asked the owner who had freed them to re-enslave them, he refused, and they responded by killing him and his family, moving back to their old quarters, and resuming their old ways -- the point being that institutionalized oppression and self-loathing, instilled over generations, form habits not easily broken. </P> 	nyt_eng_200601.gz

How to balance the voices in these pianissimo eruptions? Arthur Schnabel's recommendation was to stress the extremes, the soprano and the bass, and leave the middle voices in the background -- but this, Brendel quarrelsomely insists, will get a great deal of clarity but a totally wrong atmosphere. For this reason, he explains, I play the inner voices slightly stronger than the outer voices. That makes the chord sound softer. This is an important matter. </P> 	nyt_eng_200601.gz

After he heard President Bush tell Americans they were addicted to oil, Persson said he was relieved that at last there's one more who understands the problem. As the leader of a country that has thrust itself to the fore of environmental protection, and that has promised to greatly reduce its remaining dependence on oil by 2020, Persson has sought to persuade Sweden's motorists to use less gasoline, fill their tanks with ethanol and promote ways of heating homes without polluting the atmosphere.

Kiwanuka will still be a first-round choice, I think, but he hurt himself in those Senior Bowl workouts.

SCI-LOW-FAT-DIET (Undated) -- Shock, disbelief, cynicism and criticism have greeted a report that a low fat diet may not prevent breast cancer, colon cancer, or heart disease, after all. And it's shattering an American canon that vice gets punished and virtue gets rewarded: if you eat or drink or inhale the wrong things you get sick. If not, you get healthy. By Gina Kolata.  With photo.  SCI-ROBOTS-WILSON (Undated) -- In his new book, How to Survive a Robot Uprising, Daniel Wilson, a robotics expert, offers detailed -- and hilariously deadpan -- advice on evading hostile swarms of robot insects (don't try to fight -- loss of an individual robot is inconsequential to the swarm); outsmarting your smart house (be suspicious if the house suggests you test the microwave by putting your head in it); escaping unmanned ground vehicles (drive in circles -- they'll have a harder time tracking you); and surviving hand-to-hand combat with a humanoid (smear yourself with mud to disguise your distinctive human thermal signature and go for the eyes -- its cameras). By Cornelia Dean.  With photo.  And  SCI-ROBOTS-TIPS (Undated) -- Tips for fighting off a robot. By Cornelia Dean.  SCI-PRESIDENTS-MENTAL-HEALTH (Undated) -- All told, almost half of American presidents between 1789 and 1974 had at least one mental illness in their lifetime, according to a recent analysis of biographical sources by psychiatrists at Duke University Medical Center. A short by Benedict Carey.  SCI-TANNEN-LINGUISTICS A Conversation With feature on Deborah Tannen: A trailblazing linguist who helped expand the field to include aspects of everyday conversation is back on the best-seller list with You're Wearing That? Understanding Mothers and Daughters in Conversation. Those difficult family chasms can be mended, she says, with a better understanding of communications. By Claudia Dreifus.  With photo.  SCI-Q&amp;A (Undated) -- A science question answered: What will happen later to the trees around New York that seemed to be about to burst into bloom or sprout leaves after an unusually warm stretch? By C. Claiborne Ray.  SCI-LEVEES (Vicksburg, Miss.) -- Engineers are building giant model of New Orleans, one-50th of actual size, to help determine what happened in Hurricane Katrina. But these efforts and others, some critics say, may simply be means to deflect blame. By John Schwartz.  NASA-EARTHS-FATE (Undated) -- Billions of years from now, the sun will burn out and the world will end. Science books have told us this for years. But NASA, not wanting to scare anyone, has such a reference removed from a press release. By Dennis Overbye.  SCI-WATCH (Undated) -- News and notes on science: The eruptions of Krakatoa had effects on ocean temperatures and sea level that persisted for decades; Augustine, a volcano 170 miles southwest of Anchorage, has something Krakatoa never had, monitoring over the Internet; the chemical TTX, found naturally in the potentially deadly pufferfish, is used as an offensive weapon in other animals, including a flatworm. By Henry Fountain.  With  SCI-SYMPATHETIC-MATES (Undated) -- Scientists find weight gains among male marmosets and tamarins when their mates are pregnant. A short by Henry Fountain.  SCI-RATS-MAZES (Undated) -- When rats pause in running through a maze, they play back their memory of points along their route, but in reverse order. The discovery may provide a deep insight into how memory works in humans, as well as rats. The reverse rewind capability seems to be part of a neural editing process in which memories are selected, combined and stored as a set of edited movies, as it were, of important experiences in a rat's -- or a person's -- life. By Nicholas Wade.  SCI-PARKINSONS-DRUG (Undated) -- A drug for Parkinson's disease can bring on illusions, in this case auditory ones. A first-person account by Mark Derr.  SCI-COGNITIVE-THERAPY (Undated) -- For most of the 20th century, therapists in America agreed on a single truth. To cure patients, it was necessary to explore and talk through the origins of their problems. In other words, they had to come to terms with the past to move forward in the present. But returning to the past has fallen out of fashion among mental health professionals over the last 15 years. Over the last 20 years, psychotherapeutic techniques like psychoanalysis and psychodynamic therapy, have been eclipsed by cognitive behavioral approaches. That relatively new school holds that reviewing the past is not only unnecessary to healing, but can be counterproductive. By Alix Spiegel.  SCI-ADDICTION-PILL (Undated) -- Patients with addiction problems -- including gambling -- want a pill that will wipe away their problems. Though medicine may help, it will never be a cure-all. By Sally Satel, M.D.  SCI-REALLY (Undated) -- The claim: High intake of sodas increases the risk of esophageal cancer. The facts: .... By Anahad O'Connor.  SCI-WOMEN-HORMONES (Undated) -- A new report suggests that for women who have had hysterectomies, taking estrogen does not increase the risk of heart disease and may even protect the heart in those who are younger, from 50 to 59.

SCI-MUSIC-TASTE (Undated) -- Frank Sinatra or Tony Bennett, classical or baroque, early Los Lobos or late: Taste in music seems a deeply personal matter, guided by an internal compass all one's own. Yet two new studies reveal how social considerations influence not only the music a person buys but the recordings he or she calls favorites. By Benedict Carey.

LOVE-POEM (Istanbul, Turkey) -- It is as tiny as the sleekest mobile phones that fit in the palm of the hand, but its message is anything but modern. A small tablet in a special display this month in the Istanbul Museum of the Ancient Orient is thought to be the oldest love poem ever found, the words of a lover from more than 4,000 years ago. The ancient Sumerian tablet was unearthed in the late 1880s in Nippur, a region in what is now Iraq, and had been resting quietly in a modest corner of the museum until it was brought back to the limelight this year by a company that made it part of a Valentine's Day promotion.part of a Valentine's Day promotion. With photo.  TURKEY-FILM (Istanbul, Turkey) -- The crowd cheered, clapped and whistled as the Turkish agent plunged the knife into the chest of the enemy commander. Valley of the Wolves -- Iraq, which opened last week in movie theaters in Turkey, Austria and Germany, is a Rambo-like action story involving Turkish gunmen who seek revenge against a tyrannical occupying army. In this version, however, the enemy is no oppressive Third World dictatorship. The commander's name is Sam -- as in uncle -- and the opposing forces are the Americans, who are being punished for offenses against Turkish as well as Iraqi pride and honor. The commander, Sam William Marshall, played by an American actor, Billy Zane, is a sociopath, killing people without a second's thought and claiming that he is doing God's will. While fictional, some of the movie is based in part on real events, and many of the scenes elicit knowing looks from the audience. A journal by Sebnem Arsu.  With photo.  ITALY-BERLUSCONI (Turin, Italy) -- Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, wanted to set the record straight: He was joking when he compared himself to Napoleon the day before.

IRAQ-DETAIN (Washington) -- A federal judge here ruled on Monday that the Bush administration cannot transfer a U.S. citizen held by the military in Iraq to Iraqi civilian custody. In his ruling, Judge Ricardo M. Urbina rejected arguments made last week by Justice Department lawyers that the courts had no jurisdiction because the man, Shawqi Ahmad Omar, was not technically in U.S. custody. In his 16-page ruling, Urbina minimized as legalistic the government's argument that Omar was actually in the custody of the 27-nation Multi-National Force in Iraq, which the United States did not control.

Their crossings are as varied and elaborate as their ten billion lives: One woman is turned into snow on her journey, another remembers swimming through a heartbeat surrounded by shoals of brilliant fish.

, he said,	 Ted Turner stayed on as a director at Time Warner years longer than necessary though he disapproved of many changes and his influence started to wane. Turner stuck it out, he said, to help usher the company through a host of challenges, including an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and, most recently, an assault by investor Carl Icahn. I didn't want to leave them in the lurch, he said in an interview Monday at Emory University, just three days after Time Warner announced Turner wouldn't stand for re-election to the company's board. Turner, 67, is a legendary entrepreneur and businessman, from his purchase of the once-moribund Braves to the founding of CNN as a pioneering experiment in news. However, he sold his Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System to Time Warner in 1996 and, over the years, has steadily lost clout. They're doing a good job of operating the company, said Turner, who in stepping down offered kind words for Time Warner Chairman and CEO Richard Parsons. But it has been heart-wrenching, Turner said, to see Time Warner dismantle some of the things at his former company. He didn't like the just-announced sale of cable network Turner South to News Corp., and he hates seeing his beloved Atlanta Braves on the auction block. He still regrets the demise of the Goodwill Games, too. To see so many things that I worked my whole business life to put together, to see them broken apart, sold off, it is very hard for me, he said. Turner's not interested in buying the Braves, though. Been there, done that, he said. What would I do for an encore? The main thing is that I couldn't afford it. While Turner is preparing to drop off the Time Warner board as of May, he looks back on a proud history at Turner Broadcasting. I'm still the founder, and that's not going to change, he said. My heart will always be there. Turner, who was at Emory to accept the school's inaugural Global Innovation Award, said Turner Broadcasting was a special place for him. I like to think of it as kind of a little Camelot, Turner said. Ever the center of attention, he broke into a recitation of Camelot. Time Warner, however, hasn't been such a good place. Turner, during a question-and-answer session at Emory, said the company has been selling everything, divesting everything that was the least bit difficult to manage. He cited examples including the Braves, Turner South and Time Warner's music division and book publishing units. You need to be taking some risks, he said. I was always buying and expanding. In 2003, he stepped down as vice chairman of the Time Warner board. It has been just a matter of time before he would decide to depart all together despite his trove of shares. It's not like this came as a surprise to anyone, Turner said. Turner wanted to stay on the board, he said, while Time Warner resolved several major problems, including an SEC investigation of accounting for online advertising revenue at the company's America Online unit. Time Warner paid $300 million in early 2005 to settle civil fraud charges lodged by the agency. (The company also paid $210 million a few months prior to resolve Justice Department charges of criminal securities fraud that also involved AOL.) Then came Icahn, who lobbied in favor of breaking up Time Warner, owner of such huge properties as AOL and Time Warner Cable. Icahn lobbied hard, only to reach a deal that fell far short of his most ambitious goals. You notice I stayed until the Icahn thing was behind us, Turner said. Turner, who has a fortune estimated at $2 billion, continues with his devotion to a long list of philanthropic causes. He's a supporter of Emory's Global Perspectives Program, for example. But as Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting change, including in ways he doesn't like, Turner knows he's experiencing something many other successful businesspeople have already faced. I'm 67 years old, he said. It's true of everybody that gets old -- entrepreneurs, founders, always feel like the new guys are messing it up. </P> 	nyt_eng_200602.gz

TRAVEL-WINTER-SKI (Undated) -- From Colorado to British Columbia, a look at the best places for late-season skiing this year. By Michelle Higgins.  TRAVEL-SKI-TAOS (Undated) -- The 20-mile drive from the town of Taos to Taos Ski Valley in northeastern New Mexico is a stunning geographical contradiction. The road travels through vast red desert, past adobe houses and prickly pear cactuses, upward through the dense evergreens of the Carson National Forest, finally reaching a Bavarianlike village with the Sangre de Cristo Mountains -- blood-red at sunset -- rising to 13,000 feet overhead. The road ends where the lift line to Al's Run begins, a harrowing-looking bump run that must, in part, account for Taos's reputation as one of skiing's most daunting challenges. On this journey, the psychic distance is just as great as the physical one. In Taos, the spirituality is New Age; here in Taos Ski Valley village, it's all about the skiing. By Lisa Reed.  TRAVEL-SKI-CHAMONIX (Undated) -- Chamonix, a small resort town nestled 3,396 feet high in the Alps, has a long-standing, well-earned reputation as a center for hard-edged sports. After all, it was the birthplace of mountaineering in the late 1700s, and the site of the first Winter Olympics, in 1924. In 1988, a band of skiers that included Glen Plake, the mohawked bad boy of American skiing, upped the ante, creating the sport of extreme skiing by launching themselves (on skis, naturally) off the slopes, cliffs and even tramways around Chamonix, often while upside down and spiraling like a helicopter in a movie that has become a cult skiing classic, The Blizzard of Aahhhs. For skiers of much less than professional ability who don't have any desire to be upside down at any point whatsoever, Chamonix still provides plenty of opportunities to get the adrenaline flowing.

TRAVEL-LAOS (Undated) -- Just four years ago, a stop in this tranquil town was de rigueur for drug-touring trekkers. Local weed and Burmese speed were sold openly on the street, and by some accounts the opium dens outnumbered the guesthouses. The backpackers flocked, and haughty fans of the writer Paul Theroux, whose travels are held up by purists as the right way to do it, announced that Vang Vieng was over. Then something interesting happened. Guesthouses began posting signs saying No Drugs and Please Keep Yourself Clean. Enough of the town's 45,000 residents, it seemed, refused to choke under the hazy smoke exhaled by scruffy budget travelers. The modest economy has since gone straight, attracting well-heeled tourists to counteract the dreadlock dudes. With development moving ahead -- six new guesthouses are opening this year, bringing the total to nearly 70 -- hotel operators and tour guides see a brighter future in inner-tube rentals than in opium dens.

, he concedes,	 Add another credit to Robert Osborne's growing list: official celebrity greeter at the 78th annual Academy Awards. Already Oscar's official historian, the Hollywood Reporter columnist and genial longtime host of Turner Classic Movies will be the red carpet king on Sunday. He'll announce the stars as they arrive outside the Kodak Theatre. Offering equal welcome to nominees doesn't mean he doesn't have his own Oscar faves. But certainly not [ones] that I'll be talking about on the carpet, he says by phone from New York. If I had a vote, I'd certainly vote for 'Brokeback Mountain,' he continues. And I'm delighted that 'Crash' got nominated, since it was [released] so early in the year. For best actor, he's betting on Philip Seymour Hoffman. He's a seamless actor, and he does daring things, Osborne says. He's kind of the Spencer Tracy of today. As for the competition: I think Heath Ledger is really brilliant in 'Brokeback Mountain,' but just as an Oscar observer, it might be to his advantage not to win, Osborne says. For a young person, it can actually stifle a career. Call it the too-much-too-young syndrome. (Think Mira Sorvino and Marisa Tomei.) Best actress? Reese [Witherspoon] will very likely win, but she does have tough competition from Felicity Huffman. In all, he assesses it as a particularly competitive Oscar year, in terms of nominees' overall quality. Well, with one big exception. Personally I'm not sure that 'Munich' deserves to be an Oscar nominee, he says, focusing on the otherwise strong best picture category. Steven Spielberg is a great director, but I'm not sure this is his best work. (He would've liked to see either Cinderella Man or Walk the Line in that fifth slot.) As author of 75 Years of the Oscar: The Official History of the Academy Awards, Osborne knows the big night inside and out. For all the event's pomp and designer-gown elegance, his favorite years are the ones when something upsets the apple cart, like the streaker. That was in 1974. On the opposite end of things, great Oscar moments came from, well, the greats. Like Charlie Chaplin's 1972 honorary Oscar, which brought the silent-film genius back to the States after years of living in European obscurity. He'd kind of been exiled from this country for so many years, and was considered a communist who raped young girls, Osborne recalls, alluding to Chaplin's marriage to Oona O'Neill when she was 17. But he came out onstage by himself at the end of the show, this lonely, wonderful little old man who was not a danger to anybody. It's a revelation he likens to the 1966 ceremony when Fred Astaire, then in his mid-60s, and Ginger Rogers, then in her mid-50s, presented an Oscar. As they came on, they did an impromptu kind of swing, a dance step, he says. And you thought, 'Oh my God, this is Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers!' Moments like that are thrilling. These days, Oscar night isn't what it once was. Fewer viewers tune in. One reason? All these other awards shows are trying to copy Oscar, Osborne says. Indeed, who wants to see Witherspoon give another acceptance speech when she's done it already at the Golden Globes, the Screen Actors Guild Awards, and even the UK's Baftas? But at least people know who she is, whereas Osborne feels that 13 or 14 of the 20 actors on the list for Oscar this year are basically unknown to the public. Even that, though, can be seen as an offshoot of one of Oscar's big pluses: They call attention to more obscure movies that otherwise would not get booked in the multiplex. So Oscar matters -- at least to those who win, knowing when they die their obituaries will begin with those magic words: Academy Award-winner so-and-so died today.? Though he's new to this celeb-greeting gig -- replacing Variety columnist Army Archerd, who served for more than four decades -- Osborne is looking to have fun on Sunday. If he's bad at it, well, like host Jon Stewart, he's not too worried about its affect on his future. I'll really do my best, but it isn't exactly my main job. For the record, neither is acting in horrible movies -- even though his entry on the Internet Movie Database erroneously claims he played Farmer .2 in Tom (as in, Whatever Happened to ? ) Green's Freddy Got Fingered. This is my snobbish side, but I wouldn't go see that movie, much less be in it, Osborne says. He has no idea how to get that false credit erased from the Internet. With a laugh, he concedes, That's probably gonna be on my obituary. </P> 	nyt_eng_200602.gz

FOREIGN  With story BC-BIRD-FLU-FRANCE-NYT  The deadly strain of bird flu has been found in a cat in Germany, officials said Tuesday, the first time the virus has been identified in an animal other than a bird in central Europe.  Two months after the Central American Free Trade Agreement was supposed to go into effect, only El Salvador is ready to join, frustrating a hard-won victory for Washington in its push toward free trade. Four other countries have yet to change a host of laws to bring them into line with the agreement, which requires them to open up their economies to American trade and investment, dismantle protections for many local industries and crack down on counterfeit movies and CDs. A fifth country, Costa Rica, has yet to ratify it. While the delay is in part a sign of how complex negotiations have been when so many countries are involved, it also reflects the extent of the concerns about the agreement in the tiny economies it will affect.  We plan KATRINA--Fuel -- size to be determined  How much natural gas and oil is still shut-in in the Gulf of Mexico  vacant area near the Passaic River. A waterfront park, a new light rail line and the refurbishment of McCarter Highway along the river and the Amtrak bridge over the Passaic are in various stages of completion, and all of the public investment is attracting private investment as well. The first phase of a major mixed-use commercial development on an eight-acre waterfront site is expected to start this year.  In the airline industry's battle to survive and maybe even eke out a profit, the weapon of choice is shifting from cutting costs to raising prices.  Shares of Google dropped 10 percent after its chief financial officer, George Reyes, said growth was slowing and the company needed to find new ways to bolster sales.  The 20-mile drive from the town of Taos to Taos Ski Valley in northeastern New Mexico is a stunning geographical contradiction. The road travels through vast red desert, past adobe houses and prickly pear cactuses, upward through the dense evergreens of the Carson National Forest, finally reaching a Bavarianlike village with the Sangre de Cristo Mountains - blood-red at sunset - rising to 13,000 feet overhead. The road ends where the lift line to Al's Run begins, a harrowing-looking bump run that must, in part, account for Taos's reputation as one of skiing's most daunting challenges. On this journey, the psychic distance is just as great as the physical one. In Taos, the spirituality is New Age; here in Taos Ski Valley village, it's all about the skiing.  Chamonix, a small resort town nestled 3,396 feet high in the Alps, has a long-standing, well-earned reputation as a center for hard-edged sports. After all, it was the birthplace of mountaineering in the late 1700s, and the site of the first Winter Olympics, in 1924. In 1988, a band of skiers that included Glen Plake, the mohawked bad boy of American skiing, upped the ante, creating the sport of extreme skiing by launching themselves (on skis, naturally) off the slopes, cliffs and even tramways around Chamonix, often while upside down and spiraling like a helicopter in a movie that has become a cult skiing classic, The Blizzard of Aahhhs. For skiers of much less than professional ability who don't have any desire to be upside down at any point whatsoever, Chamonix still provides plenty of opportunities to get the adrenaline flowing.  Just four years ago, a stop in this tranquil town was de rigueur for drug-touring trekkers. Local weed and Burmese speed were sold openly on the street, and by some accounts the opium dens outnumbered the guesthouses. The backpackers flocked, and haughty fans of the writer Paul Theroux, whose travels are held up by purists as the right way to do it, announced that Vang Vieng was over. Then something interesting happened. Guesthouses began posting signs saying No Drugs and Please Keep Yourself Clean. Enough of the town's 45,000 residents, it seemed, refused to choke under the hazy smoke exhaled by scruffy budget travelers. The modest economy has since gone straight, attracting well-heeled tourists to counteract the dreadlock dudes. With development moving ahead - six new guesthouses are opening this year, bringing the total to nearly 70 - hotel operators and tour guides see a brighter future in inner-tube rentals than in opium dens.

, he added,	 Cox News Service LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. - If the Braves have a figurative torch for their pitching ace, it was passed Tuesday from John Smoltz to Tim Hudson. Manager Bobby Cox confirmed Hudson is scheduled to start the April 3 season opener at the Los Angeles Dodgers. Smoltz, last year's opening-day starter, would pitch the second game at Dodger Stadium. If everything works out, that's right, [Hudson] will open, said Cox, who would be using his sixth different opening day starter in six seasons after three in the previous 11 years. The manager had yet to talk to his pitchers about the plan, but Smoltz, 38, said it made perfect sense. Two weeks ago, the veteran with the surgically repaired (four times) elbow and shoulder that throbbed in September and October, announced he would reduce his workload in hopes of staying healthy this year. It's a no-brainer, to me, Smoltz said of Hudson starting the opener. I don't say that to be submissive. It makes sense because of everything - stats, everything. He's the guy that's going to carry the club. I don't want to put pressure on him, but that's the truth. The way the rotation breaks down, the No. 3 starter - likely Horacio Ramirez - will pitch the home opener on April 10th against Philadelphia. Hudson, 30, went 14-9 with a 3.52 ERA in 192 innings during his first season with the Braves, modest for a pitcher who led the American League with 81 wins and 1,104 innings in the previous five seasons. He fell short of his expectations, and Hudson is eager to improve on it and be the pitcher the Braves expected when he got a four-year, $47 million contract extension last spring, before he'd thrown a pitch for Atlanta. Until something's official, I don't really have anything to say about [starting opening day], said Hudson, who pitched several openers for Oakland. I just go out and work when they tell me to work. But, he added, Obviously, pitching any opening day is an honor. Especially with the staff we have. Smoltz was 14-7 with a 3.06 ERA in 33 starts, silencing those who questioned the decision to move the former All-Star closer back to his starting role after 3 1/2 seasons in the bullpen. After allowing six earned runs in 1 2/3 innings in the opener at Florida and losing his first three starts, Smoltz went 14-4 with a 2.86 ERA in 30 starts despite nagging neck, back and shoulder injuries. When the Braves had injuries to starters Mike Hampton, John Thomson and Hudson, Smoltz ground out 79 innings while going 8-0 with a 2.05 ERA over 10 games June 11 to July 31. He later conceded he pushed himself too hard over that stretch, which included three complete games and consecutive games June 21-26 in which he totaled 241 pitches in 18 innings with one run allowed. One thing I want to do is [help] lessen his workload, said Hudson, who spent a month on the disabled list last summer with a strained intercostal muscle in his left side. I want to be able to pitch every [fifth] day, stay healthy, go deep into games so he doesn't have to do what he had to do last year. Last year, all parties agreed it made sense to start Smoltz in the opener, since so much was made of his return to the starting rotation and him being the only remaining pitcher from the Braves' great rotations of the '90s. Also, the Braves wanted to take some pressure off Hudson, a Georgia-born, Alabama-raised pitcher who starred at Auburn and was the talk of baseball after being traded to Atlanta following the 2004 winter meetings. There was a lot of stuff going on for me last year, Hudson said. New team, the contract, new baby ... it was a whirlwind last year. Things really seem a lot more settled now. Meanwhile, the reality of his own mortality seems to have struck Smoltz, a former Cy Young Award winner who overcome four elbow surgeries and became the first elite pitcher to move from starter to closer and back to starter. He wants to keep going, at least long enough for another shot at the World Series, and Smoltz seems to be acknowledging that will require some concessions to his advancing age and medical history. Besides, he's started three times on opening day. Been there, done that, he said, then smiled and added, I don't care where I'm at [in the rotation], I just want to win my first start. I haven't done that very often. </P> 	nyt_eng_200602.gz

, she said,	 Cox News Service DAYTON, Ohio -- For a scary moment there, it felt like 2004 all over again. USA Today listed Ohio among 16 states introducing legislation to ban gays and lesbians from adopting children -- part of a second front in the culture wars that began during the 2004 elections over same-sex marriage. Now that we've defined what marriage is, we need to take that further and say children deserve to be in that relationship, Greg Quinlan of Ohio's Pro-Family Network, a conservative Christian group, told USA Today. Well, gosh darn it, he's right. With such an overabundance of loving families waiting to adopt kids, shouldn't we make it as restrictive as possible? In a nation with more than 6,000 children waiting to be adopted, the notion is as absurd as it is hateful. House Bill 515, introduced Feb. 9 by Rep. Ron Hood, R-Ashville, would prohibit foster and adoptive children from being placed in the home of any gay, bisexual or transgender person. Fortunately, House Speaker Jon Husted, R-Kettering, stood up to the bullies in his party and said enough is enough. He killed the bill, refusing to refer it to committee. If other states try to capitalize on the issue, as they did with same-sex marriage in 2004, Husted believes the strategy will fail. This doesn't have the same legs, he said. Voters perceived that as being for traditional marriage; they'll see this as being against the child. The issue hit close to home, since Husted himself was adopted. I know how many children never get adopted, he said. They need people to love them and to nurture them. I don't want to restrict those opportunities, I want to expand them. Judy and Jim Husted adopted Jon as an infant and raised him on a 4,000-acre farm in Montpelier, Ohio. You can't pick your parents but I couldn't be more fortunate that they picked me, Husted said of his parents, now retired and living in South Carolina. And then my sister came along and I got to pick her -- or at least that's what my parents told me. Husted said he has received relatively little flak for his position and many supportive e-mails. Husted speaks from first-hand knowledge what it is like to be in that position, said Lori Richmond of Columbus, a gay mother raising her 1-year-old son with her partner, Elizabeth Hollenbaugh. Richmond said she was shocked and hurt when she learned about the bill. Adoptive parents prove themselves worthy of parenting over and over -- first to the social worker, then to prospective birth parents, then every month to the social worker again, before finally having a judge decide if they are suitable, she said. I believe that all of these people who know the person or people trying to adopt are much more qualified to determine if that person is suitable to adopt than a blanket ban on a select group of people. It is one thing to not like gays or lesbians, she said, but it is something entirely different to punish children because of it. Fortunately for Ohio's children, Jon Husted sees it the same way. </P> 	nyt_eng_200602.gz

ARTS &amp; LEISURE  HUSBAND-WIFE-MUSICIANS (Undated) -- When the blues-rock singer and guitarist Susan Tedeschi considers her itinerary for a coming tour, she worries about more than venue size, motel rooms and the other things that might concern the average musician on the road. She also reads up on museums, zoos, aquariums and anything else that might appeal to the most important members of her entourage: her son, Charlie, who is almost 4, and daughter, Sophia, 1. And if the vagaries of scheduling and travel permit, somewhere along the way she might even work in a few days with the fourth member of the household: her husband, the guitarist Derek Trucks. There have been musical couples before them, from George Jones and Tammy Wynette to Bruce Springsteen and Patti Scialfa. But the most long-lived have tended to be professional partners, and often unequal ones. Trucks and Tedeschi are striving for a different model, maintaining separate careers with occasional intersections. By Jesse Fox Mayshark.  OSCARS (Undated) -- Sunday night, an expected 41 million Americans will tune into the 78th annual Academy Awards to watch a spectacle largely honoring films they have not seen and may never get around to watching. Much has been made about the smallness of most of the nominees for best picture, which usually refers to their modest budgets and absence of stars, but also rightly suggests an economy of ambition and scale. The received wisdom about the awards, especially outside Los Angeles, is that they are nothing but an orgy of self-love and self-advertisement, which of course they are. But they are also a useful barometer of mainstream American film culture, and they tell us something about how the movie industry sees itself and sees us, its increasingly fickle consumers. By Mahohla Dargis.  ARTIST-COLLECTIVES (Undated) -- Contemporary art is a multibillion-dollar global industry. But why does such a big deal look so small, so slight? There has to be another way to go, an alternative to a used-up alternative. By far the most interesting option so far, one that began to be news a few years ago and has increased its visibility since, is the work of miniature subcultures known as collectives. One way or another, joint production among parties of equal standing scrambles existing aesthetic formulas. It may undermine the cult of the artist as media star, dislodge the supremacy of the precious object and unsettle the economic structures that make the art world a mirror image of the inequities of American culture at large. In short, it confuses how we think about art and assign value to it. This can only be good. By Holland Cotter.  THEATER-ALBA (Undated) -- Bernarda Alba is the latest salvo in Michael John LaChiusa's campaign to repopulate musical theater. Jesse Green talks with LaChiusa.  TV-LOST (Undated) -- There is a grown-up love story unfolding on Lost, but it's often overshadowed by flashier hook-ups. Sure, Kate and Sawyer are hot. But for the teary-eyed pleasure of watching two characters in love falling apart and coming together again, it's hard to beat the South Korean husband-and-wife castaways, Sun and Jin Kwon. By Joyce Millman.  TV-SONS&amp;DAUGHTERS (Undated) -- Sons &amp; Daughters, which has its premiere on March 7, is no typical sitcom -- the performances and dialogue are largely improvised by the actors.

TRAVEL-SKI-TAOS (Undated) -- The 20-mile drive from the town of Taos to Taos Ski Valley in northeastern New Mexico is a stunning geographical contradiction. The road travels through vast red desert, past adobe houses and prickly pear cactuses, upward through the dense evergreens of the Carson National Forest, finally reaching a Bavarian-like village with the Sangre de Cristo Mountains -- blood-red at sunset -- rising to 13,000 feet overhead. The road ends where the lift line to Al's Run begins, a harrowing-looking bump run that must, in part, account for Taos's reputation as one of skiing's most daunting challenges. On this journey, the psychic distance is just as great as the physical one. In Taos, the spirituality is New Age; here in Taos Ski Valley village, it's all about the skiing. By Lisa Reed.  TRAVEL-SKI-CHAMONIX (Undated) -- Chamonix, a small resort town nestled 3,396 feet high in the Alps, has a long-standing, well-earned reputation as a center for hard-edged sports. After all, it was the birthplace of mountaineering in the late 1700s, and the site of the first Winter Olympics, in 1924. In 1988, a band of skiers that included Glen Plake, the mohawked bad boy of American skiing, upped the ante, creating the sport of extreme skiing by launching themselves (on skis, naturally) off the slopes, cliffs and even tramways around Chamonix, often while upside down and spiraling like a helicopter in a movie that has become a cult skiing classic, The Blizzard of Aahhhs. For skiers of much less than professional ability who don't have any desire to be upside down at any point whatsoever, Chamonix still provides plenty of opportunities to get the adrenaline flowing.

TRAVEL-LAOS (Undated) -- Just four years ago, a stop in this tranquil town was de rigueur for drug-touring trekkers. Local weed and Burmese speed were sold openly on the street, and by some accounts the opium dens outnumbered the guesthouses. The backpackers flocked, and haughty fans of the writer Paul Theroux, whose travels are held up by purists as the right way to do it, announced that Vang Vieng was over. Then something interesting happened. Guesthouses began posting signs saying No Drugs and Please Keep Yourself Clean. Enough of the town's 45,000 residents, it seemed, refused to choke under the hazy smoke exhaled by scruffy budget travelers. The modest economy has since gone straight, attracting well-heeled tourists to counteract the dreadlock dudes. With development moving ahead -- six new guesthouses are opening this year, bringing the total to nearly 70 -- hotel operators and tour guides see a brighter future in inner-tube rentals than in opium dens.

SCI-FLA-PANTHERS (Ochopee, Fla.) -- A new federal report has announced the obvious: The Florida panther population must grow to survive -- ideally, to three separate populations of at least 240 each. But it is ever more desperate for space. The report, by the Fish and Wildlife Service, suggested moving some to Central Florida and on to Georgia and Arkansas. But there are no firm plans, and with the panther population still endangered but healthier than it has been in decades, South Florida is facing an equally thorny new question: what to do when panthers get too comfortable on human turf? By Abby Goodnough.  With photo and map.  SCI-PREGNANCY (Undated) -- A Harvard evolutionary biologist argues that a mother and her unborn child engage in an unconscious struggle over the nutrients she will provide it. His theory has been gaining support in recent years, as scientists examine the various ways pregnancy can go wrong. His theory also explains a baffling feature of developing fetuses: The copies of some genes are shut down, depending on which parent they come from. By Carl Zimmer.  With photo.  SCI-HAIRY-LOBSTERS (Undated) -- As lobsters go, this one is not very appetizing -- it's white, it's covered with hair, and if you ate it, it would probably taste like rotten eggs. But for the scientists who found it and named it, Kiwa hirsuta was a sweet discovery: It represents not just a new species or even a new genus, they say, but a family of animals previously unknown to science. A short by Cornelia Dean.  With photo.  SCI-Q&amp;A (Undated) -- A science question answered: Do any animals (besides humans) season or otherwise alter their food to make it taste better? By C. Claiborne Ray.  SCI-MUTTER-EARTH (Undated) -- A Conversation With feature on John Mutter, deputy director of Columbia's Earth Institute. He explores the idea that the hard sciences should be connected more closely with soft science, and perhaps solve the problems of global poverty. In most parts of the world, people depend on the earth for their livelihoods. If we can understand more how the earth functions, Mutter said, we can learn how it interacts with human well-being. By Claudia Dreifus.  With photo.  SCI-FRANKLIN-PRINCESS (Philadelphia) -- During the 300th anniversary of the birth of Ben Franklin, a Russian princess whom he met once is sharing his spotlight in an exhibit here. Both were scientific innovators, and she was the first woman to head an academy of science. The princess took over directorship of the decrepit Imperial Academy of Sciences in Russia and, though not a scientist herself, restored it to prominence and intellectual respectability. This came at a critical time in the history of science, its transformation from what was called natural philosophy, often practiced by gifted amateurs, to a professional enterprise. By John Noble Wilford.  SCI-MYSTIC-PHYSICS (Undated) -- When people start turning to physics for salvation, you can bet that either something very good or very bad is happening. Two years ago, the movie What the .$!%.. Do We Know!? argued that reality is just a mental construct that we can rearrange and improve, if we are enlightened or determined enough. Science and spirituality have tied the knot, and the world is your infinitely deformable apple. Now, its sequel is out. These films and the quantum mysticism industry behind them raise a disturbing question about the muddled intersection between science and culture. Do we have to indulge in bad physics to feel good? An essay by Dennis Overbye.  SCI-WATCH (Undated) -- News and notes on science. By Henry Fountain:  -- New analysis places new dates on the settlement of Easter Island, answering questions about why it took so long for Polynesian settlers to deforest it.  -- Deforestation of Sumatra and Borneo has led to a sharp decrease in populations of orangutans, the only great apes found outside Africa, new research shows.  -- The Magdalenian Girl, a 15,000-year-old nearly intact skeleton found in a rock shelter in southwestern France, has a secret: She's not a girl -- she's a woman. New research suggests she about 25 years old or 30, not 15. The newest findings are based on the discovery that her wisdom teeth were impacted.  With  SCI-YELLOWSTONE-GEYSERS (Undated) -- Scientists believe they have found an explanation for what happened in Yellowstone in 2002 and 2003. The Norris Geyser Basin, the hottest of the park's hot spots, grew hotter still. Several geysers erupted after having been quiet for years. Others erupted more frequently. Some grew so hot that the water boiled off and they became steam vents. Satellite photos suggest that an area near the basin rose up about an inch a year over five years. The uplift probably caused increased fracturing near the surface that would account for the unrest. A short by Henry Fountain.  With photo.  SCI-WANTING-TO-LIVE (Undated) -- A cases column: A psychiatric patient prone to leaving astonishing messages overnight on his psychiatrist's answering machine has an epiphany that may save his life. It's not evidence-based, but it may help him get his ominous cholesterol down to a tolerable level. By Elissa Ely, M.D.  SCI-NASAL-SPRAY (Undated) -- Relief provided by nasal spray decongestants like Afrin and Neo-Synephrine comes at a price: the risk of rebound congestion caused by overuse and, for some people, a vicious cycle of overuse and dependence that feels like an addiction. By Richard Saltus.  SCI-MED-STUDENTS (Undated) -- Does grilling medical students with questions make them into better doctors? For years, many professors routinely peppered students with relevant and arcane queries, often embarrassing them. Things may be gentler today, but the practice, referred to as the pimping of students, still has its advocates. By Barron H. Lerner, M.D.  SCI-REALLY (Undated) -- The claim: Heart attacks are more common on Monday. The facts: .... by Anahad O'Connor.  SCI-NORMAL-SLEEP (Undated) -- Disturbed sleep has to be one of the most common complaints in medicine. Not only patients but the general public seems to have a cherished notion of what constitutes a normal night's sleep: seven to eight blissful hours of uninterrupted slumber. The problem, it seems, is not so much with their sleep as it is with a common and mistaken notion about what constitutes a normal night's sleep. Research suggests that sleeping and waking patterns are normal and evolutionary. By Richard A. Friedman, M.D.  SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) -- News and notes on health and medicine. By Eric Nagourney:  -- Safety: Injuries from infant walkers have gone down significantly but are still enough of a problem that researchers say they should be banned.  -- Reactions: Is there such a thing as too much coffee? A new study suggests there may be. Volunteers asked to perform challenging mathematical problems while placed under stress did better when they drank the equivalent of two cups of coffee, but worse when they had four.  -- Aging: It is natural that many people slow down with age, and need to work harder to do the same things they did when they were younger. But it is not just a matter of aging, a new study suggests. Researchers have found that when many older people walk, for example, they do so less efficiently than younger people, using about a fifth more oxygen.  -- Practices: A new study of medical reporting on local television news programs, a major source of health information for Americans, has found much of the coverage wanting at best, and downright misleading at worst.  SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) -- The Personal Health column: The latest research findings won't change the healthful regimen of this columnist. She looks closely at the latest finding on nonfat diets and other regimens and concludes there's every reason to stay her course. By Jane E. Brody.  SCI-DEATH-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) -- Chasing Daylight: How My Forthcoming Death Transformed My Life, by Eugene O'Kelly.

, she said,	 Cox News Service ATLANTA -- A jury begins deliberating today whether to impose the death sentence on convicted murderer James Sullivan or give him life in prison, with or without the possibility of parole. Sullivan, 64, was convicted Friday of paying a hit man $25,000 to kill his estranged wife, Lita McClinton Sullivan, 35, at her Buckhead townhouse 19 years ago. After arguments and testimony from prosecution and defense witnesses in the sentencing phase of the trial, the case went to the sequestered jury around 5 p.m. Monday, but the panel chose to defer deliberations until this morning. I have looked forward to this day for many years, the victim's mother, JoAnn McClinton, choking back tears, said in a series of victim impact statements by Lita Sullivan's relatives allowed under Georgia law. Should I forgive him? I cannot. Will I forgive him? I will not. Sullivan's younger brother, Frank Sullivan, was to court Monday prepared to testify, not for the defense, but for the prosecution. He was not allowed to take the witness stand, but outside the courtroom, Frank Sullivan read the statement he had prepared. It is a great shame I have to admit that James Sullivan is my brother, Frank Sullivan read. James' behavior is not a reflection of the household we came from. My parents lived for their children and created a comfortable, nurturing, happy home. He offered his sympathy to JoAnn and Emory McClinton and told reporters he would like to tell his older brother: For the first time in your life, stand up and tell the truth. Admit to the McClinton family what you did to their daughter. Do you have any idea the pain and suffering you brought to our parents and your children? James Sullivan's children are all young adults and do not speak to their father, his younger brother said. Defense attorney Josh Moore of the Capital Defender group tried to convince jurors that James Sullivan does not deserve the death penalty. This is not a death penalty case, Moore said. Lita Sullivan was a good person robbed of her life at an early time. She died of a single gunshot wound to the head. This is not a case where she was tortured or brutalized over days. ? This is not the worst of the worst. If he goes to prison, life for Jim Sullivan is concrete, razor wire and clanging steel bars, Moore said. Assistant District Attorney Kellie Hill said the facts of the murder fit all the aggravating circumstance required for imposition of the death penalty, including depravity of mind. You take a total stranger from the street and you pay him to put a bullet in her head. Now how depraved, how horrible, how inhuman can that be? Hill said Lita Sullivan lived for almost an hour after being shot. For agonizing minutes, She lay on the floor, bullets in her brain, gurgling and gasping for breath. She argued that the death penalty is the only appropriate option. [Defense attorneys] have asked you to give this defendant hope, at least the possibility of life with parole. ? This defendant has lived his parole for 19 years, Hill said. She said James Sullivan's day planner for nine days after Lita Sullivan was killed noted he was having champagne and caviar with Suki, the woman who became his third wife. He went on with his life for 19 years. ? He has lived in exotic places and luxurious surroundings. The McClintons, she said, have lived, enduring holidays and birthdays, without their beloved Lita. Defense attorney Don Samuel appealed to jurors for his client's life. The prosecution is appealing to your mind-set for retribution and revenge. I appeal to a different part of your being: the more noble part that involves mercy, Samuel said. Justice includes mercy and compassion and preservation at all costs of human life. Ed Garland, also representing James Sullivan, said, Whatever sentence you choose, he will die in one of the state prisons of Georgia. It is not necessary that you put poison into this man's veins. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, he said,	 In 2003, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 31.6 percent of African-Americans had excessively high blood pressure, compared to 20.5 percent of whites; 3.5 percent had suffered a stroke, compared to 2.3 percent of whites; and 10.1 percent had diabetes, compared to 6.2 percent of whites. On Friday, the association opened a new $10 million headquarters and research center, named for the late Atlanta Mayor Maynard H. Jackson, on a 127-acre plot south of Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, as part of a weekend science symposium designed to coincide with the American College of Cardiology meeting in downtown Atlanta. But in contrast to that 30,000-attendee meeting -- which focuses on treatment and through today will be releasing results of new drug trials -- the black cardiologists' group divides its attention between treating heart disease and the much more elusive goal of preventing it. Our people suffer so much from the ravages of cardiovascular disease, said Dr. B. Waine Kong, a psychologist and attorney who has been the association's chief executive officer since 1985. We could have the best doctors, the best hospitals, but they are never going to be as good as preventing the problem in the first place. Pursuing prevention, the association has brought its concern for African-Americans' high rates of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, obesity and kidney failure out of laboratories and doctors' offices and into the community. It pioneered a program, CHOICES (Changing Health Outcomes by Improving Cardiovascular Education &amp; Screenings ) that combines blood pressure, cholesterol and blood-sugar testing with a Bible-based health curriculum run out of churches in Phoenix, Chicago, Philadelphia, New York and southwest Mississippi. It supports a Center for Women's Health and created an anti-secondhand smoke campaign, active in Georgia, called Not in Mama's Kitchen. And it fields the REACH campaign, which supports 10 volunteers including Fuller on funds from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Fulton County Department of Health and Wellness. At lunchtime Monday, men trickled through the door of the Silver Star as Fuller unwound her blood-pressure cuff . Collier fretted that his customers -- her patients -- wouldn't find her. His barbershop, which occupied 181 Auburn Ave. for almost 60 years, was forced up the street a few weeks ago by the start of a $45 million redevelopment project, spearheaded by Big Bethel AME Church, that will rebuild his former block. Now it sits at the corner of Auburn and Jackson, across from Ebenezer Baptist Church and the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site, under a small sign that says Grand Opening Coming Soon. At the old shop, we'd get quite a few guys waiting for her when she came, he said. But at least one of Fuller's patients tracked her down: Paul Thomas, the lone barber at the La Sisters' parlor next door. When he met Fuller a year ago in the Silver Star's old location, his blood pressure was 170/90, well into the danger zone. He had a prescription for medications, but he kept forgetting to take them. He felt fine. Fuller, he said, explained that he wasn't fine -- and coaxed and pleaded with him to do better. On Monday, her meter showed the results: 120/80, solidly normal. Fuller hugged him. Thomas grinned. I knew I was supposed to do better, but I didn't, he said. She set me straight. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, he said,	 Cox News Service ATLANTA -- Toting around a crackling scanner might look positively archaic at the Atlanta Motor Speedway this weekend . Since January, NASCAR fans have been immersing themselves in up-to-date statistics and a variety of minutiae thanks to a nifty new handheld device. The black-and-yellow NASCAR Nextel FanView has become the must-have -- actually, must-rent -- gadget for fans attending a race. We've sold out of these each weekend, said Michael Robichaud, director of sponsorships for Sprint Nextel. Between video and audio replays and rich data, it's just a great combination. FanView rented out 3,500 units, which weigh less than a pound, at the recent Daytona 500. The upcoming Golden Corral 500 promises to offer almost 5,500. Among its capabilities: -- Eight video feeds, including seven in-car cameras. -- Real-time statistics on each driver. -- An audio replay feature that allows users to listen to the last three minutes of communications between a specific driver and crew (for instance, one can listen to the build-up to a crash). Make sure to budget for the privilege. The FanView rents for $50 a day or $70 for a race weekend and comes with a battery that lasts approximately five hours. Those who rent for the entire race weekend get a second battery, plus a charger to refuel for another day's action. For years and years the scanners would provide inside-the-helmet audio, said Andrew Giangola, director of business communications for NASCAR in New York. This is a next-generation scanner.

Drivers, he said, are open and accessible to this intimate view. For rabid fans drooling at the chance to purchase one, Sprint Nextel is working toward making a consumer model available. So, do the applications of the FanView have promise for other sporting events? Eagle-eyed views of calls at tennis tournaments? Cameras sewn into baseball caps for up-close thrills from the mound?

"165296"	"I"	"think"	" One of DealBook's major pluses, I think, is that it ignores newspaper journalists' traditional resistance to acknowledging a competitor's exclusive article or insight.

"165297"	"I"	"think"	" While the banner of The New York Times flies at the top of each page of DealBook, much of the information there hasn't been verified or confirmed by the staff. In my mind, this is a fundamental departure from the way the rest of the paper's content -- except for wire service stories -- is authenticated before it is published. We're not authenticating every article, Sorkin said, but we are going to great lengths to decide whether a story merits being published. Verification can be especially important, I think, when the story or information being picked up from another publication relies on unnamed sources -- a problem Sorkin acknowledged. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"

, they say,	 The prospect of hurting employers of illegal immigrants excites anti-illegal immigration groups, which have allied themselves with Klehm and are urging their members to hunt out and report rogue employers. The goal, they say, is to substitute lawsuits for the inability or unwillingness of federal immigration authorities to crack down on employers of illegal immigrants. One allied group is called Federal Immigration Reform and Enforcement (FIRE), and it has created an Internet website called WeHireAliens.com to encourage whistleblowing on employers who hire illegal workers. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz

For the latest photos and graphics from The New York Times, go to www.nytimages.com.  INTERNATIONAL (i code)  IRAQ-MURDER (Dateline TK) -- Developments in the investigation of the rape-murder in Iraq and of the American who has been charged. (Byline TK)  IRAQ (Baghdad, Iraq) -- Civilian deaths in June were about double the rate of a year ago, new figures from the Baghdad morgue show. Other developments, including the kidnapping of the Iraqi deputy electricity minister and 19 bodyguards. By Sabrina Tavernise.  MIDEAST (Gaza City, Gaza Strip) -- A deadline announced by Palestinian militants holding an Israeli soldier captive passes with no word on his fate. The Hamas prime minister of the Palestinian Authority, Ismael Haniyeh, urges the captors not to kill him. By Greg Myre.  MEXICO-ELECT (Mexico City) -- Developments in tally of Mexico's presidential vote. The final results, expected Wednesday, may still take a few days to compute. The No. 3 candidate Roberto Madrazo of the once-dominant PRI, formally conceded on Tuesday. By James C. McKinley and Ginger Thompson.  WASHINGTON (w code)  IMMIG-CONGRESS (Washington) -- On the eve of nationwide hearings that could determine the fate of his immigration bill on Capitol Hill, President Bush is signaling a new willingness to negotiate with House Republicans in an attempt to revive the stalled legislation before Election Day. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.  NATIONAL GENERAL (a code)  SHUTTLE (Cape Canaveral, Fla.) -- The space shuttle Discovery is scheduled to launch at 2:37 pm EDT, foam crack or not. By John Schwartz.  BUSH (Fort Bragg, N.C.) -- In a speech marking Independence Day, President Bush thanked American troops for their service in Iraq and elsewhere, saying that they were winning the war, but warning them that it was far from over. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.  An early lede has moved.  NJ-FISCAL (Trenton, N.J.) -- Hoping to break a budget stalemate that has paralyzed New Jersey's state government, Gov. Jon S. Corzine told legislators summoned to a rare holiday session that they must accept a sales tax increase this year or face fiscal crises for years to come. But the Democrats who have opposed his plan in the Assembly appeared unmoved by his appeal during a rare joint-session of the legislature, and left the Statehouse without any plans to vote on a budget. The state's budget was due on Friday. On Saturday, Corzine began a phased shutdown of state government services that will take full effect on Wednesday, when state parks and Atlantic City's casinos will be forced to close, along with all non-essential government offices. By Richard G. Jones and Laura Mansnerus.  EDUCATION (a code)  EDUCATION-COLUMN (Lynchburg, Va.) -- Alone together, Matea Osti and Marwa Abdel Latif shared a piano bench at the Steinway grand, gift of the Class of 1940. It was a summer morning on a campus without a summer session, and the entry lobby of Main Hall at Randolph-Macon Woman's College sat nearly deserted. As the two young women put hands to keyboard for Fur Elise, a sole janitor passed behind them, vacuuming the Persian rugs. The two, both from lands torn by war, have become best friends on a campus that encourages foreign students. The weekly column, by Samuel G. Freedman.  FINANCIAL (f code)  COAL-FUEL (East Dubuque, Ill.) -- The coal in the ground in Illinois alone has more energy than all the oil in Saudi Arabia. The technology to turn that coal into fuel for cars, homes and factories is proven. And at current prices, that process could be at the vanguard of a big, new industry. Such promise has attracted entrepreneurs and government officials who want domestic substitutes for foreign oil. But there is one big catch. Producing such fuel from coal generates far more carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming, than producing vehicle fuel from oil, or using ordinary natural gas. And the projects now moving forward have no incentive to reduce the CO2 emissions beyond the limited amount that can currently be sold for industrial use. By Matthew L. Wald.  SMILEY-FACE-WAR (Undated) -- In the battle of the smiley face, it's not just who smiled first that counts, but also where and how. Frown-inducing accusations have been flying in a trademark dispute between Wal-Mart Stores and a company owned by a French family over American commercial rights to the ubiquitous yellow symbol for happiness. Both parties say they expect victory when the Patent and Trademark Office rules on the case this summer. 28  LEONHARDT-COLUMN (Undated) -- David Leonhardt's weekly column. A few years back, a technology writer named John Battelle began talking about how the Internet had made it possible to predict the future. When people went to the home page of Google or Yahoo and entered a few words into a search engine, what they were really doing, he realized, was announcing their intentions. If somebody were to add up all this information, it would produce a pretty good notion of where the world was headed, of what was about to get hot and what was going out of style. It was a nice idea, but for most of us it was just an abstraction. A few weeks ago, Google took a big step toward changing this -- toward making the database of intentions visible to the world -- by creating a product called Google Trends. It allows you to check the relative popularity of absolutely any search term, to look at how it has changed over the last couple years and to see the cities where the term is most popular. And it's totally addictive.  ARABIC-MEDIA (undated) -- A media competition for minds and market share in the Middle East is evolving as a crowd of Western news organizations prepares to deliver headlines -- and geopolitical views -- in the language of the Koran. By Doreen Carvajal.  MICROSOFT-CAMPUS (Undated) -- In the midst of its biggest expansion in nearly a decade, Microsoft, the world's largest software company, has suddenly found itself with a major obstacle: not enough room to grow. The company, which houses more than 30,000 people on its sprawling campus in Redmond, Wash., wants to make room for up to 12,000 new bodies. It will spend $1 billion to expand its headquarters by more than one-third, or 3.1 million square feet, over the next three years. For a modest-sized real estate market like Seattle, those are staggering numbers. By Kristina Shevory.

, he said,	 Stephen McDonnell, who founded the natural meat company Applegate Farms in 1987 and remains its chief executive, argues that the hot dog revolution should center on beef from animals that eat only pasture rather than the standard diet of grain. Beef from cattle raised on grass is leaner and has a healthier dose of omega-3 fatty acids, the kind found in fish like salmon and mackerel. As a result, he said, the dogs are healthier. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz

, he said,	 Eric M. Berman, a lawyer in Babylon, N.Y., and an officer of the National Association of Retail Collection Attorneys, whose members represent creditors, said that complaints filed with the government were not always legitimate.

, he added,	 Zhao Shu, chairman of the China Folk Art and Literature Association, said the infatuation with lucky plates was a gross distortion of traditional Chinese culture. People are feeling empty and superficial, Zhao said. They are not learning the traditional culture and they misunderstand it. It shows a very superficial culture. It's bragging by the new rich. Zhao, who said the symbolism of numbers could be traced to Confucius as well as Taoism, said the current emphasis on 8 and 4 overlooked the fact that no number was solely lucky or unlucky. He said proper interpretation of numbers was far more nuanced and linked in meaning to the spoken language itself. Good fortune, he added, cannot be purchased with a bundle of 8's. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz

, he said,	 He wants to start with Cambridge, he said, because the city council has been particularly sanctimonious in its declaration of support for undocumented immigrants. Cambridge Vice Mayor and State Representative Timothy J. Toomey comes in for particular criticism from Nelsen. The website depicts Toomey, who Nelson says was most fervent in his support of the city's sanctuary initiative, with two glowing halos on his head. It provides a map to his house in East Cambridge, and his home number. Toomey did not sponsor the resolution, and it was passed unanimously by the nine city councilors. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he said,	 Nelsen chose to start his campaign in New Jersey because it is one of the most crowded areas of the country, he said, and a magnet for undocumented immigrants. He will not say exactly where in New Jersey he would like to place the first billboard, concerned that publicity about its location might scare off the owner. A company that owns a billboard in Arizona recently rejected his attempt to place an ad critical of US Senator John McCain, who co-sponsored the Senate immigration reform package with Massachusetts Senator Edward M. Kennedy. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz

She said, In the absence of a strong Democratic message, they [gays, guns, and God] play bigger. You're down in Appalachia [Kerry lost Kentucky, West Virginia, and Indiana by between 13 and 21 percentage points], you don't hear anything about how you're going to get a job, how your kids are going to get a better education, or how you're going to get healthcare. So the Republicans come in and say [the Democrats] are going to take your gun away, take their Bibles away. What they did was clever. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, she said,	 Part of the message, she said, has to include Iraq. The Bush administration, Pelosi said, was wrong on the premise going in, wrong on the reception we would receive, wrong on the reconstruction and how soon Iraq could pay for it, and wrong on an exit strategy of mission accomplished. Wrong, wrong, wrong, and wrong, and they say 'stay the course.' </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he says,	 As elaborate as Indian-American weddings can be, says Sorabh Kapoor, they're relatively modest compared to weddings in India, where ceremonies can go on for a week. The Kapoors are first-generation Indians who came to the area from New Delhi about 25 years ago. The Kapoor family returns often to India to visit, look for new dishes, and sometimes attend family weddings. My niece had 18 ceremonies, says the elder Kapoor. Here, he says, because of the number of weddings, the Hyatt is discussing putting in a tandoor so that the portable ones won't have to be rolled in under the hotel kitchen's exhaust fans. Last year, Bombay catered about 80 weddings, and the father and son expect to do more than 100 this year. They keep their prices below those of many other caterers - about $24 per guest for a casual buffet to $34 for a sit-down dinner. The events are also good advertisements for his restaurants, says Kapoor, who is thinking about buying a hotel in the western suburbs with his son. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz

FOREIGN  With story BC-MIDEAST-NYT  Israel on Wednesday suffered its worst casualties in southern Lebanon since the current conflict with Hezbollah started, as thousands of Israeli troops there fought house to house, and village to village, in an attempt to create a buffer zone that Israel hoped would be filled by a multinational peacekeeping force. Israeli officers on the border said there were thousands of soldiers in the south of the country engaged in very heavy fighting.  We plan MIDEAST--Update map 0727 -- 3 x size to be determined  Detailed look at border area where Israeli soldeirs killed. Inset of daily developments  With story BC-GEORGIA-UNREST-NYT  Georgian special forces pressed their attacks through the mountainous Kodori Gorge on Wednesday, trying to put down a rebellious militia whose leader had said he would no longer recognize the central government. The clashes marked the second day of fighting in the remote river valley near the Russian border, and occurred amid worries that the violence could spark renewed hostilities between pro-Western Georgia and the breakaway republic of Abkhazia, which is a de facto Russian protectorate.  0727 TOTAL VOLUME -- 27p x 1 7/8 -- NYSE, Nasdaq &amp; Amex: declines/advances  All of our photos and graphics can be seen at www.nytimages.com.

, I said,	 The following day, as we trudged through Venice with the kids, Rita asked me if I wanted to cook again. Of course, I said, thinking of a refreshing Turkish fish soup recipe I knew. It was a broth made from a boiled fish that you thickened with eggs and lemon juice just like a Greek avgolemono. I got on the phone with Paolo and asked him to buy a fish - nothing too fancy - and decided that the other ingredients could come from the garden. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz

, he said,	 The skull is all-purpose, said Sasha Frere-Jones, a music critic at The New Yorker. It simultaneously refers to horror movies, to the Misfits and, by extension, all punk rock, and to a generalized culture of blackness and spookiness and the larger, mall-Goth culture. So, he said, if you're really at heart a Goth, but you have friends who are into metal and punk, you can rock the skulls and be friends with all of them. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he said,	 Are you sure? he asked. Then he explained that BMW would include a year's free satellite service (worth more than $100) with factory installation. Also, he said, the feature would be better integrated electronically with a bunch of other confusing features my husband cares about. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he said,	 But some say a parent's suggestion to spend Saturday night with the upstanding son of a business acquaintance is not the same as meddling in college admissions or helping complete a term paper to beef up a grade. Contomanolis said it is not much different from a parent's suggesting a child call a family friend who runs a company that needs some business administration graduates. It would be problematic, he said, only if parents were carting in potential mates as the parents did in My Big Fat Greek Wedding. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, she said,	 But Johnson, the consultant, said it can be. Many parents and their adult children are already too enmeshed, she said, making the children fragile. And when a person's most intimate connection is with a parent, he or she is likely to have trouble communicating with peers. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, she said,	 Parental love is unconditional, she said, so children do not learn the art of compromise, negotiation and accepting that they and their partners will never be perfect, skills needed for a real relationship. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, she said,	 They know it, and it works for them. But, she said, she would rather remain single than marry anyone her parents recommended. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, she said,	 The relationship between Leslie Arker and her husband was easy from the beginning, she said, even though they had never met. They had similar upbringings and an instant comfort level because they knew some of the same people and places. The couple married in March 2002. They have a daughter, Emily, 2, and they are expecting their second child in September. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, they claimed,	 Supposedly Tuesday's 9:45 a.m. cocktail service had nothing to do with Fox's going last among all the major commercial networks flogging their fall lineups here. The Bloody Marys and mimosas, they claimed, were simply meant to help tout a new sitcom called Happy Hour. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he said,	 Whole Foods' new moves, he said, have as much to do with competition as with his criticisms. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, she says,	 Even after the regional center opened in the early 1990s, she and other farmers were still able to sell to individual stores. But about six years ago, she says, word came down from Whole Foods that we mustn't make these deliveries, so we stopped doing it. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, she said,	 In the bigger picture, she said, Whole Foods has learned that the centralized model isn't the whole answer when it comes to food. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz

, he said,	 What remains to be seen, he said, is how far Whole Foods will go to meet the promise of those summertime grocery bag slogans and store signs. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, they argued,	 Not all the times were happy. Ann Buchwald died of lung cancer in 1994. She is buried on the Vineyard. Art Buchwald, Wallace and Styron all had severe periods of depression. But they handled it well. They called themselves the Blues Brothers, and when Styron's memoir of depression, Darkness Visible, became a best seller Wallace and Buchwald demanded a piece of the action because, they argued, they had talked Styron out of killing himself. (They got a dinner at the Four Seasons, and that's it.) </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he argues,	 And that, he argues, is what artists often do: draw attention to what we usually overlook, to the intangible but very present atmosphere, charged with emotion and meaning, that connects one human being to the next. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, it seems,	 Even superheroes, it seems, are powerless against attorneys. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, it seems,	 For a long time, it seems, being a great artist -- a skilled manual worker, as Samuel Johnson put it -- was enough. For Bach and Mozart, for Rembrandt and Titian, even for Shakespeare, their art was their job. Their output was valued, but in a social order dominated by church, royal court and wealthy patrons, their standing was not high. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, they said,	 Legal scholars said the closeness of the Washington and New York decisions suggests that the legal status of same-sex marriages will remain unsettled and controversial. That alone, they said, represents a significant change in public and judicial attitudes. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, she said,	 Justice Bobbe J. Bridge went further, equating the majority's position with the endorsement of racial discrimination. The majority, Bridge wrote, contended that it is not our place to require equality for Washington's gay and lesbian citizens. Under that reasoning, she said, there would have been no Brown v. Board of Education, the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court school desegregation case. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, she wrote,	 Madsen repeatedly emphasized the limited nature of the court's ruling. All that was required for the 1998 law to pass constitutional muster, she wrote, was some rational basis. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, she said,	 She added that the judges should not in any event set public policy. The state of the law banning gay marriages may yet change, she said, but not because five members of this court have dictated it. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he added,	 He said it would be especially important to find out if the vaccine still worked if the bird flu virus began to change genetically. It is too early, he added, to say what the government's plans might be for buying and stockpiling this vaccine. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he said,	 Even so, he said, it would make sense for the government to stockpile about 40 million doses of the GlaxoSmithKline product and start using it if a pandemic began. If the vaccine worked, more could be made; if it did not, crash production of another vaccine would be needed. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, I think,	 A: He said the same thing about Hugh Jackman -- he'd never seen Hugh in anything. He doesn't go out much. The guy makes movies, plays his clarinet, has his family and whatever. That's his life and always has been. He wasn't trying to be funny, I think, but it was just very funny when I met him. He was just like Woody Allen! </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, she said,	 While it is unknown exactly how learning about art helps literacy skills, she said, the hypothesis is that the use of both talking about art and using inquiry to help students tease apart the meaning of paintings helps them learn how to tease apart the meanings of texts, too. They apply those skills to reading. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he replied,	 Asked if there are any limits for A&amp;M football, he replied, Not in time, I don't think there are. Moments later, he clarified: When I say time, I'm not talking about years. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he said,	 This soldier - and most others interviewed - said that Israel's ground troops are fully capable of dealing with Hezbollah, but that defeating the group will require classic, house-to-house foot soldier warfare. The officers in charge of the Israeli offensive so far have come from the air force and armored corps, he said, and therefore have little experience deploying foot soldiers and special forces. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he said,	 That would take so long, he said, that you'd never catch up. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, they say,	 Outraged Democrats, as well as some Republicans, have countered that the president is blatantly breaking the FISA law by spying on U.S. citizens without a warrant. While the president does have constitutional powers during wartime, they say, Congress can limit those powers, and already has by establishing FISA. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, I think,	 The committee was encouraged by positive responses in polling conducted within the international Olympic movement. The fact that we're taking three cities forward at this point, I think, reflects on the optimism we heard in our polling, said USOC vice president Bob Ctvrtlik, who also is a member of the International Olympic Committee. We've inched a little further towards going forward. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he said,	 Ali Ali, who has been in the U.S. for seven years and is also a U.S. citizen, said khat use is not that common here and agreed with Said's 5 percent figure. Khat, he said, is sometimes hard to find and sometimes you can get it. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he says,	 For much of their time in the business, particularly in the vinyl-LP days, Williams' legal career subsidized the music venture. Now, he says, The record company's actually become profitable. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he adds,	 The Internet is a great equalizer in a lot of ways, Schneider says. A lot more people can participate. In fact, he adds, some musicians grumble that the business has become a little too open, with so much music available that it supersaturates the market. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he said,	 Afterward, at a visit to Fort Belvoir, Va., with Bush, Warner and other leaders, al-Maliki thanked U.S. troops and said how appreciated those who had lost their lives for Iraq. He told the gathered troops that he could relate to those families who had lost loved ones -- he had been sentenced to death under the regime of Saddam Hussein, he said, and had lost 67 relatives to executions. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he added,	 Chirac, who did not rule out French participation in a force or even command of it, also said that an international force could only be deployed after a cease-fire and a solid political agreement between the parties was in place. In the absence of a political agreement, he added, an international force would not have the capacity or the mandate to disarm Hezbollah, which he said had to be done by the Lebanese authorities. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz

Mary Landrieu, a Democrat from Louisiana, one of four Gulf Coast states -- the others are Texas, Mississippi and Alabama -- that stand to reap millions of dollars in federal revenue-sharing under either the House or Senate plan.

, it seems,	 Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx star as the undercover narcotics team Crockett and Tubbs. Their bond is a matter of professional loyalty, respect but not personal friendship. These are solitary, terse men whose lives are defined by their jobs. Their way of telling a colleague that they care is by standing vigil at the hospital bed, not rambling on about it. Part of the appeal of going undercover, it seems, is the chance to cast off their inhibitions, take life-or-death risks, and run off at the mouth. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz

, she said,	 For Basics (RCA), a double disc of 23 songs, Aguilera brought together the disparate talents of the rock songwriter and producer Linda Perry and DJ Premier, a producer best known for his work with rappers like Jay-Z and Nas. In addition to celebrating her new romance, Aguilera pays homage to the music that inspired her: jazz and blues from the 1920s, '30s and '40s, and soul.

One scout thinks Pedroia will make it based on his hustle and playing the game hard (like a David Eckstein). The consensus is he's better suited for second base. The Sox made a wise choice not handing him the job last offseason and bringing in Mark Loretta, who had an All-Star season. Of course, Kevin Youkilis didn't wow anyone at this time last season, either, and he wound up having a very good first full season.

, he said,	 Jets coach Eric Mangini has been generally pleased with the development of rookie offensive linemen D'Brickashaw Ferguson and Nick Mangold. Both will open the season in the starting lineup, with Ferguson at left tackle and Mangold at center. But against the Giants a week ago, Ferguson had a pair of false-start penalties, the second on a fourth-and-1 at the Giants' 28. The Jets had gone to a hard count to try to draw the Giants offside and instead Ferguson jumped. Mangini was incensed and pulled him from the game for a quarter. Upon reflection, a calmer Mangini said, If it's fourth-and-1 and he jumps offsides, that's a problem. And last week, there was another penalty. That's a problem. It's focus. Focus isn't about how old you are, how many years you've been in the league, whether you're a rookie, whether you're a veteran. It's focus. And that's why he came out. When Ferguson was asked about the problem, he said, I just messed up a little bit, but I'll refocus for the next one. I've just got to focus in a little bit better, and really clean that up.

, he said,	 Most of what's been said in this area is based on quick observation and not long-term content analysis, said Jim Guth, a political science professor at Furman University in South Carolina who studies religion in politics. He noted there were no court challenges in 1954, when Congress inserted under God into the Pledge of Allegiance. And while President Bush's faith-based rhetoric is the subject of lengthy analysis, former President Franklin D. Roosevelt engaged in far more religious discussion. We tend to think that we noticed it, and this was yesterday, and so it must be a change from the past. That's not always the case, Guth said. Green agreed, noting the intense religious involvement against slavery leading up to the Civil War, the fierce debates over Darwinism during the Scopes trial of the 1920s and the fear that when John F. Kennedy ran for president he would take orders from the pope. The current political era, he said, isn't the most intense, but is more intense than many times. What's new is a division based on religiosity rather than affiliation, Green said. As European ethnic groups have assimilated into American society, many of the religious divisions that once defined them -- and by extension, their political identities -- also have dissolved, Green said. In its place, analysts agreed, is a division between two larger groups: those of Judeo-Christian denominations who are religious, and those who are not. At the same time, social and cultural issues that cut to the core of many religious beliefs -- such as abortion and gay marriage -- have soared to the top of the political agenda. Instead of having a division between religious traditions, what you tend to have is a difference between people who have a more traditional religiosity, whether they are Catholics or Protestants or Jews, and people who have less religiosity, Green said. As best as we can tell, this division between religiosity and secularity has never happened (before), he said. Mark Silk, head of the Leonard E. Greenberg Center for the Study of Religion at Trinity College, called it a pluralism of people of faith. When it comes to faith-based outreach, Silk said, the George W. Bush view of the world is 'us against them,' -- but the 'us' is fairly inclusive. While the impact the issue will have at the polls this fall remains to be seen, some are predicting that its influence will eventually wane. This intensity will continue, certainly through 2008, Green said. But if history is any guide, it will (go away) eventually. And it could just be because people are tired of fighting. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060902.0216 type=story > <HEADLINE> AN ISLAND WHERE EVEN MILLIONS AREN'T ENOUGH </HEADLINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz

, he said,	 Yet Liberty's buffed-up bottom line can be deceiving. A widespread lack of housing in New Orleans, McDonald acknowledged, has meant that the bank has fewer employees than it needs.

FOREIGN  With story BC-AFGHAN-NYT  When the Taliban fell, a southern provincial capital seemed like fertile ground for the United States-led effort to stabilize the country. For 30 years during the cold war, Americans carried out the largest development project in Afghanistan's history there. Afghans called this city Little America. Today, Little America is at the epicenter of a Taliban resurgence and explosion in drug cultivation.  We moved AFGHAN--Lashkar Gah map -- 21p6 x 3  Locator map.

With story BC-BRAZIL-POLITICS-NYT  On the campaign trail with the leftist presidential candidate challenging Brazil's president, contending that he has abandoned his leftist roots. She has no chance of winning but is causing a major stir that could influence the outcome.  Of all the aristocratic white families who settled in this country, one is more famous than them all, the Delameres. But Thomas Cholmondeley, the scion of the family, is no longer here. He's in Kamiti maximum security prison awaiting trial in a murder case that is dividing Kenya -- his second killing in a year of a black Kenyan.  Last week, the California legislature decided that a statue of Thomas Starr King should be replaced in the National Hall of Statuary on Capitol Hill by one of a more modern Republican who shared a similar gift of gab: Ronald Reagan. The vote, which passed nearly unanimously just before the end of the state's legislative session on Thursday night, was hailed by state Senator Dennis Hollingsworth, its author, as a fitting nod to the Great Communicator.  Five years after the World Trade Center towers collapsed in a vortex of dust and ash, government officials have only recently begun to take a role in the care of many of the 40,000 responders and recovery workers who were made sick by toxins(as in mercury and asbestos) at ground zero.  The New York Times Bestseller lists for the week: hardcover, paperback and kids'.  FINANCIAL  With story BC-AMERICAN-EAGLE-NYT  Fifteen years ago, as the head of men's and women's fashion at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, husband and wife team Michele and Charles Martin decreed a new dress code for American teenagers, filled with baggy cargo pants, weather-beaten rugby jerseys and frayed, athletic T-shirts. Today, however, the Martins have a very different mission: to wean 30 year-olds off those clothes.  Soon after Specialist Michael Potocki was shot and killed in June, the soldiers in his platoon agreed on their goal for the months ahead: to survive and make it home alive. Survival may be the only thing the troops here agree on. The first death of a comrade in battle is always an emotional shock, and the views from the foxhole here are probably as varied as the 34 soldiers. Still, in this hostile stretch of western Iraq, some of the troops have begun to wonder if the presence of United States forces here is worth the cost in American lives.

Instead, it uses an analysis that indicates the company is worth far less, based on multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization at other auto parts companies. To justify the top bonus, it argues, the company's cash flow would need to double or better from 2005 levels. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz

Mikhalitsyn said that the fake Biseptol was nearly impossible for a doctor or patient to tell from the real one and would work just as well. Bactrim is used to treat children's ear infections and urinary tract infections, according to Jose F. Flores, an American internist at the SOS clinic in Moscow.

All of Lufthansa's flights have been nonsmoking since 1989, he said, adding, Passengers and we as an airline have been happy with it. Meanwhile, the anti-smoking movement appears to be gaining ground in Germany.

, he said,	 McClellan said recently that physician payments would be cut 5.1 percent in 2007, with similar cuts in later years, if Congress took no action.

, they said,	 When aid officials arrived in Kabul in late 2001, they were shocked by the country's decrepit state. They had to build headquarters from scratch, they said, and contend with the lack of skilled Afghan workers. For remote areas like Helmand, it meant what assistance was available flowed in slowly. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz
, he said,	 Ali Ahmed Jalali, the country's interior minister from 2002 to 2005, said Afghan resentment of foreign peacekeepers was a myth. After 10 years of internecine civil war, he said, Afghans yearned for someone to step in. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz

, he said,	 Corruption was also undermining progress. A 28-year-old police recruit who asked not to be identified because he feared retaliation said he was disappointed when he returned from training to his district in Helmand.

, he said,	 In June, American officials dispatched an eight-man DynCorp saturation training team to Lashkar Gah. Brent Thompson, a 33-year-old former police officer from Dallas who heads the team, said American officials calculated that six Afghan policemen were dying for every soldier in the Afghan army who was killed. Half of the saturation team's two-week training course is devoted to teaching Afghan police military skills, like how to launch or survive an ambush. Thompson, who trained the police in Iraq for DynCorp, said the Afghan police were more poorly equipped than their Iraqi counterparts. In one recent Afghan class, he said, 40 police officers shared 15 rifles. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz

, he said,	 National pride and 27 years of revolutionary ideology, he said, make it impossible for Iran's theocratic regime to accept US domination in the Middle East or to sign on as a US client like the late shah, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, whose monarchy it overthrew in 1979. But, Leylaz added, Iran isn't strong enough to go it alone. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz

Mr. Wachtell, he said, told him that he had obligations and rights: the obligation to continue paying $10 million in monthly rent and the right to rebuild. Mr. Wachtell would also lead Mr. Silverstein's court battles seeking to double his insurance benefits, claiming that each plane constituted a separate occurrence, each reimbursable for $3.55 billion. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz

In the governor's Midtown office, Mr. Johnson said, he told Mr. Pataki that he would not be able to represent solely the narrow interests of the family survivors -- important as they are.

, he said,	 Which of the God models you follow is an accurate predictor of a number of factors, including race, political stances, even where you live, said Paul Froese, a Baylor sociologist who worked on the BISR project headed by Rodney Stark and Byron Johnson. For example, there is a strong gender differential in belief in God. Women, he said, tend toward the more engaged versions (types A and B), while men tend toward the less engaged and are more likely to be atheist. More than half the blacks in the study said they believe in the Authoritarian God. None surveyed said they were atheist. Lower-income and less-educated folk were more likely to worship god types A or B, while those with college degrees or earning more than $100,000 were more likely to believe in the Distant God or be atheists, the Baylor study concluded. Froese noted that the geography also seemed to correlate: Easterners disproportionately seem to believe in a Critical God; Southerners tend toward the Authoritarian God; Midwesterners worship the Benevolent God; and West Coast residents contemplate the Distant God. American Piety found also that God's anger alone (such as type C) does little to inspire religious participation. The authors suggest religion may most successfully motivate individuals through what it can offer them in spiritual intimacy and congregational connectivity rather than through demands backed by threats of divine punishment. Believers in an angry God tend to reject the idea that church and state are or can be separate, and are more likely to feel that one's religious faith is exclusively the correct path of righteousness. The belief that God is engaged in the world also is associated with higher expressions of religious involvement and commitment, the study found.

, he said,	 Executed in conjunction with the Gallup Organization, the national, random sampling of more than 1,700 English-speaking adults was conducted from October to December last year. The margin of error is plus or minus four percentage points. Through telephone surveys, or a 16-page form, participants answered almost 400 questions on spiritual beliefs and practices. Baylor researchers say it's the most comprehensive study of its kind in more than 40 years. Byron Johnson, professor of sociology and director of the Baylor Institute for Studies of Religion, says American Piety will change the way religion is studied in this country. This nation's beliefs and practices have not been probed in such detail since a 1960s study by Rodney Stark, then with the University of California at Berkeley. Stark now works for Baylor as BISR co-director with Johnson Johnson said analysis of the responses will offer a snapshot of American religious life in the early 21st century. Specifically, we examined the religious identities claimed by Americans, their experiences, activities, images of God, beliefs about heaven, views about the role of religion in politics, and even the consumption of religious goods, he said. Survey areas covered are tantalizing, including the war on terror; whether God truly favors one political party over another; the viewpoints of the faithful when it comes to paranormal matters such as horoscopes; and the impact of the bestselling novel The Da Vinci Code on believers. Getting agnostic and even atheist participation on Baylor's religion survey didn't seem to be a problem, he added. Although 10.8 percent did not claim any affiliation with any faith family or house of worship, only 5.2 percent of those surveyed declared themselves to be atheists. Bader said Baylor is only just beginning to mine the data for more insights into the American religious spectrum. When the next phase of the study is conducted in 2007, he said, he hopes not only to see how images of God have changed in the two-year interim, he also hopes to add other study modules as well. For example, he wants to probe racial and ethnic diversity, and gather more data on nondenominational worship. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz

, he adds,	 Col. Gilberto Perez, the commander of the institute, dismisses Bourgeois' depiction of the institute. Perez says the school promotes peace and security and teaches soldiers human rights and efficiency in the fight against Latin American corruption and crime, including the drug trade, which, he adds, infringes on the lives of the same people Bourgeois is bent on defending. </P> 	nyt_eng_200611.gz

, you see,	 I think it's a little insensitive to say those massacres were years ago, Bourgeois retorts. When the Pentagon says, 'We're putting the past behind us,' people in Latin America say, 'Who are you to put the past behind us?' For them, you see, the past still haunts the present. </P> 	nyt_eng_200611.gz
, he knows,	 For Bourgeois, sitting in on classes at the institute is not what is important: He thinks it is immoral that Americans are teaching their Latin counterparts how to kill.

, he said,	 Tom Oyen, who is president of the Chimney Sweep Online (chimneysweeponline.com), a retailer of hearth products, said one option is a fireplace insert. With an insert, he said, the firebox sits inside the fireplace opening, with the front extending several inches out past the opening. To keep the insert's heat from being absorbed by the walls of the fireplace and eventually lost, the firebox is encased in a larger metal box (called a plenum) that is vented to the room. </P> 	nyt_eng_200611.gz
, he said,	 In most cases, he said, when installing an insert, it is also necessary to install a chimney liner. The standard fireplace chimney is going to be way too big to properly vent a wood stove, he said, adding that the liner is a flexible stainless steel tube about 6 inches in diameter. The liner is routed down the chimney and connected directly to the stove. A sealer plate at the top of the chimney covers the space between the liner and the chimney walls, thereby allowing for removal of the damper. </P> 	nyt_eng_200611.gz

, he said,	 The department's commissioner, Stephen H. Burrington, said the higher figure is a result of a far more detailed audit earlier this year of the state's parks, forests, parkways, pools, hockey rinks, beaches, and historical sites. Still, he said, the $143 million dedicated to capital improvements this year has left the state in a good position to begin dealing with the backlog. The cuts, he said, include money earmarked for legislators' pet projects - a frequent target of Romney's wrath - and may not drastically impact the parks' maintenance budget. </P> 	nyt_eng_200611.gz
, they said,	 But environmental groups say the cuts will be likely to add to the financial burden as the state fails to perform basic maintenance on properties. They point to decrepit bathhouses, potholed state parkways, and lack of staff at many state parks as evidence of the need for more, not less, maintenance money. While some money may be earmarked, they said, not all of it is. </P> 	nyt_eng_200611.gz
, you know,	 I want to make good on this notion of a new partnership, and, you know, it's a great way to surface where we agree and where we don't, and then start working on those compromises. One of the reasons the budget takes so long right now is that there is nearly no consultation between the executive branch and the legislative branch. They're completely separate. It's a huge waste of time, and there is a lot of wasted money, I think, as well. So I want to try to do this earlier, and that means starting now. </P> 	nyt_eng_200611.gz
, you know,	 No, in some ways they did. But in many ways ... I've been trying to explain to you guys what's happening for the longest time, and you get glimpses of it, but you miss it. And that's OK, because we didn't build it and people didn't join it for the media. They joined it because there's a hunger out there for a sense of community, and you will find first of all that people will keep some of this together just because of this sense of community. They'll keep that going, you know, when it comes to library renovations or block parties or safe-streets initiatives and so forth. That doesn't have to come from me. What we have to do is, on occasion, remind people that it's important to stay together. The reason I push back a little when you say people got what they wanted, is that people understand they were checking in not just to win a campaign. It really is a cause. And if all we do is go up there and do the same old, same old, that will be the biggest disappointment for people. </P> 	nyt_eng_200611.gz
, you know,	 We have not thrust them forward, and the media have been generally respectful of that. Diane was the one who was smart to say, 'Look, once we thrust them forward we'll never be able to pull them back.' So that has to be done on their timetable and when they feel ready. I think the constant second-guessing - we just can't live our lives always worried about what somebody's going to think. There's too much else to do, and I hope there isn't anything we do that, you know, is so bad. I don't think there is. We're as ready as we can be, but it's like the campaign. You think you're ready, but you don't know until you're in it. I would have never have dreamt of some of the stuff that came our way, some of the stuff that was of interest to the media. </P> 	nyt_eng_200611.gz
, he said,	 Ambassador Mark R. Dybul, head of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, said in a telephone interview from Guatemala City last week that the FDA process was critical for the long-term viability of the program because the review lessened the risk for poor quality drugs, which might increase rates of resistance. The government, he said, always has wanted the lowest cost product as long as it was safe and effective. </P> 	nyt_eng_200611.gz
, he said,	 In that conflict, Hamas watched Hezbollah's army-like discipline and antitank rockets deny the much-stronger Israeli army a decisive victory.

TOP  Lede story (1-col. hed):  IRAQ-BUSH (Washington) -- President Bush delivered a vote of confidence to Iraq's prime minister on Thursday and rejected calls to begin a drawdown of American forces in Iraq, pushing back on a decision by an independent bipartisan panel to call for a gradual withdrawal. But Bush may find that his firm insistence that he will not accept any timetable for withdrawing American troops will come up against a competing view taking hold here: that it is in the interests of both the United States and Iraq to reduce the American military presence there starting no later than the middle of next year. By John M. Broder and Sheryl Gay Stolberg.  With photos NYT 1-8.  (An early lede has moved. A writethru is scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in i news file.)  With a weave to:  IRAQ-BUSH-ASSESS (Washington) -- In the cacophony of competing plans about how to deal with Iraq, one reality now appears clear: Despite the Democrats' victory this month in an election viewed as a referendum on the war, the idea of a rapid American troop withdrawal is fast receding as a viable option. By David E. Sanger.  (Scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in i news file.)  Top right center (1-col. hed):  WVA-MEDICAID (Hamlin, W. Va.) -- No question, John Johnson is a doctor's nightmare. Speaking from the easy chair where he spends his days in a small wood house, his left trouser leg folded by a safety pin where a limb was lost to diabetes, Johnson lighted another cigarette. Johnson, 61, a former garbage man, goes to a clinic once a month for diabetes checkups and takes insulin. His bills are paid by taxpayers through Medicaid. When doctors urged him to mind his diet, he recalled, I told 'em I eat what I want to eat and the hell with 'em. But ignoring doctors' orders may exact a new price among West Virginia's Medicaid recipients, as the state begins a plan to reward responsible patients with significant extra benefits and -- as critics describe it-- to punish poor people who do not join weight-loss or anti-smoking programs by taking away important services. By Erik Eckholm.  AFRICA-SEX-ABUSE (Sambava, Madagascar) -- Even as Sub-Saharan Africa races to adopt many of the developed world's norms for children, from universal education to improved nutrition to limits on child labor, one taboo -- child sexual abuse -- remains stubbornly resistant to change. In much of the continent, child advocates say, perpetrators are shielded by the traditionally low status of girls, and a lingering view among many that sex with children, particularly by relatives, does not constitute a criminal offense. By Sharon LaFraniere.  REPUBS-GOVS-MCCAIN (Doral, Fla.) -- Sen. John McCain of Arizona turned up here on Thursday for a surprise stop at the Republican Governors Association -- the group headed by Mitt Romney, the Massachusetts governor who happens to be McCain's main rival for the Republican Party nomination in 2008. McCain's appearance here -- which included eight hours of nonstop meetings -- gave Romney a reminder that he cannot take the support of his fellow governors for granted. By Adam Nagourney.  PROSTATE-CANCER-TREAT (Undated) -- The nearly 240,000 men in the United States who will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year have one more thing to worry about: Do their doctors have a big financial stake in choosing their treatments? Among several widely used treatments for prostate cancer, one stands out for its profit potential. The approach, a radiation therapy known as IMRT, can mean reimbursement of $47,000 or more a patient. Critics see a potential conflict of interest on the part of urologists, the specialists who typically help prostate patients choose a course of treatment. The critics say that urologists who can profit from IMRT may be less likely to recommend other proven approaches. Part of a series. By Stephanie Saul.  SPY-POISON (London) -- In the latest turn in the mystery surrounding Alexander Litvinenko, the former Russian spy who died of radiation poisoning here a week ago, the British government said on Thursday that radiation had been detected in 12 locations around London, and that it was likely to be found in more.
