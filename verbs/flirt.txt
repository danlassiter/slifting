"155141"	"they"	"flirt"	" Hanfling says he knows guys whose only mission is to conjure a fling out of a wedding. He's observed it many times: Two people meet at a wedding, they flirt, they get together at night. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"170083"	"they"	"flirt"	" The most remarkable thing about Queens, a silly but generous Spanish farce from the writer and director Manuel Gomez Pereira, is its unadulterated worship of middle-aged women. Not one of its five female leads will see 50 again (and two have stared down 60), yet the movie cheerfully crams them into lethal heels, cleavage-baring frocks and enough lip gloss to grease a long-distance swimmer. Thus adorned, they flirt, frolic and have fabulously wicked sex. Viva Espana! </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
