It's a military term that describes the target of a bomb or missile that fighter pilots can't see, but it could apply just as well to broadcasters covering the war in Afghanistan. Television crews from Atlanta-based Cable News Network and their competitors from around the world had rushed to the landlocked nation in hopes of being in the right place at the right time.

"101291"	"he"	"hoped"	" The form listed the identification number the owner needed to install the program. In an adjacent room, a tattered page from an undated Flying magazine listed the flight training schools in the United States. One resident of the house apparently had dreams of designing a new high technology fighter jet. Pakistan, he hoped, could produce the plane for itself and the Taliban regime. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"101882"	"they"	"hoped"	" So the Orangemen were feeling pretty good about landing St. Pierre. They had done all the right things. Said all the right things.

"108517"	"it"	"hoped"	" That seemed more than enough to everyone except the Bush administration, which immediately caved in to the industry and put the snowmobile rule on hold along with a host of other Clinton-era regulations like the one reducing arsenic levels in drinking water. It also ordered up another environmental study from the Park Service that, it hoped, would demonstrate that the industry could produce a new generation of cleaner, quieter machines capable of coexisting with nature. The study is now complete, and _ no surprise _ it shows that even state-of-the-art snowmobiles will not be significantly cleaner or quieter. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"

"127751"	"we"	"hoped"	" Designed for music practice, all three products promised, among other things, to change the key of recorded music in small increments while maintaining the tempo. That function would enable a baritone to sing with recordings of Puccini's tenor aria ``Nessun Dorma'' in our living room, if not at the World Cup. The two computer programs and the CD player can also change the speed of music without altering pitch. That function, we hoped, would adjust the music to Michael's tempo just as a live accompanist would. Our goal was to create karaoke with a brain. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"129340"	"he"	"hoped"	" Brown said he came to the funeral in order to show respect to a brother in public service and, he hoped, to begin his own transition back into a world in which a mysterious sniper seemed to lurk behind every corner. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"

"133860"	"he"	"hoped"	" Only a year ago, Law was one of the brightest stars in the constellation of leadership in the American Catholic church. He began his priestly career in 1961 in a parish in Natchez, Miss., fighting for civil rights. He was named archbishop of Boston in 1984 and was elevated to cardinal the following year. Throughout his career, he worked as a builder of bridges of understanding between Catholics and Jews. More recently, he hoped, had he not been engulfed in scandal, to have contributed to the national dialogue on a possible US war in Iraq. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"134400"	"I"	"hoped"	" Despite its title, the novel ``Nicholas Nickleby'' is about all the Nicklebys: Nicholas; his mother; his sister, Kate; and his uncle, Ralph. The most gripping and engaging of the stories is Nicholas' struggle to find security and happiness for his mother, his sister and himself, while Ralph seeks to separate and then crush the family. I decided to retain or eliminate each element of the novel based on its relevance to that story. I chose to have fewer characters but to give them more time to develop, in a way that would, I hoped, deepen the audience's connection to them. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"138933"	"we"	"hoped"	" There existed a camaraderie among writers of all shades, and a more spirited literary life than anything to be found today. We wrote in a common language, English, we read from the same platforms, we appeared together in the lists of writers banned and, together, our books vanished from the shelves. Of course, it was an unequal camaraderie. White writers owned shelves, black writers owned nothing. But that, we hoped, would be redressed later. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200312.gz"
"140353"	"he"	"hoped"	" At Breakers, Harris was pulling out all the stops with Keyes and the other interns, massaging their shoulders, mentioning that he works out five times a week, impressing them, he hoped, with his cue shots and quick wit. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"141534"	"they"	"hoped"	" The drafters of the 1876 Texas Constitution created a part-time citizen Legislature that, they hoped, would be more responsive to the people than a full-time, more professional Legislature would be. What they didn't foresee, though, was how susceptible a part-time, low-paid Legislature would become to the influence of full-time, monied special interests. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"141612"	"I"	"hoped"	" At $90.98, the bid also was clever enough, I hoped, to appeal to those witty guys and girls at Google, who ultimately have sway over the IPO price. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"141958"	"she"	"hoped"	" As she spoke, her hands moved quickly across everything -- his rocks, his clothes, his magazines and comic books. A wash of sadness came over her. I'm tired, she said.

She had gift baskets to open, a funeral to organize and, she hoped, generals and soldiers to see. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20040828.0010 type=story > <HEADLINE> EDITORIAL: ECONOMIC REALITY BITES </HEADLINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"142084"	"we"	"hoped"	" Not that our family was a model of financial restraint. We generally are not a family of shoppers, yet in the days before our son's departure, our dining room resembled a staging area for a light infantry unit. Bedding supplies were stacked in one corner, and in another were boxes of electrical and electronic gadgets. Our supply depot also included 16 boxes of facial tissue, three tubes of toothpaste and a six-pack of shaving cream -- enough, we hoped, to last at least the first semester. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"143005"	"he"	"hoped"	" The most frequently heard complaint was that by finding a middle ground between the two, Green was doing justice to neither. For his part, Green was at peace with his choice one day after announcing it and, he hoped, putting the matter to bed. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"144741"	"he"	"hoped"	" In the past week, both candidates have concentrated on rural voters, especially in the Midwest. Bush campaigned in farm regions of Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin.

"145763"	"we"	"hoped"	" Thus began a kitchen odyssey that would, we hoped, end with a successful Thanksgiving feast for 13 at Shanna and Chris' Arlington Heights home -- as well as vicarious instruction and exciting recipes for Star-Telegram readers. The planning Between beginner and intermediate was how Shanna described her cooking skills. A teacher at Alice Carlon Applied Learning Center, she makes dinner for herself, Chris and 8-year-old daughter Graysen most nights, she told us, but only simple dishes such as spaghetti and tacos. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"152967"	"we"	"hoped"	" The light was ghostly on a recent overcast morning as Chris Harned and I pulled up at 5 a.m. outside the stately log home perched on a shoulder of Minckler Mountain. It would be a good morning for turkey hunting, we hoped, on my friend Steve Renehan's property -- a large parcel so diverse and rich that I sometimes think of it as a little nation unto itself. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"154070"	"he"	"hoped"	" Brown said that it would only be fitting if a series that went from dud to classic would be capped by a seventh game that neither team played poorly enough to lose. Somebody, he hoped, would play well enough to win it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"156497"	"I"	"hoped"	" Three months into my tenure at the Annex, we all got the boot. I rented an apartment in the East Village. Krista stayed with me while she looked for a new place, and after that our friendship became one of lunches. We remained closer than two ex-roommates might, but not so close, I hoped, that I would continue to dwell on her broken relationship with Marcus. Still, the sense that I was watching needless tragedy only mounted in me. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"

"171765"	"he"	"hoped"	" According to the report, Ralston was repeatedly lobbied by Abramoff after she became a top aide to Rove, as her former boss sought to curry favor with her new one. Once a high-rolling operator who lavished gifts on lawmakers and officials -- in exchange, he hoped, for help with his clients -- Abramoff has become, in the midterm elections, synonymous with corruption. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"171969"	"he"	"hoped"	" Hirst said he found so much rich material that by the end of the 10th episode, the story had only reached 1530. By then, Henry was seeking papal approval for his divorce from Catherine so he could marry the lady-in-waiting Anne Boleyn (Natalie Dormer), who, he hoped, would give him a male heir.
