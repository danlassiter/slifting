Although many legal analysts have argued that the Supreme Court will -- and should -- be reluctant to overturn 32 years of precedent for Roe, Brownback argued that the court has overturned precedents many times.

He said FEMA would be housing people on cruise ships, in hotels, and in the travel trailers and mobile homes, which he said the agency is buying in the tens of thousands.

, he figured,	 A bigger concern for Samsonov in recent months has been the recurring migraine headaches that cut short his stay in Russia early in the spring. In his case, recurring meant every day, for weeks on end, leading the 26-year-old left winger to a number of specialists - and a much later return to workouts than he expected. The delayed fitness routine, he figured, might have led to his ailing back. </P> 	nyt_eng_200509.gz

While playing in Russia, he did not take a serious hit to the head or a heavy blow elsewhere to the body, discounting any thought that the headaches could have been concussion-related. Doctors, he said, remain uncertain, offering him only the usual array of possibilities for migraine - typically stress, exercise, or diet as triggers. </P> 	nyt_eng_200509.gz
, he said,	 Now Brown has asked for an investigation of Ortiz's discovery, alleging a serious breach of scientific ethics.

, he said,	 With electronic records, Brown said, It's important for scientists to discuss what's OK and what is not. Richard Pogge, an Ohio State astronomer who uncovered the apparent breach, said that scientists had long lived mostly successfully by a kind of honor system.

"172177"	"it"	"cools"	" A. For starters, you do not need new skylights. That draft is probably not coming from an air leak or loss of heat into the great, cold beyond. What is happening is that the glass is so cold in winter that it creates its own draft: Warm air in the house wafts along the ceiling, and when it hits that glass, it cools, and drops, creating the self-draft. To prevent that draft, you can make a storm window of glass or acrylic and a wood or aluminum frame, and attach it to the wood trim around the skylight opening. Any kind of cover will do, including a thin layer of insulation, if you can stand closing off the skylight. To make a temporary storm to see if this cockamamie idea works, tape a piece of polyethylene to the wood trim. If it does work, then you can make a more permanent storm. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
