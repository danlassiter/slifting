"43877"	"it"	"testifies"	" D Generation; Speedball Baby; Trick Babies. Coney Island High, 15 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 674-7959. The concept of rocking _ of being hard, loud and bad _ consumes these three New York City bands. It's in the way they dress, strut and play. D Generation sounds as if it's been weaned on the glam-rock of T. Rex and the New York Dolls and sings about its love-hate relationships with New York, its drugs and its hangers-on. Speedball Baby doesn't sing, it testifies, delivering preacher-style lyrics over dirty, dissonant rockabilly and punk. (Make sure you hold onto your drinks when the band's singer, Ron Ward, starts climbing on the tables.) The Trick Babies combine D Generation's '70s glam and punk influences, Speedball Babies' rockabilly revisits and a little bit of soul. Doors open at 8 p.m.; tickets are $10 in advance and $15 on the day of the show. _ N.S. Cryptic and Cerebral </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
