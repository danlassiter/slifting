Winston Link has been sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.) (lh) By WILLIAM GLABERSON c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service  WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ In a courtroom here Tuesday, O. Winston Link, the celebrated photographer, faced a dreary reality that seemed incompatible with the innocence of the bellowing steam engines and pot-bellied stoves in the photographs that made him famous.  The 81-year-old photographer, known for his black-and-white images of America's last steam engines, was here in a Westchester County courtroom to say that his former wife, Conchita Link, stole 1,400 of his prints worth more than $1 million. If she is convicted, she could, at 61, be sent to prison for as long as 25 years.  The Links' story of a late-life love that turned poisonous has been a centerpiece of art world gossip since their breakup in 1992. She said he had been abusive. He said she had isolated him and used chains to keep him in the basement of their Westchester home. He said she let people falsely conclude that he was suffering from Alzheimer's disease so she could take control of his work and his life.  Tuesday the battle reached its apex as Link told a jury how their marriage fell apart. On weekends, she would disappear from their house in South Salem, N.Y., he said. One day in 1991, he testified, he saw her packing what looked like boxes of his life's work into her car.  The prosecutor asked why Link did not stop her.  ``It could have been murder,'' Link said. ``Or damage to the prints.''  Was Link afraid of a confrontation?  ``Yes,'' he answered quietly.  In a day of detailed testimony that seemed intended to lay to rest any suggestion of mental confusion, Link was in command of details.  But sometimes, the emotion of the day seemed to get to him. In the hall before his testimony, Link said he no longer dwelled on his anger at his former wife or at Edward Hayes, the man who Link says helped her plot against him. Both have denied his charges, but Mrs. Link was found liable for $5 million in a civil suit by Link that included a divorce. She was also briefly jailed for contempt of a judge's order when she failed to turn over the photographs that are now the subject of the larceny charge.  But just as Link began his testimony, his voice broke and his eyes welled up. It happened as the prosecutor led him through the story of how he built the body of work that the prosecutors say she took from him. He told the jurors how, from 1955 to 1960, he waited in the nighttime darkness in Virginia for the last steam engines of the Norfolk &AMP; Western Railway to pass where he had set up with his lights.  The prosecutor, Kenneth C. Citarella, asked if executives at Norfolk &AMP; Western had cooperated. ``My God,'' Link said, ``they gave me the railroad.'' And with that memory of a distant kindness, he could not continue speaking for a while.  The jurors have heard gallery owners testify that Mrs. Link began to answer her husband's telephone in 1991 and 1992 and instructed them to send money to her. The witnesses have said Mrs. Link told them that her husband's health problems meant he could not work any more.  The trouble, Link told jurors, had started a few years earlier, when he suddenly discovered that he did not have any money. ``She took in all the checks,'' he said. ``I was busy making prints. I wasn't paying attention.'' The Links were married in 1984, just as he was becoming famous after years of obscurity.  (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)  Mrs. Link's lawyer, Darien J. Zoppo, has told the jurors little about her version of events. Zoppo said in an interview that Mrs. Link, a former real estate broker, is at a disadvantage in the criminal trial because she represented herself in the civil case and allowed evidence that indicated she once had some of Link's prints.  Still, Zoppo said, the prosecution must prove not only that she took the prints, which have yet to turn up, but also that they are worth more than $1 million to meet the legal requirement of grand larceny in the first degree.  When he was asked the defense's message to the jury, Zoppo answered, ``Will they be able to prove the taking, the value, and will they be able to prove that anything taken during the marriage didn't belong to her?''  Tuesday, Citarella moved Link thorough a painstaking explanation of how he did his work and how he kept his records.  Link held his own. He discussed f-stops. He described how he would adjust the electronic triggers for his lighting down to the thousandth of a second to catch the locomotives at just the right instant.  The prosecutor asked Link when he was married.  ``1984,'' the photographer said.  The month, the prosecutor asked.  ``December.''  The day?  ``Oh yeah, the 28th,'' Link said with the grin used by many happily married people as they work to remember that date. The grin quickly faded. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960709.0699 type=story > <HEADLINE> AMERICAN COMPANIES SET TO RESUME WORK ON INDIAN POWER PLANT </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> HOUSTON (BC-ENRON-INDIA-HNS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"

Twenty years ago, he and his wife, Eleanor, using profits from ``The Godfather,'' which he directed, bought 1,560 acres of the Inglenook winery, founded in 1879 by Gustave Niebaum, a Finnish fur trader and sea captain. When the property was put it up for sale last year, Coppola moved fast to buy it. ``A chance like this happens once in a lifetime,'' he says.

But underneath, the legs are moving, unhindered and graceful. During the Monday evening workouts in the Manhattan pool, the runners wear flotation belts while they jog, walk, sprint or hurdle in place for 45 minutes. It is hard work but easy on the joints.

NATIONAL _ GENERAL  (Moved in `p' category)  LAMM (Denver) _ Richard Lamm, who left public office a decade ago after serving three terms as governor of Colorado, announced on Tuesday that he would seek the presidential nomination of Ross Perot's Reform Party, setting up a possible showdown with Perot. By Ernest Tollerson.  LAMM-PROFILE (Denver) _ Blunt of speech and flinty of nature, Richard Lamm has long prided himself on displaying the hardness of his adopted Rocky Mountains. But as Colorado's former governor moves onto the national stage, the 60-year-old candidate for the Reform Party's presidential nomination will have to parry criticism that his hardness is harshness. By James Brooke.  DOLE (Richmond, Va.) _ As he did with the explosive issue of abortion, Bob Dole seemed to take another step toward the political center Tuesday, backing off his earlier opposition to an assault-weapons ban enacted two years ago. By Katharine Q. Seelye.  (Moved in `w' category)  CONGRESS-CYBERSPACE (Washington) _ As computer technology invades House and Senate offices, some members have taken to it like digitheads, organizing videoconferences with their constituents and designing fancy Web pages _ graphic links to the worldwide computer network _ with sound, video clips, even their favorite cookie recipes. Others have not yet thrown away their typewriters. Most are struggling somewhere in between. By Eric Schmitt. (With photos.)  MINIMUM-WAGE (Washington) _ After four months of incessant Democratic pressure, the Senate approved a bill Tuesday to raise the federal minimum wage to $5.15, virtually assuring a 90-cent-per-hour pay increase to more than 10 million Americans. The final vote was 74 to 24, with 27 Republicans joining all 47 Democrats in favor. But the crucial vote came earlier, on a Republican amendment that would have exempted many employers from paying the increased wage. Five Republicans broke ranks to join all 47 Democrats. By Eric Schmitt. (With photo and graphic.)  MINIMUM-WAGE-ASSESS (Washington) _ As a matter of pure politics, Republicans in Congress have handled the minimum wage as an exercise in snatching defeat from the jaws of defeat. Or at least snatching prolonged, painful defeat from the jaws of quick, change-the-subject defeat. By Adam Clymer.  (Moved in `a' category)  MISSISSIPPI-GOV (Jackson, Miss.) _ Even in the annals of rough and tumble disputes between chief executives and state legislators, Gov. Kirk Fordice's in-your-face style stands out. But the Mississippi governor's decision to appoint four white men to the board that governs the state's university system has touched off a battle royal with overtones of race and power politics. By Ronald Smothers.  SCHOOL-WORK-EDUC (Rochester, N.Y.) _ Two years after Congress passed the ambitious School-to-Work Opportunities Act, which is intended to blend the real-world skills offered by vocational schools with the academic rigors of college preparatory tracks, schools, parents, business executives and politicians are trying to gauge the initiative's success as the first full crop of graduates move from high school hallways to college campuses and corporations. By Mary B.W. Tabor. (With photo.)  PHOTO-CUSTODY (White Plains, N.Y.) _ O. Winston Link, the celebrated 81-year-old photographer, known for his black-and-white images of America's last steam engines, faced a dreary reality Tuesday in a Westchester County courtroom to say that his former wife, Conchita Link, stole 1,400 of his prints worth more than $1 million. If she is convicted, she could, at 61, be sent to prison for as long as 25 years. By William Glaberson. (With photo.)  DEL-MISSING (Wilmington, Del.) _ They are fighting hard to talk about Ann Marie Fahey in the present tense. But after 12 days, the family's confidence is flagging. Ms. Fahey, the appointments secretary for Gov. Thomas R. Carper, has not been seen in public since she and an acquaintance had dinner in a Philadelphia restaurant the night of June 27. The authorities have combed Ms. Fahey's apartment and her green Volkswagen Jetta, which sits at the curb across the street. But family members said investigators had told them they had found no evidence of foul play and could not consider anyone a suspect. ``It's like she vaporized,'' said her brother Robert Fahey, 38.

YUGO-BOSNIA-GRAVES (Cerska, Bosnia-Herzegovina) _ U.N. war crimes investigators, in the first attempt to exhume a mass grave in Bosnia, unearthed nearly a dozen bodies on Tuesday.

SPAIN-BULLRUNNING (Madrid) _ In a first, Pamplona's city hall has published a glossy brochure in English, French, and German disclosing the secrets of how to run with the bulls. The 16-item checklist arrived just in time for the weeklong annual San Fermin festival, which began on Sunday. ``A lot of people who come here are ignorant about running with the bulls,'' said Deputy Mayor Joaquin Pascal, adding that some people were beginning to think the event was ``less risky than jogging.''  EGYPT-APHRODISIAC (Mansura, Egypt) _ If it is true, as it is whispered here, that certain young women in this provincial capital have let their moral standards lapse, then no one wants to believe they fell prey to hormones alone. No, the cause _ the curse, it is said _ was ordinary-looking chewing gum laced with aphrodisiacs capable of transporting the most innocent female into a sexual frenzy. The potion's source, it is firmly believed here, is an Israel bent on corrupting pure Egyptian youth. By Douglas Jehl. (With photo and graphic.)

LAZARD-TRIAL (Boston) _ In a cavernous Boston courtroom, decorated with brass chandeliers and oil paintings of seascapes, a drama of kickbacks, corruption and big-ticket finance is unfolding. Each actor is a star: The judge brought cameras into his courtroom for the infamous New Bedford, Mass., pool-table rape case; the defense lawyer's client roster is a who's who of Boston politics, and the defendant was once a powerhouse in municipal finance. That defendant, Mark S. Ferber, 43, a former Lazard Freres partner, is fighting to stay out of jail. By Leslie Wayne. (With graphic.)

Whether for running or walking, aerobics or circuit training, arthritis or mastectomy therapy, water exercise is rising among many segments of the population _ competitive athletes, fitness enthusiasts, baby boomers, the young, the elderly, the overweight, the injured, the pregnant. By Judith Zimmer. (With photo and graphic.)  CULTURE  (Moved in `e' category)  SHAKESPEARE-SENIORS (New York) _ Two years ago, someone asked Bob Smith for a small favor. As a theater director who had spent much of his life thinking about Shakespeare, would he be willing to talk about Shakespeare, just once, at a senior citizens center connected to a theater at which he had worked? He did not exactly leap at the chance. But he agreed to do it. And what he found left him stunned _ a group of people whose range of experience and frame of reference illuminated plays he had known for years. By Janny Scott. (With photo.)  CURE-CONCERT-REVIEW (East Rutherford, N.J.) _ Like other pop stars, Robert Smith sings about love and kisses, dreams and tears. Teen-aged girls flock to the Cure's concerts to hear his songs confess that he's lonely, infatuated, suffering or giddy with desire. But he sings in a choked-up, distraught voice, and he doesn't fit the teen-idol prototypes of pretty boy or bad boy; like his most dedicated fans, he's gawky and fond of makeup. By Jon Pareles.

The book is the kiss-and-tell memoir of the political adviser who resigned from the Clinton team after it was revealed that he kissed-and-told-the-kissee about White House business.  The White House, which wasn't so enthusiastic about Morris' recollections being spread around via the magazine, made sure that Newsweek knew that a Barnes &AMP; Noble store in Manhattan was selling the book early. Somehow or other, a copy of the book turned up at the Washington Post, too.  All this prepublication publicity had the desired effect. Newsweek, which didn't want to pay for material that was by then available readily, said thanks but no thanks.  P.S. Meanwhile, Morris told Newsweek that selling his book is secondary to his No. 1 concern, reconciliation with his wife. ``The central goal of my life is to persuade Eileen McGann to come back to me, and the only way I can is by changing and persuading her that I've changed,'' he said.  ``People are always asking me, `What's next for you?' like `Who's your next client?' It's the last thing on my mind. .. What's next for me is to try to get married again to her.''  WHO SAID WHAT  ``I get into phases where I'll have the same thing every day. .. I once had the same thing for lunch every day for seven years: a Bob's Big Boy chocolate shake and coffee at 2:30 every afternoon. .. I once considered psychoanalysis because I thought I might talk to somebody about those cycles of things _ like lunches. I asked the man, `Could meeting with you affect my creativity?' and he said, `I have to be honest, it could,' and I said, `Thank you very much, goodbye.' ''  _ All about Hollywood, Chapter 1. Director David Lynch in Marie-Claire.  ``Kristin is slightly cool and aristocratic. But that's just how she protects herself from showing how vulnerable she is. And when you get glimpses of that fragility, it has this delicious sensation of discovery about it, of your thinking that you're the first person who has seen this in her. ... You feel like there's history in her. And pain.''  _ All about Hollywood, Chapter 2. Director Anthony Minghella describes Kristin Scott Thomas of ``The English Patient,'' in Buzz magazine.  JOE'S FUTURE  The latest issue of Food &AMP; Wine reads the tea leaves to make some fearless predictions about what's ahead for coffee drinkers:  _ Coffee beans will be sold like wine, identified by the name of the farm that grew the beans.  _ Kitchen gadgets to allow roasting in the privacy of one's own home.  _ Home coffee machines that grind the beans and brew the final drink, all in one gizmo.  _ Coffee presses brought to the tables of restaurants, as pepper mills are right now. ``Diners can watch the process,'' says Food &AMP; Wine, ``and be assured that the java is absolutely fresh.''  A PIT BULL BY ANY OTHER NAME  The San Francisco SPCA, which since July has been taking in pit bulls turned over by city-run Animal Care and &AMP; Control, has proclaimed that henceforth, those that pass qualifying tests will be known as St. Francis terriers, a suitably ``nice name.''  The first step in the dog's qualification process is when Animal Care &AMP; Control deems it adoptable. The animal is released to the SPCA for further screening with a series of tests. ``If they have good temperaments and pass good doggie behavior tests,'' says the SPCA's Lynn Spivak, ``then they get diplomas certifying them as St. Francis terriers. What we're trying to do is make sure people understand that these are canine good citizens.''  The prospective adopter gets tested, too. ``We put you through as much as we put the dogs through,'' says Spivak. ``We will visit your home; we talk to your neighbors, your employer, your landlord. We will thumbprint you and make sure to the best of our ability that you are on the up-and-up. We also microchip the dog so we know how to track it.''  Families who adopt St. Francis terriers are thereafter qualified to win $200 as ``ambassadors,'' going out into the community on behalf of the SPCA to spread word of the dogs' basic good nature. ``These can be wonderful companion animals,'' said Spivak. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19970116.0730 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-PHOTO-FULL-UPDATE-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> ATTENTION EDITORS: The following photos are part of tonight's N.Y.

EUROPE-U.S.-TRADE (Brussels) _ The European Commission says for the first time that it will consider paying compensation to U.S. beef producers as a way of settling American complaints about trade rules that exclude hormone-treated meat. Perhaps more importantly, the commission holds the idea out as a way of dealing with other similar trade disputes between the E.U. and U.S., where one side imposes what are clearly impermissible trade restrictions for domestic political reasons, like the steel dispute. While it may smooth over some frictions, the idea raises questions about the level of cynicism on both sides concerning the principles of free trade. By Paul Meller.

But the reason for investing in these tools of production has mostly focused on cutting costs rather than expanding output.

By Celestine Bohlen.  ARMENIAN-MUSEUM (Washington) _ It has become a political tradition here that every April 24, the president issues a statement to recall and deplore the massacre of Armenians in Ottoman Turkey in 1915. These annual statements have the dual purpose of recognizing a 20th-century tragedy and catering to an influential ethnic constituency. Within a few years, Armenian-Americans will have a new asset in their campaign to persuade politicians and others that what happened in 1915 was not just a spasm of mass killing but genocide. They are working to to raise about $75 million to build a museum here that will tell the story of this episode from the Armenian perspective. By Stephen Kinzer.

Of course it's not always theraputic to cook at home. Especially when it's your mother's home. An adventure in filial gastronomy. By Eric Asimov.  With recipes.  CHEFS-ON-LEAVE (New York) _ What happens to New York chefs when the take sabbaticals. Some have chosen to step away from the stove; others have had a hiatus forced upon them. But all of them are seizing the days to reconsider their style of cooking, their constricted way of living and, sometimes, nothing less than their profession. By Regina Schrambling.

WINE-TALK (Stellenbosch, South Africa) _ The weekly column: Coming back to South Africa after an absence of nine years is like meeting an old friend grown younger. The deep verdant valleys, the improbably beautiful mountains rising from the sea, the plants and flowers found nowhere else _ all rest immutable. But in and around them, one senses a new spirit, an eagerness to meet the world, not with defiance and resentment but with the pride that comes from building a new nation. Nowhere is this delight more evident than here in the wine country of the Western Cape. Indeed, wine could be taken as a metaphor for the new South Africa. Old-style wines, obsolete winemaking techniques and winemakers still living in the past are being pushed aside, sometimes gently, sometimes harshly, to make way for the new. By Frank J. Prial.

But make no mistake, California winemakers have been using those grapes for a long time. In the almost two-century history of California winemaking, it is French grapes, those now all-too-familiar cabernets and chardonnays, that are the newcomers. By Eric Asimov.

"113667"	"he"	"could"	" If Moussaoui could afford to pay his own lawyer, he could, of course, retain any counsel he wanted. He could screen his lawyers for piety and religion.

"113786"	"you"	"could"	" There was an importance in that moral recognition, however belated, an importance in seeing that this part of the duo who arrogantly imagined themselves above society's laws now recognized the claim of our moral code, an importance in knowing he was anguished about his brutal deed. Perhaps, seeing it, you could, along with immense sorrow for Zantops' family and friends, feel some small measure of sympathy for a young man who had lost his sense of right and wrong and, in letting criminal fantasies born in teenage boredom and bravado grow to murderous reality, had ruined his own life as well. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"114951"	"I"	"could"	" ``It was out of necessity. I figured if my mom could do it, I could, too,'' said Johnson, 33, a Smyrna, Ga., resident. ``My motivation was (the thought of) breaking down and looking under the hood and going, `Duh.' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"

"130255"	"they"	"could"	" Maybe, though, the coaches figured, if the Cowboys could minimize the game's freewheeling minutes, they could, in effect, shorten the game. Less game equals less time for mistakes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"131272"	"we"	"could"	" He said on CNN: ``There are a range of protective measures you can take within the yellow level; we are at the upper end of that range. And again, depending on the information we have available, we could, down the road, raise it to orange.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"

"132583"	"he"	"could"	" As The Economist recently put it, it's a bunch of guys in uniforms looking butch, pretending to scare terrorists.

"136240"	"they"	"could"	" These stockholders could add some or all of the company's per-share earnings to their cost basis _ the amount they have invested in the stock _ even though they haven't invested another dime. To put it another way: When these stockholders sell their shares, they could, for tax purposes, subtract from their per-share gains the per-share earnings of the company, and thus reduce their taxes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"138720"	"he"	"could"	" ``Yeah, he could,'' Tracy said. ``Health is obviously something that's very important. But has Eric Gagne proven to me that he has the wherewithal and durability to do things a little more often because he's capable? The answer is yes.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200311.gz"
"142401"	"he"	"could"	" Since Lemieux is both a player and an owner, he could, in effect, lock out himself.

"146772"	"it"	"could"	" Nothing much dramatically has changed between training this year and last year, he said. It isn't as though a week was taken away from the players.

"148621"	"it"	"could"	" A: Based on industrial studies, it could, said Dr. Mark Redfern, professor of bioengineering at the University of Pittsburgh, though the physiological reasons are not clear.

"148984"	"he"	"could"	" Allawi, a secular Shiite, a former member of the Baath Party, and a confidant of the CIA, casts a wide political net.

"156711"	"he"	"could"	" Before Running Man's tissue water was drained and replaced with silicone rubber to the deepest cellular level, he was a Chinese man who may or may not have enjoyed exercise.

"156890"	"you"	"could"	" Endangered species are covered by a complex web of local, state, federal and international laws and treaties, which include a number of exceptions. For instance, endangered big cats like tigers and leopards cannot be shipped across international borders, nor can they be shipped to buyers across state lines. But if you lived in Iowa and wanted to buy a tiger from another Iowa resident, you could, because Iowa laws allow ownership of such cats. (Roughly 10,000 tigers live as pets in the United States, compared with the 4,000 or so tigers that live in the wild throughout the world.) </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"159949"	"it"	"could"	" OpenDocument would enable records to be read by a variety of software packages other than Microsoft Office, which now holds more than 90 percent of the global market in productivity software.

"164623"	"we"	"could"	" Before we made that announcement, we put a lot of thought and study into our ability to support the entire field, Clarke said. We made the announcement with a calculated decision that, yes, we could, and so we've been following that plan. And I'm happy to say that we've been able to support the first two tests, the one January in Phoenix and the one ... at Homestead. Both have been in our mind, and I think the teams and the IRL would agree, that they have been an outstanding success. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz

On his Web site, www.dwightyoakam .com, he says, I'm still me, it's just more me on this record. The subtext is about my love for music. I'm really looking forward to playing this stuff on the road! </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, he conceded,	 Yes, he conceded, ticket sales were down for the third consecutive year, yielding the lowest annual total since 1997. Theater admissions declined 5.8 percent from 2004, although substantially boosted by the fourth quarter performances of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and King Kong. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, I know,	 For a show about women, Sisters is weirdly off on the subject of women's health. At one point Sela Ward's character is told she can have an amnio when she is less than two months pregnant even though, in real life, amnios are performed much later. This is nitpicking, I know, but it points to the condescending view the show's creators maintained toward their audience. Running on Saturday nights, Sisters geared itself to single women with no plans to go out, and it presumed that only the daffiest and most half-witted were staying home. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, she said,	 The key to Platial, Eisnor said, is that it offers a platform that lets anyone make their own mash-ups, which creates this social atlas where people can document locations that are important to them. More and more, she said, she is noticing that new Platial users will add 50 to 100 places to the site's existing maps in the first week they discover the site, and often they create their own maps. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, she added,	 Eisnor said that she too would like to see Platial rise above the simplicity often associated with mash-ups. For example, she pointed to the site's goal of aggregating many layers of content onto the site, so that a single map can offer information on crime as well as, say, architecture. The snaring of venture funding, she added, should help make that possible. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060323.0155 type=story > <HEADLINE> CHURCH'S CHICKEN HITS $1 BILLION IN SALES </HEADLINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz

, I guess,	 Maybe those films don't get made because the people who sign checks to make the films are afraid because of political correctness, says Macy, who got an Oscar nomination for playing a hapless car salesman orchestrating his wife's kidnapping in Fargo (1996). An antihero is someone who lives outside of the law, and, I guess, traditionally he does some noble act in the end to bring redemption. I think maybe in the political climate we're in now, it's hard to make those films. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz

"169129"	"they"	"could"	" If middle-class taxpayers needed any more reasons to resent the cut Uncle Sam takes out of their paychecks, they could, oh, cite the various offshore tax havens used by the wealthy to avoid taxes.
