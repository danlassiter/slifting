OLY-BKO-DIVAC (Los Angeles) _ As a seven-year NBA veteran, he knows maybe better than anyone in the Olympic men's basketball tournament that the Dreamers III will scarcely be challenged, much less beaten. Divac is required by unofficial Olympic law to be optimistic, but in private he'll own up to reality and admit that Yugoslavia is playing for silver. This summer, like this coming season, gold won't be Divac's color. 13 inches.  By Marc Stein. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-ACUFF (Los Angeles) _ Amy Acuff knows that some people don't take her seriously when she says it. That's OK, though. The UCLA high jumper admits she has set a lofty goal for herself, a goal she isn't compelled to keep to herself. It'll happen, though. One day, she is certain, she will prove her doubters wrong with a single leap. 15.9 inches.  By Michael Rosenthal. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).

Teammates call him the Golden Boy. ``The ball always seems to bounce my way,'' Amar said. ``That's kind of funny.'' 12.7 inches.  By Kevin Acee. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-BENITEZ (Woodland Hills, Calif.) _ Quincy Watts failed to earn a berth on the U.S. Olympic team. Taft High School's track and field team, though, will be represented in the Olympics.

OLY-RUN-BOLDON (Los Angeles) _ You may not have heard of him, but Ato Boldon is a star athlete. At least in his native country, Trinidad, for whom the UCLA senior will compete in the Olympic games. In June, he posted a time of 9.92 seconds in the 100 meters at the NCAA Track and Field Championships in Eugene, Ore., the fastest clocking by anyone this year. He thinks his chances are good, saying, ``Right now, I'd have to be the favorite in the 100.'' 17 inches.  By Michael Ventre. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-SWM-BRIDGEWATER (Los Angeles) _ The Olympic experience is something Brad Bridgewater has been anticipating for four years now. As an 18-year-old freshman at the University of Texas, he was invited to the 1992 Olympic Trials. ``I was frightened by the whole thing,'' said Bridgewater, a two-time Florida state swimming champion. ``I was just a kid. It was pretty incredible. I was swimming with the best in the country. I was pretty satisfied with it.'' Four years changed Bridgewater, who swallowed the tough experience of finishing seventh in the 200-meter backstroke in 1992 and used it for inspiration for this year's trials. This time, the 6-foot-4 Bridgewater, now from USC, blew the field away and landed a berth in the 200-meter backstroke. 14.4 inches.  By Gary Washburn. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-HKY-BUTCHER (Simi Valley, Calif.) _ Nick Butcher of Simi Valley is, at age 20, the youngest member of the U.S. Olympic field hockey team.

Nick is being groomed for international greatness down the line but he can contribute now. 15 inches.  By Eric Noland. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-VBL-CASTRO (La Crescenta, Calif.) _ After Gail Castro and her partner, Deb Richardson, surprised the beach-volleyball world by fighting through the trials in Baltimore and making the Olympics, they were called before the TV cameras for the customary quick interview. It was Castro's chance to say, ``Hey, a 38-year-old wife and mom has just defied the odds and made it to Atlanta!'' Or, ``Dreams do come true!'' Or maybe just, ``Hi, Larry! Hi, Larry Jr.!'' Instead, she opened her mouth and _ nothing. A chatty, friendly woman who had just showed guts and grit to help win a vital match, she froze as if the microphone were emitting tonsil-paralyzing gas. Partner Richardson had to do all the talking. Castro (nee Wolze) _ a former star at Crescenta Valley High, Valley College and Long Beach State, an ex-indoor pro in Italy, a pioneer of the women's pro-beach tour _ had all her struggles and disappointments and broken beach partnerships and sacrifices flash through her mind. 15.2 inches.

OLY-ROW-COLLINS (Thousand Oaks, Calif.) _ David Collins of Thousand Oaks has sacrificed plenty to compete in one of rowing's most grueling events _ lightweight fours without coxswain. ``When you get to the end (of a 2,000-meter, nearly six-minute race), I mean, your legs are burning, your lungs are screaming, and your vision starts to become a tunnel,'' the 26-year-old Westlake High graduate said. ``You focus on what's ahead _ the last 20 strokes, the person in front of you _ and almost let your body take over because your mind wants to tell you to stop.'' 15.9 inches.

OLY-SOF-CORNELL (Woodland Hills, Calif.) _ Woodland Hills' Sheila Cornell, at 34, is one of the United States' most distinguished softball players. She is a 13-year veteran of the U.S. national team, has won eight gold medals in international competition with the United States and is a 10-time Amateur Softball Association All-American. The 1980 Taft High School graduate is also one of the best hitters in the game. ``She's the person I would most like to have at bat with the game on the line,'' said Olympic team coach Ralph Weekly.

OLY-WTP-CORSO (Van Nuys, Calif.) _ Rich Corso has been preparing himself for this moment for more than 20 years. ``My job is to get the ballclub into the championship game,'' said the head coach of the U.S. Olympic water polo team who coaches water polo at Harvard-Westlake High School in North Hollywood in between his national duties. ``I believe you have an obligation if you are hosting an Olympic Games to be in the championship game.'' 14.5 inches.

High on the fact he's made the U.S. Olympic track and field team in the 110-meter hurdles. High on the fact he's on the verge of becoming a father for the first time. (His wife Keisha was due on the 13th). ``I thank God for these two joyous events in one moment,'' the USC graduate says in the driveway of his Valencia home. ``They balance each other out.

OLY-RUN-DEVERS (Los Angeles) _ The Olympics are about drama, about overcoming adversity, about excellence in athleticism despite the enormous challenges. Gail Devers knows what the Olympics are about. The Van Nuys native is a monument to perseverence. She won the 100 meters in Barcelona in 1992. The gold medal was hers, but the prize of overcoming Graves disease shone more brilliantly. 15.3 inches.  By Michael Ventre. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-DUMBLE (Los Angeles) _ Dawn Dumble is known for throwing her weight around. That weight _ a 9-pound metal ball _ has given the Panorama City native an identity among America's track and field elite and has been her ticket to the Summer Games in Atlanta. Never mind that shot putters usually don't ignite the kind of media hoopla that, say, the more dashing sprinters do. ``I just love what I'm doing.... It's an expression of myself,'' said the UCLA graduate, who is also among the nation's best in the discus. 16.3 inches.  By Eddie Ibardolasa. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-ROW-FALLON (Los Angeles) _ Catriona Fallon was a little surprised to hear how she was described to a reporter. ``She gets into pain quicker than anyone else and tolerates it longer,'' was the way Terry Friel, the U.S. Olympic rowing team publicist, put it. ``It's interesting she said !ital!that!off! about me,'' Fallon, a UCLA graduate, said quizzically on the phone from Oak Ridge, Tenn., where she was training to pull a port-side oar on the women's eight that is favored to win the July 28 Olympic final.

OLY-SOC-FAWCETT (Los Angeles) _ Joy Fawcett did not play soccer because she hoped one day she would represent her country at the Olympics or the World Cup. That's because when Fawcett began, there was no women's soccer in the Olympics or World Cup. ``We were doing it because we loved the sport,'' Fawcett said. ``It's fun to see it grow.'' The 28-year-old Fawcett has seen many firsts for women's soccer. In addition to being a member of the U.S. National Team that won the first World Cup for women, she became the first women's soccer coach at UCLA. Now, she is competing in the first Olympics where women's soccer is a medal sport. 13.3 inches.  By Kathy Orton. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-HDB-FERCHO (Camarillo, Calif.) _ Denny Fercho plays team handball, a game not many Americans know. It's NOT like racquetball; rather, it resembles a combination of basketball, hockey, soccer, water polo and football. Fercho was exposed to the game first when he saw a match at the '84 Olympics in L.A. and, with the help of a grant of the Amateur Athletics Foundation, soon mastered it and became one of America's best players. Then he was cut from the team, told he was too small. He overcame that obstacle by mastering the fundamentals better than anyone. Says U.S. coach Rick Oleksyk: ``Denny is the smallest in size on the team, but possesses the largest heart. His desire is second to none.'' 14.8 inches.  By Kevin Modesti. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-SOF-FERNANDEZ (Los Angeles) _ If U.S. Olympic team pitcher/infielder Lisa Fernandez is not already the best softball player in the nation, just wait a while. ``God didn't give me the talent to run fast or be quick or be strong,'' she said, ``but He gave me determination.'' That quality has carried Fernandez from an inauspicious beginning to a level of play unmatched in either softball or baseball, in the opinion of UCLA coach and softball Hall of Famer Sharron Backus. ``Lisa Fernandez is the best all-around softball player in the history of the sport,'' said Backus, who coached Fernandez for four years at UCLA. ``If you try to compare her to a major-league baseball player, she has no equal. There is no one who can pitch, hit and field like Lisa in the major leagues, nor has there been an equal in collegiate softball.'' 14.3 inches.  By Dave Shelburne.

OLY-ROW-FULLER (Westlake Village, Calif.) _ When the Fuller family first moved to the shores of Thousand Oaks' Lake Sherwood 20 years ago, one of the first gifts 8-year-old Amy received was a 12-foot wooden row boat. ``Her brother had a (sailboat),'' Diane Fuller, Amy's mother, remembered recently. ``She would get out there and challenge him to a race around the island in the middle of the lake.'' Thus began a sporting endeavor that brought Fuller a silver medal in the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, an accomplishment she hopes to improve on as her competitive life winds to a close this week in Atlanta. The odds are good that is precisely what will happen. Fuller and her world-champion American teammates are the favorites to win the women's eights class in Olympic rowing. 11.8 inches.

He surprised many when he turned down a $300,000 signing bonus from the San Diego Padres and enrolled at UCLA. Now the Bruins shortstop/third baseman/first baseman, who hit .352 with 16 home runs and 50 RBI for the Bruins, is fulfilling a dream of playing in the Olympics. 14 inches.  By Eric Sondheimer.

OLY-RUN-GODINA (Los Angeles) _ After becoming the first American to qualify for the Olympic Games in both the shot put and discus since USC's Bud Howser in 1924, John Godina of UCLA still can't believe his resume, which includes the world title, five NCAA titles and a collegiate record of 72-2\ in the shot put. Godina now wants to strive for goals others have thought impossible. Foremost is becoming one of the best in the world in both throws. The discus, even though it was the first event he tried as a fifth-grader, has always been overshadowed by his feats in the shot. 14.1 inches.  By Danny Schumacher.

He might not be the favorite to be the No.1 man in goal in Sydney in 2000. In fact, the UCLA graduate might not have ever even played the sport. ``My mom thought I'd break my neck playing football,'' said Hackett, who was not pleased with the decision at the time. ``Water polo is played during the same season _ so I went out for water polo.'' 13 inches.

OLY-VBL-HAGER (Los Angeles) _ Former Cal State Northridge star Axel Hager will be back on American soil this month representing Germany in the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Hager helped lead the Matadors to their first NCAA championship appearance in 1992 in the Finals.

OLY-RUN-HANSON (Ventura, Calif.) _ Ventura's Sharon Hanson isn't convinced her troublesome right knee, which has required six different operations, hasn't helped her track and field career as much as it has hindered it. It was, after all, her first knee injury back in high school that kept a promising hurdler and long jumper from competing in her specialties and forced her to try a few new events during track season. Hanson discovered she could do those other things pretty well, so well that she'll be doing them against some of the world's best athletes in the Olympic Games' heptathlon competition in Atlanta. 12.7 inches.  By Tim McClain. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-CAN-HARPER (Ventura, Calif.) _ Ventura canoeist Joseph Harper is the sole American entry in the 1,000-meter single canoe sprint. It's been since 1952 that an American has medaled in a canoe sprint, and the 30-year-old paddler isn't expected to change that. To a certain degree that has worked to his advantage. He has already completed a lifelong dream of making it to the Olympics; everything else is extra. It may be the attitude he needs to reach his ultimate goal: a personal best time during the Summer Games. 15.9 inches.  By Brett Pauly. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-SOC-HEJDUK (Los Angeles) _ Frankie Hejduk had an unusual way of relieving stress before a game while at UCLA. He didn't pace the floor of his dorm room, or dribble the ball endlessly. He drove to Zuma Beach and went surfing. His endeavors not only clear his mind, they have helped him become a better athlete. ``I think one of the plusses to my game is I can run all day long. I attribute that to surfing.'' The 21-year-old defender, in addition to being a member of the Olympic soccer team, also plays for the Tampa Bay Mutiny of Major League Soccer. 14.8 inches.

OLY-RUN-HERAZO (Los Angeles) _ Her sport is a walking contradiction, but there is universal agreement on Victoria Herazo's designation as a world-class athlete. It's just hard to get recognition when your Olympic event seems based on compromise, or at least, appears slightly confused. But the Castaic resident has gotten well past all the jokes reserved for racewalking, a sport that is a cross between walking and running, but strays from completely relying on either motion. A simple rule to remember is that racewalkers are not allowed to lift both feet off the ground simultaneously during a race. 18.5 inches.  By Scott Wolf. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-ARC-HUISH (Simi Valley, Calif.) _ Justin Huish of Simi Valley, with grungy hipness and athletic good looks, has become the cover boy of sorts of the U.S. archery team. If you drive down Broken Arrow Street in Simi, you might come across the 21-year-old. To practice for the Olympics _ when he's not at the national training center in San Diego _ he shoots at a target set up between the barbecue and the wind chimes in his parents' backhard. To reach the minimum international range of 30 meters, he backs up through the garage, down the driveway and onto the street named, quite coincidentally, Broken Arrow. Then he fires away _ through a narrow doorway and, sometimes, over a sleeping Akita named Bear. 14.3 inches.  By Kevin Modesti. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-BBO-JONES (Los Angeles) _ With all of his physical skills, Jacque Jones looks deep inside when asked about his true strength. The former USC baseball player and second-round draft pick of the Minnesota Twins is as strong mentally as he is physically. While coaches and scouts rave about his rare combination of speed and power, Jones concentrates on his mental game. The outfielder credits a key adjustment in his early years at USC for his success on the U.S. national team. ``At first, everything that went wrong, I got down on myself,'' Jones said from Houston, Texas. ``When I got to USC, Coach (Mike) Gillespie taught me to keep my head up and stay in the game. Ever since then, it's been my strength.'' 14.1 inches.  By Gary Washburn. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-KAWAR (La Crescenta, Calif.) _ At Crescenta Valley High School, Nada Kawar played basketball and, when she needed a physical education class, decided to give track and field a try. Ultimately, she developed into one of the state's top throwers and earned a scholarship to UCLA, where she has competed in the shot put and discus in the NCAA meet the past two years. She has twice earned All-American honors indoors. Kawar, a resident of La Crescenta since her parents brought the family to the United States in 1989, will represent Jordan in the Olympics. ``They got a little excited,'' said Kawar, one of the top weight throwers at UCLA. It's no wonder. Until Kawar came along, she said, the national record in the shot put ``was around 37 feet.'' Now, her best mark of 55 feet, } inches has been certified as the best ever in the country's modest track and field program. (She has thrown 183-11 in the discus). Suddenly, Jordan, where she already has become something of a national figure, had an American-trained, world-class weight thrower. 15.2 inches.  By Michael Rosenthal.

So when she competes in this month's Olympic Games, her fiercest opponent may well be the heat. Her confidant, guru and husband, Bob Kersee, hopes the humidity will help temper her asthma. With Florence Griffith-Joyner, her sister-in-law, officially out ofthe Atlanta Games, Jackie Joyner-Kersee may have the headlines to herself. She doesn't care. That isn't why she competes. ``She absolutely loves the sport,'' Bob Kersee explains. ``She's an athlete first and a celebrity second. 15.8 inches.  By Michael Ventre.

And that is how four-time NCAA champion hammer-thrower Balazs Kiss became a Trojan. A year out of high school, the 19-year-old Hungarian wrote to USC coaches in 1992 and asked for a scholarship. They had never heard of him. Four years later, Kiss has just finished a USC career in which he won every meet he entered. And he will represent his homeland in the Atlanta Games as a favorite to win a medal. 15.5 inches.  By Bill Schlotter. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-SHO-LAKATOS (Los Angeles) _ Josh Lakatos shoots trap for the U.S. Olympic team, a sport in which athletes fire at 200 clay targets traveling at nearly 80 mph from different stations over the course of several hours. A prodigy in the sport, the 23-year-old owns several world records. He recently won a match in Europe against essentially the same competitors he will face in Atlanta. Asked if he believes he will win the gold, Lakatos answers resolutely. ``Absolutely,'' he said, ``because I'm ready. There is no doubt.'' 17.2 inches.  By Michael A. Anastasi.

Despite growing to 6-foot-5 before leaving high school, Leslie had a hard time swallowing the idea that she was meant to play basketball. The U.S. Olympian didn't take up the sport until age 12, when her cousin encouraged her to shoot around at a local gym. Slowly, she began mastering the fundamentals, and a year later she received her first college recruiting letter. 12.3 inches.  By Gary Washburn. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-MARSH (Los Angeles) _ Michael Marsh, a graduate of Hawthorne High School and UCLA, has quietly become one of America's best short sprinters _ 100 and 200 _ and, with two Olympic gold medals to his name, one of the nation's most accomplished. He is the only American who will run both the 100 and 200 in the Atlanta Games. 15.5 inches.  By Michael Rosenthal. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-HKY-MARUQUIN (Ventura, Calif.) _ Ben Maruquin, starting sweeper for the American Olympic field hockey team, has not _ repeat, has not _ had a field hockey stick in his hands since birth. But pretty darn close. Actually, Maruquin, of Ventura, was about 4 when his father, Mogie Maruquin, joined the U.S. national team in 1974. His uncle, John Stockdill, was also a national team player. So a sport that few other Americans can claim even to understand came naturally to the 26-year-old seven-year starter. 13.1 inches.  By Bill Schlotter. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-MILLER (Los Angeles) _ Sprinter Inger Miller always had the genes. It was good health that had evaded her. Miller, a graduate of USC, is the daughter of Lennox Miller, the sprinter from Jamaica who won a silver medal in the 100-meter dash in the 1968 Olympics and a bronze in the same event in 1972. The first time she stepped on the track, as a child, she displayed raw speed handed down by her father, speed that enabled to succeed at Muir High School and USC. However, chronic injuries prevented her from taking that one final step to stardom _ until now. Miller, 24, outleaned Gwen Torrence to earn the third and final Olympic berth in the 200 and, as the fourth-place finisher in the 100, will be part of the 400 relay pool. 14.5 inches.

OLY-HKY-O'NEILL (Newbury Park, Calif.) _ When the O'Neill family moved from Michigan to Newbury Park in the early 1980s, there was a bit of culture shock lying in wait for young son John. Ice hockey was his favorite sport. And they didn't play it in Southern California in those days. Then one of his new classmates at Newbury Park High School introduced him to field hockey. ``One of my friends said, `Hey, let's go try this out,''' O'Neill said. ``And I just kind of ran with it.'' Run with it, he did. All the way to the Olympic Games. O'Neill, Mr. Versatility on the American Olympic field hockey team, can play almost anywhere on the midfield or back lines, skills that have made him a valuable substitute. 13.4 inches.

OLY-BBO-PARQUE (Los Angeles) _ When UCLA left-handed pitcher Jim Parque was finally extended an invitation to try out for the U.S. Olympic baseball team last May, his reply was, ``What took you so long?'' ``I just knew all along I could compete with any of these guys,'' Parque said. ``I was a little disappointed with the late invitation, but an invite is an invite.'' Parque proved he deserved the tryout, because he made the elite 20-man team as a relief pitcher. The former Crescenta Valley High School star was considered a longshot at the start of training camp last June, but he showed he could be a left-handed setup man and spot starter.

After being disqualified by a turn judge's controversial call in the U.S. Olympic Trials in that event, the USC swimmer and Northridge native has a renewed commitment to winning the 200 IM and the 100 breast, the events for which she did qualify.

Three years later, she was playing at the highest amateur level in the nation. By age 17, Richardson was competing against the best in the world as a member of her first of 18 consecutive U.S. national teams. Richardson later helped lead UCLA to the 1982 NCAA championship.

Her scientific approach to life _ she's a chemistry major at UCLA _ has helped her perfect her swimming, and she will be the first female Bruin since 1972 to compete in the Olympics, in the 200 butterfly and 800 free relay. ``Annette understands the difference between weight and buoyancy,'' says Bruins assistant coach Brad Burnham. ``She knows what a vector is. She understands the difference between speed and velocity and the weight of your hips versus the mass of your hips. Some swimmers go by what it feels like in the water. Annette needs numbers.'' To solve one of her recurring problems _ a slow-moving center of mass _ Salmeen watched underwater video and worked with her coach to figure out a way to position her body parts in the most effective way possible. ``To Annette, swimming fast is a problem that must be solved,'' Burnham said, ``and the pool is like her labratory.'' 14.7 inches.

When he stepped into goal for the UCLA soccer team three years ago, it was on the heels of a long procession of glittery All-American goalies: Tim Harris, Anton Nistl, Brad Friedel. Snitko more than held his own. He kept the line of succession strong by earning All-American recognition after the 1995 season, earned some distinction in the Bruins record book, and has capped the achievements with inclusion on the U.S. Olympic men's soccer team. 14 inches.

He didn't qualify for the NCAA Championships. And according to one of his coaches, he would have had a very difficult time qualifying at the U.S. Olympic Trials held in Atlanta last month. But he will compete at the Summer Olympics in the 400 meters nevertheless.

(Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-GYM-UMPHREY (Los Angeles) _ It might be hard to find too many athletes at this year's Olympics who appreciate the opportunity more than gymnast Chainey Umphrey. Four years ago, at the Olympic Trials in Baltimore, the UCLA graduate felt like an Olympian for a teasingly brief period of time. As the gymnasts jockeyed for the seven qualifying spots, an assistant coach told Umphrey he was headed for Barcelona. By a small margin, the coach had made a huge mistake _ Umphrey missed qualifying by eight one-hundredths of a point. That was the last he wanted to hear about Barcelona. 17.4 inches.  By Brad Nelson.

Both men have had their turns surging in that competition, and although it is not certain who will start in the Olympics, Vano said that's not important. ``What's important is the team,'' he said. ```The big satisfaction comes when you put on your jersey for your country.'' 15 inches.  By Dave Shelburne. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-BOX-VARGAS (Oxnard, Calif.) _ One way or another, Fernando Vargas was going to fight. Even as an elementary school-aged child, he said, ``I loved to fight.'' And he did. In time, it was no longer news when Vargas was suspended from school, apparent evidence the boy was headed in a self-destructive direction. And then, when he was only 10, came a turning point. ``I was watching a local amateur boxing tournament on cable TV and was just mesmerized,'' said Vargas, a resident of Oxnard. ``I didn't know there was such a thing for kids. So all by myself, without my mom knowing, I found out where the gym was and went there. ``My mom didn't like it at all when she found out. She thought I would get hurt. When she saw I was hurting other people, though, I guess it was all right.'' 14.0 inches.  By Michael Rosenthal. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-TTN-WANG (Pasadena, Calif.) _ Once before, Wei Wang walked away from a career as a national-caliber table tennis player. Now, more than 15 years later, she has proven that she still has what it takes. Wang, who lives in Pasadena, immigrated here from China in 1986 and became a United States citizen in 1993. Earlier this year, she qualified for the U.S. Olympic team. Her trip to Atlanta will satisfy a career goal she once sacrificed when she retired from the sport in the mid-'80s. 15.7 inches.  By Dave Allen. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-BBO-WEAVER (Simi Valley, Calif.) _ To fully appreciate the meteoric rise of Jeff Weaver, you have to understand that just two years ago, he was an undistinguished, rarely used relief pitcher for Simi Valley High School's baseball team. He went off to college to study physical therapy. He enrolled at Fresno State and decided to try out for the Bulldogs' baseball team as a walk-on. Nobody knew who he was. Now he's an Olympian, making the team as a ``one-in-a-million longshot.'' 13.2 inches.  By Eric Sondheimer. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-JWILLIAMS (San Fernando, Calif.) _ For years, Jeff Williams of San Fernando was among the nation's best 10 or 15 competitors in both the 100 and 200 meters. And then, last year, he blossomed. At the relatively advanced age of 29, he ran personal bests of 10.19 in the 100 and 20.18 in the 200. He capped his splendid year by placing third in the 200 in the world championships. 14 inches.  By Jon Wilner. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-HKY-SWILLIAMS (Newbury Park, Calif.) _ Scott Williams vividly remembers the first time he ever heard of field hockey. It was the year before the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles and members of the U.S. Olympic team were giving 12-year-old Williams and his classmates a demonstration of their game. Mike Newton and other '84 Olympians had shown up that day at Newbury Park's Sequoia Junior High School to drum up interest for a fledgling youth program. The sport already enjoyed growing enthusiasm among adults in Ventura County. ``They told us if we liked it to come out Saturday and sign up and they'd show us how to play,'' said Williams, who has learned the game better than anyone might have predicted. Thirteen years later, he is still playing _ as a teammate of Newton on the U.S. Olympic squad that will compete this month in the Atlanta Games. 16.2 inches.  By Dave Shelburne.

OLY-ATLANTA (Undated) _ The city of Atlanta seemed to be moving at a comfortable pace, on target for the July 19 opening of the Summer Games. Suddenly, however, things have become a bit more frentic. 20 inches.  By Jon Wilner. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-VBB-BEACH (Los Angeles) _ The first U.S. Olympic beach volleyball contingent isn't made up of a bunch of folks who necessarily like each other. But they can win medals. 20 inches.  By Joe Jares.

OLY-BKO-DREAM (Undated) _ Set against the thousands of amateurs who have trained their whole lives for the privilege of melting in the Georgia sun are the dozen pros who won't have to work hard at all to win gold. What could be more American, more '90s, than another Olympic Dream Team? Ignore that question, or the potential of this 12-man gang, and you risk missing some of the most compelling stories of the Summer Games. 23 inches.  By Marc Stein. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-MEDIA (Los Angeles) _ Navigating through the humid drama of athletic competition in that sweatbox known as Atlanta between July 22 and Aug. 4 takes more than a stack of TV listings and a good anti-persperent. It takes knowledge. Here's what to expect, what not to get your hopes up for, and other shortcuts for 17 days of coverage by NBC Sports. 27 inches.  By Tom Hoffarth.

What better place to celebrate the Centennial Olympics than the capital of their homeland and the site of their rebirth? But on September 18, 1990, in a Tokyo hotel ballroom, the International Olympic Committee voted 51-35 to award the Centennial Games to Atlanta, a city known worldwide as the backdrop for ``Gone With the Wind.'' We look back at the 100 years of the Olympics. 30 inches.  By Jon Wilner. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-OVERVIEW (Undated) _ Atlanta's Olympic dream becomes reality Friday, when the Games of the XXVI Olympiad begin with the Opening Ceremony at the new, 83,000-seat Olympic Stadium. Billy Payne, president of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, has all the ingredients in place for an historic 17 days. Every nation that received an invitation accepted _ essentially, the world boycotted a boycott _ and that translates into Fifteen nations once under the auspices of the Soviet Union will participate. Five competitors used to be a part of Yugoslavia. Former pariah South Africa is here, as is America's antagonist, Cuba. 24 inches.  By Jon Wilner. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).

OLY-BKO-DIVAC (Los Angeles) _ As a seven-year NBA veteran, he knows maybe better than anyone in the Olympic men's basketball tournament that the Dreamers III will scarcely be challenged, much less beaten. Divac is required by unofficial Olympic law to be optimistic, but in private he'll own up to reality and admit that Yugoslavia is playing for silver. This summer, like this coming season, gold won't be Divac's color. 13 inches.  By Marc Stein. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-ACUFF (Los Angeles) _ Amy Acuff knows that some people don't take her seriously when she says it. That's OK, though. The UCLA high jumper admits she has set a lofty goal for herself, a goal she isn't compelled to keep to herself. It'll happen, though. One day, she is certain, she will prove her doubters wrong with a single leap. 15.9 inches.  By Michael Rosenthal. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-HKY-AMAR (Camarillo, Calif.) _ Camarillo's Larry Amar is the United States' best field hockey player. Now 24, Amar is the national team captain and a two-time U.S. Field Hockey Association Player of the Year. Teammates call him the Golden Boy. ``The ball always seems to bounce my way,'' Amar said. ``That's kind of funny.'' 12.7 inches.  By Kevin Acee. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-BENITEZ (Woodland Hills, Calif.) _ Quincy Watts failed to earn a berth on the U.S. Olympic team. Taft High School's track and field team, though, will be represented in the Olympics. Ruben Benitez, a teammate of Watts at Taft, will run for El Salvador in the 100 and 200 meters in Atlanta. 15.5 inches.  By Kirby Lee. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file.)  OLY-RUN-BOLDON (Los Angeles) _ You may not have heard of him, but Ato Boldon is a star athlete. At least in his native country, Trinidad, for whom the UCLA senior will compete in the Olympic games. In June, he posted a time of 9.92 seconds in the 100 meters at the NCAA Track and Field Championships in Eugene, Ore., the fastest clocking by anyone this year. He thinks his chances are good, saying, ``Right now, I'd have to be the favorite in the 100.'' 17 inches.  By Michael Ventre. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-SWM-BRIDGEWATER (Los Angeles) _ The Olympic experience is something Brad Bridgewater has been anticipating for four years now. As an 18-year-old freshman at the University of Texas, he was invited to the 1992 Olympic Trials. ``I was frightened by the whole thing,'' said Bridgewater, a two-time Florida state swimming champion. ``I was just a kid. It was pretty incredible. I was swimming with the best in the country. I was pretty satisfied with it.'' Four years changed Bridgewater, who swallowed the tough experience of finishing seventh in the 200-meter backstroke in 1992 and used it for inspiration for this year's trials. This time, the 6-foot-4 Bridgewater, now from USC, blew the field away and landed a berth in the 200-meter backstroke. 14.4 inches.  By Gary Washburn. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-HKY-BUTCHER (Simi Valley, Calif.) _ Nick Butcher of Simi Valley is, at age 20, the youngest member of the U.S. Olympic field hockey team. He was a star soccer player at Royal High School but turned down numerous college scholarships to pursue his Olympic dream. Nick is being groomed for international greatness down the line but he can contribute now. 15 inches.  By Eric Noland. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-VBL-CASTRO (La Crescenta, Calif.) _ After Gail Castro and her partner, Deb Richardson, surprised the beach-volleyball world by fighting through the trials in Baltimore and making the Olympics, they were called before the TV cameras for the customary quick interview. It was Castro's chance to say, ``Hey, a 38-year-old wife and mom has just defied the odds and made it to Atlanta!'' Or, ``Dreams do come true!'' Or maybe just, ``Hi, Larry! Hi, Larry Jr.!'' Instead, she opened her mouth and _ nothing. A chatty, friendly woman who had just showed guts and grit to help win a vital match, she froze as if the microphone were emitting tonsil-paralyzing gas. Partner Richardson had to do all the talking. Castro (nee Wolze) _ a former star at Crescenta Valley High, Valley College and Long Beach State, an ex-indoor pro in Italy, a pioneer of the women's pro-beach tour _ had all her struggles and disappointments and broken beach partnerships and sacrifices flash through her mind. 15.2 inches.  By Joe Jares. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-ROW-COLLINS (Thousand Oaks, Calif.) _ David Collins of Thousand Oaks has sacrificed plenty to compete in one of rowing's most grueling events _ lightweight fours without coxswain. ``When you get to the end (of a 2,000-meter, nearly six-minute race), I mean, your legs are burning, your lungs are screaming, and your vision starts to become a tunnel,'' the 26-year-old Westlake High graduate said. ``You focus on what's ahead _ the last 20 strokes, the person in front of you _ and almost let your body take over because your mind wants to tell you to stop.'' 15.9 inches.  By Kevin Modesti. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-SOF-CORNELL (Woodland Hills, Calif.) _ Woodland Hills' Sheila Cornell, at 34, is one of the United States' most distinguished softball players. She is a 13-year veteran of the U.S. national team, has won eight gold medals in international competition with the United States and is a 10-time Amateur Softball Association All-American. The 1980 Taft High School graduate is also one of the best hitters in the game. ``She's the person I would most like to have at bat with the game on the line,'' said Olympic team coach Ralph Weekly.  By Kevin Acee. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-WTP-CORSO (Van Nuys, Calif.) _ Rich Corso has been preparing himself for this moment for more than 20 years. ``My job is to get the ballclub into the championship game,'' said the head coach of the U.S. Olympic water polo team who coaches water polo at Harvard-Westlake High School in North Hollywood in between his national duties. ``I believe you have an obligation if you are hosting an Olympic Games to be in the championship game.'' 14.5 inches.  By Bill Schlotter. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-CREAR (Valencia, Calif.) _ Mark Crear, high hurdler, is on a natural high these days. High on the fact he's made the U.S. Olympic track and field team in the 110-meter hurdles. High on the fact he's on the verge of becoming a father for the first time. (His wife Keisha was due on the 13th). ``I thank God for these two joyous events in one moment,'' the USC graduate says in the driveway of his Valencia home. ``They balance each other out. They help keep me calm. When I'm waiting around getting overly excited about running, I can think about the baby.'' 13.5 inches.  By Johannes Tesselaar. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-HDB-DELARIVA (Chatsworth, Calif.) _ Chatsworth resident Sandra De La Riva has made three trips to the Olympic Games as a player. The 34-year-old makes her fourth as the women's team handball's `team leader,' or administrator. 14.4 inches.  By Bill Schlotter. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-DEVERS (Los Angeles) _ The Olympics are about drama, about overcoming adversity, about excellence in athleticism despite the enormous challenges. Gail Devers knows what the Olympics are about. The Van Nuys native is a monument to perseverence. She won the 100 meters in Barcelona in 1992. The gold medal was hers, but the prize of overcoming Graves disease shone more brilliantly. 15.3 inches.  By Michael Ventre. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-DUMBLE (Los Angeles) _ Dawn Dumble is known for throwing her weight around. That weight _ a 9-pound metal ball _ has given the Panorama City native an identity among America's track and field elite and has been her ticket to the Summer Games in Atlanta. Never mind that shot putters usually don't ignite the kind of media hoopla that, say, the more dashing sprinters do. ``I just love what I'm doing.... It's an expression of myself,'' said the UCLA graduate, who is also among the nation's best in the discus. 16.3 inches.  By Eddie Ibardolasa. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-ROW-FALLON (Los Angeles) _ Catriona Fallon was a little surprised to hear how she was described to a reporter. ``She gets into pain quicker than anyone else and tolerates it longer,'' was the way Terry Friel, the U.S. Olympic rowing team publicist, put it. ``It's interesting she said !ital!that!off! about me,'' Fallon, a UCLA graduate, said quizzically on the phone from Oak Ridge, Tenn., where she was training to pull a port-side oar on the women's eight that is favored to win the July 28 Olympic final. Catriona, Queen of Pain. 15.5 inches.  By Kevin Modesti. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-SOC-FAWCETT (Los Angeles) _ Joy Fawcett did not play soccer because she hoped one day she would represent her country at the Olympics or the World Cup. That's because when Fawcett began, there was no women's soccer in the Olympics or World Cup. ``We were doing it because we loved the sport,'' Fawcett said. ``It's fun to see it grow.'' The 28-year-old Fawcett has seen many firsts for women's soccer. In addition to being a member of the U.S. National Team that won the first World Cup for women, she became the first women's soccer coach at UCLA. Now, she is competing in the first Olympics where women's soccer is a medal sport. 13.3 inches.  By Kathy Orton. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-HDB-FERCHO (Camarillo, Calif.) _ Denny Fercho plays team handball, a game not many Americans know. It's NOT like racquetball; rather, it resembles a combination of basketball, hockey, soccer, water polo and football. Fercho was exposed to the game first when he saw a match at the '84 Olympics in L.A. and, with the help of a grant of the Amateur Athletics Foundation, soon mastered it and became one of America's best players. Then he was cut from the team, told he was too small. He overcame that obstacle by mastering the fundamentals better than anyone. Says U.S. coach Rick Oleksyk: ``Denny is the smallest in size on the team, but possesses the largest heart. His desire is second to none.'' 14.8 inches.  By Kevin Modesti. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-SOF-FERNANDEZ (Los Angeles) _ If U.S. Olympic team pitcher/infielder Lisa Fernandez is not already the best softball player in the nation, just wait a while. ``God didn't give me the talent to run fast or be quick or be strong,'' she said, ``but He gave me determination.'' That quality has carried Fernandez from an inauspicious beginning to a level of play unmatched in either softball or baseball, in the opinion of UCLA coach and softball Hall of Famer Sharron Backus. ``Lisa Fernandez is the best all-around softball player in the history of the sport,'' said Backus, who coached Fernandez for four years at UCLA. ``If you try to compare her to a major-league baseball player, she has no equal. There is no one who can pitch, hit and field like Lisa in the major leagues, nor has there been an equal in collegiate softball.'' 14.3 inches.  By Dave Shelburne. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-ROW-FULLER (Westlake Village, Calif.) _ When the Fuller family first moved to the shores of Thousand Oaks' Lake Sherwood 20 years ago, one of the first gifts 8-year-old Amy received was a 12-foot wooden row boat. ``Her brother had a (sailboat),'' Diane Fuller, Amy's mother, remembered recently. ``She would get out there and challenge him to a race around the island in the middle of the lake.'' Thus began a sporting endeavor that brought Fuller a silver medal in the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, an accomplishment she hopes to improve on as her competitive life winds to a close this week in Atlanta. The odds are good that is precisely what will happen. Fuller and her world-champion American teammates are the favorites to win the women's eights class in Olympic rowing. 11.8 inches.  By Bill Schlotter. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-BBO-GLAUS (Los Angeles) _ Troy Glaus was perhaps the top baseball recruit in California in 1994. He surprised many when he turned down a $300,000 signing bonus from the San Diego Padres and enrolled at UCLA. Now the Bruins shortstop/third baseman/first baseman, who hit .352 with 16 home runs and 50 RBI for the Bruins, is fulfilling a dream of playing in the Olympics. 14 inches.  By Eric Sondheimer. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-GODINA (Los Angeles) _ After becoming the first American to qualify for the Olympic Games in both the shot put and discus since USC's Bud Howser in 1924, John Godina of UCLA still can't believe his resume, which includes the world title, five NCAA titles and a collegiate record of 72-2\ in the shot put. Godina now wants to strive for goals others have thought impossible. Foremost is becoming one of the best in the world in both throws. The discus, even though it was the first event he tried as a fifth-grader, has always been overshadowed by his feats in the shot. 14.1 inches.  By Danny Schumacher. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-WTP-HACKETT (Los Angeles) _ If not for a protective mother, Dan Hackett might not be the No.2 goalie on the U.S. Olympic water polo team. He might not be the favorite to be the No.1 man in goal in Sydney in 2000. In fact, the UCLA graduate might not have ever even played the sport. ``My mom thought I'd break my neck playing football,'' said Hackett, who was not pleased with the decision at the time. ``Water polo is played during the same season _ so I went out for water polo.'' 13 inches.  By Dave Shelburne. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-VBL-HAGER (Los Angeles) _ Former Cal State Northridge star Axel Hager will be back on American soil this month representing Germany in the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Hager helped lead the Matadors to their first NCAA championship appearance in 1992 in the Finals. Hager, who has qualified in beach volleyball, follows Bob Samuelson, who played for U.S. indoor team in 1992, as the second Northridge volleyball player to reach the Olympics. 12.5 inches.  By Tim Trepany. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-HANSON (Ventura, Calif.) _ Ventura's Sharon Hanson isn't convinced her troublesome right knee, which has required six different operations, hasn't helped her track and field career as much as it has hindered it. It was, after all, her first knee injury back in high school that kept a promising hurdler and long jumper from competing in her specialties and forced her to try a few new events during track season. Hanson discovered she could do those other things pretty well, so well that she'll be doing them against some of the world's best athletes in the Olympic Games' heptathlon competition in Atlanta. 12.7 inches.  By Tim McClain. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-CAN-HARPER (Ventura, Calif.) _ Ventura canoeist Joseph Harper is the sole American entry in the 1,000-meter single canoe sprint. It's been since 1952 that an American has medaled in a canoe sprint, and the 30-year-old paddler isn't expected to change that. To a certain degree that has worked to his advantage. He has already completed a lifelong dream of making it to the Olympics; everything else is extra. It may be the attitude he needs to reach his ultimate goal: a personal best time during the Summer Games. 15.9 inches.  By Brett Pauly. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-SOC-HEJDUK (Los Angeles) _ Frankie Hejduk had an unusual way of relieving stress before a game while at UCLA. He didn't pace the floor of his dorm room, or dribble the ball endlessly. He drove to Zuma Beach and went surfing. His endeavors not only clear his mind, they have helped him become a better athlete. ``I think one of the plusses to my game is I can run all day long. I attribute that to surfing.'' The 21-year-old defender, in addition to being a member of the Olympic soccer team, also plays for the Tampa Bay Mutiny of Major League Soccer. 14.8 inches.  By Eric Noland. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-HERAZO (Los Angeles) _ Her sport is a walking contradiction, but there is universal agreement on Victoria Herazo's designation as a world-class athlete. It's just hard to get recognition when your Olympic event seems based on compromise, or at least, appears slightly confused. But the Castaic resident has gotten well past all the jokes reserved for racewalking, a sport that is a cross between walking and running, but strays from completely relying on either motion. A simple rule to remember is that racewalkers are not allowed to lift both feet off the ground simultaneously during a race. 18.5 inches.  By Scott Wolf. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-ARC-HUISH (Simi Valley, Calif.) _ Justin Huish of Simi Valley, with grungy hipness and athletic good looks, has become the cover boy of sorts of the U.S. archery team. If you drive down Broken Arrow Street in Simi, you might come across the 21-year-old. To practice for the Olympics _ when he's not at the national training center in San Diego _ he shoots at a target set up between the barbecue and the wind chimes in his parents' backhard. To reach the minimum international range of 30 meters, he backs up through the garage, down the driveway and onto the street named, quite coincidentally, Broken Arrow. Then he fires away _ through a narrow doorway and, sometimes, over a sleeping Akita named Bear. 14.3 inches.  By Kevin Modesti. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-BBO-JONES (Los Angeles) _ With all of his physical skills, Jacque Jones looks deep inside when asked about his true strength. The former USC baseball player and second-round draft pick of the Minnesota Twins is as strong mentally as he is physically. While coaches and scouts rave about his rare combination of speed and power, Jones concentrates on his mental game. The outfielder credits a key adjustment in his early years at USC for his success on the U.S. national team. ``At first, everything that went wrong, I got down on myself,'' Jones said from Houston, Texas. ``When I got to USC, Coach (Mike) Gillespie taught me to keep my head up and stay in the game. Ever since then, it's been my strength.'' 14.1 inches.  By Gary Washburn. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-KAWAR (La Crescenta, Calif.) _ At Crescenta Valley High School, Nada Kawar played basketball and, when she needed a physical education class, decided to give track and field a try. Ultimately, she developed into one of the state's top throwers and earned a scholarship to UCLA, where she has competed in the shot put and discus in the NCAA meet the past two years. She has twice earned All-American honors indoors. Kawar, a resident of La Crescenta since her parents brought the family to the United States in 1989, will represent Jordan in the Olympics. ``They got a little excited,'' said Kawar, one of the top weight throwers at UCLA. It's no wonder. Until Kawar came along, she said, the national record in the shot put ``was around 37 feet.'' Now, her best mark of 55 feet, } inches has been certified as the best ever in the country's modest track and field program. (She has thrown 183-11 in the discus). Suddenly, Jordan, where she already has become something of a national figure, had an American-trained, world-class weight thrower. 15.2 inches.  By Michael Rosenthal. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-KERSEE (Los Angeles) _ Jackie Joyner-Kersee hasn't lost a completed heptathlon since she took the silver in the 1984 Olympics. So when she competes in this month's Olympic Games, her fiercest opponent may well be the heat. Her confidant, guru and husband, Bob Kersee, hopes the humidity will help temper her asthma. With Florence Griffith-Joyner, her sister-in-law, officially out ofthe Atlanta Games, Jackie Joyner-Kersee may have the headlines to herself. She doesn't care. That isn't why she competes. ``She absolutely loves the sport,'' Bob Kersee explains. ``She's an athlete first and a celebrity second. 15.8 inches.  By Michael Ventre. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-KISS (Los Angeles) _ A college coach would be wise to always read his mail. Former USC track coach Jim Bush did. And that is how four-time NCAA champion hammer-thrower Balazs Kiss became a Trojan. A year out of high school, the 19-year-old Hungarian wrote to USC coaches in 1992 and asked for a scholarship. They had never heard of him. Four years later, Kiss has just finished a USC career in which he won every meet he entered. And he will represent his homeland in the Atlanta Games as a favorite to win a medal. 15.5 inches.  By Bill Schlotter. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-SHO-LAKATOS (Los Angeles) _ Josh Lakatos shoots trap for the U.S. Olympic team, a sport in which athletes fire at 200 clay targets traveling at nearly 80 mph from different stations over the course of several hours. A prodigy in the sport, the 23-year-old owns several world records. He recently won a match in Europe against essentially the same competitors he will face in Atlanta. Asked if he believes he will win the gold, Lakatos answers resolutely. ``Absolutely,'' he said, ``because I'm ready. There is no doubt.'' 17.2 inches.  By Michael A. Anastasi.

Despite growing to 6-foot-5 before leaving high school, Leslie had a hard time swallowing the idea that she was meant to play basketball. The U.S. Olympian didn't take up the sport until age 12, when her cousin encouraged her to shoot around at a local gym. Slowly, she began mastering the fundamentals, and a year later she received her first college recruiting letter. 12.3 inches.  By Gary Washburn. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-MARSH (Los Angeles) _ Michael Marsh, a graduate of Hawthorne High School and UCLA, has quietly become one of America's best short sprinters _ 100 and 200 _ and, with two Olympic gold medals to his name, one of the nation's most accomplished. He is the only American who will run both the 100 and 200 in the Atlanta Games. 15.5 inches.  By Michael Rosenthal. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-HKY-MARUQUIN (Ventura, Calif.) _ Ben Maruquin, starting sweeper for the American Olympic field hockey team, has not _ repeat, has not _ had a field hockey stick in his hands since birth. But pretty darn close. Actually, Maruquin, of Ventura, was about 4 when his father, Mogie Maruquin, joined the U.S. national team in 1974. His uncle, John Stockdill, was also a national team player. So a sport that few other Americans can claim even to understand came naturally to the 26-year-old seven-year starter. 13.1 inches.  By Bill Schlotter. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-MILLER (Los Angeles) _ Sprinter Inger Miller always had the genes. It was good health that had evaded her. Miller, a graduate of USC, is the daughter of Lennox Miller, the sprinter from Jamaica who won a silver medal in the 100-meter dash in the 1968 Olympics and a bronze in the same event in 1972. The first time she stepped on the track, as a child, she displayed raw speed handed down by her father, speed that enabled to succeed at Muir High School and USC. However, chronic injuries prevented her from taking that one final step to stardom _ until now. Miller, 24, outleaned Gwen Torrence to earn the third and final Olympic berth in the 200 and, as the fourth-place finisher in the 100, will be part of the 400 relay pool. 14.5 inches.  By Michael Rosenthal. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-HKY-O'NEILL (Newbury Park, Calif.) _ When the O'Neill family moved from Michigan to Newbury Park in the early 1980s, there was a bit of culture shock lying in wait for young son John. Ice hockey was his favorite sport. And they didn't play it in Southern California in those days. Then one of his new classmates at Newbury Park High School introduced him to field hockey. ``One of my friends said, `Hey, let's go try this out,''' O'Neill said. ``And I just kind of ran with it.'' Run with it, he did. All the way to the Olympic Games. O'Neill, Mr. Versatility on the American Olympic field hockey team, can play almost anywhere on the midfield or back lines, skills that have made him a valuable substitute. 13.4 inches.  By Bill Schlotter. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-BBO-PARQUE (Los Angeles) _ When UCLA left-handed pitcher Jim Parque was finally extended an invitation to try out for the U.S. Olympic baseball team last May, his reply was, ``What took you so long?'' ``I just knew all along I could compete with any of these guys,'' Parque said. ``I was a little disappointed with the late invitation, but an invite is an invite.'' Parque proved he deserved the tryout, because he made the elite 20-man team as a relief pitcher. The former Crescenta Valley High School star was considered a longshot at the start of training camp last June, but he showed he could be a left-handed setup man and spot starter.  By Eric Sondheimer. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-POWELL (Los Angeles) _ UCLA's Suzy Powell does not expect to win the discus in Atlanta. She is just a sophomore in college, two years removed from Downey High School in Modesto. But in a few short months, Powell, the prep all-time national leader in the event, has reached an elite level. 8.7 inches.  By Danny Schumacher. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-SWM-QUANCE (Northridge, Calif.) _ Kristine Quance won't be compteting in her signature event, the 400-meter IM, in the Atlanta Games, but don't count her out of medal contention just yet. After being disqualified by a turn judge's controversial call in the U.S. Olympic Trials in that event, the USC swimmer and Northridge native has a renewed commitment to winning the 200 IM and the 100 breast, the events for which she did qualify. Without the pressure of being the favorite, her coach thinks she had an excellent shot at a medal. 16.3 inches.  By Michael Ventre. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file.)  OLY-BKO-REGGIE (Undated) _ After a rivalry spanning three decades, this is the summer that Reggie Miller gets even with sister Cheryl. OK, maybe not. ``I will never be on the same level,'' claims Reggie, the former UCLA sharpshooter who brings his 3-point prowess to Dream Team III for the Atlanta Olympics. 8 inches.  By Marc Stein.

OLY-SOF-RICHARDSON (Los Angeles) _ Anything would be harder for Sherman Oaks' Dot Richardson than softball, a sport she has excelled at since age 10 _ when she was recruited by a women's Class A fastpitch team in Florida. Three years later, she was playing at the highest amateur level in the nation. By age 17, Richardson was competing against the best in the world as a member of her first of 18 consecutive U.S. national teams. Richardson later helped lead UCLA to the 1982 NCAA championship. Now she's an M.D., on one-year leave from USC Medical Center, competing in the Olympics for the first time. 17 inches.  By Dave Shelburne. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-WTP-ROUSSEAU (Los Angeles) _ Of the four basic old-world substances _ earth, air, fire and water _ Alex Rousseau finds three to be irrelevant. ``I'm definitely a water-oriented person,'' said Rousseau. ``Swimming, surfing, water polo ... I love the water.'' He also excels in it. Since his introduction to water polo as a freshman at Santa Monica High School, the former UCLA star, 28, has matured into a starter on the U.S. Olympic team. 12.8 inches.  By Bill Schlotter. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-SWIM-SALMEEN (Los Angeles) _ Annette Salmeen was a strong swimmer in high school, but she never thought she would make it to the Olympics. Her scientific approach to life _ she's a chemistry major at UCLA _ has helped her perfect her swimming, and she will be the first female Bruin since 1972 to compete in the Olympics, in the 200 butterfly and 800 free relay. ``Annette understands the difference between weight and buoyancy,'' says Bruins assistant coach Brad Burnham. ``She knows what a vector is. She understands the difference between speed and velocity and the weight of your hips versus the mass of your hips. Some swimmers go by what it feels like in the water. Annette needs numbers.'' To solve one of her recurring problems _ a slow-moving center of mass _ Salmeen watched underwater video and worked with her coach to figure out a way to position her body parts in the most effective way possible. ``To Annette, swimming fast is a problem that must be solved,'' Burnham said, ``and the pool is like her labratory.'' 14.7 inches.  By Jon Wilner. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-SOC-SNITKO (Los Angeles) _ Had be been composed of less-stern stuff, Chris Snitko might have wilted in the face of the legacy. When he stepped into goal for the UCLA soccer team three years ago, it was on the heels of a long procession of glittery All-American goalies: Tim Harris, Anton Nistl, Brad Friedel. Snitko more than held his own. He kept the line of succession strong by earning All-American recognition after the 1995 season, earned some distinction in the Bruins record book, and has capped the achievements with inclusion on the U.S. Olympic men's soccer team. 14 inches.  By Eric Noland. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-TERRY (Los Angeles) _ UCLA's Mike Terry is no world-class athlete. He is barely knocking on the national-class door. He didn't qualify for the NCAA Championships. And according to one of his coaches, he would have had a very difficult time qualifying at the U.S. Olympic Trials held in Atlanta last month. But he will compete at the Summer Olympics in the 400 meters nevertheless. He will represent his father's homeland _ Antigua and Barbuda, the small island gems of the Carribean adorned with 365 beaches _ one for each day of the year. 14.1 inches.  By P.K. Daniel. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-GYM-UMPHREY (Los Angeles) _ It might be hard to find too many athletes at this year's Olympics who appreciate the opportunity more than gymnast Chainey Umphrey. Four years ago, at the Olympic Trials in Baltimore, the UCLA graduate felt like an Olympian for a teasingly brief period of time. As the gymnasts jockeyed for the seven qualifying spots, an assistant coach told Umphrey he was headed for Barcelona. By a small margin, the coach had made a huge mistake _ Umphrey missed qualifying by eight one-hundredths of a point. That was the last he wanted to hear about Barcelona. 17.4 inches.  By Brad Nelson. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-HKY-VANO (Simi Valley, Calif.) _ Tom Vano of Simi Valley is competing with Steve Wagner to be the U.S. field hockey team's goalie. Both men have had their turns surging in that competition, and although it is not certain who will start in the Olympics, Vano said that's not important. ``What's important is the team,'' he said. ```The big satisfaction comes when you put on your jersey for your country.'' 15 inches.  By Dave Shelburne. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-BOX-VARGAS (Oxnard, Calif.) _ One way or another, Fernando Vargas was going to fight. Even as an elementary school-aged child, he said, ``I loved to fight.'' And he did. In time, it was no longer news when Vargas was suspended from school, apparent evidence the boy was headed in a self-destructive direction. And then, when he was only 10, came a turning point. ``I was watching a local amateur boxing tournament on cable TV and was just mesmerized,'' said Vargas, a resident of Oxnard. ``I didn't know there was such a thing for kids. So all by myself, without my mom knowing, I found out where the gym was and went there. ``My mom didn't like it at all when she found out. She thought I would get hurt. When she saw I was hurting other people, though, I guess it was all right.'' 14.0 inches.  By Michael Rosenthal. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-TTN-WANG (Pasadena, Calif.) _ Once before, Wei Wang walked away from a career as a national-caliber table tennis player. Now, more than 15 years later, she has proven that she still has what it takes. Wang, who lives in Pasadena, immigrated here from China in 1986 and became a United States citizen in 1993. Earlier this year, she qualified for the U.S. Olympic team. Her trip to Atlanta will satisfy a career goal she once sacrificed when she retired from the sport in the mid-'80s. 15.7 inches.  By Dave Allen. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-BBO-WEAVER (Simi Valley, Calif.) _ To fully appreciate the meteoric rise of Jeff Weaver, you have to understand that just two years ago, he was an undistinguished, rarely used relief pitcher for Simi Valley High School's baseball team. He went off to college to study physical therapy. He enrolled at Fresno State and decided to try out for the Bulldogs' baseball team as a walk-on. Nobody knew who he was. Now he's an Olympian, making the team as a ``one-in-a-million longshot.'' 13.2 inches.  By Eric Sondheimer. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-JWILLIAMS (San Fernando, Calif.) _ For years, Jeff Williams of San Fernando was among the nation's best 10 or 15 competitors in both the 100 and 200 meters. And then, last year, he blossomed. At the relatively advanced age of 29, he ran personal bests of 10.19 in the 100 and 20.18 in the 200. He capped his splendid year by placing third in the 200 in the world championships. 14 inches.  By Jon Wilner. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-HKY-SWILLIAMS (Newbury Park, Calif.) _ Scott Williams vividly remembers the first time he ever heard of field hockey. It was the year before the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles and members of the U.S. Olympic team were giving 12-year-old Williams and his classmates a demonstration of their game. Mike Newton and other '84 Olympians had shown up that day at Newbury Park's Sequoia Junior High School to drum up interest for a fledgling youth program. The sport already enjoyed growing enthusiasm among adults in Ventura County. ``They told us if we liked it to come out Saturday and sign up and they'd show us how to play,'' said Williams, who has learned the game better than anyone might have predicted. Thirteen years later, he is still playing _ as a teammate of Newton on the U.S. Olympic squad that will compete this month in the Atlanta Games. 16.2 inches.  By Dave Shelburne.

UKRAINE-FARMERS (Bashtanka, Ukraine) _ Private farmers complain they are shut out from receiving any of the 600 American combines that are arriving in Ukraine. Who is getting the machines is a state-controlled company that is reselling them to government-run agricultural centers _ a move some say undercuts U.S. efforts to promote reform. Jane Perlez.  NATIONAL  NYC-SOARING-RENTS (New York) _ Finding a rental apartment in Manhattan has become as complicated and even more costly than it was in the mid-to-late 1980s, when soaring rents and prices, sprouting condominium towers, and co-op conversions helped define the character of an economic boom. New York is not, by most measures, having another economic boom right now; and that's where the rent issue gets interesting. The smoke is back, but without the fire. Kirk Johnson.  NYC-HMO-WOES (New York) _ Millions of New Yorkers have recently enrolled in HMOs, and most have slowly learned to navigate the system. But a growing number, mostly with chronic conditions or serious diseases, say they are being denied desperately-needed care. And instead of battling their illness, they find themselves fighting with their health plans for permission to get treatment.  FINANCIAL  JAPAN-STRONGDOLLAR (Undated) _ For a decade after the dollar began its long slide in value against the yen in 1985, American auto makers and other manufacturers enjoyed a special form of protection from Japanese competitors, whose imported products became almost inexorably more expensive in the United States. But now the sheltered years are coming to an end. The dollar has soared 39 percent from its trough in April of last year. As each dollar of sales in the United States translates into more yen at home, Japanese manufacturers have found themselves in the catbird seat, with a choice of grabbing bigger profits, cutting prices to build market share, or both. What it adds up to, a growing contingent of corporate leaders and economists say, is a new competitive threat to American companies, particularly auto makers. Keith Bradsher and Andrew Pollack.

OLY-BKO-DREAM (Undated) _ Set against the thousands of amateurs who have trained their whole lives for the privilege of melting in the Georgia sun are the dozen pros who won't have to work hard at all to win gold.

What better place to celebrate the Centennial Olympics than the capital of their homeland and the site of their rebirth? But on September 18, 1990, in a Tokyo hotel ballroom, the International Olympic Committee voted 51-35 to award the Centennial Games to Atlanta, a city known worldwide as the backdrop for ``Gone With the Wind.''

OLY-OVERVIEW (Undated) _ Atlanta's Olympic dream becomes reality Friday, when the Games of the XXVI Olympiad begin with the Opening Ceremony at the new, 83,000-seat Olympic Stadium. Billy Payne, president of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, has all the ingredients in place for an historic 17 days. Every nation that received an invitation accepted _ essentially, the world boycotted a boycott _ and that translates into Fifteen nations once under the auspices of the Soviet Union will participate.

OLY-BKO-DIVAC (Los Angeles) _ As a seven-year NBA veteran, he knows maybe better than anyone in the Olympic men's basketball tournament that the Dreamers III will scarcely be challenged, much less beaten. Divac is required by unofficial Olympic law to be optimistic, but in private he'll own up to reality and admit that Yugoslavia is playing for silver. This summer, like this coming season, gold won't be Divac's color. 13 inches.  By Marc Stein. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-ACUFF (Los Angeles) _ Amy Acuff knows that some people don't take her seriously when she says it. That's OK, though.

One day, she is certain, she will prove her doubters wrong with a single leap. 15.9 inches.  By Michael Rosenthal. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-HKY-AMAR (Camarillo, Calif.) _ Camarillo's Larry Amar is the United States' best field hockey player.

OLY-RUN-BENITEZ (Woodland Hills, Calif.) _ Quincy Watts failed to earn a berth on the U.S. Olympic team. Taft High School's track and field team, though, will be represented in the Olympics.

OLY-RUN-BOLDON (Los Angeles) _ You may not have heard of him, but Ato Boldon is a star athlete. At least in his native country, Trinidad, for whom the UCLA senior will compete in the Olympic games. In June, he posted a time of 9.92 seconds in the 100 meters at the NCAA Track and Field Championships in Eugene, Ore., the fastest clocking by anyone this year. He thinks his chances are good, saying, ``Right now, I'd have to be the favorite in the 100.'' 17 inches.  By Michael Ventre. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-SWM-BRIDGEWATER (Los Angeles) _ The Olympic experience is something Brad Bridgewater has been anticipating for four years now. As an 18-year-old freshman at the University of Texas, he was invited to the 1992 Olympic Trials. ``I was frightened by the whole thing,'' said Bridgewater, a two-time Florida state swimming champion. ``I was just a kid. It was pretty incredible. I was swimming with the best in the country. I was pretty satisfied with it.'' Four years changed Bridgewater, who swallowed the tough experience of finishing seventh in the 200-meter backstroke in 1992 and used it for inspiration for this year's trials. This time, the 6-foot-4 Bridgewater, now from USC, blew the field away and landed a berth in the 200-meter backstroke. 14.4 inches.  By Gary Washburn. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-HKY-BUTCHER (Simi Valley, Calif.) _ Nick Butcher of Simi Valley is, at age 20, the youngest member of the U.S. Olympic field hockey team.

OLY-VBL-CASTRO (La Crescenta, Calif.) _ After Gail Castro and her partner, Deb Richardson, surprised the beach-volleyball world by fighting through the trials in Baltimore and making the Olympics, they were called before the TV cameras for the customary quick interview. It was Castro's chance to say, ``Hey, a 38-year-old wife and mom has just defied the odds and made it to Atlanta!'' Or, ``Dreams do come true!'' Or maybe just, ``Hi, Larry! Hi, Larry Jr.!'' Instead, she opened her mouth and _ nothing. A chatty, friendly woman who had just showed guts and grit to help win a vital match, she froze as if the microphone were emitting tonsil-paralyzing gas. Partner Richardson had to do all the talking. Castro (nee Wolze) _ a former star at Crescenta Valley High, Valley College and Long Beach State, an ex-indoor pro in Italy, a pioneer of the women's pro-beach tour _ had all her struggles and disappointments and broken beach partnerships and sacrifices flash through her mind. 15.2 inches.

OLY-ROW-COLLINS (Thousand Oaks, Calif.) _ David Collins of Thousand Oaks has sacrificed plenty to compete in one of rowing's most grueling events _ lightweight fours without coxswain. ``When you get to the end (of a 2,000-meter, nearly six-minute race), I mean, your legs are burning, your lungs are screaming, and your vision starts to become a tunnel,'' the 26-year-old Westlake High graduate said. ``You focus on what's ahead _ the last 20 strokes, the person in front of you _ and almost let your body take over because your mind wants to tell you to stop.'' 15.9 inches.

OLY-SOF-CORNELL (Woodland Hills, Calif.) _ Woodland Hills' Sheila Cornell, at 34, is one of the United States' most distinguished softball players. She is a 13-year veteran of the U.S. national team, has won eight gold medals in international competition with the United States and is a 10-time Amateur Softball Association All-American. The 1980 Taft High School graduate is also one of the best hitters in the game. ``She's the person I would most like to have at bat with the game on the line,'' said Olympic team coach Ralph Weekly.

OLY-WTP-CORSO (Van Nuys, Calif.) _ Rich Corso has been preparing himself for this moment for more than 20 years. ``My job is to get the ballclub into the championship game,'' said the head coach of the U.S. Olympic water polo team who coaches water polo at Harvard-Westlake High School in North Hollywood in between his national duties. ``I believe you have an obligation if you are hosting an Olympic Games to be in the championship game.'' 14.5 inches.

High on the fact he's made the U.S. Olympic track and field team in the 110-meter hurdles. High on the fact he's on the verge of becoming a father for the first time. (His wife Keisha was due on the 13th). ``I thank God for these two joyous events in one moment,'' the USC graduate says in the driveway of his Valencia home. ``They balance each other out. They help keep me calm. When I'm waiting around getting overly excited about running, I can think about the baby.'' 13.5 inches.  By Johannes Tesselaar. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-HDB-DELARIVA (Chatsworth, Calif.) _ Chatsworth resident Sandra De La Riva has made three trips to the Olympic Games as a player.

OLY-RUN-DEVERS (Los Angeles) _ The Olympics are about drama, about overcoming adversity, about excellence in athleticism despite the enormous challenges. Gail Devers knows what the Olympics are about. The Van Nuys native is a monument to perseverence. She won the 100 meters in Barcelona in 1992. The gold medal was hers, but the prize of overcoming Graves disease shone more brilliantly. 15.3 inches.  By Michael Ventre. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-DUMBLE (Los Angeles) _ Dawn Dumble is known for throwing her weight around. That weight _ a 9-pound metal ball _ has given the Panorama City native an identity among America's track and field elite and has been her ticket to the Summer Games in Atlanta. Never mind that shot putters usually don't ignite the kind of media hoopla that, say, the more dashing sprinters do. ``I just love what I'm doing.... It's an expression of myself,'' said the UCLA graduate, who is also among the nation's best in the discus. 16.3 inches.  By Eddie Ibardolasa. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-ROW-FALLON (Los Angeles) _ Catriona Fallon was a little surprised to hear how she was described to a reporter. ``She gets into pain quicker than anyone else and tolerates it longer,'' was the way Terry Friel, the U.S. Olympic rowing team publicist, put it. ``It's interesting she said !ital!that!off! about me,'' Fallon, a UCLA graduate, said quizzically on the phone from Oak Ridge, Tenn., where she was training to pull a port-side oar on the women's eight that is favored to win the July 28 Olympic final.

OLY-SOC-FAWCETT (Los Angeles) _ Joy Fawcett did not play soccer because she hoped one day she would represent her country at the Olympics or the World Cup. That's because when Fawcett began, there was no women's soccer in the Olympics or World Cup. ``We were doing it because we loved the sport,'' Fawcett said. ``It's fun to see it grow.'' The 28-year-old Fawcett has seen many firsts for women's soccer. In addition to being a member of the U.S. National Team that won the first World Cup for women, she became the first women's soccer coach at UCLA. Now, she is competing in the first Olympics where women's soccer is a medal sport. 13.3 inches.  By Kathy Orton. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-HDB-FERCHO (Camarillo, Calif.) _ Denny Fercho plays team handball, a game not many Americans know. It's NOT like racquetball; rather, it resembles a combination of basketball, hockey, soccer, water polo and football. Fercho was exposed to the game first when he saw a match at the '84 Olympics in L.A. and, with the help of a grant of the Amateur Athletics Foundation, soon mastered it and became one of America's best players. Then he was cut from the team, told he was too small. He overcame that obstacle by mastering the fundamentals better than anyone. Says U.S. coach Rick Oleksyk: ``Denny is the smallest in size on the team, but possesses the largest heart. His desire is second to none.'' 14.8 inches.  By Kevin Modesti. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-SOF-FERNANDEZ (Los Angeles) _ If U.S. Olympic team pitcher/infielder Lisa Fernandez is not already the best softball player in the nation, just wait a while. ``God didn't give me the talent to run fast or be quick or be strong,'' she said, ``but He gave me determination.'' That quality has carried Fernandez from an inauspicious beginning to a level of play unmatched in either softball or baseball, in the opinion of UCLA coach and softball Hall of Famer Sharron Backus. ``Lisa Fernandez is the best all-around softball player in the history of the sport,'' said Backus, who coached Fernandez for four years at UCLA. ``If you try to compare her to a major-league baseball player, she has no equal. There is no one who can pitch, hit and field like Lisa in the major leagues, nor has there been an equal in collegiate softball.'' 14.3 inches.  By Dave Shelburne.

OLY-ROW-FULLER (Westlake Village, Calif.) _ When the Fuller family first moved to the shores of Thousand Oaks' Lake Sherwood 20 years ago, one of the first gifts 8-year-old Amy received was a 12-foot wooden row boat. ``Her brother had a (sailboat),'' Diane Fuller, Amy's mother, remembered recently. ``She would get out there and challenge him to a race around the island in the middle of the lake.'' Thus began a sporting endeavor that brought Fuller a silver medal in the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, an accomplishment she hopes to improve on as her competitive life winds to a close this week in Atlanta. The odds are good that is precisely what will happen. Fuller and her world-champion American teammates are the favorites to win the women's eights class in Olympic rowing. 11.8 inches.

He surprised many when he turned down a $300,000 signing bonus from the San Diego Padres and enrolled at UCLA. Now the Bruins shortstop/third baseman/first baseman, who hit .352 with 16 home runs and 50 RBI for the Bruins, is fulfilling a dream of playing in the Olympics. 14 inches.  By Eric Sondheimer. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-GODINA (Los Angeles) _ After becoming the first American to qualify for the Olympic Games in both the shot put and discus since USC's Bud Howser in 1924, John Godina of UCLA still can't believe his resume, which includes the world title, five NCAA titles and a collegiate record of 72-2\ in the shot put. Godina now wants to strive for goals others have thought impossible. Foremost is becoming one of the best in the world in both throws. The discus, even though it was the first event he tried as a fifth-grader, has always been overshadowed by his feats in the shot. 14.1 inches.  By Danny Schumacher. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-WTP-HACKETT (Los Angeles) _ If not for a protective mother, Dan Hackett might not be the No.2 goalie on the U.S. Olympic water polo team. He might not be the favorite to be the No.1 man in goal in Sydney in 2000. In fact, the UCLA graduate might not have ever even played the sport. ``My mom thought I'd break my neck playing football,'' said Hackett, who was not pleased with the decision at the time. ``Water polo is played during the same season _ so I went out for water polo.'' 13 inches.  By Dave Shelburne. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-VBL-HAGER (Los Angeles) _ Former Cal State Northridge star Axel Hager will be back on American soil this month representing Germany in the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Hager helped lead the Matadors to their first NCAA championship appearance in 1992 in the Finals. Hager, who has qualified in beach volleyball, follows Bob Samuelson, who played for U.S. indoor team in 1992, as the second Northridge volleyball player to reach the Olympics. 12.5 inches.

OLY-RUN-HANSON (Ventura, Calif.) _ Ventura's Sharon Hanson isn't convinced her troublesome right knee, which has required six different operations, hasn't helped her track and field career as much as it has hindered it. It was, after all, her first knee injury back in high school that kept a promising hurdler and long jumper from competing in her specialties and forced her to try a few new events during track season. Hanson discovered she could do those other things pretty well, so well that she'll be doing them against some of the world's best athletes in the Olympic Games' heptathlon competition in Atlanta. 12.7 inches.  By Tim McClain. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-CAN-HARPER (Ventura, Calif.) _ Ventura canoeist Joseph Harper is the sole American entry in the 1,000-meter single canoe sprint. It's been since 1952 that an American has medaled in a canoe sprint, and the 30-year-old paddler isn't expected to change that. To a certain degree that has worked to his advantage. He has already completed a lifelong dream of making it to the Olympics; everything else is extra. It may be the attitude he needs to reach his ultimate goal: a personal best time during the Summer Games. 15.9 inches.  By Brett Pauly. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-SOC-HEJDUK (Los Angeles) _ Frankie Hejduk had an unusual way of relieving stress before a game while at UCLA. He didn't pace the floor of his dorm room, or dribble the ball endlessly. He drove to Zuma Beach and went surfing. His endeavors not only clear his mind, they have helped him become a better athlete. ``I think one of the plusses to my game is I can run all day long. I attribute that to surfing.'' The 21-year-old defender, in addition to being a member of the Olympic soccer team, also plays for the Tampa Bay Mutiny of Major League Soccer. 14.8 inches.  By Eric Noland. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-HERAZO (Los Angeles) _ Her sport is a walking contradiction, but there is universal agreement on Victoria Herazo's designation as a world-class athlete. It's just hard to get recognition when your Olympic event seems based on compromise, or at least, appears slightly confused. But the Castaic resident has gotten well past all the jokes reserved for racewalking, a sport that is a cross between walking and running, but strays from completely relying on either motion. A simple rule to remember is that racewalkers are not allowed to lift both feet off the ground simultaneously during a race. 18.5 inches.  By Scott Wolf. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-ARC-HUISH (Simi Valley, Calif.) _ Justin Huish of Simi Valley, with grungy hipness and athletic good looks, has become the cover boy of sorts of the U.S. archery team. If you drive down Broken Arrow Street in Simi, you might come across the 21-year-old. To practice for the Olympics _ when he's not at the national training center in San Diego _ he shoots at a target set up between the barbecue and the wind chimes in his parents' backhard. To reach the minimum international range of 30 meters, he backs up through the garage, down the driveway and onto the street named, quite coincidentally, Broken Arrow. Then he fires away _ through a narrow doorway and, sometimes, over a sleeping Akita named Bear. 14.3 inches.  By Kevin Modesti. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-BBO-JONES (Los Angeles) _ With all of his physical skills, Jacque Jones looks deep inside when asked about his true strength. The former USC baseball player and second-round draft pick of the Minnesota Twins is as strong mentally as he is physically. While coaches and scouts rave about his rare combination of speed and power, Jones concentrates on his mental game. The outfielder credits a key adjustment in his early years at USC for his success on the U.S. national team. ``At first, everything that went wrong, I got down on myself,'' Jones said from Houston, Texas. ``When I got to USC, Coach (Mike) Gillespie taught me to keep my head up and stay in the game. Ever since then, it's been my strength.'' 14.1 inches.  By Gary Washburn. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-KAWAR (La Crescenta, Calif.) _ At Crescenta Valley High School, Nada Kawar played basketball and, when she needed a physical education class, decided to give track and field a try. Ultimately, she developed into one of the state's top throwers and earned a scholarship to UCLA, where she has competed in the shot put and discus in the NCAA meet the past two years. She has twice earned All-American honors indoors. Kawar, a resident of La Crescenta since her parents brought the family to the United States in 1989, will represent Jordan in the Olympics. ``They got a little excited,'' said Kawar, one of the top weight throwers at UCLA. It's no wonder. Until Kawar came along, she said, the national record in the shot put ``was around 37 feet.'' Now, her best mark of 55 feet, } inches has been certified as the best ever in the country's modest track and field program. (She has thrown 183-11 in the discus). Suddenly, Jordan, where she already has become something of a national figure, had an American-trained, world-class weight thrower. 15.2 inches.  By Michael Rosenthal.

So when she competes in this month's Olympic Games, her fiercest opponent may well be the heat. Her confidant, guru and husband, Bob Kersee, hopes the humidity will help temper her asthma. With Florence Griffith-Joyner, her sister-in-law, officially out ofthe Atlanta Games, Jackie Joyner-Kersee may have the headlines to herself. She doesn't care. That isn't why she competes. ``She absolutely loves the sport,'' Bob Kersee explains. ``She's an athlete first and a celebrity second. 15.8 inches.  By Michael Ventre.

And that is how four-time NCAA champion hammer-thrower Balazs Kiss became a Trojan. A year out of high school, the 19-year-old Hungarian wrote to USC coaches in 1992 and asked for a scholarship. They had never heard of him. Four years later, Kiss has just finished a USC career in which he won every meet he entered. And he will represent his homeland in the Atlanta Games as a favorite to win a medal. 15.5 inches.  By Bill Schlotter. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-SHO-LAKATOS (Los Angeles) _ Josh Lakatos shoots trap for the U.S. Olympic team, a sport in which athletes fire at 200 clay targets traveling at nearly 80 mph from different stations over the course of several hours. A prodigy in the sport, the 23-year-old owns several world records. He recently won a match in Europe against essentially the same competitors he will face in Atlanta. Asked if he believes he will win the gold, Lakatos answers resolutely. ``Absolutely,'' he said, ``because I'm ready. There is no doubt.'' 17.2 inches.  By Michael A. Anastasi.

Despite growing to 6-foot-5 before leaving high school, Leslie had a hard time swallowing the idea that she was meant to play basketball. The U.S. Olympian didn't take up the sport until age 12, when her cousin encouraged her to shoot around at a local gym. Slowly, she began mastering the fundamentals, and a year later she received her first college recruiting letter. 12.3 inches.  By Gary Washburn. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-MARSH (Los Angeles) _ Michael Marsh, a graduate of Hawthorne High School and UCLA, has quietly become one of America's best short sprinters _ 100 and 200 _ and, with two Olympic gold medals to his name, one of the nation's most accomplished. He is the only American who will run both the 100 and 200 in the Atlanta Games. 15.5 inches.  By Michael Rosenthal. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-HKY-MARUQUIN (Ventura, Calif.) _ Ben Maruquin, starting sweeper for the American Olympic field hockey team, has not _ repeat, has not _ had a field hockey stick in his hands since birth. But pretty darn close. Actually, Maruquin, of Ventura, was about 4 when his father, Mogie Maruquin, joined the U.S. national team in 1974. His uncle, John Stockdill, was also a national team player. So a sport that few other Americans can claim even to understand came naturally to the 26-year-old seven-year starter. 13.1 inches.  By Bill Schlotter. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-MILLER (Los Angeles) _ Sprinter Inger Miller always had the genes. It was good health that had evaded her. Miller, a graduate of USC, is the daughter of Lennox Miller, the sprinter from Jamaica who won a silver medal in the 100-meter dash in the 1968 Olympics and a bronze in the same event in 1972. The first time she stepped on the track, as a child, she displayed raw speed handed down by her father, speed that enabled to succeed at Muir High School and USC. However, chronic injuries prevented her from taking that one final step to stardom _ until now. Miller, 24, outleaned Gwen Torrence to earn the third and final Olympic berth in the 200 and, as the fourth-place finisher in the 100, will be part of the 400 relay pool. 14.5 inches.

OLY-HKY-O'NEILL (Newbury Park, Calif.) _ When the O'Neill family moved from Michigan to Newbury Park in the early 1980s, there was a bit of culture shock lying in wait for young son John. Ice hockey was his favorite sport. And they didn't play it in Southern California in those days. Then one of his new classmates at Newbury Park High School introduced him to field hockey. ``One of my friends said, `Hey, let's go try this out,''' O'Neill said. ``And I just kind of ran with it.'' Run with it, he did. All the way to the Olympic Games. O'Neill, Mr. Versatility on the American Olympic field hockey team, can play almost anywhere on the midfield or back lines, skills that have made him a valuable substitute. 13.4 inches.

OLY-BBO-PARQUE (Los Angeles) _ When UCLA left-handed pitcher Jim Parque was finally extended an invitation to try out for the U.S. Olympic baseball team last May, his reply was, ``What took you so long?'' ``I just knew all along I could compete with any of these guys,'' Parque said. ``I was a little disappointed with the late invitation, but an invite is an invite.'' Parque proved he deserved the tryout, because he made the elite 20-man team as a relief pitcher. The former Crescenta Valley High School star was considered a longshot at the start of training camp last June, but he showed he could be a left-handed setup man and spot starter.

OLY-SWM-QUANCE (Northridge, Calif.) _ Kristine Quance won't be compteting in her signature event, the 400-meter IM, in the Atlanta Games, but don't count her out of medal contention just yet. After being disqualified by a turn judge's controversial call in the U.S. Olympic Trials in that event, the USC swimmer and Northridge native has a renewed commitment to winning the 200 IM and the 100 breast, the events for which she did qualify. Without the pressure of being the favorite, her coach thinks she had an excellent shot at a medal. 16.3 inches.  By Michael Ventre. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file.)  OLY-BKO-REGGIE (Undated) _ After a rivalry spanning three decades, this is the summer that Reggie Miller gets even with sister Cheryl.

OLY-SOF-RICHARDSON (Los Angeles) _ Anything would be harder for Sherman Oaks' Dot Richardson than softball, a sport she has excelled at since age 10 _ when she was recruited by a women's Class A fastpitch team in Florida. Three years later, she was playing at the highest amateur level in the nation. By age 17, Richardson was competing against the best in the world as a member of her first of 18 consecutive U.S. national teams. Richardson later helped lead UCLA to the 1982 NCAA championship. Now she's an M.D., on one-year leave from USC Medical Center, competing in the Olympics for the first time. 17 inches.  By Dave Shelburne. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-WTP-ROUSSEAU (Los Angeles) _ Of the four basic old-world substances _ earth, air, fire and water _ Alex Rousseau finds three to be irrelevant. ``I'm definitely a water-oriented person,'' said Rousseau. ``Swimming, surfing, water polo ... I love the water.'' He also excels in it. Since his introduction to water polo as a freshman at Santa Monica High School, the former UCLA star, 28, has matured into a starter on the U.S. Olympic team. 12.8 inches.  By Bill Schlotter. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-SWIM-SALMEEN (Los Angeles) _ Annette Salmeen was a strong swimmer in high school, but she never thought she would make it to the Olympics. Her scientific approach to life _ she's a chemistry major at UCLA _ has helped her perfect her swimming, and she will be the first female Bruin since 1972 to compete in the Olympics, in the 200 butterfly and 800 free relay. ``Annette understands the difference between weight and buoyancy,'' says Bruins assistant coach Brad Burnham. ``She knows what a vector is. She understands the difference between speed and velocity and the weight of your hips versus the mass of your hips. Some swimmers go by what it feels like in the water. Annette needs numbers.'' To solve one of her recurring problems _ a slow-moving center of mass _ Salmeen watched underwater video and worked with her coach to figure out a way to position her body parts in the most effective way possible. ``To Annette, swimming fast is a problem that must be solved,'' Burnham said, ``and the pool is like her labratory.'' 14.7 inches.

When he stepped into goal for the UCLA soccer team three years ago, it was on the heels of a long procession of glittery All-American goalies: Tim Harris, Anton Nistl, Brad Friedel. Snitko more than held his own. He kept the line of succession strong by earning All-American recognition after the 1995 season, earned some distinction in the Bruins record book, and has capped the achievements with inclusion on the U.S. Olympic men's soccer team. 14 inches.  By Eric Noland. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-TERRY (Los Angeles) _ UCLA's Mike Terry is no world-class athlete. He is barely knocking on the national-class door. He didn't qualify for the NCAA Championships. And according to one of his coaches, he would have had a very difficult time qualifying at the U.S. Olympic Trials held in Atlanta last month. But he will compete at the Summer Olympics in the 400 meters nevertheless. He will represent his father's homeland _ Antigua and Barbuda, the small island gems of the Carribean adorned with 365 beaches _ one for each day of the year. 14.1 inches.  By P.K. Daniel. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-GYM-UMPHREY (Los Angeles) _ It might be hard to find too many athletes at this year's Olympics who appreciate the opportunity more than gymnast Chainey Umphrey. Four years ago, at the Olympic Trials in Baltimore, the UCLA graduate felt like an Olympian for a teasingly brief period of time. As the gymnasts jockeyed for the seven qualifying spots, an assistant coach told Umphrey he was headed for Barcelona. By a small margin, the coach had made a huge mistake _ Umphrey missed qualifying by eight one-hundredths of a point. That was the last he wanted to hear about Barcelona. 17.4 inches.  By Brad Nelson.

Both men have had their turns surging in that competition, and although it is not certain who will start in the Olympics, Vano said that's not important. ``What's important is the team,'' he said. ```The big satisfaction comes when you put on your jersey for your country.'' 15 inches.

Even as an elementary school-aged child, he said, ``I loved to fight.'' And he did. In time, it was no longer news when Vargas was suspended from school, apparent evidence the boy was headed in a self-destructive direction. And then, when he was only 10, came a turning point. ``I was watching a local amateur boxing tournament on cable TV and was just mesmerized,'' said Vargas, a resident of Oxnard. ``I didn't know there was such a thing for kids. So all by myself, without my mom knowing, I found out where the gym was and went there. ``My mom didn't like it at all when she found out. She thought I would get hurt. When she saw I was hurting other people, though, I guess it was all right.'' 14.0 inches.  By Michael Rosenthal. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-TTN-WANG (Pasadena, Calif.) _ Once before, Wei Wang walked away from a career as a national-caliber table tennis player. Now, more than 15 years later, she has proven that she still has what it takes. Wang, who lives in Pasadena, immigrated here from China in 1986 and became a United States citizen in 1993. Earlier this year, she qualified for the U.S. Olympic team. Her trip to Atlanta will satisfy a career goal she once sacrificed when she retired from the sport in the mid-'80s. 15.7 inches.

OLY-BBO-WEAVER (Simi Valley, Calif.) _ To fully appreciate the meteoric rise of Jeff Weaver, you have to understand that just two years ago, he was an undistinguished, rarely used relief pitcher for Simi Valley High School's baseball team. He went off to college to study physical therapy. He enrolled at Fresno State and decided to try out for the Bulldogs' baseball team as a walk-on. Nobody knew who he was. Now he's an Olympian, making the team as a ``one-in-a-million longshot.'' 13.2 inches.  By Eric Sondheimer. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-RUN-JWILLIAMS (San Fernando, Calif.) _ For years, Jeff Williams of San Fernando was among the nation's best 10 or 15 competitors in both the 100 and 200 meters. And then, last year, he blossomed. At the relatively advanced age of 29, he ran personal bests of 10.19 in the 100 and 20.18 in the 200. He capped his splendid year by placing third in the 200 in the world championships. 14 inches.  By Jon Wilner. (Will move on the ``s'' sports file).  OLY-HKY-SWILLIAMS (Newbury Park, Calif.) _ Scott Williams vividly remembers the first time he ever heard of field hockey. It was the year before the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles and members of the U.S. Olympic team were giving 12-year-old Williams and his classmates a demonstration of their game. Mike Newton and other '84 Olympians had shown up that day at Newbury Park's Sequoia Junior High School to drum up interest for a fledgling youth program. The sport already enjoyed growing enthusiasm among adults in Ventura County. ``They told us if we liked it to come out Saturday and sign up and they'd show us how to play,'' said Williams, who has learned the game better than anyone might have predicted. Thirteen years later, he is still playing _ as a teammate of Newton on the U.S. Olympic squad that will compete this month in the Atlanta Games. 16.2 inches.  By Dave Shelburne.

Q. Has he served as a go-between between you and the Indonesian Government or the Suharto Government, or with China? A. Not to my knowledge, no. I don't believe he has. You know, when _ I have conversations with hundreds of people, and I always assume that whatever I say to them they might say to someone else. Q. But you never asked him to undertake such a liaison? A. No, not to my knowledge. No, I mean, I did not ask him to do that. He has _ but if I said to him _ let me give you an example. I want to just _ if I said to him, I want a good, strong, positive relationship with China, and my objective is to engage China, not to isolate it _ which is something I have said to many people, mostly American citizens who do business in China, knowing that they might have contacts with people in the Chinese Government _ it would be clear to him and everyone else _ or if I said to him, I want to continue to pursue this relationship and make it ever better, I mean, it wouldn't surprise me if he said that to somebody the next time he was in China because I expect that to be done by _ I mean, a lot of times I do that deliberately knowing that it would be communicated. But that's not any different than I've done with scores of other people in similar situations involving other countries. But he's never sort of become any kind of a, you know, unofficial envoy or something like that. Q. Your Administration decided two years ago to suspend its investigation of worker rights in Indonesia, after the Indonesian Government made some guarantees to you about improvements. There are very serious questions now about whether a number of those improvements they promised have actually been acted upon. In retrospect, do you think you were too light on Indonesia? A. I can't answer the question in the sense that I haven't had any kind of report from that from our people over there. What I did on that was I took the recommendations of the N.S.C. They worked it through and I took their recommendations on it. When we came in the one thing I was determined to do was to find a way to promote better relations with a lot of these countries and keep those markets alive for American economic reasons _ and also for political reasons because I thought it would reduce the chances of bad things happening in that part of the world _ without abandoning America's position on human rights. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"

, he said,	 O'Reilly, who served as a Clinton delegate at the 1992 Democratic nominating convention, blamed the former president for failing to follow Justice Department procedures for checking out pardon requests. If that process had been used, he said, then the applicants and their supporters would not be under suspicion. </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, he said,	 The new figures have some thought-provoking information, he said, including a change in an ``arbitrary assumption that immigration from poorer to richer areas of the world was going to decrease progressively.'' But he said immigration alone did not account for America's fertility rate. </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, he said,	 Whatever the cause, he said, ``We are the only developed country today that is anywhere near replacement level, and nobody has an explanation for it.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, he said,	 Marchand's death forced Chase to rethink his plotting for the season, he said, and inspired the episode, which culminates in a memorial service for Livia. It is a scene that he acknowledged ``plays a little like a one-act play.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, he said,	 The new season, he said, will include some general themes, with Tony and Carmela's two children probably featured more than before. But mainly, Chase said, ``Everything has to be seen as part of the gangster life.'' The pressure to continue to tell unusual stories has made it harder for Chase to foresee taking the series beyond next season. In several recent interviews he has indicated that he expected to shut the series down after that. </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, he added,	 ``It looks like the trend is showing signs of bottoming,'' said Jay Feldman, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston. Still, he added, ``There really is something for everybody in the durable goods data.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, he believes,	 Asked what he thought would have happened without such programs Espinosa said, ``I don't like to think about it.'' But today, he believes, his Irvine-based business has outgrown the need for them. </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, he said,	 For Ocampo, such a shift is a bigger undertaking. His engineering company specializes in serving the utilities, he said, not unlike a doctor who specializes in internal medicine. In fact, it was at PG&AMP;E's suggestion that he left his engineering job at Bechtel to go out on his own. </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, he said,	 Should the utilities he deals with go bankrupt, he said, ``we will be hit very hard.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, he said,	 Joseph F. Alderete, who runs Southern California Edison's program, said there had been a 10 percent cutback across the board in December. And beyond the cutbacks, he said, some of his contractors were confronted by banks that no longer wanted to lend them money. ``They were kind of getting squeezed from both ends.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, we guess,	 We all know we like to do exactly what we shouldn't. So, what do you do when you go to a Web site that tells you not to to espn.com? You go to espn.com, of course. Such is the theory, we guess, behind ESPN.com's new marketing ploy: They've set up a Web site that mocks their own. Kathicam.com's very bright pink home page features the following statement: ``Welcome to my website, as you'll see it's way better than espn.com,'' which is conveniently hyperlinked to the sports site. </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, she says,	 Her latest CD is 1999's ``The Dust Bowl Symphony'' (Electra), a symphonic retrospective of her career. She recorded the album with the London Symphony, she says, because she wanted to shape her songs with the ``colors I had always wanted to hear in them.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz

, he said,	 But can this continue? Andre Schmitz, the acting general director at the Deutsche Oper, said the theater offered 257 performances in 2000, 60 fewer than in 1994. And despite cutting employees to 740 from 1,100 and modestly raising ticket prices, he said, the Deutsche Oper had a $3 million deficit because of annual wage increases. </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, he said,	 In a separate opinion on the cost-benefit issue, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who has written favorably about using cost-benefit analysis as a regulatory tool, said that statutory ambiguity should generally be read as ``permitting, not forbidding, this type of rational regulation.'' However, he said, the history and general structure of the Clean Air Act made clear that costs were not to be considered at the standard-setting stage. </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, she said,	 The challenge to the standards was led by the American Trucking Associations and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Robin S. Conrad, a lawyer for the chamber, said Tuesday that industry would continue to battle the standards both in court and in Congress where, she said, ``we will see if we can get the magic word `cost' put into the statute.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, he said,	 Joseph A. Osha, director of securities research at Merrill Lynch, said Intel was trying to perform a balancing act. As its core business of desktop computer products slowed, he said, Intel was pressing more urgently into chip products for faster-growing businesses like mobile and server systems. ``In the context of that challenge, they are doing as good a job as can be done,'' Osha said. ``They have handled the downturn as well as anyone in the industry.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, he said,	 Ball's work reflects, in one way or another, a life that has been shadowed by personal struggle. He grew up in a middle-class home in Marietta, Ga. ``Newt Gingrich's old congressional district _ I got out as quickly as I could,'' he said with a laugh. His father, Frank, was a quality control inspector for Lockheed. Ball was, he said, a closeted gay youth who could not face his sexuality. </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, he said,	 On both shows, he said, writers were expendable and the stars dominated the creative process. ``They looked on the shows as basically p.r. for their lives,'' Ball said. ``It was like taking dictation. You'd hear, `I have a bad haircut, so let's do a show about that.' It taught me a valuable lesson about television: not to be too proprietary about the material. Let it go. Find something else.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, they said,	 Despite that progress, Colombia experts and some lawmakers sounded a skeptical note. There will be no fast resolution to Colombia's problems, they said, citing, among other things, the need to establish the rule of law and to rein in paramilitary and security forces, which were harshly criticized by the State Department's human rights bureau this week. </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, he added,	 ``We are at the dawn of a whole new era of human affairs,'' Clinton said, noting the potential for combining democracy, human rights, and the global economy. However, he added, ``I am absolutely convinced it will not happen unless the American people know more, care more, understand more how it will affect their lives.'' </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010227.0335 type=story > <HEADLINE> WHERE HAVE YOU GONE, JOAN BLONDELL AND FAY BAINTER? </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-OSCARS-SUPPORTING-ACTRESSES-$ADV04-1,140(2TAKES)-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz

, he added,	 ``Serb tanks are in a very, very aggressive position,'' one American official said. ``They are in a position to run roughshod over this.'' For the moment, he added, Serbian authorities have pledged restraint, but it is not clear how long that restraint will last, the official said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, they say,	 But to a range of groups, from national school organizations to civil libertarians, the Good News Club is a chipper moniker for religious coercion of young children. Deciding the case in its favor, they say, would open up schools to groups eager to use schools as mission fields for religious conversion, or frighten schools into refusing to let anyone, even the local gardening club, use their space. </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, she said,	 A basket of roses rested on the table in front of her, a gift from the show's writers to congratulate her on the Oscar nomination. She is one of five best actress nominees _ along with Joan Allen (``The Contender''), Juliette Binoche (``Chocolat''), Laura Linney (``You Can Count on Me'') and Julia Roberts (``Erin Brockovich''). The day before, the trailer had been choked with flowers, she said, but it made it so hard to move around that she pared them down. </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, she said,	 The paradox was driven home to her most forcefully, she said, even before she received her Oscar nomination, when she found herself with three movies in theaters and a new television series at the same time. </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, you know,	 ``And now there's all this Oscar madness,'' Burstyn said. ``Literally, anything can happen in our lives, as long as we do our job, you know, and take care of business.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, she said,	 Although she did not attend the ceremony each time she was nominated for an Oscar, she said, she does hope to be at this year's event, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on March 25. </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, she said,	 The larger problem, she said, is that there are simply fewer roles like Sara _ complicated, layered characters, both male and female _ than there were back in the 1970s. </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, he said,	 An employee of Clemens Markets, a small chain in Pennsylvania, said in an interview that his company sells irradiated beef but that he could not talk about it because he might be fired if the chain's name was publicly connected with irradiation. Irradiated beef, he said, ``is not a major success story.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, she said,	 But Carol Tucker Foreman, director of the Consumer Federation of America's Food Policy Institute, objected to what she said was the industry's attempt to hide irradiation behind other words. Consumer research, she said, shows that shoppers want the term irradiation to appear on treated products. </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, he said,	 Bush's more focused strategy, Jones suggested, may have two timely rationales. One is the close division on Capitol Hill: `Given the politics of a 50-50 government, it's real hard to come on like gangbusters with a long list of things which you must have.'' Second, he said, ``In the context of basically good times, the public isn't saying `do this or else,''' and there is probably no single problem that must be solved to have politicians keep their jobs in 2002 or 2004. </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz

, he said,	 At a retail price of $20 a pound or more, growers here concede, Kona is one of the world's costliest coffees. Yet no one is getting rich; Langenstein estimates that he cleared about $20,000 last year. His mill, a ramshackle apparatus made of plywood and galvanized steel, with handmade pulleys and belts, is 100 years old. He sticks at it, he said, because he loves the climate, having grown up in Newark, N.Y., near Rochester, where winters can be brutal, and because ``it's such a great place to raise kids.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, he said,	 Eight years later, he became the first all-organic producer of Kona Coffee, substituting weed-whacking for herbicides and compost for chemical fertilizer, and enriching the soil further with glacial rock dust. He found in short order that his product, now sold under the Rooster Farms label (www.roosterfarms.com), could command a premium price, he said, ``just as it ought to.'' He charges $25.95 a pound, with shipping extra. </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz
, he said,	 In response, Klebanoff noted that publishers' changed their contracts' language over the last two decades to refer specifically to electronic books, suggesting their previous contracts did not include them. He added that major publishers have entered negotiations with their authors to buy electronic book rights, again implying that the publisher did not already own the rights. What is more, he said, no other publisher has sued him. A spokesman for RosettaBooks said that the lawyer David Boies is representing the start-up. </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz

, she said,	 China is trying to polish its human rights image, in part to aid its bid to host the 2008 Olympics. On Tuesday, the visiting U.N. commissioner for human rights, Mary Robinson, said that officials had indicated that China might ratify a key U.N. rights treaty, the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as early as Wednesday. But it was not clear, she said, whether China would fully accept the most sensitive clause in the covenant, which calls for free labor unions. </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz

, I think,	 A colleague recently put me onto a remarkable reading experience, the collected short stories of Alistair MacLeod, a Canadian writer who has the talent of turning geography into a character. Something only the best can do, I think, without being mushy. MacLeod clearly has a distinctive literary voice _ a Canadian one. And in reading him you remember that there is such a thing as Southern literary sensibility and a Western sensibility in this country. I know that Alice Munro, the great Canadian short fiction writer, also has among other things a commanding sense of region. Still, I haven't read enough of the Canadian writers to know if they have collectively a distinct discernment or taste that feeds on their homeland. </P> 	nyt_eng_200102.gz

"104321"	"I"	"mean"	" Speaking of this year's Hall class, since the league's cloistered voting system prevents most people who have been around pro football from voting, here are my selections from the 15 finalists. Parcells, Ray Guy, and Art Monk are unassailable. Guy is the greatest punter of all time. I once saw him kick a ball off the TV screens at the Superdome in New Orleans in practice just to prove he could do it. Monk's numbers speak for themselves, and so do Parcells's. Of the other finalists, how do you deny Jim Kelly, who took four teams to the Super Bowl? George Allen will probably get in because old coaches always do. I think Dave Casper, Lester Hayes, and L.C. Greenwood also deserve inclusion, but they won't all get in this time. My ballot (if I had one after 27 years covering the NFL) would read: Parcells, Guy, Monk, Allen, and Kelly, with a sentimental vote for John Stallworth. Hayes, Donnie Shell, Casper, and Bob Kuechenberg all deserve slots, too, but they'll have to wait. Please don't bring up Harry Carson's name again. If he hadn't played in New York, he'd be Vincent Brown, and would anyone outside of New England even consider him? . . . Green Bay wide receiver Antonio Freeman conceded last week that there will be a major difference Sunday playing in St. Louis's domed field rather than at frozen Lambeau Field. ``The sound will be vibrating off the walls of that dome,'' he said. ``There's a difference between playing outside and playing inside and a difference playing on grass and playing on turf so, I mean, yeah, there's a difference.'' You don't have to tell that to Packers quarterback Brett Favre. He's 10-14 in domed stadiums, including 2-7 at the Metrodome against the Vikings. His problem, people say in Green Bay, is that the noise level makes it difficult for Favre to be heard calling audibles, which he does more than most quarterbacks. When he goes to improvise in such circumstances, interceptions often result . . . From the Department of Disinformation, consider this statement by Freeman when asked about the long hours coaches work: ``Their schedules are identical to ours but they're here probably three hours earlier and probably stay about seven hours later than we do.'' So, other than the 10 hours difference, assistant coaches in the NFL have it the same as their players. Glad we cleared that up. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"

TOP  Lede story:  WAGE-STAGNATION (Undated) _ Although the recession has ended, the wages of more than 100 million workers are still stagnant, endangering the consumer spending that sustains the fragile recovery. The stagnation in total wages paid to the nation's employees outside of government is now a year old, according to newly revised government data, which paints a bleak picture of the economy. By Louis Uchitelle.  (Scheduled to move by 2 p.m. ET in ``a'' news file.)  Top center story:  HEALTHCARE-COSTS (Washington) _ Ten years after a health care crisis threw American politics into turmoil, many experts see another one on the horizon. The cost of health care, which had stabilized in the mid-1990s with the advent of managed care, is climbing rapidly again, putting new strains on employers, workers and government health programs.

Off-lead story:  ISRAEL-SETTLEMENT (Jerusalem) _ Five years ago, Israel's decision to build a sprawling housing complex on a pine-covered hilltop of east Jerusalem temporarily brought peace negotiations with the Palestinians to a halt. The plan was condemned by the United Nations, criticized by the United States and bitterly protested by Palestinians and left-wing Israelis. But in Jerusalem, the extreme has a way of becoming as routine as a mortgage payment. Now the project, called Har Homa, is becoming a reality of stark white stone and glass brick, a suburban dream hewn from a tormented landscape. By James Bennet.  With photos.

FOLD  LATAM-ECON (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) _ Brazil and other Latin American governments have followed Washington down the free market path, only to find they are now losing control over their economies. The immediate consequences are most visible here in Brazil. By Larry Rohter.  (Scheduled to move by 3 p.m. ET in ``i'' news file.)  BOTTOM  BOSTON-CATHOLICS (Boston) _ Late last month, the Boston Archdiocese decided to reject donations from a charitable fund set up by a moderate lay group. The group had set up the fund because the church sexual-abuse scandal had prompted many parishioners to refuse to give to the archdiocese. The fund was a way for people to give to archdiocesan charitable programs while bypassing the archdiocese's financial control. But when Cardinal Bernard F. Law refused to accept what many Catholics saw as much-needed money on the grounds that the fund would undercut the archdiocese's role, he succeeded only in further alienating some of his flock. By Pam Belluck.  (Scheduled to move by 2 p.m. ET in ``a'' news file.)  NY-PHONE-CARDS (New York) _ Hui Jiang, an immigrant from Fujian Province in China, has ambitions. In 12 years in the United States, he has gone from selling phone cards on the street to distributing as many as 20,000 cards a day to his own network of immigrant retailers. Jiang has accomplished this despite knowing limited English. ``I'm going to go step by step to become a big company,'' he vowed. ``If I need people to speak English, I'll hire them.'' He is hardly the exception in the cutthroat world of prepaid phone cards. The business may be driven by the desire of homesick immigrants to stay in touch with the family they left behind. But it has also, improbably, become a career ladder for immigrants with little experience and much bravura. By Susan Sachs.  With map.  (Scheduled to move by 3 p.m. ET in ``a'' news file.)  INSIDE STORIES PROMOTED ON PAGE 1:  IRAQ-MINORITIES (Barda Qaraman, Iraq) _ Decree 199, a presidential order issued by Saddam Hussein, is Iraq's equivalent of ethnic cleansing. Creating an Arab majority on the great Mesopotamian plain north of Baghdad is not an innovation by Saddam, who, like all Iraqi leaders since the state's founding in 1921, is an Arab. But Saddam, especially since his defeat in the 1991 Gulf War, has accelerated efforts to drive minorities out, and bring Arabs in, to the region that sits atop some of the world's greatest oil reserves.

But when Bowen contacted the church's headquarters in Brooklyn, he says, he was rebuffed. By Laurie Goodstein.  (Scheduled to move by 3 p.m. ET in ``a'' news file.)

Can we really top ourselves year after year after year?  Are all our Christmases really merry and bright?  Is it really such a crime if they're not?  Some of the most memorable Christmases in our family have been due to circumstances not conducive to providing brightness, let alone merriment.  But when my family recalls Christmas past, it isn't the perfectly-prepared dinner, the artfully arranged decorations or the plans that went off without a hitch that we remember.  It's the time the turkey's browning bag exploded, blowing the door off the oven.  It's the time Sharla opened up the Christmas presents, skated around the living room in her new skates, played with Darla's Barbie, and broke it, then wrapped them all back up.  It's the time Daddy threw the Christmas tree out the front door.  The Christmas tree stand had been leaking sugar water into the carpet where it was quietly mildewing. This was discovered after days of wondering where the ``funny smell'' was coming from.  Daddy tried to put the fully-decorated tree into another stand, but the tree wasn't cooperating. After an extended period of being scratched by a tree that had not received moisture in two weeks, receiving a continuous stream of unsolicited suggestions, warnings and ``constructive'' criticism, he resolved to set the Christmas tree free. Fly little tree, fly.  There was the Christmas I had the mumps. I was going to get to ride on a float with the rest of the Blue Birds in the Christmas parade. I had come close to having a nervous breakdown over my inability to construct a pompom from blue and red plastic. We were supposed to shake these as we waved to the admiring crowds. Mine didn't come out a pompom, all I had was raggedy strips of plastic.  I was crushed when The Henderson Daily News published a news article about the impending appearance of the Blue Birds in the Christmas parade and left out my name.  I wondered if I had been struck off due to my lack of pompom constructing skills. It was only after getting a job at a newspaper that I realized it wasn't anything personal. The names were listed alphabetically and ``Karla Whitehead'' made the story too long, so they just cut off my name.  And then I came down with the mumps. My one chance to be in a parade, and it was going to pass me by. It wasn't even going to do that. I was sick. I was contagious. I couldn't even watch the parade and cheer on my fine-feathered friends.  But I did get to watch the parade. Daddy, a mechanic at the Buick dealership, which was on the parade route, parked a brand new Buick in front so I could watch from the back seat.  Daddy caught candy, and a record for me from the KGRI-Radio float. My sisters and I played the 45 of ``Shell Happy'' and ``Asia Minor'' for decades. The only possible connection ``Shell Happy'' might have with Christmas is that it does make you think of stockings and unwrapping. Like a Candy Barr.  But the Christmas memory that stands out most, the one that is repeated year, after year, was created by my brother-in-law, Dave.  It had been an especially memorable Christmas, involving in-laws, out-laws and spouses, old and new.  The special casserole my sister brought was sitting on the stove top, which someone accidentally turned on. The casserole dish broke, freeing three pounds of potatoes, sour cream and extra sharp Cheddar cheese to ooze down into the depths of the stove.  My sisters and I had shopped, wrapped, cooked and carted food, gifts, kids and husbands all over East Texas and North Louisiana in the quest of a perfect Christmas, and it was unraveling before our eyes like a cheap mitten.  We had suggested to the husbands that washing the dishes might be their token gesture of helping this year instead of sitting in front of the television to ``stay out of our way'' like they usually did.  And then it happened. Dave stood at the top of the stairs and uttered the words that will never die. ``We didn't come here to work.''  No sooner had the words left his lips did he wish, more than anything in his entire life, that he could call them back. But he couldn't.  ``You didn't come here to work? YOU didn't come here to work? YOU didn't come here to WORK?''  These words never left our mouths. We didn't say anything _ we didn't have to _ he knew exactly what we thought.  ``Uh, I mean, we had better get to work,'' he said, slinking into the kitchen.  That's right. Make sure those pots are the brightest ever. And you'd better be merry about it.  Hash Brown Potato Casserole  2 pounds frozen hash browns  1 can cream of mushroom soup  1/2 cup chopped onion  1 pint sour cream  2 teaspoon salt  1 teaspoon black pepper  1/2 cup melted butter  2 cups grated Cheddar cheese  1 -2 cup crushed corn flakes  1/2 cup melted butter  Mix potatoes, cheese, sour cream, salt, onion, soup and pepper together and pour into a 2-quart casserole.

DEAR DIARY:  On a recent Saturday evening, after dinner at an Asian-fusion restaurant, watermelon martinis at a hip Downtown bar, and a live jazz show, I thought to myself that I had just had a quintessential Sex and the City New York evening.  Hopping on the 6 train to head home, I was even more excited to get a seat. At the next stop, an attractive young woman of about 25 came on and stood in front of me. She was wearing an outfit that looked very designer. Thinking that this night could not be any more uniquely New York, I was slightly surprised to see the woman tearing frantically at a magazine page. As is my custom when I see strange occurrences on the subway, I tried to look down and not stare. Yet the sight of this beautiful and hip woman grappling with a magazine page on such a beautiful and hip night was too gripping.  As things turned from quaintly odd to bizarre, the woman took the shredded page and wrapped it around her wrist.  Again, I sought distraction elsewhere: The young girl in a bathing suit across from me guzzling a gallon of orange juice, the mariachi band playing loudly to my left and the teenagers selling candy for their school basketball team were not able to help me keep my eyes from this beguiling woman.  When I finally looked up, I had to stifle a laugh at what I realized had actually happened. The magazine page was a full-color advertisement for a Rolex watch. The frantic shredding was to leave only the watch. The wrapping around the wrist was an effort to model the expensive accessory.  It was the perfect uniquely New York ending to the perfect, uniquely New York night.  -- SETH BLINDER  DEAR DIARY:  When my sister came to visit me in Connecticut, we needed (of course) to spend a couple of days in New York City. We checked into a the Renaissance New York Hotel in Times Square and planned an excursion for Broadway tickets.  Rain had been threatening, and, sure enough, the downpour came just as we were leaving our hotel. My savvy sister is from Seattle, and was equipped with a jacket with a hood. I inquired at the reception desk if any loaner umbrellas were available. They were all gone, so I checked with the bellmen. Emmanuel, at that station, declared that his supply had also been depleted. When I spotted a rain-soaked umbrella in his area, I said, How about that one?  No, he said, that is for our use. I said he didn't need an umbrella, he had a nice big hat. He then disappeared into his storeroom and returned with a bellman's hat for me to wear out to the theater. My sis and I set off in style, protected from the evening's showers.  -- KATHLEEN EVANS  DEAR DIARY:  The scene: Zabar's cafe. Me seated next to an early 20-something male. He was talking on a cellphone, perhaps to his girlfriend. I was (unavoidably) eavesdropping.  From what I was able to gather, they had gone to a party the night before where he drank too much. He explained his regrettable performance on the dance floor with the statement: It wasn't just the alcohol talking. It was the alcohol dancing.  -- MICHAEL MISCIONE  DEAR DIARY:  I spotted a middle-aged man on a 23rd Street crosstown bus firmly holding (but not crushing) an empty paper coffee cup with the Starbucks logo, upside down. Soon we both got off the bus and boarded another going north on Third Avenue, and this man now sat opposite me, still holding his cup.  I wondered what use he would put it to: holding rubber bands, pins or paper clips, soil for a tiny plant, or whether he just needed another paper cup at home. My curiosity forced me to get up and confront this total stranger. Excuse me, I said, but can I ask you why you have carried this empty paper coffee cup from one bus to another? What plans do you have for it?  He smiled and said, Well, I just don't want to throw an empty paper coffee cup on the sidewalk, and I haven't as yet found a trash bucket.  -- ALFRED GESCHEIDT  DEAR DIARY:  I was riding the M15 bus south down Second Avenue one recent Sunday, adjusting to the vagaries of the driver's personality. Ours today was splendidly aggressive yet skillful, with sure moves and a deft touch on the brake.  After the bus squealed to a stop at 26th Street, the driver opened the passenger door and gruffly yelled a few words before I could distinguish the tail end: Hey, get on the bus, you hear! A gray-haired, grandmotherly woman clambered up in the mild confusion, her face a bit dazed, it seemed, and slowly, slowly bent toward the driver, finally planting a tender kiss on his cheek. Then she shyly took a seat.  I wondered if this was the new way to avoid paying a bus fare. But a moment later, the driver, muscling his way into traffic again, shouted to his passengers, That lady used to change my diapers when I was a baby!  Upon disembarking, the old woman patted the driver's shoulder, and he took her face between his large hands and kissed her, lips to lips.  -- FIONA BAYLY  DEAR DIARY:  A few of my officemates and I decided to take a colleague, Elliot, to lunch in Manhattan for his birthday. We took a subway from our office in Downtown Brooklyn to our Midtown destination. After a few stops on the train, a man with a guitar got on and played an old country song. We applauded, gave him a dollar and asked him to sing Happy Birthday to Elliot, but the man told us he had to get off at the next stop, which he did.  After lunch, we made our way back to work by train. A few stops into our trip, the man with a guitar stepped into our car. He looked at us, then at Elliot, and started singing Happy Birthday.

House, 24, a nanny just months ago, is stunned and pleased to see her face emblazoned on T-shirts and enjoys hearing people say they'd hurry home to watch the show. On the downside, others try to touch her and feel her hair. It's just so weird, House says, I don't want to be negative, but creating a boundary is hard. You'll read that all the behaviors House encounters are part of the way we're naturally wired to react to celebrity glamour and fame. Celebrities inhabit a kind of parallel universe that appears transparent to us but which we can never really enter. Because of their familiarity, our minds make us think that celebs are our personal friends, social intimates, even lovers.

, he figures,	 Wagner showed me on a series of maps how the process might play out in the New York State Senate. As each rural upstate district lost its prisoner population, to regain sufficient inhabitants it would have to reach into the next district, which in turn would have to reach into its neighbor. Wagner calls this effect the cascade. At the same time, urban districts would cascade in the other direction as they became, on paper, more densely populated. Somewhere in the middle (probably, he figures, in the suburbs around New York City) the two waves would meet, shifting the balance between urban Democrats and suburban Republicans in competitive districts and, as a consequence, the whole legislature. As Wagner admits, prisoners aren't unique in being counted in the census but denied the vote -- children and immigrants suffer a similar fate. But prisoners' interests, he argues, tend to be especially divorced from those of their legislators. The weight of the prison population strengthens the very districts and legislators with the most stake in tough-on-crime policies that create and fill more prisons -- figures like Dale Volker (a favorite target of Wagner's), the Republican state senator from New York's 59th district who has helped stymie popular efforts to reform New York's stringent Rockefeller drug laws. Wagner goes so far as to invoke the Constitution's infamous three-fifths clause, which counted slaves as three-fifths of a person for the purpose of Congressional apportionment. (It) wasn't so much an insult to the slaves, Wagner says. They were already property, they weren't even legally people, they weren't going to vote. But crediting their numbers to slaveholders, the worst people in the world for them, made it that much worse. The South used that added power to protect slavery against the more populous North for 70 years. But the three-fifths clause mattered as much as it did because in 1860 the United States had 4 million slaves in a population of 32 million, a proportion that even the most draconian prison policy would take a while to reach. The effects Wagner is talking about are shifts at the margins. He can't be sure, for example, that any electoral effects of the cascade wouldn't be blunted by the creative gerrymandering of incumbents determined to keep their seats. And even if the Census agreed to change its policy, poor rural districts would likely still support prison expansion for the economic benefits they're thought to bring. According to Karen Mills, a Census Bureau analyst, there are no plans to change the prisoner residence rule. Inmates are counted, she pointed out, just like residents of nursing homes, college dormitories, long-term hospitals, and domestic military bases. Besides, she says, it would be a logistical nightmare for the Census Bureau to have to contact all of the state and federal prisons in all 50 states and find out where (their prisoners) were going to go after they got out, or where they were sentenced, or where their own home is. They may not even have a home. Wagner believes that it would be easiest if the census methodology were simply changed -- ideally before the 2008 dress rehearsal of the 2010 Census. But he maintains that the real fault lies with the state and federal agencies that use the data, and he thinks a court might agree with him. Many state constitutions -- including Massachusetts' -- define residency differently from the Census Bureau, not as where one happens to be, but where one chooses to be. While he's not working on any litigation, Wagner thinks a group of urban plaintiffs could conceivably use that definition to sue their legislators for drawing districts that unconstitutionally diluted urban votes. That, of course, would require that people start seeing the matter not as a prisoner problem but as their own. Wagner sees this shift already happening -- in rural prison counties, of all places. Recently, non-prison towns in New York's Greene and Franklin Counties, feeling shortchanged in county-wide apportionment calculations, got the county government to stop neighboring towns from counting their prisoners. As Wagner says, When (rural) citizens recognize that this hurts them they want it changed. Which is good, because it means that the number of people who see themselves losing their democratic right in some important way from the census is expanded from urban people to rural people who don't happen to live next to the prison. And the more people feel shortchanged by the census, the more Wagner feels he's doing his job. </P> 	nyt_eng_200409.gz

The reason, she said, was that her parents were threatening to kill her unless she agreed to marry a man from Turkey whom she had never met. By Richard Bernstein. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz

"158246"	"I"	"mean"	" A: I don't see it any different. People talk about hearing the same thing over and over - I never bought into that. If that was the case, I mean, look at other sports. Have they stopped listening to Joe Torre in New York or (Bobby) Cox in Atlanta? If people think that you can help them or think that you can be successful, why are they going to stop listening, unless you're just so overbearing? I don't think those guys (on previous Kings teams) got enough credit for maintaining that success over the years, despite all the injuries and everything that went on. But now, I guess I can answer your question at the end of the year. Now I've got a totally different team, so we'll find out how much harder it is with this group: Can I reach them the same way? Can I get them to play the same way? But every year, you have to find a way to form relationships with the people close to you, and I think I've always been able to do that ... That first year here, my gosh, you talk about a makeshift team. We had those guys (Webber, Divac, Williams), but no idea how they would play together. We had Vernon Maxwell and Jon (Barry) and those guys. I think every year is a challenge, whether you've got the same team or you don't. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
"158247"	"I"	"mean"	" A: Well, I think the difference is, the player to a large extent can control his free agency by performing or not performing on the floor. He puts the stats up or he doesn't. But a coach might do a really good job, but you're going to have times during the season that are down, and people are going to jump on that (contract status). There's so much more exposure now, with the talk radio and so many people - there's just so much more talking done. I was amazed reading the paper after the third week in the NFL, I mean, in USA Today they had the top three (coaches) who were in trouble. That's reality. But you know, in some ways Geoff is right, and it depends upon how the coach wants to view it. And I don't view myself - if I'm in my last year and things don't work out, I'll move on. I know the circumstances. I'm not afraid of that or worried about it. I love it here. I love the city, the fans - for the most part, everything has been great. So why should I not try to make sure, if I was to be coaching my last year here, that I do a great job and go out on a positive note? That's how I'm looking at it. I know that (contract status) is going to be brought up, just like I've already seen people talk about how we've got to be better defensively. Like my coaching staff, from Pete Carril to Elston (Turner) to T.R. (Dunn) don't realize that? Three years ago, we were the best team in the league defensively. Why aren't we today? I have two players from that team. Personnel changes. Players change. Injuries change things. Age changes it. The dynamics of this team has changed. I know one thing: In the NBA, you've got to look at the talent and the strengths you have, and that's how you build a team to win. And then you've got to work on your weaknesses and get them better. There are a lot of things we've got to do, but I believe strongly in the people on my staff. We're going to continue to teach defense. But I also think we're going to have a pretty good offensive team again. We know what we're dealing with. We've always known that. You can look up at that board right over there. (He walks over to unfold a dry-erase board built into the wall, upon which is written the Kings' league rankings in every pertinent statistical category for the past seven seasons). Like we don't know the difference in our field-goal percentages and what we've done defensively and what we've done offensively? We know what we have to do. Can this team be really good defensively? I don't know. But we'd better be better than we were last year at the end of the year. I'm looking forward to it. I'm really looking forward to seeing what these guys can do, and we're going to be more demanding, especially with our core. We're going to put much more emphasis on our strength-and-conditioning program. We're going to demand more of them during the practice sessions. It's a chance to change the culture a little bit, because it's a different group. When you're successful and you're winning, you're not as quick to make a change. Detroit isn't going to change anything right now. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
"158248"	"I"	"mean"	" A: (Pauses). Every guy that has left - I mean, not having Vlade back last year was really hard. He was such a huge part, even though we knew we had aged. But what he meant to the team, that was huge to me. Chris and Doug, I mean, both of those ... But this off-season, if you're talking about this summer, it's Bobby (Jackson). There's no doubt. He came and he gave us something that nobody else could give us, and I felt so bad for him that he got hurt with these freakish injuries and never got something going. He's a guy I'd like to see get a nice contract that's going to set him up and his family. But it was time for us to make a change, we had to do something, and he was just the guy involved. I think it could be a good situation for him there (in Memphis). I hope so. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
