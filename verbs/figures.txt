"28848"	"he"	"figures"	" But doing card shows is not the most honorable way to make a living after one's career, or to supplement one's income during it. It cheapens the value of that person's identity. It causes the athlete to think of his fan base in terms of how much cash he can make off it.

NY-SIMPSON-TALK-NYT (New York) _ The crowd that filled the auditorium in Manhattan one evening last week was stellar indeed _ writers, academics, lawyers, publishers, a judge, a Pulitzer Prize winner and assorted other thinkers of big thoughts. What was on their minds was, by contrast, rather earthy _ violence, celebrity, money, sex, race. They had come to find meaning in the one soap opera (now in reruns) that mandarins are not afraid to admit they watch. The O.J. case, that is. By Janny Scott. Moved Tuesday, Sept. 24.

MUSIC-DANDO-BOS (Gay Head, Mass.) _ It's nearing summer's end on Martha's Vineyard, and Evan Dando, the 29-year-old guiding voice and vision of the Lemonheads, is chilling on the deck of his vacation rental. It's the first sunny day in a week. Affable and welcoming, Dando is definitely in casual mode, wearing jeans and a T-shirt, sporting stubble, nursing a glass of whiskey.

JAPAN-PRINCESS-NYT (Tokyo) _ The train carrying Japan's most famous young couple chugged into the station recently, and out came Princess Masako, all charm and elegance in a pale-green suit, waving to her picture-snapping fans and walking briskly, two steps behind the Crown Prince. That is almost the only kind of public appearance that Princess Masako makes these days for she has virtually disappeared since her marriage three years ago. By Sheryl WuDunn. W/color photo.

A yellow silk foulard is clasped loosely around his neck, a cream handkerchief tucked in his double-breasted jacket.

So, ``Baby,'' as Straus would say, this is the 50th year since he built the venerable publishing house of Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux into a shabby chic haven that is literary home to Pulitzer Prize winners, Nobel laureates, and prominent writers who, in some cases, prefer Straus' fabled charm to more generous advances.

JFAX-TELECOM-ART-NYT (Undated) _ Even in the unconventional world of Internet business, Jaye Muller does not appear to be a typical entrepreneur.

HOAGY-SCION-PROFILE (Brewster, N.Y.) _ If fishing is, as Hoagy Bix Carmichael likes to say, a jerk on one end of the line waiting for a jerk on the other, it is owing to the prolific genius of his own father, the songwriter Hoagy Carmichael, who died in 1981, that he can indulge his obsession around the world and back in his own backyard (not a Hoagy Carmichael song) in northern Westchester County.

This comes from the lips of Grant's staggeringly gorgeous girlfriend, actress and model Elizabeth Hurley, who adds the title of producer to her credits with Friday's release of Grant's latest film, ``Extreme Measures.'' By Dave Larsen. Moved Friday, Sept. 20, for release Sunday, Sept. 22.  MACHIO-ACTOR-LADN (Los Angeles) _ Ralph Macchio, 34, says a ``Pulp Fiction'' role like the one that triggered John Travolta's film return might just earn him a place in the big time, that heady world of super-fat paychecks he once occupied. By Janet Weeks. Moved Monday, Sept. 23.  KENNEDY-BESSETTE-BOS (Undated) _ Details about the very private Carolyn Bessette and her wedding to John F. Kennedy Jr. By Nathan Cobb.

JAPAN-PRINCESS-NYT (Tokyo) _ The train carrying Japan's most famous young couple chugged into the station recently, and out came Princess Masako, all charm and elegance in a pale-green suit, waving to her picture-snapping fans and walking briskly, two steps behind the Crown Prince. That is almost the only kind of public appearance that Princess Masako makes these days for she has virtually disappeared since her marriage three years ago. By Sheryl WuDunn. W/color photo. Moved Friday, Sept. 20.  STRAUSS-PROFILE-MEDIA-NYT (New York) _ At his favorite corner table, Roger Straus Jr. greets the world according to habit. A yellow silk foulard is clasped loosely around his neck, a cream handkerchief tucked in his double-breasted jacket. And he is loudly, cheerfully spouting enough profanities to fill all the salt shakers in the Union Square Cafe. So, ``Baby,'' as Straus would say, this is the 50th year since he built the venerable publishing house of Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux into a shabby chic haven that is literary home to Pulitzer Prize winners, Nobel laureates, and prominent writers who, in some cases, prefer Straus' fabled charm to more generous advances.

TOP-AZR (Undated) _ A note taped to the front door of Emilio Castillo's Scottsdale, Ariz., home asks that visitors not ring the doorbell to avoid waking the children. A concerned dad? Sure. But Castillo also founded the nearly legendary soul band Tower of Power. Somehow, images of Mr. Mom and Funk Master don't go hand in hand. By Randy Cordova.Moved Sunday, Sept. 22.  JFAX-TELECOM-ART-NYT (Undated) _ Even in the unconventional world of Internet business, Jaye Muller does not appear to be a typical entrepreneur. With his tight orange pants and blond-streaked hair, he looks more like a rock musician than the founder of an ambitious young company that wants to change the way business people communicate. Indeed, Muller is a pop singer from the former East Germany whose first album, ``We are the Majority,'' sold 350,000 copies worldwide. But now, as president of JFAX Personal Telecom Inc., this 24-year-old has turned his sights on E-mail in-boxes everywhere. By Sreenath Sreenivasan. W/graphic. Moved Sunday, Sept. 22.  HOAGY-SCION-PROFILE (Brewster, N.Y.) _ If fishing is, as Hoagy Bix Carmichael likes to say, a jerk on one end of the line waiting for a jerk on the other, it is owing to the prolific genius of his own father, the songwriter Hoagy Carmichael, who died in 1981, that he can indulge his obsession around the world and back in his own backyard (not a Hoagy Carmichael song) in northern Westchester County.

NY-SIMPSON-TALK-NYT (New York) _ The crowd that filled the auditorium in Manhattan one evening last week was stellar indeed _ writers, academics, lawyers, publishers, a judge, a Pulitzer Prize winner and assorted other thinkers of big thoughts. What was on their minds was, by contrast, rather earthy _ violence, celebrity, money, sex, race. They had come to find meaning in the one soap opera (now in reruns) that mandarins are not afraid to admit they watch. The O.J. case, that is. By Janny Scott. Moved Tuesday, Sept. 24.

At Jason Allami's store, things are not what they seem _ an umbrella doubles as an audio recorder, an innocent-looking pen is also a bug detector and a Dick Tracy-esque watch sports a hidden camera. By Deborah Adamson. W/photo. Moved Tuesday, Sept. 24.  MUSIC-DANDO-BOS (Gay Head, Mass.) _ It's nearing summer's end on Martha's Vineyard, and Evan Dando, the 29-year-old guiding voice and vision of the Lemonheads, is chilling on the deck of his vacation rental.

The bow is worth more than 50 times what it was then, while the Dow Jones industrial average has increased only eightfold. But if Perlman has comparable acumen in picking stocks, he will probably never find out. When it comes to investing, Perlman, one of the world's great violinists, mainly turns a deaf ear.

ROGERS-TRAVEL-LADN (Victorville, Calif.) _ Imagine, then, the wave of nostalgia that hits like the kick of a prospector's burro when we aging boomers spot the giant-size Trigger from Interstate 5 in Victorville and pull into the parking lot of the Roy Rogers-Dale Evans Museum, built to resemble an 1860s fort.

The bow is worth more than 50 times what it was then, while the Dow Jones industrial average has increased only eightfold. But if Perlman has comparable acumen in picking stocks, he will probably never find out. When it comes to investing, Perlman, one of the world's great violinists, mainly turns a deaf ear.

SUSAN-ANTILLA-BLOOM (New York) _ Investors have perennially suffered at the hands of shady investment advisers, a tranche of investment professionals who work under all the supervision of Peter Pan's lost boys.

So, ``Baby,'' as Straus would say, this is the 50th year since he built the venerable publishing house of Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux into a shabby chic haven that is literary home to Pulitzer Prize winners, Nobel laureates, and prominent writers who, in some cases, prefer Straus' fabled charm to more generous advances.

JFAX-TELECOM-ART-NYT (Undated) _ Even in the unconventional world of Internet business, Jaye Muller does not appear to be a typical entrepreneur. With his tight orange pants and blond-streaked hair, he looks more like a rock musician than the founder of an ambitious young company that wants to change the way business people communicate. Indeed, Muller is a pop singer from the former East Germany whose first album, ``We are the Majority,'' sold 350,000 copies worldwide.

HOAGY-SCION-PROFILE (Brewster, N.Y.) _ If fishing is, as Hoagy Bix Carmichael likes to say, a jerk on one end of the line waiting for a jerk on the other, it is owing to the prolific genius of his own father, the songwriter Hoagy Carmichael, who died in 1981, that he can indulge his obsession around the world and back in his own backyard (not a Hoagy Carmichael song) in northern Westchester County.

MOVIES-BEST (Los Angeles) _ Hollywood wrecked everything from the White House to the art of storytelling last year and reaped a whirlwind of dollars. It was the highest-grossing year, if not necessarily the most profitable, one in movie business history, with an estimated ticket sale total of $5.85 billion, up eight percent from 1995's previous record of $5.44 billion.

NATIONAL _ GENERAL  (Moved in `w' category)  GINGRICH-ETHICS (Washington) _ In an apparent setback for Speaker Newt Gingrich, the House ethics committee announced Tuesday that it would not proceed with its two-year investigation into ethics complaints against him until Jan. 8 _ one day after he is to stand for re-election to the leadership post. By Katharine Q. Seelye.  (Moved in `a' category)  GRAND-CANYON (Los Angeles) _ The Interior Department on Tuesday took a step toward eliminating intrusions of man into the Grand Canyon, restricting aircraft overflights in a harbinger of an overall plan to restrict even automobile traffic at the Canyon and in some of America's other heavily traveled parks. By James Sterngold. (With photo)  POLICE-DEATHS (Undated) _ The number of police officers killed in the line of duty last year dropped dramatically, to the lowest level since 1960, according to figures released Tuesday by the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund in Washington. Experts said the decline was at least partly attributable to the major decrease in murder in many of the nation's big cities. By Fox Butterfield. (With graphic.)  ALZHEIMER-HEALTH (New York) _ They looked for all the world like elderly professionals, dressed casually in the typical New York hues of black and gray. But the two women and one man, sitting in front of a packed room at a recent meeting on Alzheimer's disease, were not researchers or directors of programs. They were patients, they had Alzheimer's disease and they were there to tell what it was like to know you have a disease that is slowly, inexorably, killing your brain. By Gina Kolata. (With photo.)  WELD-YEAREND (Boston) _ A lot of people might have thought that 1996 was a bad year for Bill Weld. He spent millions of dollars, and thousands of hours, campaigning for the U.S. Senate in one of the most closely watched races in the country. And the popular, patrician governor of Massachusetts lost. ``It was not my first defeat,'' Weld said in an interview Tuesday. ``There was the Rhodes scholarship,'' he volunteered. ``The Marshall scholarship. Harvard Law Review. My life is a tangled wreck of failures.'' By Sara Rimer. (With photo.)  PSYCHOPATHS-EDUC (New York) _ Dr. Naftali Berrill, a forensic psychologist who had conducted court-ordered examinations of Joel Rifkin, the serial killer, and Colin Ferguson, the Long Island Rail Road killer, teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. The class is part of the college's fastest-growing area of study: forensic psychology. ``There is a fascination with this stuff,'' said Berrill. ``Popular culture has gone nuts with the idea of taking someone who has committed a crime and profiling the person, thinking about why he did it, what is behind it.'' By Karen W. Arenson. (With photo.)  HARMONY-SALE (Harmony, Calif.) _ This tiny, 19th-century community on the Pacific Coast Highway halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco is for sale for $1.49 million. The price includes two and a half acres in a verdant valley and a cluster of old buildings that used to be a dairy. By Keith Bradsher. (With photo.)  COLO-CHILD-SLAY (Boulder, Colo.) _ It has been nearly a week since the body of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, the daughter of John Ramsey, 53, president of Access Graphics, a $1 billion subsidiary of Lockheed Aeronautics, and Patricia Ramsey, 39, a former Miss West Virginia who is well-known in social and charity circles in Boulder and Atlanta, was found in the basement of the couple's home. And with each passing day the mystery surrounding the death of JonBenet, who was named Little Miss Colorado 1995 and America's Tiny Little Miss 1996 has deepened.  NY-CARDINAL (New York) _ As he approaches his 77th birthday Jan. 15, Cardinal John O'Connor sounds very much like a man preparing to close out his career. He is, after all, two years beyond the official retirement age for bishops, reason enough for introspection. But despite periodic eruptions of speculation about his future, the cardinal has no plans to go anywhere just yet. He still loves his job, he feels fine, and he notes that he has assignments from the Vatican through 1997. By Joyce Purnick. (With photo.)  NY-DEBUTANTES (New York) _ It's hard to imagine, but being a debutante is back. Cotillion chairmen in New York say they have not seen this many young women participate in a decade. By Monique P. Yazigi. (With photo.)  INTERNATIONAL  (Moved in `i' category)  PERU-HOSTAGES (Lima, Peru) _ In a remarkable and unexpected development in the 14-day hostage crisis here, Marxist rebels who stormed a reception at the Japanese ambassador's residence permitted television cameramen and still photographers to breach the compound's security wall and enter the residence, where they filmed and interviewed rebels and some of the remaining hostages. By Diana Jean Schemo.  PERU-HOSTAGES-MEDIA (Lima, Peru) _ Ever since Tupac Amaru guerrillas took hostages at the Japanese ambassador's residence on Dec. 17, the government has tried to tightly control the rebels' access to the news media. By Calvin Sims.  IRAN-TOURISM (Isfahan, Iran) _ Nearly a generation after the ayatollahs seized the palaces of kings, Iran is still locked in a fierce and bitter struggle over how hospitable it should be to the non-Muslim world. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the revolution's late spiritual leader, used to rant about ``the Western sickness among us.'' But the reality is that in a country with raging inflation, 20 percent unemployment and little foreign investment, hard currency counts. And tourists from places like Germany and Japan spend more than twice as much money as devout pilgrims from other Islamic countries. By Elaine Sciolino.  SAFRICA-FASSIE (Johannesburg, South Africa) _ Brenda Fassie is known as South Africa's black Madonna. But in truth, she vacillates between nearly being its Kurt Cobain (flirting with drugs and suicide) and sometimes being its Bette Midler (motherly in a wacky way). Ms. Fassie should have more money. She was named best female vocalist of 1995 in the All-Africa Music Awards in September. Her new album, ``It's My Time,'' which came out last month, has already gone gold. But Africa is a poor continent, where ``going gold'' means selling a mere 25,000 copies rather than a million, and she sometimes still performs at beauty contests and soccer games, changing before the show in the back of a car. By Donald G. McNeil Jr. (With photo.)  U.N.-BOUTROS-GHALI (United Nations) _ A couple of weeks ago, after Madeleine Albright had finally ended Boutros Boutros-Ghali's hopes of a second term as secretary general, the defeated and dispirited Egyptian diplomat finally got his chance to ask Albright, by then President Clinton's choice as secretary of state, a few undiplomatic questions. ``What went wrong?'' he asked over a private farewell dinner at his official residence. ``Why this campaign against me for six months?'' By Barbara Crossette. (With photo.)  COLOMBIA-GERMANS-ARREST (Bogota, Colombia) _ The arrest of a German couple at the airport in Bogota after they secured the release of a woman kidnapped by leftist guerrillas has provoked diplomatic tensions between Colombia and Germany. The incident also raises questions about the role of foreigners in financing Colombia's guerrillas. By Diana Jean Schemo.

After sprinting to a record close of 6,560.91, the Dow Jones industrial average stumbled backward Tuesday, falling 101.1 points, or 1.54 percent, to close at 6,448.27. By Reed Abelson.

These institutions recently joined hundreds of arts groups, large and small, in learning they would not be getting federal support in 1997 from the embattled National Endowment for the Arts, whose budget has been cut 40 percent by Congress. By Judith Miller. (With graphic.)  RUSH-SHINE-PROFILE (New York) _ In the last month, Rush, whose lanky build, long, rubbery face and slightly off-kilter good looks recall the American actor James Woods (``a cuddly James Woods,'' Rush said), has collected a cache of splashy honors. He was named best actor of the year by both the Los Angeles Film Critics and the New York Film Critics Circle, and he was nominated by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association in the best dramatic actor category _ along with Liam Neeson, Woody Harrelson, Mel Gibson and Ralph Fiennes, movie stars and matinee idols all _ for a Golden Globe, an award that has become something of a harbinger of the Oscar in recent years.

"84972"	"she"	"figures"	" To raise the odds of her daily survival, Isabelle takes a lot of precautions. On the bus to East Hampton, she makes sure she takes a seat in the middle of the right side (where, she figures, the odds of surviving a head-on crash are better) and she ties herself into the seat with the belt from her alpaca coat. For many years she has subscribed to a macrobiotic vegetarian diet, thereby avoiding the toxic effects of eating meat and dairy products. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"85768"	"he"	"figures"	" Unclear throughout is Christine's reluctance to love Theo, who is handsome, rich and loves her dearly. At one point, she runs away after he kisses her, then emerges the next morning with a change of heart only to find Theo cold and indifferent because, he figures, this is her desire. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"92443"	"he"	"figures"	" But Zubritsky has a more immediate concern. He wants to replace his 1995 Mercury Sable, which, he figures, operates at 22 miles to the gallon, with the Prius, which he expects will go roughly twice as far on a gallon. He thinks he would save about 400 gallons a year but has not determined if that would cover the extra cost of buying a hybrid rather than an ordinary small car. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"

"95211"	"he"	"figures"	" It begins with Campbell's Michael drunkenly accepting his fifth award for some pointless campaign. The honor -- and, by extension, his very existence -- are worthless, and as Michael returns home to an empty apartment and an answering machine full of nattering messages, Michael breaks out the pills and the nooses. Enough, he figures, is enough. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"
"98346"	"he"	"figures"	" Piniella always chuckles at times like this. Helps cut the tension, he figures, and in this case he gets to needle his old boss, George Steinbrenner, for annually buying almost all of creation to find sufficient baseball talent. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"101205"	"he"	"figures"	" ``If the conversation takes a left turn, he can't handle it,'' Rahman said. ``And that's what happened in the (first) fight.'' And, he figures, it'll repeat itself tomorrow. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"116411"	"he"	"figures"	" For the past two years, Bryant has been a model of resiliency. He has yet to let a physical ailment diminish his game, or his team's title hopes.

"117051"	"he"	"figures"	" Red Sox fans, said Martucci, often seem to have a chip on their shoulders when they arrive in his shop. It's the residue, he figures, of all those years of losing to the Yankees. They're frustrated. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"121353"	"it"	"figures"	" Sure, anybody could look at Bill Clinton and know that he was, well, girth-challenged, especially given his self-confessed palate passion for cuisine des Golden Arches.

Sure, anybody could look at Bill Clinton and know that he was girth challenged, especially given his self-confessed passion for cuisine des Golden Arches. So, it figures, he would not perform well on the most widely accepted measure of obesity, the body mass index. But what about an athlete who packs on mounds of rippling muscle instead of pounds of jiggling fat? Are you going to call Nomar Garciaparra tubby?

SCI-BUILD-ART (Undated) - Shorter, stronger, more resilient. Less apt to break into shrapnel in an explosion. Harder to get into, but easier to get out of. In the future, buildings seen as being at risk of terrorist attacks will be designed with those guiding principles in mind, according to architects, engineers, security professionals and fire-safety officials, all currently immersed in the complex business of terror-proofing the built environment.

"123190"	"he"	"figures"	" And the crowds have been responding, said Jayson Bernstein, a spokesman for the wrestling producer. The fans are the real gauge. If they hoot or cheer, he figures, the wrestlers must be doing something right. ``I think they're still getting the reaction,'' Bernstein said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"123518"	"he"	"figures"	" On Hopper's farm, the aquifer, which stood 95 feet below the surface when he was a boy, now stands at 335 feet, with just 65 to go before it hits bottom. Now, he figures, his water bill (in electricity, for pumping from ever greater depths) accounts for a fifth of his overhead. Last year, he earned 52 cents an acre for his cotton, not enough to break even, and 20 cents of that came from the government. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"124655"	"he"	"figures"	" How long this trend will go on and where it will lead, no one can say. But Clifton T. Sharp Jr., a Chicago-area anti-spam activist, has calculated some hair-raising scenarios. If, he figures, you get one message a month from just 1 percent of the 22.4 million businesses in the United States, you'll average 7,359 e-mail ads per day. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"124976"	"he"	"figures"	" White finds the footage of the tower attacks fascinating. The first plane struck about 40 feet from Adam, he figures, just a few floors below his son's office on the 101st floor. He believes his son might have survived for a time. He imagines how Adam, a resourceful and athletic fan of Indiana Jones, might have tried to escape. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"

"131027"	"she"	"figures"	" Often, however, there isn't a lot of elsewhere to look. Carole Hyatt, with a house in the Berkshires, has tried to confine her caretaker search to the Kripalu spiritual retreat (people there, she figures, have a strong sense of ethics) and the Canyon Ranch spa (people there, she figures, have a strong sense of service). But she sometimes resorts to newspaper ads _ which is how she ended up with her easy-rider caretaker. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"135770"	"he"	"figures"	" Donald Moore, Slade's boyfriend, is a meat manager at Stop 'n' Shop and still bears the faint accent of the North Carolina farm where he grew up. He can describe the scene in the basement so calmly, he figures, because he ``cuts meat for a living.'' He climbed down the winding stairs into the basement at a few minutes before 4. She was sitting on a blanket that had been spread on the concrete floor, with a kitchen knife in her hand, he said. The children were lying behind her, their throats cut. There was very little blood. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"

"138493"	"he"	"figures"	" Hotel guests complain all the time, of course, but even the most loyal rarely get such royal treatment. When Marc Neikrug, the concert pianist, got such treatment at the Chateau Laurier in Ottawa a few years ago, he figures, his celebrity and perhaps the universal ''you scratch my back I'll scratch }7:99[X underwear in his room. The next day, a colleague described the experience to the concierge on the hotel's executive floor, who as it happened was a music lover to whom Neikrug had previously given concert tickets. ``At lunchtime,'' he said, ``I got a message, `Could they move me?''' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200310.gz"
"142759"	"he"	"figures"	" A peace activist from Oregon stays in his residence, asking the Iraqi workers in his organization to visit or call so he does not have to venture out. He can still accomplishing things here, he figures, more so than if he left the country. Speaking to a reporter, he does not want to be identified by name in case Web-savvy kidnappers could use it to search him out in his neighborhood. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"146810"	"she"	"figures"	" Otherwise, she imagines disaster. The last time her brothers were moved from one building on the grounds to another, in 1995, one didn't speak for two years, Booher said. The staff didn't realize he wasn't speaking, because he only has 16 words, she noted ruefully. But I knew. Her other brother, she figures, would simply withdraw further. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"148850"	"he"	"figures"	" During school vacations, Omar comes back to Dreyfoos. He goes to his old classes, shows his designs to his former teachers, and chats with students. I just hang around, let them ask questions, get them excited, he says. Chances are, many of them never considered such an offbeat career. And once they see what he's doing, he figures, who knows what else they'll think of? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"148875"	"he"	"figures"	" Running is a wonderful survival mechanism, he figures, in an age where defensive linemen are quicker than DSL. That said, Michael Vick has one of the strongest arms in the league. Look out when he gets settled into the new system, Cunningham warned. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"153296"	"he"	"figures"	" Then, in a chain reaction, the sellers of the larger house closed on a $900,000 four-bedroom new colonial house. Neeley had a stake in all three deals, as well as the sale of two more homes, both for prices well above $1 million. In less than two weeks, he figures, he cleared nearly $98,000 in commissions, after splitting with other brokers and his firm. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"154465"	"he"	"figures"	" If he hadn't gone into the Army, he figures, he would have become a high school English teacher. Sometimes, instead of pushups, he assigns his candidates written papers, and shakes his head at their poor writing skills. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"160821"	"he"	"figures"	" There's not a trace of sadness in Spinks. There are, he figures, people worse off than him. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"163662"	"he"	"figures"	" Scott ran into trouble with the Willie Nelson mystique at an early age, 16 or 17, he figures, when he attended a Willie Nelson picnic in the early '70s out at Liberty Hill. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"166829"	"he"	"figures"	" The place to be, he figures, is the English Premiership, where clubs like Manchester United are said to be interested and whose employees aren't all touchy-feely about the game that was invented there. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
