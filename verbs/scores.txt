"92084"	"he"	"scores"	" In a little more than a month (June 23-24), the NHL will stage its annual amateur draft in Sunrise, Fla., home to the soon-to-be-sold Panthers. Top pick? If Boston owned it, the choice would be star Russian forward Ilya Kovalchuk. ``Typically, you'd like to build around a North American, a Steve Yzerman type,'' said Jeff Gorton, Boston's assistant general manager. ``That seems to be the trend, anyway. But Kovalchuk's dynamic. He's big, physical. He can score and make plays. Really, there is nothing he can't do. He has this attitude that some don't like _ he's a showman who wants the puck all the time. But when he gets it, he scores, so who can blame him for wanting it?'' Any other year, said Gorton, Jason Spezza (Windsor, OHL) would be ``the automatic No. 1.'' . . . Approximately the top 100 picks in the draft will convene in Toronto for four days next week, beginning Wednesday, for the annual draft combine _ with all 30 NHL teams getting their chance to kick the tires on these teenagers . . . Speculation continues in Atlanta that the Thrashers, who own the No. 1 pick, will wheel it for a No. 1 goalie, or perhaps for a package that would bring Michael Peca (this year's Nikolai Khabibulin) and a goalie from Buffalo. That's another way of suggesting that Damian Rhodes, who turns 32 Monday, is at the end of the road in Hotlanta. The former Michigan Tech standout is on the books for $5.3 million over the next two years. The Thrashers could save about $1.8 million on that via a buyout. In case you missed it, Atlanta signed little-known prospect Kamil Piros, the Czech center/winger it got from Buffalo via the Donald Audette deal. The two-year deal guarantees Piros _ projected among the team's top six forwards _ only $470,000 over two seasons, all but $110,000 in a signing bonus . . . The Ducks still haven't chosen their next head coach. Pat Burns remains in the rumor mill, but Alain Vigneault is considered the favorite . . . The eight games Tie Domi must sit out at the start of next season for his mugging of Scott Niedermayer will cost him just under $65,000. A better punishment: Make him forfeit the $65,000, but insist the Leafs not only play him in those eight games, but skate him a minimum 20 minutes per game. Otherwise the league has granted the Leafs addition by subtraction . . . Mikael Renberg is a lock to be back with the Coyotes next season, but don't look for Robert Reichel to join him in the desert. Reichel, who recently put up 12 points in eight games for the Czech Republic in the World Championships, more likely will land in Montreal . . . Look, he's a great player, but Jaromir Jagr can't be winning friends on the Penguins with his near-weekly pronouncements that he's destined to play somewhere other than Pittsburgh next year. Talk about lacking a sense of time, place, and priorities . . . After practice these days, Ex-Boston captain Ray Bourque pops on a baseball cap that reads, ``Mission 16W.'' FYI: It's a reminder that it takes 16 wins to capture the Cup. It is not a reminder that the Cup currently rests at Exit 16W off the New Jersey Turnpike . . . The Memorial Cup, the Stanley Cup for Junior ``A'' hockey in Canada, began Saturday in Regina, Saskatchewan, with four clubs: Regina, Red Deer, Ottawa, and Val d'Or. Don't bet on the tourney's MVP making a big NHL splash. In the last 20 years, only eight of them have had pro careers of any note, with Dale Hawerchuk ('81) the best of the bunch. Among the biggest busts is Alfie Turcotte ('83). He was chosen 17th overall by the Habs only weeks later, but went on to play in only 112 NHL games. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"

He's about winning; that's his attitude. And he works hard. When he first got here, he didn't know how to work hard. He thought he was, but he wasn't. Now, he knows.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"

Now played by an attractive bit of blond rough named Daniel Craig, Pierce Brosnan having been permanently kicked to the kerb, Her Majesty's favorite bad boy arrives on screens with the usual complement of cool toys, smooth rides, bosomy women and high expectations. He shoots, he scores, in bed and out, taking down the bad and the beautiful as he strides purposefully into the 21st century. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
