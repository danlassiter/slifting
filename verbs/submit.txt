"12006"	"I"	"submit"	" That is, I submit, worthy of Twain at his most deliciously subversive. I came across it in a short story called Cowards, recently republished in Fresno Stories (New Directions, $5). It's one in a series of bibelots, small format paperbacks covering the waterfront from Ezra Pound to Dylan Thomas to William Carlos Williams. Fresno Stories offers 11 stories drawn in equal parts from Saroyan's early and late periods. They're all at least good, and some of them are better than good. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"
"17969"	"I"	"submit"	" But the answer to such problems, I submit, is not preaching to girls and boys who may become parents someday, chastising them to wait until their Prince Charming or Dream Girl comes along. Instead, we should help these young people understand that becoming a parent when you're 16, uneducated and unskilled is destructive and dumb. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"
"24433"	"I"	"submit"	" But Hatch declared, ``If the federal government is incapable of putting any meaningful limit on the number of times that a prisoner can challenge this conviction over and over again, then this government is, I submit, not serious at all about fighting crime.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"24867"	"I"	"submit"	" ``Fifty years is a long time. And perhaps it can be argued that the Board's, and the courts', and the Congress' erstwhile interpretation of the phrase was inhumane, or unenlightened, or an anachronism, or something else even more disparaging. But it cannot be argued, I submit, that the prior interpretation was not and is not the law.'' Id., at 1235-1236 (footnotes omitted). </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"25839"	"I"	"submit"	" As the Court notes in response to this dissent, see ante, at 10, under its reading the third clause serves to define the actus reus element of the crime, just as Congress could have done by replacing the phrase ``notice of the possible interception'' with the unambiguous phrase ``notice of such authorization or application.'' That unambiguous language, however, would not achieve the temporal limitation on liability that I believe Congress intended to achieve with the words ``possible interception.'' The Court appears to acknowledge the need for such a limitation. See ante, at 10, n. 3. Rather than recognizing the limitation the statute contains, however, the Court hints that it might in some future case invent one. Limiting liability to the time before the authorizing judge announces the wiretap may well be ``plausible,'' ibid., but no plausible basis exists for finding that limitation in the words of the statute. A wiser course than judicial legislation, I submit, is simply to adopt a literal, reasonable construction of the text that Congress drafted. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

"32154"	"I"	"submit"	" With ultimate victory comes a sense of satisfaction. With satisfaction comes complacency. With complacency comes mediocrity. That the Braves have been the best team in baseball these last five seasons can, I submit, be traced to this simple truth: As good as they are, as successful as they've been, they're still hungry. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"33259"	"I"	"submit"	" Training military leaders, I submit, is too important a task to leave it to the military. Just like training priests is too important a task to leave to the clergy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"

"36246"	"I"	"submit"	" The closer you looked at the prosecution's case, I submit, the more receptive you were to the defense's contention that the state had not proved Simpson's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"

"36593"	"I"	"submit"	" La Russa would never use Charlton the way Lou has. This means La Russa would not have done what Piniella has done; namely, get the Mariners where they are in these playoffs. All Piniella wants to do each day is win. He isn't locked into a theory. He wants to win Sunday and worry about Monday Monday. This, I submit, is the proper way to approach postseason baseball. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"36956"	"I"	"submit"	" That, I submit, is a lovely paragraph of classical English prose. The latter portions of the book don't match up, but there are occasional grace notes, such as this, about the weather in Miami: `` . . . hot, but pleasant, like a woman breathing gently in your ear.'' And I like his remark about making a semi-commitment to a film: ``It's been observed in Hollywood that a semi-commitment is about as reliable as a semi-erection, but I've sometimes proceeded on both.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"40687"	"I"	"submit"	" During a brief, challenging and, ultimately, unrewarding Other Life in local television, I discovered how good Fred Cusick really was. And, I submit, is. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"
"61568"	"I"	"submit"	" All this, I submit, is hogwash, a monstrous sham, the bloated musings of drunken woolgatherers. A recent experience illuminates the point. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199606.gz"
"92557"	"we"	"submit"	" Connelly added: ``The fraud on the courts here, we submit, is an attempt to circumvent the legal requirements of a 1996 law that limit petitioners in the position of Timothy McVeigh to a showing of actual innocence if they wish to avoid a death sentence.''

"104843"	"I"	"submit"	" They gave Triarc a chance, I submit, because Triarc's presentation convinced the distributors that Snapple once again had an owner that understood the spirit of the brand.

"142120"	"I"	"submit"	" During the hearing, Norman Siegel, a veteran civil rights lawyer, told the court that one of his clients, a 17-year-old student at Trinity School in Manhattan, had been in jail for 42 hours. There is no reason, I submit, that this process had to take this long, Siegel said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"144547"	"we"	"submit"	" In 1992, Cambridge University proposed giving Derrida an honorary degree. Twenty professors of philosophy objected that semi-intelligible attacks upon the values of reason, truth, and scholarship (are) not, we submit, sufficient grounds for the awarding of an honorary degree in a distinguished university. In a vote of the full faculty, Derrida's supporters prevailed, 336-204. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"147040"	"we"	"submit"	" This, we submit, is no accident. The attorney general -- who, by the way, says he favors the death penalty for premeditated crimes of terrorism -- senses he does not have to trumpet his position, or fears that it could even hurt him with some voters. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
