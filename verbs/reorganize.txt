"135847"	"they"	"reorganize"	" It is accepted wisdom that the more outlandish catwalk efforts (sometimes called runway stunts) rarely make it to the marketplace. But the ideas often do. Artists ``don't really create anymore, they reorganize,'' Nicholas Bourriaud, the curator of the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, once stated in Artforum. Like DJs, Bourriaud maintained, they function as cultural synthesizers. And it is as gatherers of ideas, harvested and then recast with, say, Galliano's brio or McQueen's seditious shrewdness, that designers, and the spectacle of fashion, remain compelling to watch. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
