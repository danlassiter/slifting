"8036"	"we"	"gather"	" Devon, whom Farentino describes as sort of a futuristic Donald Trump, is rich, her family having been the builders of the space stations. When Devon's young son turns up with a disease for which the only conceivable cure is, we gather, fresh air, she bankrolls the expedition to a planet 22 light years away that apparently has the same features as this one. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"

The Marge Schott T-shirt booth.  1. Grand Marshall: Kathie Lee Gifford.  BILL'S WORLD  By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star  The little boy next door, in search of a way to get a day off school, wishes there were a ``Million Kid March.''  Two O.J. Simpson jurors are rushing out a co-authored book, it's reported. Not, we gather, a cookbook.  Colin Powell and Joe Montana signed their books at the same time recently in New York stores across the street from each other. With all that forced smiling for all the buyers, wasn't there a danger of grinlock?  Margaret Thatcher, on turning 70, declared it ``just another day.'' Unless you're counting in dog years, in which case it was just another week.  Al Gore told Haitians on his recent visit there that there's ``no doubt you will overcome all obstacles.'' But, if they're like us, most of the solutions will in time become new obstacles.  ``The crime rate is down almost every place in America,'' Mr. Clinton says. Though in some places you can't tell what place it is because the ``Welcome to. . .'' signs have been stolen.  ``The unemployment system,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``is not relevant to the times in which we live.'' Which, as reported on most of our VCR clocks, would be ``12:00, 12:00, 12:00. . .''  The president says ``a ton'' of Democrats are in favor of Medicare reform. He didn't mention names, but he could have meant himself and Ted Kennedy.  The economy is in ``a remarkable period of success,'' Mr. Clinton says. Can we have a day off to celebrate?  CITY STREETS  From Ellen Fisher:  The other afternoon, walking down Fifth Avenue, long after the pope had left for Baltimore, I noticed that the barricades blocking traffic were still up. I asked a doorman about them, who told me they were there for the Columbus Day Parade.  ``Who's marching today?'' I inquired. ``The Spaniels,'' he informed me. ``The Spaniels will march this afternoon and the Italians tomorrow.''  I probably would have given him a typical smart New Yorker retort about New York going to the dogs but the image of all those cockers, Brittanies and King Charleses parading proudly down Fifth with muzzles raised and tails waving was so sweet that I just thanked him and walked on.  In New York, survival training begins young. Mother to 4-year-old, overheard on East 83d Street: ``While I'm getting your Chicken McNuggets, if someone tells you to get up, just say: `I'm sorry. This is my table.' ''  From Joy Rothenberg:  The elevator in my office building was too crowded for me to reach the button. ``Would somebody please press my floor number?'' I asked. ``It's the same as my age.''  One passenger replied, ``You better get a job in the Empire State Building.''  A morning train into Manhattan from suburban Katonah. Two well-dressed women across the aisle from each other talk of old times, when they were part of a foursome. One woman says: ``I have Harry on the dresser. I plan to bury him when I move.''  Take note, Mother Goose. My friend Dolores's grandson, Bradley, 4{ years old, proudly recited the following nursery rhyme to her the other day:  Peter, Peter Pumpkin Eater  Had a wife and couldn't beep her.  From Francine Lange:  The scene: a subway train into Manhattan. The subject: panhandlers and the lines to get passengers to open hearts and wallets.  Straphanger 1: Remember the guy who wore the same suit when he was begging? We couldn't tell whether it was gray, brown or dirty white.  Straphanger 2: Yeah. He said he was dying of some incurable disease.  Straphanger 1: Guess what? I saw him on another train last week. Same rap. So I say to him, ``Hey, you were supposed to be dead a couple of months ago.''  Straphanger 2: What happened?  Straphanger 1: The guy didn't even miss a beat. He kept moving through the car and called back: ``Well, you know. These things take time.''  Lunchtime conversation between mother and grown son in a midtown restaurant overheard by Jake Wallace Beasley:  Mother: I went to my doctor yesterday to find out how I can lose some weight.''  Son: I can tell you how to do that. Eat more fruits and vegetables and exercise.  Mother: That's exactly what he said. But what kind of life is that?  GOOD DAY, WIRE WANDERERS!!!!!

DAVID-LETTERMAN ``LATE SHOW'' TOP TEN  Signs You're Not at the Real Million Man March  10. Everybody's singing John Denver songs.  9. Keynote speaker: Mark Fuhrman.  8. Entire march consists of you and that Urkel guy.  7. You're surrounded by people dressed as their favorite Star Trek character.  6. Everywhere you look _ Osmonds.  5. You see bumper stickers that say, ``Don't blame me, I voted for Pat Buchanan.''  4. It's held at the DMV, and the ``march'' is moving very slowly.  3. Lots of handmade signs that say, ``Yanni!''  2. The Marge Schott T-shirt booth.  1. Grand Marshall: Kathie Lee Gifford.  BILL'S WORLD  By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star  The little boy next door, in search of a way to get a day off school, wishes there were a ``Million Kid March.''  Two O.J. Simpson jurors are rushing out a co-authored book, it's reported. Not, we gather, a cookbook.  Colin Powell and Joe Montana signed their books at the same time recently in New York stores across the street from each other. With all that forced smiling for all the buyers, wasn't there a danger of grinlock?  Margaret Thatcher, on turning 70, declared it ``just another day.'' Unless you're counting in dog years, in which case it was just another week.  Al Gore told Haitians on his recent visit there that there's ``no doubt you will overcome all obstacles.'' But, if they're like us, most of the solutions will in time become new obstacles.  ``The crime rate is down almost every place in America,'' Mr. Clinton says. Though in some places you can't tell what place it is because the ``Welcome to. . .'' signs have been stolen.  ``The unemployment system,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``is not relevant to the times in which we live.'' Which, as reported on most of our VCR clocks, would be ``12:00, 12:00, 12:00. . .''  The president says ``a ton'' of Democrats are in favor of Medicare reform. He didn't mention names, but he could have meant himself and Ted Kennedy.  The economy is in ``a remarkable period of success,'' Mr. Clinton says. Can we have a day off to celebrate?  CITY STREETS  From Ellen Fisher:  The other afternoon, walking down Fifth Avenue, long after the pope had left for Baltimore, I noticed that the barricades blocking traffic were still up. I asked a doorman about them, who told me they were there for the Columbus Day Parade.  ``Who's marching today?'' I inquired. ``The Spaniels,'' he informed me. ``The Spaniels will march this afternoon and the Italians tomorrow.''  I probably would have given him a typical smart New Yorker retort about New York going to the dogs but the image of all those cockers, Brittanies and King Charleses parading proudly down Fifth with muzzles raised and tails waving was so sweet that I just thanked him and walked on.  In New York, survival training begins young. Mother to 4-year-old, overheard on East 83d Street: ``While I'm getting your Chicken McNuggets, if someone tells you to get up, just say: `I'm sorry. This is my table.' ''  From Joy Rothenberg:  The elevator in my office building was too crowded for me to reach the button. ``Would somebody please press my floor number?'' I asked. ``It's the same as my age.''  One passenger replied, ``You better get a job in the Empire State Building.''  A morning train into Manhattan from suburban Katonah. Two well-dressed women across the aisle from each other talk of old times, when they were part of a foursome. One woman says: ``I have Harry on the dresser. I plan to bury him when I move.''  Take note, Mother Goose. My friend Dolores's grandson, Bradley, 4{ years old, proudly recited the following nursery rhyme to her the other day:  Peter, Peter Pumpkin Eater  Had a wife and couldn't beep her.  From Francine Lange:  The scene: a subway train into Manhattan. The subject: panhandlers and the lines to get passengers to open hearts and wallets.  Straphanger 1: Remember the guy who wore the same suit when he was begging? We couldn't tell whether it was gray, brown or dirty white.  Straphanger 2: Yeah. He said he was dying of some incurable disease.  Straphanger 1: Guess what? I saw him on another train last week. Same rap. So I say to him, ``Hey, you were supposed to be dead a couple of months ago.''  Straphanger 2: What happened?  Straphanger 1: The guy didn't even miss a beat. He kept moving through the car and called back: ``Well, you know. These things take time.''  Lunchtime conversation between mother and grown son in a midtown restaurant overheard by Jake Wallace Beasley:  Mother: I went to my doctor yesterday to find out how I can lose some weight.''  Son: I can tell you how to do that. Eat more fruits and vegetables and exercise.  Mother: That's exactly what he said. But what kind of life is that?  GOOD DAY, WIRE WANDERERS!!!!!

"48226"	"I"	"gather"	" Worse, this green and black blizzard of cash and mud is alleged to have mortally wounded the special character of the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary; it has, I gather, ruined the time-honored opportunity of voters in small groups to sort through the initial batch of candidates on intimate, thoughtful terms as solemn surrogates for the national electorate. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"

"58043"	"I"	"gather"	" I have been reading the memoirs of two writers I admire extravagantly, Alfred Kazin and Gore Vidal. Much as I esteem both men as writers, however, their memoirs leave me uneasy. Vidal, I gather, has never met anyone who wasn't famous. Except for his family and wives, neither apparently has Kazin. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"

"121094"	"I"	"gather"	" ``The way she has transformed Mostly Mozart is terrific,'' Lamos said, ``against, I gather, a tide of internal criticism. Some of it has to do with the old-boy network, which is still in place.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"
"147880"	"I"	"gather"	" Advertising is a creative profession, so I feel copywriters and the like should be allowed a certain license that others -- in more staid jobs, let's say -- are not permitted, he said. If a misspelling or questionable grammar serves a purpose, I have no objection whatever to em instead of them, or, say, like instead of as. Your em, I gather, is meant to suggest a tone, a friendliness that them would not so easily convey. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"

"159413"	"I"	"gather"	" Tours for travelers, not tourists is the slogan of a tour company whose brochure landed on my desk a while back. This stuck me as a pretty nifty little Zen koan. Tours that aren't for tourists, I gather, are roughly equivalent to bicycles that aren't for bicyclists and flutes that aren't for flutists. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"163225"	"I"	"gather"	" More recently, the professor has heard responses such as, Yes, I gather, or So I've heard. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"166001"	"we"	"gather"	" Mrs. Lintott's position is a somewhat unfashionable one both in the play and in real life these days, where mere competence sometimes seems undervalued. She is not a particularly exciting teacher, we gather, just a highly effective one. Her great virtue is the way she suggests to the boys on the stage and the grownups in the audience that education has its limitations. If you don't get into one college, she reminds us, you will almost certainly get into another, and while education may be a necessary preparation for life, it is in no way a substitute for it. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060429.0071 type=story > <HEADLINE> ABUSE CONCERNS STYMIE RELEASES FROM GUANTANAMO </HEADLINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
