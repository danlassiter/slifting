His self-drawn caricature, complete with five concealed Ninas, had been replicated in paint on the avenue between 62nd and 63rd streets to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Margo Feiden Galleries, which represents him. But then it rained.   Television cameras and political figures in attendance notwithstanding, the 40-foot-long portrait began to drip.   ``There went Hirschfeld's eyebrows,'' Ms. Feiden said. ``Then the Ninas disappeared, and he lost about 20 pounds. He was supposed to sign the work, but he couldn't do it in the rain.''   The problem, she explained, was that the rain began during the 12 hours that were necessary to seal the top coat.   On Sunday at 3 a.m., the painters returned to touch up Hirschfeld.   So how did he survive Monday's rain? Ms. Feiden made repeated forays out of her gallery to check and pronounced him perfect. ``Every hair and every Nina was absolutely in place,'' she said.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941121.0461 type=story > <HEADLINE> PAIR OF BASEBALL MEETINGS SET </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-BBO-LABOR-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"

"9952"	"he"	"explained"	" Most carbohydrate and protein drinks contain glucose polymers, he explained, which provide a steady release of glucose into the bloodstream, much like a time-release cold capsule.

In the Russian market, he explained, international investors were drawn mostly to lower-price, if riskier shares that hold out the promise of greater and faster returns.

"12809"	"he"	"explained"	" ``I would say that we missed some elements to input,'' Nakano acknowledged. The two previous quakes were centered in the ocean off Japan and were caused by the shifting of tectonic plates, he explained, while this week's quake occurred along a fault line very near a population center, a possibility that the forecasters did not take into account. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"

"13183"	"he"	"explained"	" Rather than continuing to focus their sales messages solely on a woman of 25 to 54, he explained, pork producers also want to reach ``the other people in the household she buys for.'' So, a 30-second commercial by Bozell Chicago carries a broader theme, ``Taste what's next,'' than the familiar theme used since 1987: ``Pork. The other white meat.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"
"13197"	"he"	"explained"	" The announcement last week of the departure of the American force and its replacement on March 31 by nearly 7,000 U.N. peacekeepers caught many Haitians by surprise and has brought with it ``a sense of foreboding,'' a diplomat here said. Despite resentment in some parts of the country about their failure to dismantle paramilitary groups, he explained, ``the Americans are a known quantity to people here, and the United Nations is not.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"
"13568"	"he"	"explained"	" ``I was astonished,'' McCobb, 62, said. All the more so, he explained, because he had lived almost his entire adult life believing he had no blood relatives. ``To see you had a relative when you thought you had none is such a thrill.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"
"13676"	"he"	"explained"	" Shakespeare lived in a different city than his wife throughout much of their marriage, left her his ``second best bed'' in his will and had a curse inscribed on his tomb that prevented her from being buried next to him.

"13903"	"he"	"explained"	" The wrong thing, he explained, is China's attempt to enter the World Trade Organization by stripping away the protected markets of its state-owned industries, by reforming its banking system, by acknowledging colossal bad debts and by forcing money-losing state enterprises into bankruptcy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199502.gz"

"14453"	"she"	"explained"	" ``What a typical hearing question,'' she replied, using the epithet for the nondeaf. Some deaf adults, especially those whose deafness wasn't detected when they were babies, she explained, read poorly, as if English were a second language, after American Sign.

"14463"	"he"	"explained"	" A man who likes to pepper his speech with sports images, he said Genoa's 1980s decline had pushed it toward ``disqualification.'' Genoa, he explained, lost tens of thousands of jobs during a recession in the decade's early years as Italy privatized industries like the shipbuilding and steelmaking conglomerates here. Over the last decade, Genoa's population slumped by 150,000 to below 700,000 people as jobs disappeared. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199502.gz"

"15957"	"he"	"explained"	" Hall said that one of plans being considered is to buy fishing rights or boats at what he called ``a reverse auction.''

"16325"	"she"	"explained"	" Her own acting career with a variety of international directors never really stopped, but it never really took off in France.

"16328"	"she"	"explained"	" Even if NYPD Blue racked up through-the-roof, ER-like ratings, she explained, it still wouldn't attract an advertiser stampede, because many advertisers won't risk having their product associated with the adult-themed cop drama. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"

"19194"	"he"	"explained"	" The timing of Crenshaw's victory, as well as the dramatic nature of his triumph -- two birdies in the final three holes, to break a tie with Davis Love III -- caused Tinsley Penick to seek refuge in his office during the final hour of Sunday's telecast.

"19300"	"she"	"explained"	" Hearst, she explained, used to camp in tents with his family on the hill overlooking his 250,000 acres; what turned out to be the state's only castle began as an idea for a modest, two-story house. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"

Frable of the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond, who is the nation's leading expert on fine-needle aspiration, said in an interview that Dr. Yang's stain ``works like a charm.''

"21065"	"he"	"explained"	" The fact that he had once made money in the ring accounted for his imprisonment.

"22208"	"we"	"explained"	" In Rowland, we explained the proper method of analyzing a statutory term's ``context'' to determine when a presumptive definition must yield.

"22904"	"he"	"explained"	" The teachers at the neighborhood schools did not expect much from their black and Hispanic students, and dropout rates were high. The schools papered over the problem with fancy gold-lettered honor rolls, not for A students but for the handful of students who were passing all their courses. One Brooklyn principal masked the low number of graduating seniors by padding the commencement ceremony with a group of students who marched down the aisle and received blank pieces of paper instead of diplomas.

BRICKS AND BOARDS AND ROCK AND ROLL  Looking forward to the Labor Day dedication of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, the design magazine Metropolis analyzes the contribution of architect I.M. Pei, whose other works include the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, the East Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and the ``pyramid'' addition to the Louvre in Paris.  When the 78-year-old architect first was offered the commission, he turned it down, saying that he didn't know anything about rock and roll. Then Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner and Atlantic Records CEO Ahmet Ertegun, both members of the museum's Foundation, took the architect on a tour of Graceland and the Mississippi Delta, in which, they explained, rock and roll had been born.  ``After that trip,'' said one of the architect's associates, ``Mr. Pei felt rock and roll was important. He realized it wasn't just a flash in the pan.''  The new facility contains one of Pei's trademark pyramids, a 117-foot-tall ``tent'' made of glass and steel, and a tower with cantilevered wings. Museum design director Peter Arendt called it an ``architectural, sculptural interpretation of the explosiveness of the music.''  Metropolis calls the building ``Pei's funkiest building ever,'' but at least one architecture critic is skeptical. ``The sponsors were clearly looking for the Kennedy Library,'' said Michael Sorkin.

Times News Service  For those planning a Caribbean vacation in the aftermath of Hurricane Luis, the most common advice from tourism officials is: Call first.  The storm obliterated some resort islands but left others virtually untouched. Antigua and St. Martin/St. Maarten, which is part French and part Dutch, sustained severe property damage. The destruction was more modest in St. Barts, Anguilla, and St. Kitts and Nevis. Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Guadeloupe suffered almost no damage at all.  Even on the islands that were hardest hit, the damage to hotels varied greatly depending on their location and construction. While some hotels may not reopen for nearly a year, others have been providing full service since the day after the hurricane passed.  On Antigua, for instance, the Royal Antiguan accepted guests on the weekend after the storm, although service was reportedly far from first rate. Antiguan tourism officials acknowledge that hotels like Trade Winds, Runaway Beach and Galley Bay suffered heavy damage and will not reopen until at least next summer.  ``Galley Bay is a lot of thatched cottages, and they were just flattened,'' said Alan A. Fleschner, the Royal Antiguan's marketing director. ``They had a very lovely bar that was just off the beach with a big pointed top to it and it was just on its side. Runaway Bay lost its restaurant and all its beach rooms.''  John H. Bell, executive vice president of the Caribbean Hotel Association, predicted that 90 percent of the hotels in the region would be open again by mid-November and that 98 percent would be operating when the high season officially begins in mid-December.  Putting the best face on the situation, Bell said that many hotels might be better than ever once they are repaired. He said that hotels that were originally designed to cater to an older clientele may use the opportunity to build nightclubs and sports facilities that appeal to younger visitors. ``You get an overall rejuvenation process,'' Bell said. ``I remember that happened particularly after Hurricane Gilbert in Jamaica. The hotel product had never looked so good as the season afterward, and I wouldn't be surprised to see the same in the Leeward Islands.''  Only time, of course, will repair much of the damage from the storm, the strongest to strike the Caribbean since 1989. On the islands most directly in the path of the hurricane's 130 mile-per-hour winds, royal palms were uprooted, beaches were eroded, reefs were dislodged, and hillsides once verdant were stripped of all vegetation.  A number of cruise lines are bypassing St. Maarten and Antigua for the time being, and are replacing those ports of call with other islands. Carnival Cruise Line's Celebration, for instance, will now sail to St. Croix rather than St. Maarten on its seven-day journeys out of Miami, which also include stops in San Juan and St. Thomas. Royal Caribbean Cruise Line's Monarch of the Seas, on its cruises from San Juan, will stop in St. Croix and Trinidad instead of Antigua and St. Maarten, along with scheduled stops in Barbados, Martinique and St. Thomas.  ``We'll look at it on a week-to-week basis,'' said James R. Lida, Royal Caribbean's manager of corporate communications. ``We're not going to bring 2,500 passengers into a destination until we can be an economic benefit rather than a burden.''  Caribbean tourism officials are understandably concerned that the hurricane will arrest what has been a steady growth in visits to their region. They are encouraging prospective visitors to change destinations within the Caribbean rather than abandoning the islands altogether.  But they doubt that tour operators and hoteliers will try to lure visitors with price cuts. ``I don't anticipate any reductions from what was previously planned,'' said Michael J. Youngman, marketing director for the Caribbean Tourism Organization. ``There are already a lot of values out there.''  c. 1995 N.Y. Times News Service  Taking a taxi can be an expensive and unpleasant experience in Prague. With more than 100 million visitors pouring into the Czech Republic last year, taxi drivers in the capital have been charging tourists exorbitant prices, and often insisting on payment with insults and even punches. There have been reports of tourists being charged more than 10 times the $20 that a ride from the airport to the city should cost.  So far there have been no published reports of unwitting riders being given the electric shock treatment that some drivers, according to a report in Mlada Fronta Dnes, a Czech newspaper, threatened to install in their cars. ``Metal wires are stuck into the upholstery and when a button is pushed, the circuit is connected and there's an electric shock,'' Antonin Zemlicka, a member of the drivers' guild, said earlier this year. The idea, he explained, was to force passengers to pay the fare on the meter, whether it was correct or not.  There are honest cabdrivers in Prague who abide by the rules, which are as follows. According to law, a ride should cost 12 crowns (25 crowns to the dollar) per kilometer. The meter can be set at levels one through four, and for all rides within the city it should be set at one. Beware, however: many meters are rigged. Some tourists prefer to negotiate a fare with the driver, writing the agreed price on a piece of paper and then paying that and no more.  Those staying in a hotel should ask the front desk to call a cab. There are several reliable radio cab companies, among them Profitaxi (6104-5555) and AAA, (3399), both of which have English-speaking operators. One more tip: avoid the taxi ranks in Mala Strana, Wenceslas Square and Charles Bridge, which are known for unscrupulous drivers.  c. 1995 N.Y. Times News Service  To commemorate the 75th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which insured voting rights for women, the Woodrow Wilson House, in Washington, is displaying ``An Act of Right Justice: Woodrow Wilson and Women's Suffrage.''  Under pressure from many sources, including his daughters, President Wilson supported the amendment, which was eventually ratified on Aug. 26, 1920.  The Wilson House is featuring copies of ratification documents from several states of the initial 36 to ratify the amendment; audio recordings of interviews with Alice Paul and Laura Ellsworth Seiller, prominent suffragists; the official pardon of 16 imprisoned suffragists, signed by President Wilson in 1917, and original marching costumes, banners, pins and handbills.  The exhibit will be on display through Jan. 8 during regular museum hours, Tuesday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The Wilson House is at 2340 S Street, N.W., within walking distance of the Dupont Circle subway station.

Times News Service  For those planning a Caribbean vacation in the aftermath of Hurricane Luis, the most common advice from tourism officials is: Call first.  The storm obliterated some resort islands but left others virtually untouched. Antigua and St. Martin/St. Maarten, which is part French and part Dutch, sustained severe property damage. The destruction was more modest in St. Barts, Anguilla, and St. Kitts and Nevis. Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Guadeloupe suffered almost no damage at all.  Even on the islands that were hardest hit, the damage to hotels varied greatly depending on their location and construction. While some hotels may not reopen for nearly a year, others have been providing full service since the day after the hurricane passed.  On Antigua, for instance, the Royal Antiguan accepted guests on the weekend after the storm, although service was reportedly far from first rate. Antiguan tourism officials acknowledge that hotels like Trade Winds, Runaway Beach and Galley Bay suffered heavy damage and will not reopen until at least next summer.  ``Galley Bay is a lot of thatched cottages, and they were just flattened,'' said Alan A. Fleschner, the Royal Antiguan's marketing director. ``They had a very lovely bar that was just off the beach with a big pointed top to it and it was just on its side. Runaway Bay lost its restaurant and all its beach rooms.''  John H. Bell, executive vice president of the Caribbean Hotel Association, predicted that 90 percent of the hotels in the region would be open again by mid-November and that 98 percent would be operating when the high season officially begins in mid-December.  Putting the best face on the situation, Bell said that many hotels might be better than ever once they are repaired. He said that hotels that were originally designed to cater to an older clientele may use the opportunity to build nightclubs and sports facilities that appeal to younger visitors. ``You get an overall rejuvenation process,'' Bell said. ``I remember that happened particularly after Hurricane Gilbert in Jamaica. The hotel product had never looked so good as the season afterward, and I wouldn't be surprised to see the same in the Leeward Islands.''  Only time, of course, will repair much of the damage from the storm, the strongest to strike the Caribbean since 1989. On the islands most directly in the path of the hurricane's 130 mile-per-hour winds, royal palms were uprooted, beaches were eroded, reefs were dislodged, and hillsides once verdant were stripped of all vegetation.  A number of cruise lines are bypassing St. Maarten and Antigua for the time being, and are replacing those ports of call with other islands. Carnival Cruise Line's Celebration, for instance, will now sail to St. Croix rather than St. Maarten on its seven-day journeys out of Miami, which also include stops in San Juan and St. Thomas. Royal Caribbean Cruise Line's Monarch of the Seas, on its cruises from San Juan, will stop in St. Croix and Trinidad instead of Antigua and St. Maarten, along with scheduled stops in Barbados, Martinique and St. Thomas.  ``We'll look at it on a week-to-week basis,'' said James R. Lida, Royal Caribbean's manager of corporate communications. ``We're not going to bring 2,500 passengers into a destination until we can be an economic benefit rather than a burden.''  Caribbean tourism officials are understandably concerned that the hurricane will arrest what has been a steady growth in visits to their region. They are encouraging prospective visitors to change destinations within the Caribbean rather than abandoning the islands altogether.  But they doubt that tour operators and hoteliers will try to lure visitors with price cuts. ``I don't anticipate any reductions from what was previously planned,'' said Michael J. Youngman, marketing director for the Caribbean Tourism Organization. ``There are already a lot of values out there.''  c. 1995 N.Y. Times News Service  Taking a taxi can be an expensive and unpleasant experience in Prague. With more than 100 million visitors pouring into the Czech Republic last year, taxi drivers in the capital have been charging tourists exorbitant prices, and often insisting on payment with insults and even punches. There have been reports of tourists being charged more than 10 times the $20 that a ride from the airport to the city should cost.  So far there have been no published reports of unwitting riders being given the electric shock treatment that some drivers, according to a report in Mlada Fronta Dnes, a Czech newspaper, threatened to install in their cars. ``Metal wires are stuck into the upholstery and when a button is pushed, the circuit is connected and there's an electric shock,'' Antonin Zemlicka, a member of the drivers' guild, said earlier this year. The idea, he explained, was to force passengers to pay the fare on the meter, whether it was correct or not.  There are honest cabdrivers in Prague who abide by the rules, which are as follows. According to law, a ride should cost 12 crowns (25 crowns to the dollar) per kilometer. The meter can be set at levels one through four, and for all rides within the city it should be set at one. Beware, however: many meters are rigged. Some tourists prefer to negotiate a fare with the driver, writing the agreed price on a piece of paper and then paying that and no more.  Those staying in a hotel should ask the front desk to call a cab. There are several reliable radio cab companies, among them Profitaxi (6104-5555) and AAA, (3399), both of which have English-speaking operators. One more tip: avoid the taxi ranks in Mala Strana, Wenceslas Square and Charles Bridge, which are known for unscrupulous drivers.  c. 1995 N.Y. Times News Service  To commemorate the 75th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which insured voting rights for women, the Woodrow Wilson House, in Washington, is displaying ``An Act of Right Justice: Woodrow Wilson and Women's Suffrage.''  Under pressure from many sources, including his daughters, President Wilson supported the amendment, which was eventually ratified on Aug. 26, 1920.  The Wilson House is featuring copies of ratification documents from several states of the initial 36 to ratify the amendment; audio recordings of interviews with Alice Paul and Laura Ellsworth Seiller, prominent suffragists; the official pardon of 16 imprisoned suffragists, signed by President Wilson in 1917, and original marching costumes, banners, pins and handbills.  The exhibit will be on display through Jan. 8 during regular museum hours, Tuesday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The Wilson House is at 2340 S Street, N.W., within walking distance of the Dupont Circle subway station.

UNDATED: 202-387-4062.  c. 1995 N.Y. Times News Service  The Hotel Kitano, closed in November 1991 for a $50 million reconstruction, reopened this month at 38th Street and Park Avenue as the 150-room Kitano New York.  One of the hotel's two restaurants, the Nadaman Hakubai, the only branch of Nadaman outside Asia, features the traditional, multicourse Kaiseki approach to food. The Garden Cafe, the hotel's other restaurant, has Western dishes done in Japanese ways _ a hamburger, for example, prepared with Japanese seasonings and served with rice. The Ryurei Lounge offers Japanese tea service.  Rates at the brownstone-and-brick hotel, built in 1926 by the Rockefeller family, range from $240 to $1,200 (for a Japanese-style suite) a night. Reservations and information: (212) 885-7000.  c. 1995 N.Y. Times News Service  Two CD-ROM's packed with information of use to travelers are becoming available in computer stores around the nation.  Precision Mapping 2.0 for Windows features a detailed map of the entire continental United States. It includes more than 17 million streets and roads _ virtually every street in the country _ and almost 3 million miles of rivers and streams.  Users can search by city name, street name, address, ZIP code, area code, and latitude and longitude. The program will even search down to the level of a street block, or a cross street or intersection.  Once a location has been found, Precision Mapping 2.0 can be used to create a custom color map that can be exported for use in a word processing program or spreadsheet. The program, produced by Just Softworks of Lemont, Ill., can be used with most printers, so that within seconds the custom map can be ready to use.  Available at Software Etc., Barnes &AMP; Noble, Computer City and Comp U.S.A., Precision Mapping 2.0 has a street price of $79 (the full recommended retail price is $119). As a bonus, buyers can choose between two free CD-ROM's: American Business Information's 11 Million Yellow Pages or 70 Million White Page Listings.  To run the program, users will need Microsoft Windows 3.1 or higher (including Windows 95), a 386 or higher I.B.M.-compatible computer, four megabytes of memory, a CD-ROM drive and a mouse.  Almost a companion program is the 1995 Wayzata World Factbook, a multimedia gazetteer compiled from information supplied by the Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department, the Defense Intelligence Agency and other official sources.  It provides cultural, governmental, economic and demographic profiles of 264 countries, regions and territories. The profiles are enhanced by maps, sound effects, color flags and more than 200 photographs of world landmarks, from the pyramids to the Great Wall of China.  Also included are entry requirements for travel, State Department travel advisories and terrorist group profiles. The 1995 edition, the fifth since 1991, contains eight megabytes of updated data, as well as new photographs and charts.  The program has a street price of about $20 ($25 recommended retail price), operates with any Macintosh, as well as with Windows 3.1 and, according to the manufacturers, Windows 95, and is available from Comp U.S.A. or Computer City, or by mail from Wayzata Technology, 21 Northeast Fourth Street, Grand Rapids, Minn. 55744; (800) 735-7321.  c. 1995 N.Y.

A FIRST WIFE HAS HER SAY  Mean ol' Mirabella magazine begins a story on candidates' wives with the wisdom of Democratic strategist James Carville: ``The Republicans must love families,'' says Carville, ``they have so many of them. I'm offering a reward to any Republican candidate who's left his wife for an older woman.''  Most of the first wives were reluctant to talk with Mirabella, but at least one wanted to set the record straight. ``There are all these stories going around about us that are just plain wrong,'' said Phyllis Macey,retired occupational therapist and Bob Dole's first wife.  The Doles met, she explained, at the end of his hospital stay for severe war injuries. They married in 1948. He ran for Congress in 1960, and then the good times rolled. ``President Nixon lit my cigarette one night,'' says the former Mrs. Dole, recalling a visit to the White House. ``I still have the matches.''  As her husband's political ambitions waxed, however, his attention to family matters waned. ``We didn't communicate very much. The last year we were married, he worked from sunup to past sundown.'' But she didn't realize anything was wrong ``until he told me he wanted out,'' in 1972. Dole refused to discuss what had gone wrong in the marriage.  Now married to her third husband, Macey realizes some of what was missing from her first union. ``Bob wasn't a hugger and a toucher,'' she says.  She said she still supports her husband politically _ ``I did remain a Republican, although one year I didn't vote'' _ and hand-painted 2,000 wooden Dole campaign buttons in 1988. She made $5,000 on the project.  No hard feelings from Phyllis Macey. ``What is amazing,'' said the 71-year-old of her 72-year-old ex, ``is how young he looks for how old he is.''  NO NEED FOR MONEY LAUNDRY  After studying 102 coins and 100 bills, researchers at New York Methodist Hospital, where they must be popping nickels and dimes like canapes at a cocktail party, have determined that only 3 percent of the coins and 11 percent of the bills were growing bacteria.

(lb) c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service  NEW YORK _ Isabelle Stevenson, president of the American Theater Wing, is fully prepared to take the blame on Monday if any of the 366 producers, directors, actors and playwrights attending the organization's luncheon in the Rainbow Room are displeased with their seats.  ``Everyone wants to sit with a celebrity,'' Mrs. Stevenson said the other day as she juggled table arrangements.  ``What would have a perfectly beautiful sight line in the Rainbow Room for any other occasion may not be so desirable for someone here who is not near a celebrity. Producers look around to see if they are seated as well as other producers, and groups from theater companies all want to sit together.''  To accommodate as many people as possible, she explained, she ordered extra-small chairs, ``though some of them will be for larger people.''  The luncheon is the first in a series of celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the Tony Awards, which are presented by the American Theater Wing and the League of Broadway Theaters and Producers.  Patricia Neal, who won a Tony 50 years ago for her performance in ``Another Part of the Forest,'' is one of four actresses to be honored. The others are Glenn Close, Zoe Caldwell and Rosemary Harris.  c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service  NEW YORK _ It's time for Michael Garin, the composer, pianist and writer, to move on.

But he is not leaving the big time.  ``At Arthur's Landing I will do a lot of the same material,'' he said the other day.  ``This is a global village, no matter whether you're in Weehawken, New York or Los Angeles.

"63108"	"he"	"explained"	" Another characteristic of the fund, Kravis said in an interview, will be that unlike most recent economic development efforts in New York, this one will not try to protect the existing economic base or try to keep companies from leaving the city _ though investments like that might be made on occasion.

But, she explained, it is need-based Medicaid, not age-based Medicare, that covers nursing-home stays. If Medicaid pays, all your income must be paid to the state. If you are married, Ms. Lamson said, your spouse can have no more than about $75,000 and a monthly income of no more than around $2,000.

"70316"	"he"	"explained"	" Of course, plunging money into tiny start-up companies is risky business. Russ Schultz, a financial planner in Reno who specializes in these investments, said angels must be thick-skinned about losses and free from any need for the money they plow into the ventures.

"70329"	"he"	"explained"	" Heritage Trails New York offers guided tours of the neighborhood daily, departing from the statue of Washington outside Federal Hall. Guides, judging from mine, Michael Emyrs, make an effort to be entertaining. The pockmarks in the Wall Street side of the Morgan Guaranty Trust, Emyrs pointed out, were a result of debris from an abandoned car that exploded on the street on Sept. 19, 1920. A particularly large gouge, he explained, was from the head of a woman who had the misfortune of walking by at the wrong moment. He also pointed out what he described as the best soft ice cream in the district _ at Allie's, on the Nassau Street pedestrian mall, at the corner of John Street. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"

"72366"	"he"	"explained"	" Ideally, cashmere-bearing goats thrive in extreme cold climates, which promotes growth of the soft down that is their protection, and dry climates, which keeps out oil in the down.

(lh)  c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service  Where there's one Tisch, there are sure to be others these days, naming buildings, receiving honors, celebrating family occasions.  Wednesday and Thursday, for example, Preston Robert Tisch, who is known as Bob; his wife, Joan Tisch, and their three grown children _ Jonathan Tisch, Steve Tisch and Laurie Tisch Sussman, along with Jonathan's wife, Laura, and Steve's fiancee, Jamie Alexander _ will all be at Tufts University in Medford, Mass., for the dedication of the new $21 million Tisch Library, for which they gave $10 million.  They will be more than spectators or ribbon cutters. Bob Tisch, an owner of the New York Giants, will lead a panel of sports team owners and executives Wednesday in a discussion, ``Let the Games Begin: The Business of Sports.''  ``I wouldn't talk about poetry or history too well,'' he said Monday, ``so I put together a sports panel.''  On Thursday, Steve Tisch, producer of the Academy Award-winning movie ``Forrest Gump'' and a Tufts graduate, class of '71, will moderate a panel of alumni on `` `Forrest Gump' at the Millennium.''  Asked about the decidedly non-ivory tower topics, John DiBiaggio, the president of Tufts, said: ``Both sports and film have significant amounts of scholarly content. And maybe it's a reflection of our willingness to appreciate that academic pursuits cover a broad spectrum.''  This is not the only event to be attended by the Tisches en masse. Even more of them were on hand last week for a dinner in the Pierre Hotel at which Bob Tisch was honored by New York University.  And next week they will all be traveling to California for Steve Tisch's wedding on Oct. 20 at a vineyard in the Napa Valley.  c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service  NEW YORK _ The proceedings were becoming awfully solemn the other night at a party at the United Nations celebrating the 1,100th anniversary of the establishment of Hungary. Eva Forsyth decided she had to do something. She is a Hungarian-born bridal-dress designer and manufacturer and one of 10 people who were being honored by the American Council of the World Federation of Hungarians, which gave the dinner.  ``It was very serious, because we all spoke about our lives,'' Ms. Forsyth said Monday. ``And the award winners all made dissertations about how we got to the United States and why we succeeded here. It was sad. Walter Cronkite had tears in his eyes.''  So she approached the band leader, Zoltan Zorandy, and asked him to play something peppy. ``He only played Hungarian folkloric music,'' she said. ``And I said, `No, we need something happy American.' He asked, `What is that?' and I answered: `Right now that is something Spanish. Could you play the Macarena?''  Zorandy could not, he explained, but he knew a guitarist who could play, and sing the lyrics. Send for him, no matter what it costs, Ms. Forsyth responded. Zorandy made a quick local phone call, and the guitarist appeared. That is how everyone from George Soros to Isabella Rossellini, and, yes, Walter Cronkite, ended up doing the Macarena to celebrate Hungary. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19961007.0817 type=story > <HEADLINE> VENEZUELA'S CISNEROS CREATES NEW TELEVISION PRODUCTION COMPANY </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> Caracas, Oct. 7 (Bloomberg) (BC-VENEUZUELA-CISNEROS-BLOOM) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"

Times News Service  When Anne Stevens decided to transfer to a different college for her junior year, she turned to friends _ and to her computer _ for information.  Now, thanks in many ways to what the 21-year-old Smith College student learned from browsing college home pages on the Internet, she is hoping to transfer to Brigham Young University, in Provo, Utah, next fall, without ever having visited the campus.  ``Brigham Young's home pages were easy to read and very informative,'' Ms. Stevens said. ``Part of their application was on line, which makes it easy to apply. Once you fill it out they send you the rest.''  Kris Carde, 18, a freshman majoring in computer engineering at the University of California at Davis, also used the information highway to research colleges. A veteran hacker, mouse potato (the cyberspeak equivalent of a coach potato) and programmer, Carde launched a full-scale investigation of colleges he was interested in. Although he visited many of the 12 schools he considered, as a senior at Amherst Regional High School in Amherst, Mass., he did most of his research over the Internet.  ``I wouldn't have felt comfortable choosing a school based entirely upon information found on its home page,'' he says. ``There is more to a school than what you find on its Web site. Still, the school's home page gave me information about configurations of the computer labs, dorm layouts and student activities that had not been included in the school's catalogue.''  In recent years, colleges of all sizes have joined the march to provide Internet users with access to information via a home page. Often these pages were designed for and by students on campuses. Increasingly, however, the pages have evolved into marketing and recruiting vehicles that are being tested for their ability to attract new students to a campus.  ``Initially, rudimentary pages were put together by brilliant teen-agers,'' said Robert Thornton, vice president at Teikyo Post University and formerly associate director of admissions at Vassar College. Teen-agers, he explained, were among the few who understood the coding called hyper text markup language that is the programming language for the Internet. Many colleges also had _ and continue to have _ unofficial pages created by students. But today, he said, ``many schools are commandeering their entire computer-science departments to create splashy home pages.''  Thornton cautions that college home pages are in their infancy and that colleges are testing them without making long-term projections about the ultimate affect they'll have on the admissions process.  ``I don't think college home pages will replace college catalogues,'' Thonton said, ``but I do think they will one day revolutionize the application process. It gives students a whole new way to research schools quickly and thoroughly.''  David Merkowitz, spokesman for the American Council on Education, a Washington-based organization that represents 1,700 colleges, agrees.  ``The Internet represents another recruiting tool colleges can't afford to ignore,'' he said.

Colleges are also finding that home pages can eliminate much of the paperwork associated with processing applications, admissions officers say. Many schools are testing home pages that allow students to either download an application into their computer or to fill out an application on line and send it back through the computer.  But it is the ease with which home pages can be updated that give them distinct advantages over the traditional college catalogue. Some pages feature high-tech enhancements like sound and graphics that let potential students take virtual tours of the campus and surrounding community. Other pages can instantly link to related home pages about special programs and faculty or student-created pages.  The quality of home pages varies, depending on the ability of the page's creator, or ``Webmaster,'' to combine advanced computer skills with a creative approach.  The majority of home pages, however, have a long way to go, said Michael Stoner, a Web page and site designer who is vice president of a college media relations firm and a member of the International Interactive Communications Society, a professional group.  ``Most schools are paying lip service to the Web as a communication vehicle,'' he said. ``They see it as an add-on but they don't see the value in it because it's too early to measure results.''  Yet, Stoner said, it would not be long before colleges will set aside a budget for Web development so home pages can either be developed in-house or by Web design companies. Depending upon the time spent, services and creative effort provided, he estimated that it can cost anywhere from $25,000 to $150,000 to have a Web specialist design a home page.  Stoner cited UCLA (http://www.ucla.edu) as a school that is considered ahead of the pack. UCLA has 250 Web sites and 50,000 content pages. And the site is kept updated by a full-time, professional four-person team. The school paid Box Top Interactive a Los Angeles Web-site developer whose clients include large corporations, more than $75,000 to help speed users' ability to access its official home page _ a gateway to the sites.  Determining how many colleges have home pages is difficult.  Christina DeMello, a technical specialist at a database software company, the Oracle Corporation in Redwood Shores, Calif., has compiled a list of more than 3,000 ``official'' or administration-approved home pages from throughout the world. The list is an outgrowth of her days helping set up the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's official page in the spring of 1994.  And colleges have only begun to measure the impact of their home pages in a consistent way. A 1995 survey by MIT, for instance, found that the increased use of home pages and E-mail on the Web made a ``very real difference in our recruiting efforts,'' said Michael Behnke, the admissions director at MIT.  That year, MIT (http://web.mit.edu) received 110 E-mail messages from prospective students. ``Ultimately, 84 percent of the students who E-mailed us enrolled at MIT.''  The university's official Web site was created after the university discovered one created by students. ``It was fine, but some of the information was wrong,'' Behnke said.  More important than the information, however, he said, was creating fast, easy links to each page.  Brigham Young University, on the other hand has yet to measure the results of its efforts on the Web.  ``We don't know what effect it has had on admissions,'' said Brent Harker, Brigham Young's director of public communications. ``In the future, we plan to survey our students to find out which ones researched the school over the Web.''  At New York University _ where a virtual tour of New York City has been created to jazz up the admissions page (http://www.nyu.edu) _ Richard Avitabile, director of admissions and enrollment management, said inquiries over the Web have increased by 200 percent.  ``At the moment, we feel it will enhance our marketing approach,'' he said.  It is the ease and immediacy that of home pages that attracted both Ms. Stevens and Mr. Carde in their search for schools.  ``Initially I knew I wanted to attend a school in Utah,'' said Ms. Stevens, ``but I didn't know which one.'' She started her search by using a Web browser service, Netscape Navigator, to obtain a list of all Utah colleges that had home pages.  Ms. Stevens checked each school's page to see if it met her criteria for courses, financial aid, location and campus social life. Brigham Young (http://www.byu.edu) came out on top.  ``I was impressed that many of the departments had their own home pages. If I had questions, I simply E-mailed the department head.''  Achieving such a useful Web site was no simple feat, Harker said.  ``Prior to creating the school's official home page in 1994, there were more than 200 unofficial sites,'' he said. The school's official page now has 10 central areas of information. When students send questions by E-mail, he said, the school tries to ``get back to them the same day.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19961102.0071 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-FEATURE-$ADV03-BUDGET-BOS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> For Release SUNDAY, November 3, 1996.

She started her search by using a Web browser service, Netscape Navigator, to obtain a list of all Utah colleges that had home pages.  Ms. Stevens checked each school's page to see if it met her criteria for courses, financial aid, location and campus social life. Brigham Young (http://www.byu.edu) came out on top.  ``I was impressed that many of the departments had their own home pages. If I had questions, I simply E-mailed the department head.''  Achieving such a useful Web site was no simple feat, Harker said.  ``Prior to creating the school's official home page in 1994, there were more than 200 unofficial sites,'' he said. The school's official page now has 10 central areas of information. When students send questions by E-mail, he said, the school tries to ``get back to them the same day.''

"77688"	"she"	"explained"	" Jews, she explained, are ``people of the book,'' who give a high priority to scholarly study. But Talmudic law ``seems to say that women are to be placed in the same category as minors and slaves,'' she said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"

"78327"	"she"	"explained"	" The problem, she explained, is that patients might actually have more vision before a procedure than they appear to have on standard tests, which ask them to pinpoint light sources or read eye charts. ``Postoperatively, there is a group of 10 people in the room, hanging on every word, and as the patient reads along an eye chart, every single letter he reads is met with excitement and interest,'' McKay said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"
"78348"	"he"	"explained"	" Whitney said there was no officially protected forest and almost no intact native forest in the range of the pink-legged graveteiro. Cocoa, he explained, is cultivated by removal of the forest understory and thinning of the canopy to about 10 trees per acre. ``This system has preserved, to a considerable extent, the humid microclimate upon which many forms of life depend,'' he said. ``The canopies are almost continuous over large tracts and hold magnificent adult trees of a wide variety of species.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"

"78482"	"she"	"explained"	" The cardinal and her brother, she explained, had both been patients at the same cancer center here. After they were discharged, Cardinal Bernardin wrote Cruz's brother a note, encouraging him to keep battling his stomach cancer. Mario Cruz died last Wednesday, just a few hours before the cardinal. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"
"78880"	"he"	"explained"	" An added benefit of the souped-up pampers would be a cheaper price tag. Early detection of wetness, he explained, would reduce the need for expensive, absorbant filler in the diaper. Plus, the sensor would only cost about two-cents each to manufacture. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"

"79436"	"she"	"explained"	" Ms. Limkatos said that if members receive the government housing subsidy it is used to repay their loans. Their daily contributions alone, she explained, would never be enough to build a decent home _ even if the women build it themselves. Sweat equity will go only so far, she said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"
"79750"	"he"	"explained"	" Beyond money and mechanics, there is also substance. Bratton, now a security consultant, speaks with authority on crime-related issues. But asked in an interview last week about matters ranging from school governance to superstores, he declined to answer. He would, he explained, develop positions if he became a candidate. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"
"80261"	"he"	"explained"	" The main difference, he explained, is that they don't simply send an RNA copy out to produce the proteins that do the work. Instead, he said, the RNA copy is ``edited'' in an unusual but predictable way before being translated into a protein. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"

"80752"	"he"	"explained"	" After compiling a database of common Gulf War syndrome symptoms among ailing veterans, Nicolson said, he and his wife began to suspect the immediate cause was an unknown ``mycoplasmic infection.'' Mycoplasmas, he explained, are small micro-organisms related to bacteria, some of which can aggressively invade blood cells. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"
"80764"	"he"	"explained"	" Church &AMP; Dwight's baking soda toothpaste doesn't compete in the same category as Colgate Total, he explained, since it doesn't claim to help fight gingivitis. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"
"80900"	"he"	"explained"	" Cable companies must create appliances that operate reliably and continuously, he explained, so that consumers never have to worry about anything more serious than opening and closing a refrigerator door. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"
"80941"	"it"	"explained"	" The report also said there was no concerted effort to inform hospitals about the program. Such communication is needed, it explained, so officials will know to refer patients who are being discharged to the program. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"
"81446"	"he"	"explained"	" Thus, he explained, after single episodes of high-fat eating, instead of burning the excess fat for energy, the body stores it. The result is weight gain. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"
"81507"	"he"	"explained"	" Cable companies must create appliances that operate reliably and continuously, he explained, so that consumers never have to worry about anything more serious than opening and closing a refrigerator door. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"
"81571"	"he"	"explained"	" The store owners could not be charged with possession of stolen property, he explained, because the undercover agents were only pretending that the computers were stolen. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"
"81837"	"he"	"explained"	" Andy Atchison of Kansas City recently shopped at Toys R Us at 10 p.m. It's an ideal time to slip away from home, he explained, because the children have been put to bed. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"
"82129"	"he"	"explained"	" For more than 20 years this has been the cycle for Colapietro, who says that over that time he has never missed celebrating a Mass at Christmas or Thanksgiving. To do so would be shirking his responsibility, he explained, adding that preaching on Christmas was especially meaningful for him because it was the day on which his father died 11 years ago. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"
"82253"	"he"	"explained"	" He said a man called Nada Bradley ``would get food and bring it back to us.'' During the violence, he explained, ``he wasn't killed. They just shot his eyes out.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"
"82452"	"I"	"explained"	" Roy Riegels, I explained, is only the most famous player in Rose Bowl history, excluding Orenthal Simpson. A center and linebacker for California, Riegels is branded in memory for his blunder in the 1929 Rose Bowl, when he picked up a Georgia Tech fumble, lost his compass and ran 65 yards the wrong way. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"
"82629"	"he"	"explained"	" And another time: ``An acted play is a novel intensified.'' He was single-mindedly obsessed by the notion of the scene. As a novelist, he explained, he worked on ``absolutely scenic lines,'' and developed dialogue as it might be employed in a script, ``with the loose end as gross an impertinence on its surface, and as grave a dishonor, as the dangle of a snippet of silk or wool on the right side of a tapestry.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"
"82663"	"he"	"explained"	" Meanwhile, he explained, ``I'm in a damned delicate situation right now.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"82734"	"he"	"explained"	" But after World War II, immigration standards were unofficially relaxed to allow some of those SS guards in, Schultz said. During the Cold War, he explained, it was thought that those former members of Hitler's army could provide information about the Russian military. Also, Schultz said, it's possible that an SS guard could have gotten through the net because his papers were not completely examined. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

"82923"	"he"	"explained"	" Arieh Coll, the manager of the Fidelity Export fund, said several factors could combine to cause equities to perform poorly this year. Over time, he explained, stock prices rise because of growth in company earnings or gains in the multiples that investors are willing to pay. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"83252"	"he"	"explained"	" When the current charter was drafted in 1989, he explained, ``there was a distrust that was held for the council. Now, seven years later, I don't think anyone can objectively say that the council as an institution has been irresponsible when it comes to adopting the budget or anything else.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"83448"	"he"	"explained"	" He had intended to leave the Gewandhaus after its 250th-anniversary season, in 1994, he explained, but he agreed to stay through last year to continue fighting for the institution, as the government withdrew a subsidy of $1.3 million. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"83513"	"he"	"explained"	" ``I still believe that we have the most robust search engine,'' said Lee Rubin, a spokesman for the company. The QPAT data base allows users to search the full text of filings dating back to 1974, he explained, while the IBM system has a smaller data base that users can actually search. But the IBM system has the advantage of making drawings and other images included in the filings easily accessible, a feature QPAT lacks. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"84076"	"he"	"explained"	" What that work did, he explained, was to trace the fundamental chemical structure of nucleic acids _ the material that passes genetic characteristics from the mother cell to the offspring. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"84128"	"he"	"explained"	" Still, he doesn't hesitate to boast that, in his market research with his wife and two children over the Christmas holidays, he felt shortchanged by Disney World -- ``our biggest competition.'' Everything was a la carte, he explained, and ``my wife and I were exhausted'' at the end of the stay. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

"84193"	"he"	"explained"	" ``When you talk of financial crimes, you have to be careful,'' said Erwin Jenni, head of the extradition service at the Swiss Justice Department in Bern. In Switzerland, he explained, financial crimes involve fraud or embezzlement. Then there are so-called fiscal offenses, he said, which cover tax matters. ``We don't extradite for fiscal and customs offenses,'' Jenni said, a policy that allows Rich, who has been indicted in the United States on charges of evading $48 million in income taxes, to live in Alpine comfort in Zug. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"84442"	"he"	"explained"	" Levinson said the gap between his demand and the Mets' offer was so great that ``it led us to believe that the only chance we would have of bridging that gap was with a multiyear deal.'' A multiyear contract, he explained, gives both sides more room to maneuver. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"84551"	"he"	"explained"	" Not just any rape, he explained, with Miss Kotor listening silently, perhaps hearing the story for the first time, but the sex her father forced a young niece to engage in years ago. That act resulted in Miss Kotor's birth, the priest said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

"84945"	"he"	"explained"	" ``I've seen them at work, and these guys are smooth,'' Defillo said. A common means of pickpocketing, he explained, is for a thief to lift the wallet of someone in a long, crowded line and then pass it to an accomplice standing behind him. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"85534"	"he"	"explained"	" Lou Yacullo paced the deck of the USS Slater, nestled under the huge arcing hull of the USS Intrepid. The Slater is a destroyer escort, he explained, a tough little vessel armed to the gills that spent the last years of World War II knocking kamikazes out of the sky and submarines out of commission. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"85581"	"he"	"explained"	" History, he explained, offered many examples of cultural drought in the wake of a period of ``creative energy'' when the arts flourished. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"85598"	"he"	"explained"	" When he put down his paper, he explained, ``From the moment my mother brought me into this world she left.'' He described his mother as a footloose Jazz Age flapper who gave him to an aunt to raise. ``So many things can be said about leaving, but at the moment I don't have a lot of good news for us,'' he added. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

"85743"	"he"	"explained"	" Dinkins said that in discussing his own candidacy, he was throwing out the ball to see if anyone would swing at it. His decision would be based, he explained, on whether he concluded he had a better chance of defeating Giuliani than did any of the four announced Democratic candidates: Borough Presidents Ruth Messinger of Manhattan and Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx, along with the Rev. Al Sharpton and City Councilman Sal Albanese of Brooklyn. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"86347"	"he"	"explained"	" The pirates ``give us all a bad name,'' said Arnulfo Nova. But he agreed that the warning might be necessary. Last November, he explained, a man pointed a pistol at him, robbed him of 200 pesos, then pumped a bullet into his seat, narrowly missing him, when he attempted to take away the gun. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"86557"	"he"	"explained"	" But, he explained, ``I knew he liked to golf. I told him we had a reasonable chance that we could give him full function of that leg.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"86721"	"he"	"explained"	" Just last week, as Aeroflot's Flight SU 262 crossed over Belarus, the plane's navigator stepped out of the cockpit for a quick smoke in the passenger cabin. The deafening roar in the cabin of the aging Tupelov 154, he explained, was wind rushing in through the emergency door. He offered no explanation for the gasoline smell. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"86806"	"they"	"explained"	" The surviving family members were overjoyed after hearing Monday's verdict but they insisted that the awards, while more than welcome, were not the big issue in their civil action.

"86903"	"he"	"explained"	" Sheng made the trip, he explained, to find out what the orchestra could do. Indeed, the 47-member National Traditional Orchestra of China, led by Hu Bingxu, embodies a paradox: China has no tradition of symphonic orchestras; or if it does, the tradition began in the 1950s and is of laughably recent origin in a country where most traditions started millennia ago. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"

"87914"	"he"	"explained"	" What they do have now are enough scorers to beat the listless, the hopeless, the fellow lottery-bound. Jayson Williams walked off the floor early in Sunday's game and later announced he was done for the season due to his injured thumb. He played hurt 11 weeks, he explained, but the Nets ``have the horses'' now to get by without him. Unfortunately for them, this also means they have a lesser statistical chance for Duncan in the weighted and more crowded lottery. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"88117"	"she"	"explained"	" Pillsbury buys more than 5,000 ingredients from more than 1,200 vendors, she explained, and it is impossible for Pillsbury to keep track of which ones use genetically altered seed stock. ``It's a complex food chain that creates a lot of issues for us if we have to label,'' Harlander said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"

"88453"	"he"	"explained"	" House Majority Leader Dick Armey said the Republican leaders, now in their second term in power, are returning to the normal way of conducting legislative business.

"88593"	"he"	"explained"	" ``Good eating,'' Claude assured me about the barracudas, although I hadn't asked. They would be fried crisp and served with a spicy gravy, he explained, along with rice and beans cooked in coconut milk _ a true island feast. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199703.gz"
"88620"	"he"	"explained"	" The cost of renovating an existing structure, he explained, can be almost half that of building from scratch, but there simply are not many good sites available. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199703.gz"

"88687"	"he"	"explained"	" In an interview, he pointed out that both cancer cells and infectious organisms needed iron from their host to grow. Cancer cells can live in a semidormant state for a long time, he explained, but they cannot multiply without iron and oxygen from blood. He said smokers, asbestos workers and people who grind or weld steel, mine iron or paint with iron oxide powder could acquire high levels of iron in their lung tissues, increasing their risk of lung cancer. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199703.gz"

"88813"	"she"	"explained"	" Born in San Francisco into a well-to-do family, she divides her life into three parts. In a very protected early life, she explained, ``I was brought up beautifully without love.''

"89160"	"she"	"explained"	" ``Trailers are pulled behind a pickup truck,'' Huckabee said. ``We are not having a trailer on the mansion grounds.'' Nor is it, she explained, a mobile home, since the Huckabees are not going anywhere. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200007.gz"
"90101"	"he"	"explained"	" One way that museums can help educate, he explained, is by organizing exhibitions that are not designed exclusively to draw large crowds. ``I am convinced that shows that earn money should pay for shows that lose money,'' he said. ``I myself have done exhibitions that were not done for crowds, although of course one always hopes people will come.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"

"92126"	"she"	"explained"	" Handly, their teacher, said exposing her students to cutting-edge science had benefits far beyond whatever they learned in the lab. San Jose's Overfelt High, she explained, does poorly on state rankings. Many of its students read far below their grade level. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"
"92709"	"he"	"explained"	" The next time that starting slot comes up, though, next Saturday against Atlanta, Torre indicated, the pitcher very likely will be Knight, experienced or not. Mendoza, he explained, is more important in the bullpen, and anyway he will be on a 70- to 75-pitch limit in the Yankees' cautionary treatment of a pitcher coming back from shoulder surgery. Putting Knight in the rotation would give the Yankees two starting pitchers with a total of 10 major league starts (all Ted Lilly's) between them. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"92815"	"he"	"explained"	" Massey first learned he was infected in 1984, when he had an AIDS test as part of a research study. He was not surprised by the result, he explained, because of his hemophilia, and, like virtually every American with this genetic disease in the early 1980s, he was repeatedly exposed to HIV through the blood clotting factors made from pooled blood of donors. In those early years of the epidemic, before HIV was discovered and a blood test developed, infected donors could not be identified, so blood often contained the virus. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"93680"	"he"	"explained"	" In other words, the baby may indeed be allergic to various substances, but eliminating exposure to them is unlikely to clear up the eczema. Rarely is eczema brought on by allergens, Eichenfield said, though dust mites may occasionally be a trigger. Instead, he explained, eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is primarily a built-in hypersensitivity that goes along with other atopic conditions like asthma, hay fever and hives. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"93968"	"he"	"explained"	" ``It's not like we sit down and write up a blueprint of how the evening will go,'' said Birkel, 42, of their dinner parties. But, he explained, his wife can pick up on certain cues. ``She can be quite engaging,'' he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"94599"	"he"	"explained"	" Jacob Riis, a newspaperman who could recognize a good phrase, copyrighted the title ``How the Other Half Lives'' even before he wrote the book. Traditionally, he explained, ``the half that was on top cared little for the struggles, and less for the fate of those who were underneath.'' But now, Riis wrote in his 1890 book, there were missionaries (like himself) devoting lives of ``unselfish thought and effort'' to rescuing the lower half. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"

"95436"	"she"	"explained"	" In one scenario, she explained, wind from the west is kept aloft by an inversion layer created from coastal marine air. The fire east of the mountains burns below this layer, but with cooler mountain air above it. As the day heats up and the fire heats up, the cooler layer buffers and entraps the fire _ keeping the wind at bay. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"
"96182"	"he"	"explained"	" ``What we are doing, you might say, is Draconian, but our objective is to keep the entity alive,'' Wolf said.

"97574"	"he"	"explained"	" The Blockers framed the two 1,000-square-foot spaces that flank the front sidewalk with landscape timbers, and they ran winding limestone gravel pathways within. First they set in the larger specimens _ spineless prickly pear, yucca, ocotillo, maguey and cholla. The cholla has such wicked spines that they could plant only small specimens, later removing the super spiny teddy bear variety. Cholla spines have microscopic barbs, he explained, as well as a sheath that stays in the skin after they are removed. The Blockers have two of the quick-growing, many-branched cholla ``trees,'' which they prune at least twice a year. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"

"98447"	"she"	"explained"	" Rebecca Eisen, a labor and employment attorney at Brobeck, Phleger &AMP; Harrison in San Francisco, said a state labor standards and enforcement employee she was working with asked to be sent a fax instead of a letter.

"99088"	"he"	"explained"	" Mirabelle is the kind of character who could exist in every big city, he explained, but she would be different in New York. ``In Los Angeles, a girl can still make $6 an hour and have a place of her own,'' he said. ``Here it is three to a room.

The purpose, he explained, was to protect rare cacti. In 1999, the parties had their arbitration hearing before a British law professor, a Mexican law professor and former U.S. Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti. The panel unanimously held that Mexico ``failed to ensure a transparent and predictable framework for Metalclad's business planning and investment,'' violated NAFTA's Article 1105(1) and indirectly expropriated its investment, in violation of NAFTA Article 1110(1). </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"

"100548"	"he"	"explained"	" Remez served six years in the Israeli army, rising to become a captain of the paratroopers. His great-grandfather signed the Israeli declaration of independence, and his grandfather created the air force. True to his family roots, Remez, an activist with Peace Now, supports peace and a withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza partly because he sees that as the best way to ensure Israel's future as a democratic, Jewish state. Without it, he explained, ``there won't be a Jewish state that any Jew will be proud of, and there won't be a Palestinian state that any Palestinian will want to be a member of.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"100892"	"she"	"explained"	" Part of the rationale for blocking crash news, she explained, is that people in airports are a ``captive audience'' lacking ``the ability to turn the television off,'' as they could at home, to avoid seeing frightening images. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"100982"	"he"	"explained"	" For instance, he explained, water officials had not considered the possibility of someone putting pathogens into drinking water supplies. Rather, they had concentrated on treating natural water-borne bacteria. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"101055"	"he"	"explained"	" Hague insisted he had always been an actor, however much he had seemed to be totally immersed in music.

"101245"	"he"	"explained"	" That sting, he explained, is typical of C-enhanced compounds, which act as a mild irritant, causing the skin to retain water temporarily and puff out.

"101576"	"she"	"explained"	" Soon after the terrorist attacks, Barbara Heizer started mining her closet. ``I found myself saying, `What do I need that for? I've already got so much,''' said Heizer, a freelance editor and writer. Seated beneath a 1970s Andy Warhol portrait of her in her TriBeCa loft, Heizer wore a pair of decade-old Manolo Blahnik equestrian-style boots, a ``very old'' but revamped Donna Karan motorcycle jacket and a 1996 Chanel dress. For some time now, she explained, so-called vintage clothes have seemed to her ``much cooler than anything coming out in the stores.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"101706"	"he"	"explained"	" The citizens group's attorney, Speer, said the group had little choice but to sign once the Justice Department had decided to settle the case.

"101787"	"she"	"explained"	" She opens her story in 1867, she explained, because during the Civil War American artists had been cut off from Europe and had begun developing American subjects, notably landscapes. While this trend later led to the Hudson River School, the landscapes presented at the Paris exhibition were dismissed as bland and unsophisticated. Their self-confidence shattered, American artists by the thousands began heading to France to learn their trade. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"101799"	"he"	"explained"	" In an interview, Smith said he would pursue what he called ``two clear-cut priorities.''

"102185"	"she"	"explained"	" Bone tools were indicative of modern behavior, Brooks said, because their production required a ``higher level of planning and conceptualization than just knocking off flakes of stone.''

"102350"	"he"	"explained"	" As he prepared samples of wine, Bacci (as every other producer subsequently would do) perfumed the glasses by pouring in a half ounce or so of wine, then swirling and discarding it, before pouring the wine for serving. The idea, he explained, is to rid the glasses of any off-tastes _ one of numerous examples of how seriously the Tuscans take their wine. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"102515"	"he"	"explained"	" In a question-and-answer session with a few thousand people in Orlando, Fla., the president decided to pop the question to himself: ``Why are you having the opportunity to have a military tribunal?''

"102572"	"he"	"explained"	" Scores of young men and boys hovered outside the sheik's house Thursday, displaying a mood that was by turns festive and furious.

"102587"	"he"	"explained"	" AOL Time Warner, he explained, tried to portray itself as having the growth trajectory of a much smaller technology company, a pace that was simply unrealistic for a behemoth with $40 billion in annual sales. It promised that free cash flow, a common measure of the earnings power of a media company, would increase by 50 percent a year over the next few years. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"102642"	"he"	"explained"	" ``I said it wasn't just our professional duty but our patriotic duty to get the job done,'' he recalled. Here, he explained, was a Mexican company coming to Wall Street to raise funds from investors around the world _ a prime example of the global economy at work. ``This is something that the terrorists are trying to destroy,'' he said to the group.

"102980"	"he"	"explained"	" I'll never forget how I first learned that Gene Kahn killed Kennedy. It was a Saturday in the summer of 1993. In Massachusetts no less. I was interrogating a fidgety informer who spun a vivid account _ delivered to him, he explained, by a swarthy foreigner _ of an intricate assassination conspiracy and an ensemble cast that boasted mob hit men, Cuban emigres and Marilyn Monroe.

"103249"	"he"	"explained"	" When I asked the manager why the system had been programmed that way, he sheepishly admitted that his compensation was based on the average time required to handle customers' calls _ including the time they spent on hold _ and hanging up on callers was the only way to hit his targets.

"103299"	"he"	"explained"	" Many men, he explained, retire to their sheds to make things they could easily buy, for the same reason other men climb mountains: because they can. Consider Simon Jansen, a software engineer in neighboring New Zealand, who searched for a way to keep beer cold throughout daylong sessions in his suburban Auckland shed.

"107043"	"she"	"explained"	" At first, the speech was fairly well received, said Betty Glad, author of ``Jimmy Carter: In Search of the Great White House.'' Then Carter demanded resignations from his entire Cabinet and accepted those of four, reinforcing the idea, she explained, that he ``was still an outsider, even as president of the United States, and had to clean house.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"107338"	"he"	"explained"	" Wes Pringle, the group marketing director of oral care at Pfizer, supervised the design of the PocketPaks package, which he called particularly important. It had to be discreet and portable, he explained, and extremely small, which distinguished it from other products on the market. ``In the end, when we found that the product could fit into the small, front `fifth pocket' of a pair of jeans, we knew we were successful,'' he said. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020222.0200 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-GRAPHICS-BUDGET-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Here are the New York Times News Service Macintosh graphics scheduled for Saturday, 02/23/2002.

"107581"	"he"	"explained"	" Yellen disagrees. The population of modern Homo sapiens then was small and probably widely scattered, he explained, and so ideas and cultural practices might have been slow to travel among different groups. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"108310"	"he"	"explained"	" No message, he explained, could ever be free of ambiguity. As a result, ``we have no basis for the belief that any part of the message will be intelligible,'' he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"108350"	"he"	"explained"	" The birds ride the trains all the time, he explained, motivated not by sloth but by simple hunger and ignorance: When the trains are at the terminal being cleaned, for about 20 minutes, pigeons amble through the open doors, looking for unnoticed crumbs. But being pigeons, they do not listen for the announcement that the train is leaving, and the doors close on them. They ride generally for one stop, exiting as soon as the doors open again. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"108457"	"he"	"explained"	" Sperry said that a small pile of artificial hips and other artificial body parts found on the crematory property indicate that some bodies were cremated over the years. The metal parts, he explained, would not have burned during the cremation process. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"108522"	"he"	"explained"	" In December she met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that when 300 people were killed in a Moscow apartment bombing he wanted to strangle the terrorists with his bare hands. But, he explained, that was his immediate response and ``just emotion.'' No law-abiding society, he said, can govern itself on emotions. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"108595"	"he"	"explained"	" Goldrach's goal was to avoid cleaning the painting to the point that it seemed to be painted just yesterday. The achievement, he explained, is to retain the patina of age appropriate for a 17th-century painting. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"109118"	"he"	"explained"	" Typically there is a diagram, a cartoon actually, which consists of a giant U with an eyeball on top of one stem looking back at the other. The skinny unadorned end of the U is the Big Bang, he explained, tracing his finger along the loop. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"109214"	"he"	"explained"	" ``I don't know if it's therapeutic,'' Stone replied, ``but people always want to unburden themselves.'' A person, he explained, may tell a total stranger, ``You won't believe what just happened to me.'' People think ``suffering should mean something,'' he said. ``Otherwise, no degree of pain is of the slightest significance. The moral of suffering then is: Better you than me. And then we are in a hopelessly lonely and brutal world.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"109445"	"it"	"explained"	" He then handed me a brochure. The work, it explained, ``asks about the relationship between national trauma and the understanding of images.'' It ``shows portraits of Hitler and Duchamp,'' he said, adding: ``Not Hitler and Duchamp themselves, even if this is often implied casually. The portraits of Hitler and Duchamp have more in common with each other for the simple reason that they are both pictures, than a picture ever has with the person depicted. This sounds sophisticated but it is exactly the point.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"110109"	"she"	"explained"	" ``It's simply about accepting a man for his urges _ and that's all it's about, urges,'' she added. ``It's very odd. It was written around the time of Monica Lewinsky and Clinton. And it was written around the time that the question was being asked, `Why didn't Hillary leave him?''' Albee, she explained, told her once that the play was about ``the worst thing a man can tell a wife and have the marriage survive.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"110416"	"he"	"explained"	" The accident created a ripple effect, he explained, touching not just him, but his family and friends, people who have listened to him speak and people who have read about his story nationwide. He hopes now his lessons on forgiveness can reach as many people and is looking for a publisher. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"110445"	"he"	"explained"	" When someone reports abuse, he explained, a ``review of the report shall be undertaken to determine the validity of each claim. If the alleged claim appears substantiated, and after consultation with competent archdiocesan officials, the alleged perpetrator will be removed from any function, responsibility, or ministry until the matter is resolved.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"110519"	"she"	"explained"	" Some fear being institutionalized or becoming victims of elder scams, she explained, so they won't fill out the forms. They may be leery of sharing information with strangers, or, because of some impairment, may not be able to read or fill out the census form. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"110555"	"he"	"explained"	" The energy released from a one-ton bomb would instead diffuse on the surface, he explained, because bombs are designed to destroy things on the surface, not to shake the rock below. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"111311"	"he"	"explained"	" Last season was better, he explained, because all of the product he needed, he was able to get in local waters. When Texas oyster fishermen have to go to Louisiana waters for oysters, they generally aren't making any money, they are just keeping their customers happy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"111314"	"he"	"explained"	" Authorities, though, are not restricted to simply asking questions, Johnson said. For example, he explained, sometimes a person will be kept in a room or a house and subjected for a lengthy time to a ``good cop-bad cop'' routine by interrogators. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"111601"	"he"	"explained"	" ``It is a whole new price point acceptance,'' said Ross Klein, senior vice president for corporate marketing for Polo Jeans. His company's jeans, he explained, typically sell for $39 to $49, but fashion jeans start at $79 and go to $130. ``When we present real innovation, we have no problem selling through at the high prices,'' he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"112027"	"he"	"explained"	" (James Traub is a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine.) </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020410.0086 type=story > <HEADLINE> $ADV31 </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> When I was in fifth grade and was invited to become an altar boy, my father would not allow it.

"112417"	"he"	"explained"	" One December, asked what was on his wish list, Dennis O'Connor Sr. responded: ``I'd like the gift of time.'' Time with each of his children, he explained, for him and his wife, Charlene. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"112459"	"he"	"explained"	" His family had a military background, he explained, and he was angry about the way some Vietnam War activists had insulted returning veterans. Chesney spent two tours in Vietnam on a Navy construction crew. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"112615"	"he"	"explained"	" In his studies, Leibel said, he purposely recruits people who are obese but have no other health problems. That way, he explained, when he studies the effects of weight loss he reduces the likelihood that his data will be confounded by other disorders. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"112835"	"he"	"explained"	" (James Traub is a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine.) </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020417.0212 type=story > <HEADLINE> $ADV31 </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> When I was in fifth grade and was invited to become an altar boy, my father would not allow it.

"113500"	"he"	"explained"	" ``In spite of all the wars and political strife that surrounded me, I have lived a charmed life,'' he wrote in his memoirs, ``The Joy of Insight,'' published in 1991. That title held special significance for him, he explained, for it described what he spent his life pursuing successfully _ though modesty kept him from saying so _ whether in research, teaching, or public affairs. ``The joy of insight is a sense of involvement and awe, the elated state of mind that you achieve when you have grasped some essential point; it is akin to what you feel on top of a mountain after a hard climb or when you hear a great work of music.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"113609"	"he"	"explained"	" Upon hearing that, Wissel said, he knew what to do. Unless a program is uninstalled using the ``add/remove'' feature in the computer's Control Panel, he explained, pieces of that program will float around in the system, wreaking havoc. (Commercial uninstall programs will also do the job right.) So he properly uninstalled the unwanted programs to get rid of the detritus. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"113799"	"I"	"explained"	" I was bombing and still had an hour to go. Desperately I launched into a discussion of the timeline of innovation and how designers like Galliano must constantly create newness without losing brand recognition, how they must renovate a brand by inventing new signatures. Galliano, I explained, had done that brilliantly at Dior. He had reincorporated Dior's love of romance and femininity into his own postmodern love of music and street fashion. I queued video No. 2, Dior's recent ready-to-wear. Galliano is so global! Look at those Eskimos! And Samurais! And Mongolian mukluks! And look at those models! </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"114561"	"he"	"explained"	" But as Cameron, the 28-year-old Seattle center fielder, slugged four homers in four at-bats over the first five innings of the Mariners' 15-4 victory over the White Sox in Chicago on Thursday, he felt something wholly familiar _ a Little Leaguer's calm, he explained, without any concern about what had happened or what might happen next. ``I was just in another world,'' he said. ``For one night, I was as good as anybody has been in the game.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"114594"	"he"	"explained"	" Smoke, he explained, can drift into other apartments through ventilation systems. Besides, smoking can be a fire hazard. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"114757"	"he"	"explained"	" Those findings were not valid, Sloan said, because the researchers had failed to analyze their data according to established principles of statistics. When so many variables are in question, he explained, it is quite likely that chance alone will cause a few of them to appear significant. Scientists usually employ statistical formulas to ensure that none of the associations they find can be attributed to chance, but the researchers here failed to do that, Sloan said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"115218"	"he"	"explained"	" As a colleague once put it, Wolfram has ``stepped on a lot of toes.'' Tensions arose in many institutional settings before he set out on his own. In the early 1980s, there was even a court battle with Caltech over ownership of computer software designed by Wolfram. In addition, Wolfram noted, when he began his work on complexity he confidently expected others to follow through on his suggestions; instead, he bluntly said, without his leadership the field did ``horribly, horribly.'' Such frustrations, he explained, eventually persuaded him to design an alternative scientific career, founding his own company and pursuing his interests without any need for grants or support. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"115418"	"he"	"explained"	" Wolfgang Sawallisch, the orchestra's conductor, told The Philadelphia Inquirer, ``The first impression is an overwhelming one, a wonderful one.'' The musicians can hear one another clearly, he explained, which was not the case at the nearby Academy of Music, where the orchestra had played since its inaugural concert in 1900. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"115834"	"she"	"explained"	" Not everyone is in favor of mandatory disclosure. ``These types of arrangements should be confidential to the individual,'' Walker said. ``I don't see why an insider should have to disclose the details of the plan.'' Deadlines for insiders to report trades are set by Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, she explained, which the commission itself cannot change. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"116258"	"he"	"explained"	" Los Angeles Times food editor Russ Parsons explained in his book ``How to Read a French Fry'' (Houghton Mifflin, $25), that in order to achieve french fry perfection, one must start with a russet potato, preferably an old one. The truly committed will do a ``specific gravity'' test _ that is, float the cut fries in brine. The ones that sink will make the best fries. And real purists, he explained, swear by frying in horse fat. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"116374"	"he"	"explained"	" Among the elements it could include, he explained, are a battery powered heating and cooling system, night vision capability in the helmet and senors to permit medics to remotely monitor vital health signs. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"116532"	"he"	"explained"	" Forgiveness, Lapsley says, is a matter of choice, and since the American government ultimately responded militarily to the terror attacks, many Americans never examined any alternatives. Yet because so many worldwide shared in America's horror and grief over Sept. 11, he explained, ``Your pain has been acknowledged. That gives you freedom to take a position away from war and hatred and revenge.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"116537"	"he"	"explained"	" Forgiveness, Lapsley says, is a matter of choice, and since the American government ultimately responded militarily to the terror attacks, many Americans never examined any alternatives.

"116711"	"she"	"explained"	" In the 1950s and '60s, she explained, even the iris was touched by the country's fascination with space flight, as hybridizers created flowers with wild beards that thrust skyward, like a rocket. These were called Space Agers, and included Come to Me, Classy Chassy, Flight Commander and Trumpet Crescendo. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"116954"	"they"	"explained"	" The architects Christian Jabornegg and Andras Palffy sat outside a coffee house in the Judenplatz here this month talking about the granite paving stones under their feet. As the eye travels toward the center of the square, they explained, the stones grow slightly larger. It is a subtle game of forced perspective _ the kind of understated game they are known for. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"117042"	"she"	"explained"	" ``I didn't think I would get so emotional,'' she said afterward, as the women headed to a restaurant for lunch. The early days of free-wheeling breakdowns, she explained, have been replaced by brief outbursts, usually when Joe, 6, and Nina, 3, are out of the room. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"117130"	"he"	"explained"	" That instability is depressing business investment and weighing down the stock market, Palmisano said. Investors are not only focusing on fundamentals like a company's ability to generate cash, he explained, but they are also demanding sound strategy, skilled management and by-the-book accounting from companies. ``It is incumbent on business leadership to demonstrate that,'' Palmisano said, ``so our credibility will not be questioned.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"117206"	"he"	"explained"	" There is a price to be paid, however, for being able to lock in a low current rate for a number of months. Generally speaking, Winter said, that price translates into an interest rate increase of two to three ``basis points'' per month of rate lock. A basis point, he explained, is one-hundredth of a percentage point. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"117330"	"he"	"explained"	" Most of the details for Rumsfeld's trip _ from when he will be in South Asia to those with whom he will meet _ have yet to be finalized, the official said. Among the reasons for the uncertainty, he explained, are the schedules of officials in Pakistan and India and timing related to the mission of Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, who is visiting just before Rumsfeld's arrival. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"117347"	"he"	"explained"	" The outer range is uncertain, he explained, because of uncertainties in the abilities of geological activity on the planet to keep the planet warm. By some calculations, an increase of only 1 percent of the distance from the Sun would cause glaciers to envelop Earth, and indeed some scientists have suggested that Earth was a so-called snowball in its past when the Sun, according to standard astronomical calculations, would have been cooler. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"118196"	"he"	"explained"	" Ohler teaches the three-day free classes that Hinckley offers new jet boat owners. Some of the fastest learners, he explained, as he prepared a Talaria for a speed run in Boston Harbor, are children versed in video game stick control operation. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"119235"	"he"	"explained"	" Mostly, Simmons says, he hopes to energize people under 30 to become politically active and socially conscious. One way the Network plans to do that, he explained, is by starting a ``rap the vote'' media campaign with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and a literacy drive with the Urban League next month. Both will use hip-hop artists on radio and on television stations like BET and MTV and in classrooms. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"119709"	"he"	"explained"	" Murray L. Kurzman, a former FDA regional inspection chief in New York, said the bulk of his work involved writing letters, trying to get problem clinics to comply. Clinic owners knew they could take advantage of the agency's reluctance to crack down, he explained, adding that often ``it was like pulling teeth to get them to respond.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"119752"	"he"	"explained"	" Murray L. Kurzman, a former FDA regional inspection chief in New York, said the bulk of his work involved writing letters, trying to get problem clinics to comply.

"119780"	"she"	"explained"	" There are a handful of places around the country set up to handle ex-offenders _ halfway houses, homes for AIDS patients getting out of prison, treatment centers for convicted drug addicts _ but none are like the Castle, Page said. The difference, she explained, is that the Castle takes all comers. There is a screening process to get in, but the only real requirement is a willingness to change. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"119911"	"she"	"explained"	" Brinkema has gone out of her way to explain the nuances of the U.S. legal system to Moussaoui, an articulate former resident of Britain who earned a master's degree in international business from Southbank University in London. Brinkema politely and systematically overrode Moussaoui's objections and entered a plea of innocent on his behalf rather than allow the amateur lawyer to plead ``no contest'' to the six-count conspiracy indictment. That plea would have been tantamount to a guilty plea, she explained, and would carry punishment. Four of the six charges carry maximum penalties of execution. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"119949"	"he"	"explained"	" On Thursday afternoon, Diggins, a professor at the CUNY Graduate Center who had been serving as an informal adviser for the conference, said his objections were scholarly, not political. ``I'm not concerned about Cornel West's political point of view,'' he said by telephone from Laguna Beach, Calif., where he was attending a conference. ``I'm concerned about whether he has any point of view in matters of philosophy.'' West, he explained, did not have a reputation for coming to conferences prepared: ``In order to comment on Sidney Hook, one would have to read at least 20 of his books. Cornel West is such a celebrity intellectual, I don't think he'll have time for it.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"120194"	"she"	"explained"	" CUBA-JULY-4TH (Undated) _ For Vicki Huddleston, the Fourth of July is no day at the beach. Last Independence Day, Ms. Huddleston, the highest-ranking U.S. diplomat in Cuba, gave more than 600 guests at her Havana mansion short wave radios. The idea, she explained, was to make it easier for Cubans to listen to Radio Marti, the Miami-based, anti-communist station. Last week, Fidel Castro, in a speech to Cuban lawmakers, denounced the radios as ``subversive and destabilizing.'' The goal, Huddleston surmises, was to discourage her from giving out more radios this year. If so, it didn't work. By Fred Bernstein. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"
"120290"	"he"	"explained"	" One reason, he explained, was that his wife and three children are with him here. His son Luke, 3 in October, handed his father a water bottle during the warm-up period. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"
"120353"	"he"	"explained"	" Fish in a supercooled state have tissues so cold that they should freeze, he explained, but there are no seeds to start the crystallization process. ``If these fish should come into contact with ice, crystals would form, and they would die almost instantly,'' he said. ``However, midwater pelagic fishes,'' which live at medium depths in the open ocean, ``don't ordinarily come into contact with floating ice.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"
"120536"	"he"	"explained"	" Looking to the future, Gouttierre described himself as ``realistic, tending toward optimism.'' What must be understood, he explained, is that success for Afghanistan will be a long process with more disturbances along the way. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"

"120651"	"he"	"explained"	" The problem, he explained, is that Kipfer has no good alternative if she wants to prevent further bone loss. While there are effective drugs for osteoporosis, known as bisphosphonates, he worries about giving one to a 56-year-old woman who would have to take it for decades to prevent her bones from deteriorating. These are drugs, like Fosamax and Actonel, that protect against osteoporosis by permanently binding to the surface of bone and slowing the activities of osteoclasts, cells that break bone down. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"
"121285"	"she"	"explained"	" Her research, she explained, is endlessly fascinating. ``How can something so random work so well,'' she observed. ``The brain is just a hack.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"
"121678"	"she"	"explained"	" I didn't ask the question that immediately came to mind, but she guessed it and answered anyway. ``No, I didn't.'' But she said it wasn't easy. Some of the kids, she explained, even made up stuff about their families so they would be rewarded for their patriotism. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"121686"	"he"	"explained"	" ``When I went to medical school in 1963, human evolution looked like a ladder,'' Wood said. The ladder, he explained, stepped from monkey to modern human through a progression of intermediates, each slightly less apelike than the previous one. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"121970"	"she"	"explained"	" ``At a lot of these parties you feel more relaxed. You're with your best friend; you have a glass of wine; the salespeople aren't as ambitious,'' Baltatzidis said. In fact, she explained, despite being a serious, well-informed shopper when stone-cold sober, she always seems to find just the right thing with cocktail in hand. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"122153"	"she"	"explained"	" Soni was not oblivious to the politics of her new home. ``If Arafat and Sharon will stay at home we will run the states and everything will be fine _ the small people,'' she said. But in the meantime, she explained, ``my political point of view is money.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"122331"	"he"	"explained"	" ``We went after women who were natural networkers,'' Rondina said of his recruiting efforts. The concept, he explained, is to tap well-connected women, primarily from the Junior League, to sell to their peers. ``We look at demographics, and we find people in towns where there are a considerable number of people with an income of above $150,000 a year,'' he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"122807"	"he"	"explained"	" ``I can't afford it,'' explained Mohammad Sajjad, a factory worker who recently asked Jameel to repair a front tooth damaged in a fight two and a half years ago. The pain, he explained, had started to bother him. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"122951"	"she"	"explained"	" This way, she explained, excess breading is deposited in the first vat, and the oil in the second vat, where the clams spend the rest of their brief culinary life, stays cleaner and fresher.

"123333"	"he"	"explained"	" Kaiser said his motto was ``Great work, well marketed.'' Perhaps most important after producing good work, he explained, is making the institution a place that people talk about. ``It elevates the way people think about the Kennedy Center,'' he said. ``It's not all about selling tickets to a show. It's about creating a profile.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"123357"	"he"	"explained"	" Bjorkman is ranked No. 48 in the world in singles, and was once as high as No. 4, in 1997. Growing up in Sweden playing soccer and hockey, he explained, he loves the team concept and wants the younger players to play both singles and doubles simultaneously. The rewards in that, however, are questionable. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"123493"	"he"	"explained"	" On a return visit several nights later, a waiter gave us a punctuation lesson. The tilde formerly used over the ``n'' in the bistro's name was dropped, he explained, because the word (a tupina is a traditional cooking vessel) is French and not Spanish. He also pointed out a tiny balcony, barely big enough for two, that opens off the dressier dining room. We grabbed it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"

"124186"	"he"	"explained"	" The airplane hijackings that took place last year were unlike any of those events because, as Dr. William Schlenger, author of the first national study of posttraumatic effects, put it, ``the choice of the World Trade Center as a target maximizes indirect exposure.'' In the real-time moment when the towers collapsed, he explained, Americans watching television in Omaha experienced the kind of horror that has been reserved for eyewitnesses. Fear was established in the most unlikely people.  `Listening to his brain' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"

"125388"	"he"	"explained"	" As a Marxist, however idiosyncratic, Adorno believed that music should be politically ``progressive.'' That meant, he explained, that it had to speak about suffering and its origins in bourgeois society without lunging into sentimentality or straining at transcendence or seeking distractions. For Adorno, the pained expressionism of Schoenberg's music was truth-telling, while the technologically crisp creations of Stravinsky were not. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"125610"	"he"	"explained"	" Instead, he explained, he had faith in the power of art to transcend the moment. ``The first time you see a photograph of a fireman crying, you are shocked. But if you see the same picture over and over and then as an advertisement for a politician, it's beginning to be corrupted. What I am trying to do is go back to the original emotions and create something out of time, the way great art ought to.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"125987"	"he"	"explained"	" The company's earnings have been growing steadily _ from 1.90 euros per share in 2000 to 3.30 euros projected for 2002 _ because of successful upgrades of existing models, Tyler said. Those upgrades have created a surge in sales, he explained, and with minimal capital costs. ``When you build products that sell for high prices and don't require customization,'' he said, ``profit margins are significant.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"

"126514"	"he"	"explained"	" ``I don't really get excited until it becomes a Category 2 or 3 hurricane,'' said the Rev. Willie Bishop, 66, as he picked up lumber and other building supplies at a Lowe's store in the New Orleans suburb of Metairie. The material was not to board up windows, he explained, but for a home-repair job. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"126604"	"he"	"explained"	" For all the talk of falling barriers _ 4 percent of the faculty is black, including two vice chancellors _ some African-American students and professors questioned how much longer it would be before, say, a black man or woman is named the university's chancellor.

Instead of getting in the car and battling traffic westward, he explained, a person could now hop onto the light rail, get off at Hoboken and take a regular train.

"127076"	"it"	"explained"	" The Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation had it just about right in a recent analysis when it noted how the latest energy initiative turns conventional market economics on its head. A market economy, it explained, normally encourages participants to take 50 cents' worth of resources and turn them into a dollar's worth of output, adding value in the process. Conversely, the tax credits and subsidies in the energy bill encourage taking a dollar's worth of inputs and transforming it into 50 cents' worth of output. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"

NEW YORK _  Dear Diary:  My husband and I were in Manhattan recently visiting our daughters, who are college students. My elder daughter and I were waiting for my husband outside a Midtown restaurant between Seventh and Eighth avenues.  While we were standing there, a woman walked into the restaurant, and a few minutes later she came back out. She looked both ways down the street and then, pointing east, asked us what street was the next intersection. My daughter politely said Seventh Avenue. She then inquired what was after that intersection, and my daughter said Sixth Avenue.  The woman then turned around and faced the other direction. All the while, a man had been standing in the restaurant doorway, apparently listening to the woman. Looking toward the Hudson River, she asked what was in that direction. Without missing a beat, the man said, ``New Jersey and California.''  Seemingly satisfied, she walked back into the restaurant.  _ KAY HARRIS  Dear Diary:  I was walking to my girlfriend's apartment in Midtown, carrying a new globe in my hands. Four times, someone walked up to me, spun the globe, pointed to a spot and said, ``This is my home country.''  _ BRIAN JOSEPH  Dear Diary:  Some of the happiest times of my life were spent in New York City in the late 1970s and early '80s. Among a thousand wonderful memories, this is my favorite example of New York wit:  A splendid, sunny autumn day. Fifth Avenue, across from St. Patrick's. A well-built young man in his early 20s, naked to the waist, blue jeans and sneakers and full-size professional boxing gloves. He is sparring with a lamppost at the curb and using full force with every blow he lands.  Those of us walking by eye him warily, but do not interfere. As I stop at the next corner for a red light, two businessmen beside me also stop. One says dryly to the other, ``Ten bucks on the lamppost to win.''  _ DONNA MacDONALD  Dear Diary:  The recent death of the Broadway lyricist Adolph Green reminded me of my favorite New York celebrity sighting.  I was in a bookstore on the Upper West Side, browsing through the new-nonfiction section, when I heard a woman's voice nearby calling out an ascending series of numbers.  I went around the corner and there was Green. His companion, a woman presumably with better vision and hearing than his, had a book open at its index and was shouting page numbers into his ear. Upon reaching the last one, the woman put the book back on the shelf, and she and Green wandered off contentedly.  I walked over to see the object of their interest. It was a new book about the composer Leonard Bernstein. I looked at the index and saw that the page numbers the woman had been shouting into the aging lyricist's ear all appeared under the entry, ``Green, Adolph.''  _ STEVAN ALBURTY  Dear Diary:  Five-year-old Ruby gave her grandparents a preview of her Halloween costume _ a fairy-princess gown, complete with magic wand, which she said had the power to make wishes come true.  When Grandpa asked if it could grow hair on his head, Ruby gave it a moment's thought.  ``Yes,'' she said with assurance, and ceremoniously touched his head with her wand.  Grandpa then asked, ``Well, do I have hair now?''  Ruby replied, ``Yes, but it's invisible.''  _ BARBARA LAUFER  Dear Diary:  Fortunately, good security does not preclude a quick wit.  On a recent trip out of Newark Liberty Airport my carry-on bag was pulled out and vigorously searched until my medical reflex hammer (obtained at a recent conference and left in the suitcase) was found.  The metal handle had generated the prompt response from the security team.  On my return trip I kept the hammer in my pocket and showed it to the security guard, explaining that I didn't want to leave it in my bag and cause any more excitement.  To which the guard responded, ``Oh, it was just a knee-jerk reaction to what they saw on the screen.''  _ Dr. DAVID E. MANDELBAUM  Dear Diary:  The other day, as I passed Bloomingdale's on Third Avenue, I noticed a tyke in a stroller facing the display window. A woman I assumed to be the grandmother was talking excitedly to the child while gesturing toward the window. I then looked at the window. It was a farm scene with a full-size model of a cow and life-size cowhands.  As I caught Grandma's eye, she explained, ``We're having a trip to the country.''  _ GRACE CAMPBELL  Dear Diary:  After a tiring, busy day in Manhattan, shopping and visiting my pregnant daughter, I was on the escalator at Grand Central Terminal, hurrying to catch the 8:37 back to Connecticut.  As I rode up, I noticed a man riding the down escalator who was wearing a plaid wool scarf identical with the one I had on, and tied in the same fashion. He must have noticed the coincidence, too.  As we neared each other, going in opposite directions, we both nodded and smiled in acknowledgment. Suddenly, as we passed, he leaned over, handed me a bouquet of fresh pink and yellow roses, and said cheerfully, ``Here you go.''  He was gone before I could even stammer my astonished thanks. Clutching my roses, I said aloud, ``I love New York.'' My amused fellow riders chuckled and beamed, and I smiled all the way home.  _ DIANA BELL  Dear Diary:  The arrival of the new theater season prompted the recall of this New York tale:  On a bitter night several winters past, a friend and his wife left a Broadway theater and headed for the parking garage on West 46th Street where they'd left their car. A slightly built man stood on the corner, trying in vain to hail a taxi. It was Hume Cronyn.  Snow had begun to fall. My friends approached the actor and offered him a ride. He thanked them but said no, he'd wait for a taxi.  My friend retrieved his car, and driving past that same corner, saw the unsuccessful Cronyn still waving at passing taxis. He pulled over and repeated his offer. This time Cronyn accepted, and signaled to a huddled figure in a doorway to join them. Seeing that it was Jessica Tandy who approached, my friend, the would-be chauffeur, exclaimed, ``My God, I'm driving Daisy!''  _ HARVEY WIDELL </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20021118.0017 type=story > <HEADLINE> ELLISON OBEYS AN ORDER, AND ORACLE RESPONDS BY WINNING </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> AUCKLAND, New Zealand  (BC-YAC-AMERICA'S-CUP-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"131727"	"he"	"explained"	" Moreover, he explained, because much of Colorado is a semiarid landscape that will not naturally support trees, the added ``biodiversity'' has made the area extremely vulnerable to fire. In a more sparse, unpopulated landscape, fires can serve to regenerate the soil, but in a populated area with lots of trees, fires can spread more easily and become much more dangerous, as they have become in recent summers in the Western United States. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"

Dreary, those, but they didn't suppress the gregarious spirit of Henry McCleary. We found the 50-year-old Belfast native seated in one tiny tenement, wearing period clothing and reading a newspaper beside a warm turf fire. Turf, he explained, is what peat is called when it's cut for burning. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"

"131947"	"he"	"explained"	" ``The brain is an opportunistic sleeper,'' said Richard Gelula, executive director of the foundation. If a person is sleep-deprived, he explained, the brain will lapse into sleep at the first sedentary chance it gets _ in front of the television, at a concert or play, while driving a motor vehicle. ``Let's face it, driving is not an exciting activity for the brain,'' he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"132678"	"he"	"explained"	" Vesey, he explained, was a freed black man and chief organizer of a rebellion that was prevented when two house slaves in Charleston warned their master about it. Vesey was hanged along with 34 other conspirators. ``After that, all the whites were fearful for their lives, and that is why they placed spikes all over the place as a deterrent,'' said Brown. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"133053"	"he"	"explained"	" Annual bonuses, Englizian added, are ``not a significant portion of the cash pay, and that reflects that we're a company with a research and development culture.'' Software products, he explained, can take a few years to develop and bring to market, so bonus criteria are not always linked to company profits. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"133431"	"he"	"explained"	" He successfully brushed off five would-be tacklers as he bolted to the right. The key to having them touch your jersey without bringing you down, he explained, is stay low. One of the reasons the Cowboys called up Dantzler from the practice squad a couple of weeks ago is because he is a workout junkie and has more strength to break tackles than Reggie Swinton. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"133719"	"he"	"explained"	" Many Chinese, he explained, believe that in a temple, the souls of their ancestors will be constantly accompanied by the deities (who reside in the temples) and so will feel less lonely. In addition, the blessings bestowed upon the dead by gods will shorten their stay in the painful underworld and give them a chance to either be reborn or ascend to heaven faster. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"133762"	"he"	"explained"	" But Mottola, a former manager who got his start representing the rock duo Hall and Oates, did offer this during the interview: Record labels, he explained, spend millions developing and marketing artists whose careers peak after only three albums. So Mottola wants companies like Pepsi, part of PepsiCo, and Chrysler, part of DaimlerChrysler, to help pay to market and promote them. He also wants Sony to have a part of whatever revenue an artist now keeps from touring, selling T-shirts and making movies. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"134221"	"he"	"explained"	" Pluck a guitar string, he explained, and a wave propagates along it. Shorten the string, and there is a shorter path, a changed frequency of the waves, and a higher pitch. ``But instead of plucking a guitar, I pluck the Internet,'' Chafe said _ by sending pulses down a network path. The round trip of the pulses governs their pitch: for instance, the shorter the delay, the shorter the path and the higher the pitch. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"134712"	"he"	"explained"	" ``In the old days, (limited partners) got their money back before the sharing happened,'' said Jim Barrett, partner and co-chair of the private equity department at the Boston law firm Palmer &amp; Dodge. The danger in sharing too soon, he explained, is, ``If you have early winners and later losers, which is not an atypical dynamic, then it's quite likely that the VC is going to be overdistributed.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"134805"	"he"	"explained"	" Now that digital technology is no longer a novelty, Sony is seeking to give a new group of consumers, mostly women in their 20s and early 30s, an incentive to buy, Malcolm said. These are women, he explained, who are not likely to wear the camera but may tote it like a compact in their bags. Unlike the compact, a relic of a more self-consciously elegant age, the camera ``might actually be useful,'' said David Wolfe, an analyst at the Doneger Group, a New York retail consulting company. Selling it like a jewel is ``Marketing 101,'' Wolfe said, adding somewhat cynically: ``Make it pretty and women will buy it. Who cares if you know how to work it or not.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"135258"	"he"	"explained"	" The main motivation for considering VSL theories, Magueijo explained, comes from the as-yet undiscovered quantum gravity. In relativity there is only one special number, the speed of light, but in quantum gravity, he explained, there is another special number, known as the Planck energy, equivalent to 1019 billion electron volts. According to quantum gravity thinking, an elementary particle accelerated to that energy will behave as if space and time themselves are lumpy and discontinuous and all the forces of nature are unified. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"135299"	"he"	"explained"	" ``I'm kind of messed up now,'' the 19-year-old said. A childhood friend, he explained, was being laid to rest in Youngstown. The young man had died of multiple gunshot wounds. His funeral coincided with the news conference being held in a plush hotel a world away. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"135497"	"he"	"explained"	" The caliphs of the Ottoman Empire carried out no fewer than 72 massacres against the Yazidis in the 18th and 19th centuries alone, he explained, with the faithful slain by the thousands in the lettuce fields then dotting northeastern Iraq. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"135979"	"he"	"explained"	" Fulford's apple crop was munificent this year, despite a severe drought, and he attributes much of this to compost tea sprayed four times during the growing season. In dry years, he explained, there is not always enough water to carry up needed minerals from the soil. By spraying on bacteria that have predigested essential minerals, the foliar application saved the day. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136035"	"he"	"explained"	" He described a simple way of disguising the severity of injuries from OSHA: ``I'd go to the hospital and get guys out of bed or a wheelchair to avoid a lost-time incident.'' Even if the worker sat in an office all day, he explained, McWane could still claim that his injury had not required him to miss work. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136622"	"he"	"explained"	" The man who spoke up, Andrew Ragouzeos, 24, was a reporter covering the event for The Bronx Times Reporter. Later, he explained, ``I really wanted to say something, since no one else was saying anything.'' Only one other person testified at that meeting. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"

"137158"	"he"	"explained"	" ``I think, to begin with, you have to have a face _ a U.S. face, a government interagency face _ for every ministry,'' the official said. Those ministries, he explained, would likely fall into four categories: some would be dismantled, some would be turned over quickly to Iraqis and the handoff would take a little longer for others. His fourth ca|2#59 ;7:621203271429:40:;7:6212243341:6::7::977;29 He cited defense as an example, and said they might come under an international agency or another outside entity. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200303.gz"
"137356"	"he"	"explained"	" Little said he will be prepared to begin using his relief crew from the sixth inning on. He will use them, he explained, based on the other team's lineup and the amount of rest each pitcher has had. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200303.gz"
"137596"	"he"	"explained"	" The Armenian developer said he paid ``about the same amount of money'' to his 60 North Korean workers as to Russians with the same skills. The advantage to him, he explained, ``is that the Koreans do a greater volume of work.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200305.gz"
"138280"	"he"	"explained"	" Joe Pantoliano revealed a layer beneath his cocky persona when he was named outstanding supporting actor in a drama. His voice choked with emotion as he thanked Gandolfini. Backstage, he explained, ``The whole thing was a complete surprise. I haven't been paying attention (to Emmy campaigning).'' Then, smiling, he clarified news reports about his ``Sopranos'' character: ``I wasn't whacked: A whack is a mob-sanctioned hit. I was murdered in cold blood.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200309.gz"
"138281"	"she"	"explained"	" Tyne Daly, named best supporting actress in a drama for ``Judging Amy,'' thanked her late co-star Richard Crenna: ``I first met him in the '70s and I liked him immediately; I had the honor of working with him at the last, and by that timebI loved him dearly.'' Backstage, she explained, ``They decided the honorable thing to do was to let his character die, too. It was not a very happy assignment for any of us.''

"138434"	"she"	"explained"	" The first volume is highlighted by an over-the-top set piece in which the Bride takes on dozens of O-Ren Ishii's black-suited, sword-wielding yakuza. However, Liu doesn't think that ``Kill Bill `` is violent. Rather, the violence becomes a character in the film, she explained, describing it as a dialogue that Tarantino creates without words. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200310.gz"
"138541"	"he"	"explained"	" To some extent, he explained, the rite is weakened. ``There's a hypersensitivity to words, how certain words become used to include or exclude. I don't like to see this happening. From my perspective, I think this 'under God' issue is a blip, a tiny blip on a very large screen. The politics of the moment is making it a greater issue. Whatever the court decides, years from now we'll look back and it will be a blip.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200310.gz"
"138668"	"he"	"explained"	" Transformers take electricity from high-voltage power lines and reduce its potency in order to route it safely to residential and commercial buildings, Clendenin said. The transformers are not expected to go into full use until summer, he explained, as utility workers connect them to local power wires and cables. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200311.gz"
"139068"	"he"	"explained"	" Dulaimi, the date farmer who was praying at the mosque Friday, said he will eagerly turn to the council for guidance. Although Hussein's regime repressed all Islamists, he explained, Sunnis enjoyed some protection. ``No one is on our side now,'' he said. ``So we want to represent ourselves.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200401.gz"
"139120"	"she"	"explained"	" Last year, they passed on a table they liked because of qualms about the money, Lehv said. This year, she explained, as Lehv hit the floor to measure the $13,500 three-leaf American campaign-style table they had just committed themselves to, ``the moment seems more right to buy.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200401.gz"
"139843"	"he"	"explained"	" Earlier, Kerry had said he voted against the bill because he thought the war and reconstruction should be financed by rolling back part of the Bush administration's tax cut. That, he explained, was why he had voted for the $87 billion appropriation when it included an amendment demanding that the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans be reversed, then against it once that provision was stripped. His explanation has been mocked as a flip-flop by Republicans and featured in their campaign commercials. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"140581"	"he"	"explained"	" I'm just here for the gift bag, admitted Dick as he left. Of the studded leather collar around his neck, he explained, I was wearing a tie, but someone gave this to me, so I put it on. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"140792"	"he"	"explained"	" Some of the acclaim stems from the sheer scope of the orchestra's transformation. Gillinson, who grew up in Brighton, joined the London Symphony as a cellist in 1970. In 1984 he put down his instrument and took over the management of the orchestra, a self-run collective of its musicians, because, he explained, someone had to do something. A move to the Barbican, to a hall that audiences hated, had drained the orchestra's finances, while a long-standing attitude of entitlement among the musicians created a parallel drain in creativity and passion, London critics say. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"

"140895"	"she"	"explained"	" Gyro-gyro, Kalivas said with a laugh. The expression, she explained, translates to walking around and around, the motion evoking the circling spit of lamb used to make the popular sandwich. Kalivas and her teammates had been mesmerized, she noted, by the people-watching, the pin trading, the international dining, the moviegoing, the nightclubbing (sans alcohol) and the e-mailing that was going on among athletes from Argentina and Botswana to Yemen and Zimbabwe. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"141139"	"he"	"explained"	" The idea, he explained, was to pull out of areas densely populated by Palestinians and make sure that Israel constructs boundaries that ensure a stable Jewish majority. That is why the Gaza Strip, with its relatively isolated settlements, was the first chosen for unilateral disengagement and why populous suburban settlements like Maale Adumim will be embraced as part of Israel. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"

"141722"	"he"	"explained"	" Kefdas said he hoped the rest of the world would not be disappointed in Greece, either. The Greeks, he explained, have much to offer beyond being founders of the Olympic Games and their most recent host. They have this beautiful island and many more like it, and the right mind set to appreciate them. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"141841"	"he"	"explained"	" For the Olympics, he explained, a new highway was built that connects Lavrio to Athens. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"142075"	"he"	"explained"	" Alexander, he explained, did not exact revenge after his conquests, at least not beyond what was required to consolidate his dominion. As he marched across Egypt, Persia and India, he sought to integrate West and East, defying the cultural purity preached by the ancient Greeks. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"142129"	"he"	"explained"	" Kid Rock, the Detroit-born rap artist who is a member of the spiky clump of George W. Bush supporters in the wonderful world of entertainment, trumpeted his support for the president Wednesday night at the recording-industry party for Sen. Bill Frist, the majority leader, and Dennis Hastert, the House speaker. The Kid, as he is called, was wearing a black Western-style bowler hat with a rhinestone band over his sweat-drenched stringy blond hair. He jumped right into an elaboration of his own considered brand of Republicanism. If he were president, he explained, he would never get caught having sex in the Oval Office, but would instead install cameras in the Lincoln Bedroom. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"142271"	"he"	"explained"	" If you are trying to beat them, you only have one throw that will work, said Benjamin Stein, a 25-year-old computer programmer in New York. If you play a defensive game, you have two throws. You can either tie or beat them, and you are successful. Draws are valuable, he explained, because they give you the chance to get more information about your opponent's mindset and strategy. If I could eliminate one of my opponent's three possible next throws, Stein said, I had a pretty good shot at staying alive. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"

"143441"	"he"	"explained"	" It's all timing, said Jeff Streichhirsch, a puller holding tight to Gilfether's elastic rein. A lot of his job, he explained, has to do with minimizing the slack in the bungee as Gilfether rises and falls, so she isn't the victim of an unexpected catapult. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"144130"	"he"	"explained"	" It's a gray with a lot of beige in it, so it's like a stone color, a very soft stone, he said. In the entryway Ryskamp put an intricately patterned William Morris wallpaper, which, he explained, emphasized rather than detracted from, the small pictures hung there. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"144206"	"he"	"explained"	" Williams has played in every postseason game the Yankees have played under Torre, and he knows what it means to take an early series lead. The issue, he explained, is believing that every game is essential. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"144727"	"he"	"explained"	" We are looking for a new audience, an audience that doesn't go to the theater, Rosenberg said recently here. He was one of 10 theater students at the Central School of Speech and Drama here who started the company six years ago to create nontraditional, site-specific performances that involve the audience. In Dance Bear Dance, for instance, the audience becomes part of the unfolding conspiracy to blow up a nameless enemy. So, he explained, we would be really shooting ourselves in the foot if we went to perform in a theater where the experience would be going to the National. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"145083"	"she"	"explained"	" Exports have been strong and continue into the fourth quarter, when they normally would start to weaken, said Kathy Hall, an editor of the Platts Petrochemical Report.

"145085"	"she"	"explained"	" Fifty percent were not eligible because the victim knew the defendant, a circumstance that shortens the statute of limitations to five years under state law. In 20 percent, the police paperwork was not available (many of the rapes, she explained, took place in housing projects, which were policed by a separate agency until 1995). In another 20 percent, the victims would not cooperate. And in 10 percent, the victim could not be found or had died. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"145459"	"he"	"explained"	" Every few steps, he stopped to identify native plants, of which many are to be found only in Madagascar. Many of the plants, he explained, had medicinal or other practical uses. He pointed out one that helped with headaches, another with asthma, a third in stopping the flow of blood from cuts. In trees and bushes, he pointed out a cuckoo roller, its wings colored bright green and red. He spotted a dozen bush larksand two male Madagascar paradise flycatchers that chased each in the undergrowth. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"145463"	"he"	"explained"	" The object, he explained, was to cut operating costs and sell Komag's disks at competitive prices.

"146691"	"he"	"explained"	" It's the one, said Chris Goodman, chief test driver for the Mercedes SLR McLaren supercar, who has spent many hours driving the Nuerburgring. The roller coaster qualities of the track, he explained, make it the ultimate template for German cars. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"146697"	"he"	"explained"	" The preparation was recognized as a traditional dish of Yorkshire as early as 1577, when William Harrison wrote about the mealtime traditions and foods of the various social classes of England.

"147038"	"he"	"explained"	" His mother, he explained, died when he was 11 and his working father left Scardino largely on his own to navigate his community, Venice Beach, which was then infested with gangs. Scardino found a safe haven at the Boys Club of Santa Monica. At the well-equipped club, he played basketball with the children of Jerry West, then a star of the Los Angeles Lakers, and became a young table tennis champion. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"147653"	"he"	"explained"	" That trail, he explained, was toward healthy German self-esteem. Before, it was Deutschland uber alles -- Germany above everything, he said.

Everybody's very embarrassed to be German. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"

At first he was a passive investor, he explained, but when the company hit some turbulence, he parachuted in. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"148295"	"he"	"explained"	" When the seafloor erupted from the quake, he explained, the geometry of the Sumatran fault should have first produced a negative wave (a decline in sea level) on the Indonesian side of the fault and a positive wave sent toward Sri Lanka first -- at some 500 mph. A tsunami is a series of both negative and positive waves, but Sri Lanka should have been hit first by a positive wave. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"

"148569"	"he"	"explained"	" Bush, he explained, did not plan to keep records and hold countries accountable for specific things -- for example, by counting the number of dissidents released, many of whom can be re-arrested the next day.

"149000"	"she"	"explained"	" They'd been mobbed when they left the Hilton, she explained, and then the ET crew made Paris emerge from the car twice to get a better shot. Poor thing, her mom said, she was cold in the night air. To make things worse, under her Elie Saab gown she had a big bruise from a snowboarding accident at Sundance a few days before, an injury somehow intensified by the long dress.

"149954"	"she"	"explained"	" The Super Bowl boosted sales, particularly in the discount sector, said Schechter, explaining that the event led customers to stock up on party goods and football paraphernalia. Because of the late Super Bowl, she explained, these sales were not recorded until February. (Other analysts credited the game with lifting Target's numbers, in particular, by 9 percent, well past a 6.4 percent estimate.) </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"

"150398"	"she"	"explained"	" In their written comments, she explained, they said things like I really hate it when the theory of evolution is presented as fact, or I don't agree with their presentation of human existence. She said one viewer described the film as anti-creationist propaganda. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"150630"	"he"	"explained"	" The play, he explained, is a tribute to the producing gene. Producers usually don't get credit when a film succeeds, he said, yet they usually have to carry the movie longest. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"151531"	"I"	"explained"	" So, in 1999, I told Jackie she had lung cancer. Chemotherapy could prolong her life, I explained, but the disease was fatal. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"151609"	"he"	"explained"	" I had the good fortune to spend half a day touring the villages of Essex with Malcarne, a lifelong resident who taught archeology and the history of architecture for many years at Wesleyan University in Middletown. Villages are demographic rather than political entities, he explained, built around a geographic or economic commonality. While under the same municipal government, Essex, Centerbrook, and Ivoryton each has a post office and ZIP code and a Main Street. There are libraries in Ivoryton and Essex. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"151796"	"he"	"explained"	" Obviously, he explained, it's not healthy to deprive an animal of the oxygen it needs to breathe. But, Roth said, his team found that it can be healthy if you reduce the oxygen immediately to a level so low the animal stops breathing -- or engaging in any other metabolic activity. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"151797"	"he"	"explained"	" It is when the oxygen levels aren't low enough that you get damage, he said. If the oxygen levels are too low for respiration but high enough to allow metabolic activity, he explained, the cells continue to struggle to do their business and suffer. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"152415"	"she"	"explained"	" Seven months into the separation I received a call from my lawyer. Are you sitting down? she asked. My husband, she explained, was seeking full custody of our children on the grounds that I was an unfit mother. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"152453"	"he"	"explained"	" The thought of turning a four-year-old loose with a pair of pruning shears was not pretty, so we struck a deal. I'll clip and you carry the trimmings to the brush pile. Okay? After a fair amount of cogitation, he decided that would work so he picked up two branches, one for each hand, he explained, and went to work. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"152812"	"he"	"explained"	" Workers would pre-fund their personal accounts, he explained, throughout their working life, and use the nest egg to supplement other retirement savings. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"152877"	"she"	"explained"	" All suburbs are not equal, said Amy Land, 41, who moved to Larchmont, N.Y., five years ago, after exploring several Westchester locales with her husband, Richard, 41. In each town that we looked at, we went to a playground, had something to eat and went to a couple of school fairs, and said, 'Are these people like us?' Certain towns, she explained, felt not as alive; dark. They evoked memories of a brief stint in a Baltimore suburb where everybody always wanted to be somewhere else, she said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"153160"	"he"	"explained"	" Before, we used to read; now, we have images to create social conscience and leave a historical testimony, said Lopez Obrador, who, showing a sense of humor, wore a black plastic anti-Lopez Obrador bracelet on his left wrist. The bracelets, he explained, are sold in Las Lomas, a wealthy suburb, and this one was given to him at a press conference that morning. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"153369"	"he"	"explained"	" For 27 years I said no, Marino said. He wanted to do the whole package -- the structure, the layouts, the interiors -- while many developers wanted him to scale back his involvement, he explained, because of the cost. I had people just want to use my name, he said, and I wouldn't have to touch a thing. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"153651"	"he"	"explained"	" Azhar Usman, 29, with his knitted skullcap and full beard, presented somewhat differently. An MTV executive, he explained, had recruited him, saying: We're going to redefine the identity of the MTV host. It doesn't have to be someone sexy and good-looking. A comedian (and lawyer) from Chicago, Usman used the audition to invent an exaggeratedly accented (and quite amusing) character: Vijay the VJ. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"153712"	"she"	"explained"	" Schueler kept the diary. He went to become an artist of considerable reputation. But he always hoped, his widow, Magda Salvesen, later explained, to write about his own difficult war by drawing, in part, on the experiences of his seemingly fearless comrade. He kept the diary, she explained, not out of malice or spite, but as an artist, for whom the needs of people often played a secondary role. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"153714"	"you"	"explained"	" When you first met, you tried to help him: You hid his loudest clothes in a box marked dishes. This kind of shirt, you explained, goes with that kind of tie. You'll get the hang of it, you said. Your own mother probably told you you were wrong. You didn't listen. Love conquers all. Right? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"153766"	"she"	"explained"	" Studio executives, she explained, tend to be overly aware of the tastes and priorities of their corporate counterparts at the network, and as a result may tailor their pitches accordingly. Executives at a true independent, she said, are more likely to heed their instincts and try to shop an idea to other networks rather than grant first dibs to a sister network. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"153781"	"she"	"explained"	" The feisty 40-something North African author, Nedjma, appears to have been motivated by more than a desire to titillate. By portraying a woman enjoying the pleasures of the flesh, she explained, she wanted both to celebrate the body as an expression of life and to strike a blow against the repression of Muslim women. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"153896"	"he"	"explained"	" Even in a very dark sky, he explained, nearby galaxies -- Andromeda in the north and the two Magellanic Clouds in the south -- appear only as fuzzy patches of light. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"154010"	"she"	"explained"	" A few weeks ago I had lunch at the improbably named Tryst restaurant with a woman who had moved to Boston in the mid-1990s. Her first job here, she explained, was as a beer destroyer for the Boston Beer Company, makers of Samuel Adams. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"154168"	"he"	"explained"	" The pine tar, he explained, was a substitute for rosin and didn't affect his pitches. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"154432"	"he"	"explained"	" He was tweaking the computer codes to make his sumo robot wrestle other robots off a large black board edged with white tape. His robot will stay inside the borders, he explained, because it senses the white color and knows not to go any further. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"154446"	"he"	"explained"	" The 1930s elegance of Ray's latest effort was intended, he explained, to represent the natural elements: sun, water and fresh air. Yet somehow the oxygen seemed to have been sucked out of the pavilion where he showed his collection, and the mood was as stilted as the parlor games (reading the future in rotting fruit was one) in Savages. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"

"154891"	"he"	"explained"	" As the Hancocks relaxed under a picnic shelter in the back yard, Andrew strolled onto the deck in a sleeveless shirt that showed off his muscular arms, one of which was emblazoned with a Metallica tattoo. He joined the Guard, he explained, because 12 members of his family had served in the military and it was more or less expected of him. An assistant electrician in civilian life, Andrew was a member of Brean's unit and also would soon be leaving for Iraq, where he would drive a supply truck. He was anxious to return so he and Heather could start a family. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"

"155329"	"he"	"explained"	" We did everything we could to advise people that there might be material that might be offensive to some people, Davis said. The real problem is the perception of viewers watching that segment. Hassan, he explained, is not a terrorist, but an angry, disillusioned Arab-American, embracing his roots after experiencing racism from other Americans since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. (Hassan's real name is Mark Copani and World Wrestling identifies him as Italian-American.) </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"155397"	"I"	"explained"	" Martinis, I explained, were available shaken or stirred and slightly chilled until the ice cubes melted, or for the ultra-sophisticated, warm whiskey with cold water or tepid soda. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"155580"	"he"	"explained"	" They are being admitted into evidence, he explained, because prosecutors must show that defendants were knowledgeable of PIJ violent acts before they attempt to show that they raised money to encourage future PIJ violence. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"155786"	"she"	"explained"	" Adriana Romo, 17, was delighted to be seeing something that made her two older brothers in Acapulco jealous. They are space nuts, she explained, and always watch the shuttle launches on the Internet or television. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"156447"	"he"	"explained"	" The wind that I felt at my back at The Palms inspired this pool that spirals in the wind, McDaniel said. It's wavy, and it has a big front that looks like it's pushing against the beach. He also introduced 8-foot-wide circular cushions, dotted with pillows and candles, along a deck reminiscent of ocean liners. The purpose, he explained, was to give guests something other than the ocean to admire. I'm not about waterfalls, and I'm not about clear water shooting a hundred yards across a pool, McDaniel said. I'm all about the beauty of the garden space, and the pool is one of the objects in the garden. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"156509"	"he"	"explained"	" We didn't have to protect him until the year after this, Bill Bavasi, the Mariners' general manager, said, meaning on the 40-man roster. This wasn't a case, he explained, of rushing a youngster because the team needed pitching. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"156513"	"he"	"explained"	" His head resting on his backpack, 23-year-old Francisco Lopez lolled on the ground in a tent set up for stranded passengers outside Terminal 4 and produced a piece of paper bearing the scribbled number 468. This, he explained, was his place in line -- the line for the chance to speak to an official who might find him a way to get home. He is supposed to start college in Mexico City on Monday. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"156535"	"he"	"explained"	" His first grown-up kitchen, in a sublet in the Westbeth complex in the West Village, sometime in the early 1970s, sat pristine and untouched. He had recently been divorced, he explained, and so busy trying to find myself that I never used it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"156769"	"he"	"explained"	" He said that delays often start with the way an office is run. Doctors assume, he explained, that the most efficient office is filled with waiting patients, like a company making sure its warehouses are always full. But companies have learned that there is a cost to keeping warehouses full. The same principle applies to doctors' offices. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"

"157015"	"he"	"explained"	" Lill, by contrast, asked for nothing so unconventional or so decisive in his classes. Formally polite, reserved, wearing a tie, he spoke with caution -- largely, he explained, because I never really know what teaching is. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"157160"	"she"	"explained"	" Family: She is the oldest of seven children. The first three became doctors, McKee said, and the first four all enrolled in college ahead of schedule. After that, she explained, her father began to mellow out a bit. McKee is single but looking. One day, she said, she, too, wants to have a large family. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"157392"	"he"	"explained"	" Murphy, whose own home was filled with mud -- It's like King Tut's tomb in there -- said a crew would have to restring a phone line 1,200 feet to the next service box. Not a hard task, he explained, but it cannot be done until every foot of Biloxi is examined to determine what needs to be fixed first. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
"157598"	"he"	"explained"	" The architect, unimpressed, said flatly that the only ground zero project that was not doomed to failure was the transportation hub. Since it was devoid of symbolic importance, he explained, it would not become a political time bomb. The rest? Forget it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
"157911"	"he"	"explained"	" I did this whole line of molded things in the most amazing colors, said Rashid, who is as wiry as Gumby and who was dressed in stovepipe trousers and a short-sleeve shirt colored Bazooka pink. The Rosa Cha collection by Amir Slama was Rashid's first foray into fashion, a business formerly without much interest to him, dominated as it is, he explained, by stylists and others more concerned with sifting through the debris of bygone decades than forging the future of design. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
"158014"	"he"	"explained"	" It is not clear, finally, whether Roberts views Casey as a superprecedent. But he considers it, he explained, a meta-precedent. That is, Casey is important not only for its substantive ruling but also for its explanation of how to analyze whether given cases should be overruled. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"

"158120"	"he"	"explained"	" That showed during Friday's ferry trip, as Horton rushed around the deck with a smile on his face. First he placed shots that captured the skyline in the background, then filmed aerial takes from a helicopter circling the vessel as Dempsey sternly walked past extras and smiling passengers hidden behind smoky glass again, and again, and again. A lot of television, he explained, is about the hurry up and wait. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
"158137"	"he"	"explained"	" The blood, he explained, had drained from the refrigerator and maggots had sprung up. The stench -- kinda like urea he said (the son of a New York City subway conductor, he likened the smell to Port Authority, New York's main bus station, in the 1970s) -- was so strong he had to escape to his attic for a breath of fresh air. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
"158259"	"she"	"explained"	" It was a break, she explained, from the grinding monotony and aching void that is the only life she may ever know. She reads to kill time and to prepare herself in case a Florida governor one day decides to pardon her. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
"158652"	"he"	"explained"	" Before, the elections were fake, and they were pushing it on us, he said. Now Shiites are the organizers. The difference, he explained, smiling, is that now there is no pushing. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"

"159392"	"he"	"explained"	" Villalobos said he used to watch telenovelas with his parents but stopped at 18. He started going out at night, he explained, and now that he is married he watches with his wife, with whom he has a 4-year-old son. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"

"160297"	"he"	"explained"	" Yes, he was told. The man hadn't been going into a shelter, he explained, partly because shelters are reluctant to allow patients with syringes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"160526"	"she"	"explained"	" Using a vivid metaphor that acknowledged the scariness of the enterprise, she explained, We have to find the courage to take off our emotional clothes. Cook elaborated on that danger in speaking of the essential fear that crawls around in most performers' hearts, an anxiety that in a curious way may also be a motivating factor in the desire to become a performer: We feel that we're not enough, that the world doesn't want us. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"160721"	"he"	"explained"	" The couple moved briefly to Guatemala, where they married and where Anett was born. Maldonado then decided to sell the cable company and return to the United States, he explained, to make a home for his family. He told Carbajal that he would go through the system to bring her and Anett in legally. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"160900"	"she"	"explained"	" Gregory and Petukhov ask fans to watch them skate, and feel the chemistry. At its essence, she explained, ice dancing is about male and female contact. Their performances speak for themselves, she said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"160924"	"he"	"explained"	" McCullough is driven from book to book, he explained, closing his collar against the chill, by basic questions: Who the hell are we? Where did we come from and how did we get to where we are today? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"161304"	"he"	"explained"	" You don't drink it straight, Fuchinokami said. Pour hot water in the cup and then the spirit, he explained, to release the flavor and aroma. Fifty-fifty, or 60-40, favoring the water, are the usual proportions, he said. But you decide. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"161460"	"he"	"explained"	" A lot of people don't like to back down, he explained, but they do because they don't want to get in trouble with the law. When people get 'liquored up,'  Butler said, it's not unusual to get aggressive with another person. Butler recognizes that the change gives more legal latitude for those confrontations to escalate into potentially fatal violence. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"

"162451"	"he"	"explained"	" His kitchen shelves show off some of his favorite toasters from the '20s and '30s, some with open-wire or filigree sides, some with stylized echoes of the Empire State Building or the Chrysler Building. All, he explained, have been completely remanufactured: disassembled, soaked clean, completely rewired. Additional appliances are squirreled away in the apartment in cardboard boxes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"162540"	"he"	"explained"	" The 80 percent test is the critical test to look at, said Edward R. Mackiewicz, the pension agency's general counsel from 1985 to 1987. By law, he explained, all business entities that are at least 80 percent owned by a single parent company are part of a controlled group that is jointly liable for their bankrupt brethren's pension debt. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"

"162957"	"he"	"explained"	" The White House press secretary, Scott McClellan, tried to spin this as a communications strategy. The vice president of the United States, he explained, designated a private citizen (and a lobbyist for a Texas engineering company) to go out there and provide that information to the public. As a result, what might have been a one-day gag on late-night TV is now a running story, and an excellent reminder that this administration never met a fact that it didn't want to suppress. (The last time Cheney made news while hunting was when he secretly invited Justice Antonin Scalia to go shooting right after the Supreme Court had agreed to decide whether Cheney could keep the membership of his energy task force secret.) </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"

"163317"	"she"	"explained"	" Arden said small dogs present a different kind of trouble, which she calls small dog syndrome. Many owners (especially those who think of themselves as parents) treat their Yorkies and Chihuahuas like babies, she explained, and this leads to spoiling. Owners often fail to discipline small dogs when they relieve themselves on the carpet, for example. Because it was just a couple of drops, owners wipe it up and say, 'Oh he just didn't want to go outside and get his little feet all wet,' Arden said. If it was a Lab, she added, the owners wouldn't say the same. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"

"164507"	"he"	"explained"	" Eppolito, he explained, wanted to persuade investors to give him $75,000 to write scripts about their lives. When he sold the script to Hollywood the subject would get 50 percent of the profit for the lifetime of the project, Corso said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164729"	"she"	"explained"	" The sisters found that during the nearly 70 years that the letters have been arriving, they have become a reflection of the changing times. In 1970, a girl from Montana wrote, Five years ago I met a Negro boy, William, at Bible camp. They had fallen in love, she explained, but added: My parents and friends are against us getting married.

"165107"	"he"	"explained"	" Designing brain-like electronic circuits would also make them more energy efficient.

"165556"	"he"	"explained"	" The Seeger Sessions came about, he explained, from a clutch of songs he recorded in 1997 for a Pete Seeger tribute album titled Where Have All the Flowers Gone, released on the Appleseed label. After his Devils &amp; Dust tour last year, he intended to take a break and to release a follow-up to Tracks, a 1998 four-disc set of rare odds and ends.

This meant, he explained, that I was reaching the friction point. I shifted into first gear and slowly released the clutch. Sure enough, the car started trembling. Then one of my neighbors waved from the sidewalk. I waved back, and the shaking stopped. This was because, I noted with embarrassment, I had stalled the car. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"

"166980"	"he"	"explained"	" They would come busting in the door, and then stop and look and say, 'Oh, kendo,' he said. Yelling is a crucial part of kendo, he explained, a sign that the stomach and chest muscles are joining in the power of the strike. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"

"167205"	"he"	"explained"	" We see crime going up, said Steven Nicholas, assistant superintendent of the New Orleans Police Department. But he cautioned that the perception is worse than the reality.

"167881"	"she"	"explained"	" Lillis ordered the Chachases to scrap the reward. A rich man doesn't need the money, she explained, and a poor man who spots Buddy will see instead a bag of money with fur on it. He'll chase after the cat, likely terrifying it, and then he'll hoard news of the sighting in hopes of getting the money later. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"167912"	"he"	"explained"	" Antoine Predock, based in Albuquerque, N.M., dematerialized the fence, he explained, with a physical wall designed as a mirage. An earthwork of rammed, tilted dirt would be pushed into place by Mexican day laborers. Crushed rock scattered before it, and heated from below, would appear to lift it off the ground, in the way that heat in the desert appears to make objects hover, like mirages. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"167948"	"he"	"explained"	" We'd prefer there to be an environment where there hasn't been an asking price on the property, said Michael A. Fine, the executive vice president of Sheldon Good &amp; Co. Auctions. Otherwise, he explained, the buyer might not pay more than the last asking price on the property. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"168493"	"he"	"explained"	" We can use these to look at anything the immune system attacks, said Nepom. Tetramers, he explained, allow scientists to locate the one-in-a-million key immune system cell that can tell them exactly what is going on in the body when a vaccine stimulates a protective response or when something goes awry. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"
"168494"	"he"	"explained"	" Nepom is a bit more circumspect. Tetramers are clearly of value as a new diagnostic tool, he said. The molecules are designed to immediately fluoresce -- light up -- when they've found a target in the blood, he explained, allowing for a simple, direct and quantitative identification of the cell or foreign invader of interest. It's a rapid, direct test rather than the current approach, which is indirect and often requires a wait of weeks or more to get results. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"

, he said,	 Extreme heat actually reduces the efficiency of the solar panels, he said, pointing to a dial that showed the plant was running at 83 percent of its capacity. On cooler days, the panels operate at full capacity. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he said,	 The hardest part, he said, was obtaining loans to finance the roughly $5 million in construction costs. Gaertner also had to persuade the mayor of Buttenwiesen to allow him to string power lines across the fields. With only a handful of farmers in Germany installing these panels on a large scale, people really had no idea what we were talking about, he said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he believes,	 To hedge his bets, Gaertner has held on to his 1,000 pigs. The other day, they were huddled in a shed, sleeping through the searing heat. With the world's population expanding, he believes, the price of pork may someday rebound enough to make that a viable business again. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz

, he said,	 Such expertise is essential, said Paul Kedrosky, a partner at Ventures West, based in Canada, and author of the industry-focused blog Infectious Greed.

, they said,	 Analysts called the return to profit an early sign of success for Stringer, a British-American who took Sony's helm a year ago. The biggest evidence, they said, was the rebound in electronics, which account for more than 70 percent of company revenues. Robust sales of cameras, camcorders and laptop computers all contributed to higher profits, Sony said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
, he said,	 Meanwhile, a more celebrated discovery -- at least in that small but passionate world of waterfall aficionados -- was that of Russ Weatherbee, a wildlife biologist at the Whiskeytown National Recreation Area near Redding, who had long heard rumors of a big waterfall on Crystal Creek. There was no sign of it on U.S. Geological Survey maps, but, he said, I kept thinking, one of these days somebody will come in and say, 'This is where it's at.' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"

"169282"	"he"	"explained"	" In college, he learned how to make friends -- seek the people you want to meet, he explained, instead of waiting to be sought out. One friend was Yuji Tanaka, with whom he would later form the comic duo, Bakusho Mondai. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169310"	"they"	"explained"	" Mennen, they explained, was bought out by Colgate 15 years ago. But they'd made friends with many of the people they worked with, and 10 years after the merger, some ex-employees organized a reunion. They figured a dozen might show up. One hundred and eighty-seven came. Lots of them keep in touch. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169632"	"he"	"explained"	" One drank coffee from a tiny plastic cup. Some slumped in sleepy poses along the side of the road. Toward the end of the long line of army vehicles, a portly soldier with a bushy mustache sat on a small folding stool around 10:30 a.m., his mouth slightly open and his head leaning against a wall. He opened his eyes suddenly and looked up self-consciously. He had not slept in 24 hours, he explained, and had been working hard since 8. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"170027"	"he"	"explained"	" His blanket, he told the museum staff in an e-mail message, was certainly not much to look at. But it had special meaning for him, he explained, because it had been issued to him in March 1945 at Sachsenhausen, the last of six German concentration camps in which he had been incarcerated in the last eight months of World War II. He carried it on a 12-day death march after the Nazis evacuated the camp's Jewish prisoners one step ahead of the approaching Allies, and he nestled inside it on his first morning of freedom after his captors fled, and the Nazi war machine was collapsing. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"170279"	"she"	"explained"	" They came of age before the Islamic revivalist movement that has swept Syria, she explained, and as a result many of them do not feel an intellectual ownership of Islamic teaching in the same way that their younger sisters do. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"

"170822"	"he"	"explained"	" As he changed into his Rays jersey, large tattooed numbers could be seen on his shoulders. What did they signify? That's the date my mom passed away 3-5-01, he said without hesitation. His mother, Patricia, had a drinking problem, he explained, and needed a liver transplant. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171049"	"he"	"explained"	" Part of his success lies in his intuition about which foreign series can play well here. As the television-addicted son of parents who worked in theater and avant-garde music, he says he views art as a visceral thing. So when he watches new programs, he explained, for me it comes down to, do I feel it? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171072"	"he"	"explained"	" But these were merely shortcuts, he explained, adding that he disdains anthropomorphic antics; he once broke up with a girlfriend because she sent Squeaky a birthday card. Ventriloquism as he sees it is nothing more or less than an art: He is part vocalist, part instrumentalist, part dramatist. Despite this division of roles, he dismisses the split-personality theory as a vestige of more superstitious times, exacerbated by novels like William Goldman's Magic and to some extent by Soap, in which lonely, repressed souls act out through their art. Instead of voicing the puppet, the puppet voices them. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171172"	"she"	"explained"	" Elfriede Rinkel had bad arthritis, she explained, and her apartment building's elevator was often out of service. She said she just wanted to go back to Germany, and because she told us that, we believed her. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171202"	"he"	"explained"	" Tummy Tuck jeans, which retail for $88 a pair at Nordstrom, Dillard's, Macy's and Bloomingdales and 1,000 specialty stores, are a fashion product, he explained, a niche in the enormous blue jeans market where 450 million pairs are sold every year. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171387"	"he"	"explained"	" The students, he explained, are absolutely going and those going are justified to fight jihad against US troops.

"171685"	"he"	"explained"	" Mandelson refused to be drawn into more specifics on his preferences, but he said that, in a globalized economy, distinctions between local products and foreign ones were not always clear.

"171849"	"he"	"explained"	" For anyone in baseball to rank among the elite, he explained, they must be measured by October, not gaudy regular-season statistics. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172297"	"he"	"explained"	" His secret in grouping random images, he explained, is to place them all the same width apart so that there is a visual rhythm to the seeming madness. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172571"	"he"	"explained"	" A Holocaust survivor once told me that his existence in the camps took place in two separate psychological spaces. In one, he was acutely aware of the unspeakable horror of his situation. But in the other, life seemed eerily normal. In this second space, each day presented challenges, and days in which he coped relatively successfully with them felt much like the good days of the past. To survive, he explained, it was critical to spend as much time as possible in the second space and as little as possible in the first. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172878"	"she"	"explained"	" Then, she explained, she came across a story on U.S. Sen. Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican re-elected to his second term with 83 percent of the vote, the largest victory in the state's history. It could be that Hagel, who won his Senate chair in 1996 with a history-making upset, truly won his constituency's hearts. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173621"	"she"	"explained"	" For Cook has strikingly transformed herself. Slimmer and more agile at 79 than she has appeared in decades, though still full-figured, she has recaptured a vocal stamina that was on the verge of fading. Because she was still recovering from an infection in her windpipe, she explained, only three-quarters of me is here. Gone, however, was the shortness of breath that had become increasingly noticeable in recent years. At the same time, the texture of her gorgeous lyric soprano was fuller. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173733"	"he"	"explained"	" If he was sipping the eggnog and unwrapping the packages, that probably meant the Cowboys didn't make the playoffs, which happened only once in his career. Christmas and the playoffs, he explained, were for him inextricably united. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"174320"	"he"	"explained"	" Nearby, Casey ran a big, noisy pump. Its purpose: drain water off the land that someday is supposed to be wet. Otherwise, he explained, the machines would get stuck in the muck. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
