A PROMINENT FAMILY CELEBRATES REVOCATION OF A DOCTOR'S LICENSE AT HELEN THOMAS' BIRTHDAY PARTY, CLINTON FIRES THE QUESTIONS (ll)  c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  NEW YORK _ Ellen Burstein, a former television consumer affairs reporter, had reason to celebrate this week. And rallying around her the other evening for champagne at her apartment were family members including her mother, BeatriceBurstein, a former state Supreme Court justice, and her sister Karen Burstein, a 1994 candidate for state attorney general.  The reason for the gathering was a decision by the State Professional Medical Conduct Administrative Review Board to uphold the revocation of the license of Dr. Irving Dardik for defrauding and exploiting patients with multiple sclerosis.  Five others had joined Ms. Burstein, who has had multiple sclerosis since 1986, in a complaint to the state Department of Health.  Dardik charged her $100,000 before treatment began, a fee that he said he needed for full-time therapists.  Ms. Burstein, now 50, went to Dardik after reading about him in New York magazine in June 1991. She said that in the course of his treatment her condition deteriorated. She is now in a wheelchair.  The revocation ``was vindication for me and my family,'' she said, adding that her mother and five siblings had been suspicious of the treatment from the start but did not want to discourage her.  ``I was beginning to lose control over my life and they wanted to give me something of my own to decide,'' she said. ``When I realized he had cheated me, they supported my decision to file a complaint and went through the whole process with me. Every pain I feel, they feel, too, and they were equally ecstatic over the decision.''  Dardik, a vascular surgeon, said Friday that he does not need a license to continue working with chronically ill patients in his home in Great Meadows, N.J. His mode of treatment, which he calls ``superesonant wavenergy,'' requires no drugs, invasive procedures or machinery, he said, but works through altering the cycles of the body's rhythms through exercise.  c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  Helen Thomas, the chief White House correspondent for United Press International, has written about the birthdays of eight presidents. Friday, the current president honored her 75th birthday with two gifts: an exclusive interview in the Oval Office and a surprise party for her colleagues in the Press Room, with beer and chocolate cake.  ``How do you stand doing this year in and year out?'' President Clinton demanded in a rapid-fire imitation of the woman who covered the Rose Garden ceremony where he shook John F. Kennedy's hand as a teen-ager.  ``Aren't you sick of this?''  Ms. Thomas, who came to the beat in 1961, made it clear that she was not sick of it, and peppered him with questions until he left the party.  Asked if he had a favorite Helen Thomas anecdote, Clinton confessed that he is never ready for the questions she shouts at him on his early morning jogs ``in that wonderful piercing voice of hers,'' which he mimicked before recalling his own rueful reaction: ``I'm not awake, Helen.

Times News Service  NEW HAMPSHIRE: DEMOCRATS SEE OPPORTUNITY  The Granite State has been off the national political map since an army of outside reporters, pundits and spinmeisters took their expense accounts elsewhere after the Presidential primary. But democracy goes on, as New Hampshire voters go to the polls on Tuesday for a primary election held in semi-solitude.  It has been nearly two decades since New Hampshire elected a Democrat as governor and U.S. senator, and now party officials are confident they can do both. They are counting on defections from moderate Republicans.  Jeanne Shaheen, a three-term state senator with soccer mom credentials, is the overwhelming favorite to win the Democratic nomination for governor. Stephen Merrill, the incumbent Republican governor, is not running for another term.  Though she sometimes portrays herself as a housewife who treats New Hampshire as one giant neighborhood, Ms. Shaheen has a reputation as a savvy political strategist who can pull off the upset. She introduced Jimmy Carter to New Hampshire voters in 1976, then managed Gary Hart's upset victory against Walter Mondale in 1984.  How excited are Democrats? ``I feel like the entire state has been transported to a parallel universe,'' said Judy Reardon, a spokesman for Ms. Shaheen.  Pat Buchanan won this state's Republican presidential primary in February, and his vocal followers _ about a third of party voters _ have yet to put down their pitchforks. The target has been Rep. Bill Zeliff, the Republican who is leaving Congress to run for governor. Zeliff has been castigated by Christian conservatives who feel he is too moderate, particularly on abortion.  As such, the party is badly fragmented, a not unfamiliar pattern. The late Leon (Andy) Anderson, longtime New Hampshire political editor at The Concord Monitor, used to say to that about every 15 years, Republicans ``just plain kill each other off in elections.''  In the Senate race, two Democrats _ John Rauh, a business executive, and Dick Swett, a former congressman _ are competing to face Sen. Robert Smith, the Republican. Smith, known in the capital for displaying graphic photographs of abortions, is thought to be vulnerable, but Republicans have an advantage in voter registration.  WASHINGTON: GOVERNORSHIP UP FOR GRABS  One governor's seat that Republicans hope to pick up is Washington, where Gov. Mike Lowry, a widely unpopular liberal Democrat, is stepping down. But to beat the Democratic nominee _ likely to be either Norm Rice, the mayor of Seattle, or Gary Locke, the King County executive _ Republicans first have to end their own war.  As in New Hampshire, the Republican Party in the Evergreen State is badly split between Christian conservatives and more moderate, business-oriented party members. The right has rallied behind Ellen Craswell, a self-described ``Christian radical.''  Campaigning in churches and at Bible study groups, Mrs. Craswell has attracted a large following. She has dispatched ``prayer teams,'' as her campaign volunteers are called, throughout the state. Mrs. Craswell has said that any government program that goes beyond ``the limited Scriptural purpose of government'' should be eliminated. She has never said specifically what that means.  With just a week to go until the primary, Republicans have come to realize that, given their crowded primary ballot, Mrs. Craswell could win the nomination with something like 12 percent of the vote. The result in November, they feel, would be a landslide for Democrats. Attacks from within the party went public last week in a flurry of statements.  The most notable broadside was fired by Jim Waldo, a longtime political consultant and a Republican gubernatorial candidate backed by many of the party's moderates. Waldo said Mrs. Craswell had stepped over the line separating church and state, noting for example that she says she would impose ``biblical values'' in state government. He said, too, that her past statements indicate that she would hire only Christians to fill state government positions.  Privately, many Republicans applauded Waldo. But his criticism may have misfired. Mrs. Craswell, while not backing down from her religious views, said she had never called for a Christian litmus test for potential state employees.  LOUISIANA: CAUGHT OFF GUARD BY A POP QUIZ  It happens every election: the pop quiz manages to trip up an otherwise well-versed candidate. In Oregon last year, Rep. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, failed to answer correctly when asked about the price of milk and gasoline and the location of Bosnia on a map. He fell badly in the polls, but recovered in time to win the open Senate seat.  Now, the pop quiz has stung several candidates in the Louisiana Senate campaign. In a debate last week, the eight major candidates in the race to succeed Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, a Democrat who is retiring, stumbled over questions about welfare, Medicaid, and the Cabinet.  Two of the candidates could not name the secretary of energy _ a position of considerable influence in an oil- and gas-dependent state like Louisiana. The answer is Hazel O'Leary. Only one of the candidates, Chuck McMains, a Republican and state representative who is far behind in the polls, got all questions correct, including what percentage of the state's population was on federal welfare. A Republican, Rep. Jimmy Hayes, guessed 26 percent. One of the leading Democrats, Attorney General Richard Ieyoub, put the figure at 10 percent. The correct answer is between 4.5 percent and 6 percent.  With less than two weeks to go to the primary, recent polls show that Ieyoub and the other leading Democrat, Mary Landrieu, a former state legislator, are comfortably ahead of the nearest Republican. Because only the top two finishers _ regardless of party _ go on to the general election, that trend, if it holds, would all but guarantee a Democratic Senate seat for Louisiana. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960909.0739 type=story > <HEADLINE> EDITORIAL: APPROVE THE TEST-BAN TREATY </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-EDIT-TESTBAN-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"

Golf Journal, the official publication of the U.S. Golf Association By PETER F. STEVENS  On the morning of July 18, 1896, history strode to the first tee of the U.S. Open. That day John Shippen was measuring the first swing of an African-American golfer in a professional tournament. Peter F. Stevens writes about this little-known but monumental history maker who became the first American leader in a U.S. Open and the first black golf pro. As amazing as his talent is the grace with which Shippen faced white professionals and proved he belonged in their midst.

Black wedding traditions such as crossing sticks and jumping the broom, are modifications of African traditions from the homeland. Cole writes on how these traditions evolved.

By HELAINE OLEN  In 1985 Yla Eason hit the toy stores, determined to find an African-American action figure for her son, to no avail. So the former New York Times reporter put her Harvard MBA to use and started Olmec Toys, named for the ancient Aztec civilization that some scholars believe traded with Africa. Helaine Olen writes on this entrepreneur, who capitalized on the toy industry's shortsightedness and, in the process, coined the now common toy phrase, ``ethnically correct,'' to describe her results. Now, a decade later, Olmec is a $5 million company and the pioneer in a lucrative _ and growing _ market niche.

(1,500 words) By LINDA S. LAWSON  ``Blacks are going to have to tell their own stories,'' playwright Tennessee Williams once said. But with a Republican-controlled Congress that places less importance on the arts, finding the money to tell their stories has been a struggle. Black Elegance magazine's Linda Lawson writes on the history of black theater and how it has emerged as a force to be reconed with. Now new ways of fund-raising, and high-profile actors, are putting the African-American stage in the spotlight.

At the time that the talks between Andersen, the accounting giant, and securities regulators collapsed, the two sides were as much as $150 million apart on the amount of a financial settlement. But these people said that there were strong signs of progress.  Meanwhile, reforms at Arthur Andersen that were proposed by Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, have begun. Just not in the way he expected.

"121168"	"I"	"feel"	" And with a Cowboys team expecting to be much better than last season's 5-11 squad reporting to San Antonio for training camp today, Jones has a lot to say. Q: Do you see yourself stepping away from day-to-day operations of the Cowboys anytime soon? A: No. No way. I feel like I've learned so much in 14 years. Q: So do you see yourself being involved in 14 more years? A: Yes, definitely. Q: GM and everything? A: Absolutely. I have no thought of doing anything different or slowing down. A couple of years ago, when I did some things to improve my health and condition and appearance, I didn't do it because I was getting ready to slow down or do something different. I did it because I have a lot ahead and I want to be fit and feel good about doing it. So, no, I don't see anything different for me for many years to come. Q: Will you continue to be on the field, giving advice and suggesting plays during games this season? A: Yes. Being on the field is football to me. I get the sense of who is doing it and who is not. While I can sit in the stands or see a game on TV, my idea of football is down there. ... You see how the players are looking at it, how the coaches are looking at it, so you can get a better read for the challenges and what they are dealing with. So there is no question I evaluate better when on the field. Q: In evaluating coach Dave Campo this season, does he need a certain number of victories or a playoff berth to keep his job? A: No. The evaluation will be a technical evaluation of ``Are we improving here?'' Because, I feel, the responsibility of only winning five games probably falls more squarely on my shoulders as GM and owner. Q: But, as GM and owner, you have upgraded the talent and, by default, the expectations for this season. Wouldn't another 5-11 season chafe you? A: Let's say I understood the circumstances behind our record. It would be foolish to think about making a change after three years of his being a head coach. So no the record wouldn't be a factor. Q: Would not making the playoffs be a factor? A: No. No, it is not. Not in relation to Dave. Q: What has you most excited heading into camp? A: Last year, we were in new territory regarding quarterback because we didn't have Troy. While we certainly have some questions to answer there, we know more about what to expect and what we got in Quincy Carter than we did at this time last year. Quincy has showed us that he can play, he can manage a game, he cannot get beat and, at the same time, give us a chance to get great play out of our quarterback with his skill. If that comes together for us, we have a chance to be in contention. Q: If Quincy Carter is the quarterback of the future, why the big cash to another young, unproven quarterback in Chad Hutchinson? A: When you try to pick a Pro Bowl _ or championship-caliber _ quarterback in the second round, your odds are slim. I've always known that, but I thought when I made the decision last year, while there is risk there, with that pick there is also reward. ... But, as part of that, I know you have a better chance for this franchise to ultimately end up with a Pro Bowl, Super Bowl-type of quarterback, if you have two opportunities to do it rather than one. And there is the Chad Hutchinson rationale. It was just too good of an opportunity to pass up, and, because Quincy is where he is in his development, I didn't see any quarterback controversy issues because by every standard that you can think of, Quincy deserves to be the starting quarterback. Q: You are criticized for drafting Quincy, for how you look, etc., etc. How are you able to brush it all aside? A: First of all, as a person, I'm sensitive to the criticism. It isn't that I'm not aware of it. Nobody likes to have negative things said about him, but, from the day I bought the Cowboys, there wasn't even a 30-second honeymoon. There was criticism from Day 1. ... And so, the minute I get stung or read something or hear something that is a personal criticism, and I've been criticized from everything from what I do to the way I look, I just shrug it off as part of being a part of the Dallas Cowboys, which is worth it. Q: This team has something really positive coming this year with Emmitt Smith likely to break Walter Payton's all-time rushing record. What does the team have planned for it? A: Many things. They are tied to announcements. We want to involve other great players, other players in the NFL who have been great rushers and great ball carriers. We want to involve other great players of this franchise. We want to make it a celebration and a recognition of the game and people who have played before Emmitt. The other thing we want to do is recognize the great players who he played with who make the record possible. nn </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020726.0026 type=story > <HEADLINE> MAVERICKS PUT FULL-COURT PRESS ON RASHARD LEWIS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 07-26-02 00:57:00EDT (BC-BKN-MAVERICKS-TEX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"

It's another layer of flavor, he said, as they steeped in wine. To take a lighter approach, he added, skip the wine and add a little tomato and vinegar and you have a shrimp dressing.

Between his work and his religion, he is something of an expert on Adventist cooking. White proposed vegetarianism not so much as doctrine, but as recommendation, Walden said. By the 1880s, he said, a significant drive to create an Adventist culinary tradition had developed. But, according to Walden, at one point White wrote: Some people are eating too much oatmeal and raw vegetables. Our food needs to be tasty.

, you see,	 Coleman cannot be accused of fawning. His Olivier is a charismatic genius but also ruthless, autocratic and narcissistic. Larry was not really interested in people, you see, said Peter Hiley, a longtime assistant to Olivier and Leigh.

In the car, they found blood from Avery and Halbach, they said. They also found her car key in the bedroom of his trailer, they said, and, using the very technology that had led to Avery's release two years earlier, they said they identified Avery's DNA on the key. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, she said,	 Around the nation, DNA testing has led to the exonerations of 163 people since 1989, including Avery, said Maddy deLone, executive director of the Innocence Project in New York, where Barry C. Scheck and Peter J. Neufeld were pioneers in the movement. Only one of those exonerated, she said, is known to have been convicted of a serious crime since being freed. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, she said,	 At the trial, the strongest evidence against Avery came from the victim herself. She identified Avery as the man who attacked her as she jogged on a beach. She had seen his face just 8 to 10 inches from her own, she said, and had noted his height, his broad hands with stubby fingers, his hair. The first thing that had raced through her mind during the attack, she told the jury, was that she needed to get a look at this guy. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 As snow fell over Avery's Auto Salvage in a rural part of Manitowoc County last week, Avery's family members said they were certain that Avery was innocent of the new charges. The authorities were wrong before, and they are wrong again, Avery's father, Allen, said. The evidence, he said, was planted. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, it said,	 Now it's starting all over again, Avery's father said as he looked around the salvage yard that law enforcement officials had spent days searching.

, they say,	 The war in Iraq, where more than 2,000 American servicemen and women have been killed, is one major reason recruiting for the Guard has become more challenging, Guard officials say.

, they say,	 Part of the plan is to pull American troops back from the cities to more remote bases where they will be less visible but poised to assist when needed.

, he says,	 Catchy title, this one. But even if you share the sentiment, even if you are as rhapsodic about your iPod as Jones is about his, are you really interested in hearing about the hills and valleys of one man's musical taste? In Jones' case, it ranges from his passion for Gary Glitter's I Didn't Know I Loved You (Till I Saw You Rock &amp; Roll) when he was 12, through a disco phase to soul and punk and his recent passion for jazz. These pages often have the effect of a one-sided conversation with a friend who thinks he was the only adolescent who overcame adversity (Jones had a stammer) by taking refuge in the music of his time. Then again, there's an endearing quality to his refusal to abandon the songs he has loved, even though it results in far-flung and potentially embarrassing preferences. Can't you like everything? he asks. I do. The iPod, he says, has reunited him with songs he hadn't heard in years. He alternates the story of his musical history with chapters about Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and the development of the iPod. Jones is editor of British GQ. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz

The group also receives contributions from other drug companies, she said, but she denied that the money played any role in the group's opposition to the plan. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz
, he said,	 At her arraignment Tuesday, she was released on $25,000 bail. Her lawyer, Steven M.

She is guilty, he said, of nothing worse than negligence or stupidity for putting business expenses on personal credit cards and personal expenses on business credit cards. </P> 	nyt_eng_200511.gz

But, he wrote, The effect was exactly the same. Hazan, who said he was surveying all the companies he follows for potential back-dating issues, focused on Cyberonics options that were granted at a special board meeting on the evening of June 15, 2004. That was only hours after a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended that the agency approve Cyberonics' request to market its implantable nerve stimulator as a treatment for severe, chronic depression. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, they say,	 Cyberonics and analysts who favor the stock say that much of insurers' resistance stems from the focus of the original clinical trials on three-month results, which turned out to be too short a period to demonstrate an advantage.

THAILAND-KING (Bangkok, Thailand) -- Royalty gather to honor Thailand's king on a very special day for him, the 60th anniversary of his rule. Amid elaborate ceremonies with roots deep in Siamese history, the royal visitors will witness the almost mystical devotion of Thailand's people to their king, who is the anchor of their culture and traditions within a chaotically modernizing world. By Seth Mydans.  CHINA-DAVINCI (Beijing) -- China has suddenly withdrawn The Da Vinci Code from movie theaters nationwide, despite brisk ticket sales. There is domestic religious and political intrigue involved. By Joseph Kahn.

FINANCIAL (f code)  NATURAL-BEEF (Undated) -- A sprawling ranch in Saguache, Colo., is the birthplace of Coleman Natural Foods, founded by Mel Coleman's father in 1979. From the start, he sold natural beef -- something alien to most shoppers and meat producers back then. His cows, he said, were not given antibiotics and growth hormones like the big processors' cattle were, and he fed them a vegetarian diet. It took him years to win converts, not only among retailers but also among consumers and government regulators. Now, paradoxically, natural and organic meats have become so popular that even the big conventional meat producers are getting into the business and Coleman is left in the unexpected position of scrambling for shelf space once again.

The measures, which were recommended in a report released by the agency's Counterfeit Drug Task Force, emphasize certain regulatory actions and the use of new technologies. By Barnaby J. Feder.  FRONTIER-AIRLINES (Undated) -- A Q&amp;A with Jeff Potter, chief executive of Frontier Airlines. Since being named CEO in April 2002, Potter, 46, has more than doubled sales to $994.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, and established the company, a low-cost carrier, as a viable alternative to United Airlines on many routes from Denver.

ESTATE-TAX (Undated) -- The estate tax in the United States -- dubbed the death tax by its opponents -- affects very few people, but many others have dreams of being rich enough to be covered by it. Perhaps that explains the vehemence of the opposition to it. By Floyd Norris.  INVESTING-OVERSEAS (Undated) -- Foreign stocks have outperformed the home-grown variety for the last couple of years. One fund industry executive, who in his days as a portfolio manager extracted more than his fair share of gains from domestic stocks for his investors, contends that the discrepancy is far from an ephemeral trend.

For the latest photos and graphics from The New York Times, go to www.nytimages.com.  CULTURE AND ENTERTAINMENT (e code)  PICASSAO-SPAIN (Madrid, Spain) -- Museums find anniversaries hard to resist. And this time, Pablo Picasso is offering Spain a feast: 125 years since he was born here; 70 years since he was named director of Madrid's Prado Museum in absentia during the Spanish Civil War; and 25 years since Guernica, his iconic anti-war painting, arrived here after its long exile in New York. In today's art world, this more than justifies a major retrospective. Picasso: Tradition and Avant-Garde, which runs through Sept. 3, is installed at both the Prado and the Reina Sofía Museum, Madrid's principal gallery for modern and contemporary art. But there is more to this than lighting candles. It is all part of a long-running effort by Spain to reclaim its most famous 20th-century artist. By Alan Riding.  EARTHA-KITT-REVIEW (New York) -- Eartha Kitt, indestructibly seductive at 79, is still wowing them at the Cafe Carlyle. By Stephen Holden.  DIXIE-CHICKS (Undated) -- Why the Dixie Chicks have a No. 1 album without country or rock airplay. By Jeff Leeds.  TOURIST-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) -- William Grimes reviews The Naked Tourist by Lawrence Osborne (North Point Press/ Farrar, Straus, Giroux).  NY-BALLET-APPRENTICES (New York) -- It's reckoning time for students at the School of American Ballet, as Peter Martins plucks out stars to become apprentices at the New York City Ballet. How does he go about it? By Daniel J. Wakin.  TURKEY-MUSEUMS (Istanbul, Turkey) -- As the Turkish government fights to recover objects illegally removed from the country by smugglers and unscrupulous art brokers, the nation's museums lack the most basic mechanisms for protecting art from damage and theft. By Sebnem Arsu.  TV-LOUIE-REVIEW (Undated) -- Virginia Heffernan reviews the comedy series Lucky Louie (on HBO, Sunday at 10:30 p.m.).

, he said,	 The first detected case in the current outbreak, he said, was a 39-year-old farmer who went to Windhoek, a city of 125,000, in early May for a gall-bladder operation. He fell ill two weeks after returning to Aranos, his home town, and is now on a respirator. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 Basketball is in our blood, said Ghraid(cq) al-Izmerly, whose mother was once a star in Iraqi women's basketball. Now, he said, basketball has become our job. With employment like it is in Iraq, what can we do besides basketball? </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, it seems,	 Drug violence claims hundreds of Mexican lives each year. Every couple of years, it seems, border town hotspots switch from Tijuana, to Juarez, to currently Nuevo Laredo, where at least 120 people have been killed in gangland fashion as rival gangs fight for the control of the Interstate 35 corridor. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, it notes,	 Already, it notes, three Cleveland-area election officials have been indicted for illegally rigging the recount. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he says,	 People start to get a little more interested, he says, when you give them the applied side of the science. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 Among its successes so far, he said, has been the election of Dean as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, the strong showing of Paul Hackett in Ohio and the sagging support in Connecticut for the re-election of Sen. Joe Lieberman, the Democratic Party's vice presidential nominee in 2000. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, she said,	 Progressive blogger Jane Hamsher kicked off the discussion panel with criticism of mainstream news organizations, which, she said, had failed in their job to reveal the truth of the events surrounding the leak of Plame's name to conservative columnist Robert Novak after Wilson criticized the administration's war policies. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, she added,	 Her mention of Watergate reporter Bob Woodward and former New York Times reporter Judy Miller drew hisses from the audience. Hamsher said that if the mainstream media had done its job, we wouldn't be here. And for that, she added, I want to thank them from the bottom of my heart. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he writes,	 For Battelle, Farecast represents a potential return to the Web's early promise of shifting power to consumers. That was thwarted, he writes, when merchants began to collude with one another and with aggregators. If you think AutoByTel or Expedia is on your side, you're kidding yourself. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he says,	 THE TROUBLE WITH WIKIS: There is nothing wrong, per se, with Wikipedia, writes Jaron Lanier, the computer scientist, artist and author, in a provocative essay on the Web site Edge: The Third Culture (edge.org). Rather, he says, the problem is how Wikipedia is used and the way it has been elevated to such importance so quickly. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he acknowledges,	 Often, he acknowledges, the hive mind is smarter than any individual -- in determining prices, for example. The collective is good at solving problems which demand results that can be evaluated by uncontroversial performance parameters, he writes, but it is bad when taste and judgment matter. Often, he says, it is best to combine the strengths of the hive mind with those of the individual -- as with open-source software. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 Currently, he said, No employers are required to do anything when they get no-match letters. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he added,	 The Fed, he added, will be vigilant to ensure that the recent pattern of elevated monthly core inflation readings is not sustained. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he suggested,	 Lacking a formal plan, Mathes said, forest managers will simply use the original documents to get the information they need. At most, he suggested, Forest Service workers will have to look in more than one place for what they need. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 C. Bruce Johnstone, managing director of Fidelity Investments, prefers putting money into markets that feature three pillars: rising corporate earnings, reasonable valuations, and benign inflation and interest rates. The markets that possess those in greatest abundance, he said, are overseas, and he expects that to remain the case despite short-term swings. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 His biggest holding, he said, is Fidelity Emerging Markets. That would give him stakes in such companies as Samsung Electronics and Kookmin Bank in Korea; the Russian energy concern Lukoil; Teva Pharmaceutical in Israel; and a couple of Brazilian commodity producers: the energy company Petrobras and the mine operator Companhia Vale do Rio Doce. They were among the fund's largest positions on March 31, the most recent date for which Fidelity would provide information. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 Two other funds in his personal portfolio, he said, are International Small Cap and International Small Cap Opportunities. Their largest holdings included Banca Italease, a company that leases equipment to financial institutions; Hitachi Construction Machinery in Japan; Central African Mining and Exploration; and SolarWorld, a German maker of solar energy equipment. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he says,	 In some cases, the more affordable grills even perform better, he says, particularly when it comes to evenness -- the ability of the grill to cook a burger to perfection no matter where it rests on the grill. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, I think,	 He wished Federer better luck. I would love to see Roger win it, he said. He is the best player probably ever in tennis, and it would be, I think, nice to see him lifting the trophy here. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, they said,	 The interest rate saga took a dramatic turn this week when central banks in Europe and Asia raised their benchmark interest rates in a move designed, they said, to keep inflation under control. Strategists also suggested they were trying to rein in some of the speculative frenzy in the global markets. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 Pro wrestling is essentially a story of good versus evil, like a Popeye cartoon, noted Goldberg, who runs both New England Championship Wrestling and the WWW, a subsidiary of the NECW. And like Popeye climbing off the ropes to battle Bluto, he said, the outcome of the story may be predictable, but the entertainment value is all in the wrinkles. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, she said,	 I want to see where this goes, Ariel said as she applied makeup before the tag-team match. Her side job, she said, is working at a McDonald's, where they don't mind if I need to take a month off to go wrestle. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 Scott Riggs, who is competing only in Cup, said he realizes that drivers who also run Busch have an advantage when the two circuits run at the same track because they learn more about how the tires react at that particular track, and they can get a better feel for racing conditions related to the track itself. But, he said, when the races are at different tracks on the same weekend, the negatives could outweigh the positives. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 The first detected case in the current outbreak, he said, was a 39-year-old farmer who went to Windhoek, a city of 125,000, in early May for a gall-bladder operation. He fell ill two weeks after returning to Aranos, his home town, and is now on a respirator. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 From the start, his father sold natural beef -- something alien to most shoppers and meat producers back then. On a sales trip in the early 1980s, his father camped out in a rented car to save money as he made his pitch to grocers. His cows, he said, were not given antibiotics and growth hormones like the big producers' cattle were, and he fed them a vegetarian diet. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, she said,	 The greater culprit, now as then, she said, is the country's system. Back then we believed the party was great and graceful and correct, and you were obedient to the party, she said. You went wherever it pointed you. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, she said,	 Deprived of a pension until recently, closely monitored and unable to publish inside China, she has dedicated her life to overcoming the official silence about the Cultural Revolution. The leadership, she said, has buried the memory of this period because it is afraid of losing power. They would prefer for the Cultural Revolution to be forgotten. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, it seems,	 Rebecca Repasky stands in a shaded grotto of moss-shrouded trees when she says this. She's not talking to anyone in particular; she's just, it seems, momentarily seized by the demure, canny personalities of the flowers she studies. Along this winding trail through the Peruvian cloud forest, Repasky has found approximately 150 species of orchids since August. They are more vivid than the biggest box of Crayolas: vibrant shades of blue, leopard-spotted lemon-yellow, wine, hot pink and orange. It's possible that up to five species in Repasky's collection are completely new to science. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, she explains,	 After she finishes her field research this summer, Repasky hopes to publish a manuscript on her research and a field guide to the orchids of the region. The Amazon Conservation Association, which will be applying to the Peruvian government for a conservation concession in these mountains (something like a lease on the land), says that AABP's orchid findings will play a role in its arguments for conservation. The first thing to know about orchids, Repasky says, is that there are more of them than perhaps any other family of plant in the world, upwards of 30,000. The second thing to know, she explains, is that many are epiphytes, plants that grow on other plants. However, they derive their nutrients not from the plant they live on, but from the forest materials that collect or grow on those branches, and from the rain and the air. Indeed, most of Repasky's orchids adhere to trunks and limbs at what might be termed the mezzanine level of the forest, happily undisturbed. Their Latin genus names-- Stellilabium, Epidendrum, Lepanthes, Habenaria -- bestow grandeur, even if most of these highly evolved flowers are less than 1 square inch. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, she adds,	 Some orchids are so specialized, she adds, that they're designed to accept pollen only if it comes from the leg or underside or some other very specific part of the visiting bug. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, she added,	 A lot of people know that I was involved in health care back in '93 and '94, and I still have the scars to show for it, Clinton says in a new biographical film that she is showing on the campaign trail. After raising the topic in a recent speech, she added, But it's worth wading into again -- and we're going to have to. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, she said,	 The woman who was sharply criticized a decade ago for a lack of political realism is now steeped in it. If her cardinal sin in 1993-94 was overestimating the public's appetite for change, as many analysts contend, she seems intent on not repeating the error. When employers complain to her about the need for federal action on health care, she said, I say back to them, fine, what are you going to do to help us create the consensus that has to develop in order to move the political system? </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 At least some of that might have to do with his loyalty to Georgia. He grew up 30 minutes from Athens, his parents and grandparents are longtime UGA football season-ticket holders and it was always his intention, he said, to play for the Bulldogs. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 Surgeons often ask patients what they want to hear. Inabnet has to be especially sensitive, he said, because in most of his cases, the patients receive local anesthesia and are awake. In Thursday's operation, to remove a pea-size parathyroid gland, the patient asked for opera. Inabnet's iPod happened to have a classic 1960 recording of La Traviata, which played through a desktop computer with speakers surgically taped to the computer stand. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz

, she said,	 In Key Biscayne, yeah, it was a huge thing for me, Kuznetsova said. In the past, she said, I didn't believe in myself, that I couldn't make it, that I couldn't beat top players in a row. Since I won Key Biscayne, it's like to me, I know I can do this. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 The Israeli commander for the south, Gen. Aviv Kochavi, said in a telephone interview that his troops had fired four shells toward an area 400 yards inland from the beach often used to shoot Qassam rockets toward Ashkelon, in the early morning, and another six shells in the late afternoon. Three of the six fell north of the target, he said, and the accident was south of the target, so we're trying to discover whether one of our shells fell wrong or whether a dud shell, fired previously, exploded on the beach. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he added,	 National enthusiasm is certain to rise with the opening success against Costa Rica. If we lose, only five percent think Germany will be world champion, Nienhaus said. With Friday's victory, he added, it's 80 percent. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060609.0198 type=story > <HEADLINE> SHAQ FOUL SHOOTING NOT A PRETTY THING </HEADLINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, we ask,	 So, we ask, after all these years, was it frustrating to hardly have any scenes together in their new movie? </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, she said,	 But soccer, she said, has tapped into something else entirely. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, she said,	 It took our breath away, Julie Stevens, program director of KRTY-FM, a country station in San Jose, Calif., said of the song. Before hearing it, she said, she had figured fans would forgive and forget as long as she shut up about it. Now, she said, that's not going to happen. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, she said,	 That kind of sentiment has undermined the Dixie Chicks' prospects even at radio stations that had not abandoned it before. Stevens, the San Jose radio programmer, said she had played the band's music even when many other country programmers had taken it off the air in 2003. But now, she said, the band's choice of songs seemed aimed at renewing old tensions. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz

, he said,	 It was the last game in which both players were healthy. Nalbandian said he felt pain in an abdominal muscle while hitting a second serve in the next game. He aggravated a strain, he said, that he sustained Tuesday in the final set of his quarterfinal against Nikolay Davydenko. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 Later this month, a former Patrick supporter will hold a Gabrieli meet-and-greet for gay and lesbian voters in the South End. Mark Walsh, an event planner, said that after a great deal of soul-searching this spring, he switched sides. Gabrieli, he said, combined unwavering support for gay issues with experience creating jobs and an openness to lowering taxes, which Walsh believed would appeal to independent voters. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, she added,	 A lot of people know that I was involved in health care back in '93 and '94, and I still have the scars to show for it, Clinton says in a new biographical film that she is showing on the campaign trail.

, he said,	 He told National Public Radio in an interview last week that making condolence payments had become a standard response by the military. The practice, he said, is common in this part of the world -- it means a death payment, a death gratuity, so to speak -- it is part of life over here. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz

, he declared,	 The Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, differed with that explanation after the verdict, which, he declared, sent a clear message that the 'n' word has no place in our society and should be banished from our vocabulary. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 But the mother, he said, had not yet been told how many from her family were dead - her husband, his other wife, Raisa, and four daughters: Alia, 25, Sabrina, 22, Ilham, 15, and Hanadi, 1, according to hospital records. A son, Ayham, 18, was in critical condition and two daughters, Amina, 22, and Latifa, 7, were among the 30 other people injured in the beach shelling. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 Cape prices will fall, but I don't think they'll likely fall dramatically, Belsky predicted. That's because second-home owners, like second-home buyers, also have more discretion about whether to wait for more favorable conditions. With the economy still strong, he said, demand for vacation rentals provides a cushion for Cape homeowners. Holding on to the house may make more sense, Belsky said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 The boom on Cape Cod was unforgiving to buyers, and Ritchie said they had given up on finding the perfect place in a quiet area, not too far from the water. You could see the prices skyrocketing, so we never really went forward, said Ritchie, 50, who vacationed in Harwich as a child. This summer, he said, I'm sure we can find something. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, I stop,	 As soon as I feel any stiffness (throwing), I stop, because I don't want to get it inflamed again, Gagne said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 When Zbikowski enters the ring, he said, he expects to feel the same nervousness he experiences when he runs through the stadium tunnel at Notre Dame. But instead of being with the Fighting Irish, Zbikowski will be fighting alone, although many of his teammates will be at ringside, wearing Notre Dame jerseys and cheering. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 Some weather blogs seem to be cut-and-paste jobs that merely pass along the latest official advisories, he said. But the ones run by trained meteorologists can be interesting to read, he said, because they may be more willing to offer opinions and theories when they're online. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 Labor issues are another potential problem, he said, citing shipping industry statistics that show the port of Hong Kong being twice as productive as the ports of Los Angeles/Long Beach, where labor costs are higher and work rules more restrictive. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 After the first treatment, he said, the woman quickly became more creative, a change her employer said happened immediately. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 Bees are very important everywhere as pollinators and, from a commercial point of view, there are lots of agricultural crops that would suffer reduced crop yields without bees, he said. Examples, he said, are broad, field, and runner beans and also raspberries. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he says,	 Both efforts, he says, are designed to limit the impact of minority voters. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, I reasoned,	 Faced with the prospect of being left in his apartment during that gray March without him or anyone, I decided I would get professional help, too. I went online and found a center that was, unsurprisingly, also in Arizona. I wanted to prove to Matt that I was a good girlfriend, worthy of his love. Going to treatment, I reasoned, was the ultimate evidence of this. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, you know,	 Um, I'm depressed, I said. And, you know, stuff with my family. Maybe alcohol. Love addiction? I offered meekly. What about you? </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, I thought,	 Time and again I heard from fellow addicts outlandish stories of vitriolic romances and suicidal tendencies. Crazy, I thought, until I considered how similar their stories were to mine. Because Matt was in effect my drug, I wasn't allowed to speak with him during my first month of treatment. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, I thought,	 I had never entertained the thought that we might actually break up for good. The reason we were in treatment, I thought, was to rescue our love thing. I erupted into hysterics and looked to Matt, desperate for some sign that this was all a big mistake. He merely stared at his palms, then at me, blankly. These are the painful consequence of your actions, his therapist said to me sternly. You should be thankful to Matt for helping you get here. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, she added,	 Susan Kelly is an avid reader of detective novels, but the public library doesn't always have what she wants and she draws the line at buying books in hardcover. So Kelly joined a membership library, where she has, among many other privileges, the run of more than 15,000 new and classic mysteries. You can even get the originals of books from the 1920s, she said. The staff members, she added, just pull them off the shelf and hand them to you. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 In researching his novel Bandbox, Mallon took advantage of the library's collection of old and beautifully colored magazines from the 1920s and earlier. It's a great resource if you actually want to get your hands on a document, he said, and not just see it in some digital form. In writing Henry and Clara, he used the collection to find out the proper color for a widow to wear for her wedding in the 1840s. (Maroon, it turns out.) They had an old etiquette book that they brought out from the stacks, he said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, she said,	 Andrea Labov Clark has one of these memberships -- primarily, she said, for her three children, ages 3, 7 and 9. The children's librarian knows the children by name, and frequently what type of book they enjoy, she said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, they say,	 Yet to Clinton's supporters, as well as some students of gender and politics, therein may lie the rub. As much as any other factor, they say, women who are seen as tough, especially in military affairs, have dominated elections around the globe. Certainly that was true for Thatcher, the Iron Lady who warned her allies not to go wobbly on her, and Meir, who led Israel through the Yom Kippur war of 1973. And the triumph by Bachelet, a former defense minister in Chile whose father was an air force general, has been widely interpreted as a signal that female candidates require an extra show of strength. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, she added,	 Nonetheless, she added, I do not believe Hillary is going to be the beneficiary of that. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, she said,	 Monserrat, who plans to study advertising in college, had dabbled in political action -- attending an anti-war march this year, for example -- but she said the immigration debate shook her to the core. Now, she said, she has become a volunteer with a civil rights group that advocates for improvements in public transit. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, she said,	 But just like they took risks coming to this country for a better life, she said, she had to take a stand. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 Still, he said, those students who are not here legally face a bumpier road enrolling in college and finding jobs in professional fields after graduation. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
, he said,	 Stephen Biggar, director of American equity research at Standard &amp; Poor's, also expects dividends to move closer to the forefront of investors' thinking. Despite the minimal yields and strong price growth for many stocks in recent years, he said, the longer-term market picture has been different: Over the last 50 years, he said, dividends have accounted for a larger proportion of stockholders' returns than share-price appreciation. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz

, she said,	 Walchli likes companies with so much fuel to burn that they consistently raise their dividends. If you can find companies that grow their dividends 5 to 8 percent a year, your dividend, in many cases, can double within a decade, she said, a possibility that may lure aging investors into high-yielding stocks. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz
