"26113"	"he"	"realizes"	" Kristal is disappointed, but says he's trying to find a way to buy back the tapes and affiliate with a label that will release them. One of the problems, he realizes, is that heavy hitters like the Ramones, Blondie's Deborah Harry and the still-feuding Talking Heads did not play the gigs. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"30443"	"he"	"realizes"	" One of the most moving scenes in ``Apollo 13'' comes when Tom Hanks, as astronaut James Lovell, realizes during a hushed, understated, but eloquent impromptu breakfast with his young son that the boy understands more than Lovell gave him credit for _ that he realizes his father can die trying to go to the moon. All Hanks' Lovell can do is reassure him up to a point. To do more, he realizes, would be to lie _ which not only would be patronizing and morally wrong, but would cause his son to question his own (accurate) perception of the situation. In this sense, ``Apollo 13'' is this year's ``Bambi'' and ``Lion King'' _ but it has a happy ending. The parent whose loss the child fears escapes from danger and returns home. The worst doesn't always happen. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"

"46308"	"he"	"realizes"	" Sullivan is no Pollyanna. He knows how bitter and divisive the recent debate was over gays in the military and how convoluted the final compromise was. Any debate over gay marriage may make that seem, he realizes, like some high-society tea party. And Sullivan also knows, from his own experience as the first openly gay editor of a major American magazine, that the struggle for gay rights has made great strides, but still finds itself facing an atmosphere of misinformation, animosity and fear. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"
"59654"	"she"	"realizes"	" The emotional realism of ``The Shadow Man'' is sometimes wrenching, for it possesses a candor that is neither self-conscious nor artful. This is a hard ground to walk _ on one side lies the realm of the confessional, on the other, the coldly literary _ and here it constitutes the essential difference between the searing memoir and the merely competent one. Researching her father's life, Gordon breaks down in the quotidian ways we allow ourselves: She snaps at a waitress, weeps in a library restroom, becomes obsessed over a leather jacket in lieu of the lost object she can never again reclaim. The eternal daughter to her statuesque dead, she realizes, from the comfort of her own daughter, that the drama will not be carried over. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"

His chances, he realizes, are very good at the golf course that sets up for high-ball hitters who favor a left-to-right ball flight and who are good putters. Norman is all of the above. But he always has been. The difference is that he has a little something more now. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"
"64573"	"he"	"realizes"	" For Muller, Miyawaki, Zarich and others who have left Boston, many admit that they're just buying time.

Tormented, in the book's most contrived stroke, by the death of his own young daughter a year earlier, he has been left by his wife and must now worry about the price of every subway token.
