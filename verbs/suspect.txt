Then those kittens had kittens so fast that multiple generations were flashing before our eyes. In the meantime our own two domesticated cats had both disappeared (eaten, I suspect, by the coyotes that tour our streets). Now we were faced with a dilemma -- feeding some 13 cats that weren't ours, that stayed outside, that not only couldn't be petted but hissed at us when we came too near. But we couldn't stop feeding them: We didn't want the kittens to suffer. And with the cats came fleas, on the patio, in our bedroom, our office, the living room. You could walk out on the patio, look down and find eight or ten fleas on your socks, biting your ankles, leaving little red marks on your back at night. My over-the-fence backyard neighbor told me the fleas had driven his son into the house in tears and he had to have his house sprayed at a cost of $107. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199408.gz"

But his movies can always be rented (and, I suspect, will be in something of a flurry after appetites are whetted by the cable documentary).

"18246"	"you"	"suspect"	" One of the reasons this film got made, you suspect, was that the former children, with their '90s consciousness, needed to absolve themselves of the guilt of being beneficiaries of now-unacceptable women's roles. They also needed, one senses, to absolve their natural mothers for their emotional distance on the grounds that their mothers, much more than they, were cast in narrow societal roles. The issues of parenting and childhood, emotions expressed and denied, can't help but be minefields. Still, these women collectively somehow did something right. Ettinger and Johnstone never recast their childhoods in a nostalgic haze, never stoop to recrimination, either. Now, as then, Martha and Ethel are there to carry them -- and their film. They're smart enough to know it, wise enough to accept their nannies' gift. The generosity and unconditional love shining from their faces after all these years are a joy. So is this film about them.

Women, especially, often spend a lifetime waiting for someone to free them from that prohibition, especially in public. For the most part, we're comfortable with one-on-one personal sharing, but put us in coed classes, at political meetings or around a business table, and studies demonstrate that women are more hesitant than men to promote their ideas, to contradict others or to speak up without being called upon.

His Albrecht in this ``Giselle'' was elegant and restrained, and while Albrecht may be Bavarian in the ballet, Bujones was a Latin lover, alternately smoldering and playful with Tcherkassky. Her Giselle, meanwhile, was a waif, ghostly white even while still alive. Bujones' first entrance was greeted with show-stopping cheers; his curtain calls were as gratifying to us (and, I suspect, to him) as the actual performance.

To me, its charm _ apart from the look of wonderment on the dewy face of young Hal Scardino as the toys come magically to life _ lies in its decent, savvy, rumpled but good-hearted parents played by Lindsay Crouse and Richard Jenkins.

There's violence here, too, and it's as jolting as any currently around. Nor is there any shortage of sex or blood. Yet the best stuff in ``Mulholland Falls'' isn't the self-conscious cop banter or the set pieces when Nolte and his pals (sanctioned by their boss, a droll turn by Bruce Dern) pit their human-dimensioned corruption against worse corruption in higher places. ``Mulholland Falls'' peaks when Nolte's cop is forced to go home and admit to his convincingly loving and appealing wife (Melanie Griffith) that he has been unfaithful. Not that the FBI wouldn't have ratted him out anyway. One of the most violent scenes comes when Nolte unleashes a little payback to his FBI rival, Daniel Baldwin. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"

Even so, I found they took some getting used to, I guess because I'm accustomed to seeing fashion displayed on human stick figures.

The owner, Boris Berezovsky, is an outspoken opponent of President Vladimir Putin and was thought to be a reason behind moves to close the station. The government's press minister, Mikhail Lesin, said he would review the new company's application to continue broadcasting.  NORTHERN IRELAND: SINN FEIN URGED TO COOPERATE  President Bush's envoy for Northern Ireland, Richard Haass, urged Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, to name members to serve on the province's new police board and to stop discouraging Catholics from joining the new cross-community Police Service of Northern Ireland, which replaces the 92 percent Protestant Royal Ulster Constabulary. Northern Ireland's other Catholic party, the Social Democratic and Labor Party, and two main Protestant parties have joined the board but Sinn Fein has refused to, saying reforms do not go far enough.  AFRICA  ZIMBABWE: VOTE ON MEDIA LAW PUT OFF  A proposed law that would require journalists to be citizens of the country and licensed by the government has been put aside by Parliament until next week so amendments offered this week can be reviewed by the minister of information. The law, which would make it all but impossible for foreign journalists to work in Zimbabwe, is one of a series of bills the governing party has been pushing through Parliament in what critics say is an effort to weaken the opposition before elections in March. In recent days President Robert Mugabe, who is running for re-election, has come under renewed pressure from fellow African leaders who have urged him to ensure that the vote is open and fair.  ASIA  SRI LANKA: REBELS SET CONDITION FOR TALKS  Ethnic Tamil rebels have demanded that a ban on their group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, be lifted before they will enter peace talks with the government to end an 18-year civil war that has killed more than 62,000 people. The government has not made clear its position on lifting the ban; the group has been designated a terrorist outfit by Sri Lanka, India, the United States and Canada. G.L. Peiris, a government official, said the issue would be discussed.  KYRGYZSTAN: DEATH PENALTY MORATORIUM  In its continuing effort to be perceived as a progressive nation, Kyrgyzstan extended a moratorium on death sentences and announced a plan to gradually abolish the death penalty. The extension was signed into law by President Askar Akayev in what officials said was a confirmation of the Central Asian nation's ``commitment to basic human rights and freedoms.'' Earlier this month Kyrgyzstan adopted a human rights program under which the death penalty could be abolished by 2010.  INDONESIA: JUDGES NAMED FOR RIGHTS TRIALS  After many delays, the government appointed 18 judges to oversee various human rights trials including the trial of 19 people _ some of them generals _ accused of atrocities when East Timor voted for independence in 1999. It was not clear when the trials would begin.  AMERICAS  DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: VISIT BY HAITIAN LEADER  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti arrived in the Dominican capital to discuss a range of issues, including the extradition of a former Haitian police official accused of plotting a failed coup attempt last month. Dominican officials have said they will deport Guy Philippe, the police official, to a third country rather than hand him over to Haiti. Aristide is expected to ask President Hipolito Mejia to increase border security; Haitian officials believe the commandos who stormed the presidential palace last month crossed over from the Dominican Republic. The visit came one day after the Organization of American States said it would set up a mission in Haiti to try to resolve the political stalemate between Aristide and the opposition. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020116.0179 type=story > <HEADLINE> CoxNet Cox News Service budget  </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-ADVANCE-BJT-0120-2NDLD-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"

PIPE-ORGANS (Undated) _ An obsession will often take you places you did not know you wanted to go. For some people, that means scaling the side of a mountain as they attempt rock climbing. For others it involves a bone-rattling canoe trip down the white water of a rushing river. For me, obsession led to the rafters of Yale University's Woolsey Hall, where I one day found myself hunched down and gingerly maneuvering across an 18-inch-wide plank, 50 feet above the floor, with nothing between me and the void but a flimsy-looking railing I was holding tightly in my grasp. I have spent much of my life seeking out pipe organs, and in New Haven, I had finally found one of the world's greatest. By Craig R. Whitney.  DELUXE-LOG-CABINS (Undated) _ A marriage of captains of industry with log cabins _ popping up from the Pennsylvania countryside to Lake Tahoe and the great Northwest _ has created a curious culture, and some contradictions. For one thing, the logs often cannot protect movers and shakers from their own work ethics, and a home office is often a well-worn room in these retreats. For another, while the outside of the homes are made of shorn trees, they are far from Abraham Lincoln's log cabin. Inside are the latest amenities: Sub Zero refrigerators, floors made of slate from Shanghai, and Cypress hardwood imported from South America, a Viking wine cooler kept at 55 degrees. By Matt Richtel.  RITUAL-CANADIAN-HOCKEY (New York) _ Like many immigrants living in New York City, I wanted to preserve some of the customs of my homeland, which in my case is Canada. And, like many immigrants, I suspect, I have failed almost completely. Last July 4, I climbed up on the roof of my building to watch the fireworks over the East River, but I barely took notice of Canada's birthday three days earlier. On Canadian Thanksgiving, we ordered in Chinese, the surest sign I had given up my native customs for New York's. But there is one ritual I've managed to keep: Watching the CBC's webcast of Don Cherry on the hockey show ``Coaches Corner.'' By Bruce Headlam.  COLLECTING-LARGE (Undated) _ Large things, particularly in small spaces, have often had a special appeal to me. I have often admired the way interior designers choose just the right large accessory to make what they often call a statement. A couple of weeks ago, on a tour of the Chelsea art galleries, I fell in love. The objects of my affection were Julian Schnabel's ``Big Girl Paintings,'' a series of larger than life portraits of all-American blondes and brunettes, by an American artist who is known for being larger than life himself. Meanwhile, I was left wondering how anyone could ever get one of these beauties into a house. What kind of wall space would be needed to accommodate paintings that range in height from 7 feet to 13 feet? By Suzanne Slesin.  FAVORITES-BIKE (Undated) _ A folding bike made in Oregon, and, for good measure, a Dutch-speaking child in Amsterdam. By Andrea Siegel.  PORTLAND-36-HOURS (Undated) _ Though it is often overshadowed by its more glamorous neighbors to the north (Seattle) and south (San Francisco), Portland, Ore. has one thing in its favor: the weather. The average daytime temperature from June through September is in the 70s, and the average rainfall is usually 1 inch per month. No wonder the prime activities for the locals include soaking up the sunshine in state's many parks and exotic gardens or a downing a local ale at a street-side table at one of the city's dozens of brew pubs. By Kathy McCleary.  AUTO-AUDIO (Undated) _ A car is not a concert hall _ too cramped, too noisy, too weird acoustically. Yet there is hardly a carmaker today that does not offer a premium-priced sound system that at least implicitly promises to bring you concert-hall sound on the road. That promise is not credible, but there has been a revolution in the way factory-installed car stereos are marketed and in how they sound. Until cars become so automated that we can drive them and watch television, a good sound system is the best way to ease the tedium of a long drive. By Ivan Berger.  GAS-GUZZLING-TAX (Undated) _ Conspicuous consumption is not enshrined in the Constitution, but even though some Americans seem to regard ownership of expensive gasoline hogs as a birthright, the government makes them pay for their choices with luxury and gas-guzzler taxes. The burden is getting lighter, though, because the federal luxury tax on cars will be eliminated at the end of the year. By Cheryl Jensen.  MOTEL-LIVING (Undated) _ The story of a couple who wanted to buy a second home, but bought a motel instead. By Terry Trucco.

CULTURE AND ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' code)  FEATURES  NEWMAN-RETROSPECTIVE (Philadelphia) _ The Barnett Newman retrospective at the Philadelphia Museum of Art makes such an eloquent argument for Newman's radical and almost ludicrously ambitious achievement that it should help to dispel any kneejerk impulse you have to reject it or him. People had the impulse for years. (Many still do.) Newman was the classic struggling artist in New York who, perversely, grew to relish the role. He was born in 1905 on the Lower East Side and died in 1970. He once ran for mayor as a write-in candidate on an arts-education platform against Fiorello LaGuardia (not as a joke) and didn't start to produce art he considered worth saving before the mid-1940s. Until the late 1950s, on the rare occasions he had an exhibition, he was ridiculed when he wasn't simply ignored. His reputation as a major American painter, the textbook view today, didn't take hold until the 1960s. By Michael Kimmelman.  With photo, NYT8.  WESTERMANN-SCULPTURE (Washington) _ The American sculptor H.C. Westermann (1922-1981) is a hard nut to crack. Just when you think you've nailed down your feelings about his work, he does something disconcertingly corny or sexist or obvious. Walking through his large retrospective at the Hirshhorn Museum here is a little like being in a cartoon animation, with Bugs Bunny or Woody Woodpecker popping his head out of one gopher hole, then another and another, chortling his way across a big flat field. But Westermann's bad-boy antics were a form of pitiless scrutiny trained on himself and society _ its racism, warmongering, materialism, environmental profligacy and general hypocrisy. By Roberta Smith.  With photo.  GOLEM-THEATER (New York) _ Placing your hopes for survival in a lump of clay is a wish of last resort, born of either rage or faith. In Prague in the late 16th century, the Maharal, or rabbi, made just such a wish, fashioning a living tool of retribution out of earth and water and sending it forth to defy the city's vicious anti-Semites and defend the Jews. Such is the legend, dramatized in 1921 by H. Leivick in ``The Golem,'' and among the play's themes is that faith and rage can be dangerously difficult to tell apart. As Israelis and Palestinians persist in their agonizing war, the contemporary pertinence of ``The Golem'' is painfully apparent. And the play's awful conclusion, its depiction of vengeance turning tragically back upon the avenger, has everything to say about the perpetual cycle of violence that is stripping Jerusalem and its environs of their holiness and humanity. Bruce Weber reviews a new production of the play by the Manhattan Ensemble Theater.

OTHER ENTERTAINMENT  AIDS-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ The tale of Dr. Robert Gallo's role in the discovery of the virus that causes AIDS is one of those stories that wouldn't be believable as fiction. The narrative of John Crewdson's new book, ``Science Fictions,'' is bursting with allegations leveled at Gallo, his associates, rivals and enemies, that include deception, misconduct, incompetence, fraud, sabotage, back-stabbing, double-dealing, overstatements, half-truths, outright lies, a clandestine affair with a co-worker, a bribery attempt, denials, evasions, coverups and serial rewritings of history. All of this would be plausible in politics, but none of it is the normal stuff of science. Gallo has steadfastly maintained his innocence of all charges. Reviewed by Ed Regis.

As he faces the most daunting diplomatic challenge of his career, Powell will need all the optimism he can muster. A news analysis by Todd S. Purdum.  CHINA-GAYS (Shenzhen, China) _ Gone are the days when gays in China's cities lived completely closeted lives, and the Galaxy Club here is a giddy, liberated kind of place. Young men in tight jeans swoon together singing karaoke. Androgynous types drink beer and throw dice. But when the doors close at 2 or 3 a.m., many of these men will cross the border to the other world also inhabited by the vast majority of China's gay men _ that of husband and father. As gay clubs, newsletters and web sites multiply on the mainland, gay men in a few places like Shenzhen are enjoying choices and a kind of freedom that was unthinkable only a few years ago.

People had the impulse for years. (Many still do.) Newman was the classic struggling artist in New York who, perversely, grew to relish the role. He was born in 1905 on the Lower East Side and died in 1970. He once ran for mayor as a write-in candidate on an arts-education platform against Fiorello LaGuardia (not as a joke) and didn't start to produce art he considered worth saving before the mid-1940s. Until the late 1950s, on the rare occasions he had an exhibition, he was ridiculed when he wasn't simply ignored. His reputation as a major American painter, the textbook view today, didn't take hold until the 1960s. By Michael Kimmelman.  (ART ADV: Photo NYT8 is being sent to NYT photo clients.)  WESTERMANN-SCULPTURE (Washington) _ The American sculptor H.C. Westermann (1922-1981) is a hard nut to crack. Just when you think you've nailed down your feelings about his work, he does something disconcertingly corny or sexist or obvious. Walking through his large retrospective at the Hirshhorn Museum here is a little like being in a cartoon animation, with Bugs Bunny or Woody Woodpecker popping his head out of one gopher hole, then another and another, chortling his way across a big flat field. But Westermann's bad-boy antics were a form of pitiless scrutiny trained on himself and society _ its racism, warmongering, materialism, environmental profligacy and general hypocrisy. By Roberta Smith.  (ART ADV: Photo NYT7 is being sent to NYT photo clients.)  GOLEM-THEATER (New York) _ Placing your hopes for survival in a lump of clay is a wish of last resort, born of either rage or faith. In Prague in the late 16th century, the Maharal, or rabbi, made just such a wish, fashioning a living tool of retribution out of earth and water and sending it forth to defy the city's vicious anti-Semites and defend the Jews. Such is the legend, dramatized in 1921 by H. Leivick in ``The Golem,'' and among the play's themes is that faith and rage can be dangerously difficult to tell apart. As Israelis and Palestinians persist in their agonizing war, the contemporary pertinence of ``The Golem'' is painfully apparent. And the play's awful conclusion, its depiction of vengeance turning tragically back upon the avenger, has everything to say about the perpetual cycle of violence that is stripping Jerusalem and its environs of their holiness and humanity. Bruce Weber reviews a new production of the play by the Manhattan Ensemble Theater.

The narrative of John Crewdson's new book, ``Science Fictions,'' is bursting with allegations leveled at Gallo, his associates, rivals and enemies, that include deception, misconduct, incompetence, fraud, sabotage, back-stabbing, double-dealing, overstatements, half-truths, outright lies, a clandestine affair with a co-worker, a bribery attempt, denials, evasions, coverups and serial rewritings of history.

For some people, that means scaling the side of a mountain as they attempt rock climbing. For others it involves a bone-rattling canoe trip down the white water of a rushing river. For me, obsession led to the rafters of Yale University's Woolsey Hall, where I one day found myself hunched down and gingerly maneuvering across an 18-inch-wide plank, 50 feet above the floor, with nothing between me and the void but a flimsy-looking railing I was holding tightly in my grasp. I have spent much of my life seeking out pipe organs, and in New Haven, I had finally found one of the world's greatest. By Craig R. Whitney.  DELUXE-LOG-CABINS (Undated) _ A marriage of captains of industry with log cabins _ popping up from the Pennsylvania countryside to Lake Tahoe and the great Northwest _ has created a curious culture, and some contradictions. For one thing, the logs often cannot protect movers and shakers from their own work ethics, and a home office is often a well-worn room in these retreats. For another, while the outside of the homes are made of shorn trees, they are far from George Washington's log cabin. Inside are the latest amenities: Sub Zero refrigerators, floors made of slate from Shanghai, and Cypress hardwood imported from South America, a Viking wine cooler kept at 55 degrees. By Matt Richtel.  RITUAL-CANADIAN-HOCKEY (New York) _ Like many immigrants living in New York City, I wanted to preserve some of the customs of my homeland, which in my case is Canada. And, like many immigrants, I suspect, I have failed almost completely. Last July 4, I climbed up on the roof of my building to watch the fireworks over the East River, but I barely took notice of Canada's birthday three days earlier. On Canadian Thanksgiving, we ordered in Chinese, the surest sign I had given up my native customs for New York's.

COLLECTING-LARGE (Undated) _ Large things, particularly in small spaces, have often had a special appeal to me. I have often admired the way interior designers choose just the right large accessory to make what they often call a statement. A couple of weeks ago, on a tour of the Chelsea art galleries, I fell in love. The objects of my affection were Julian Schnabel's ``Big Girl Paintings,'' a series of larger than life portraits of all-American blondes and brunettes, by an American artist who is known for being larger than life himself. Meanwhile, I was left wondering how anyone could ever get one of these beauties into a house.

AUTO-AUDIO (Undated) _ A car is not a concert hall _ too cramped, too noisy, too weird acoustically. Yet there is hardly a carmaker today that does not offer a premium-priced sound system that at least implicitly promises to bring you concert-hall sound on the road. That promise is not credible, but there has been a revolution in the way factory-installed car stereos are marketed and in how they sound. Until cars become so automated that we can drive them and watch television, a good sound system is the best way to ease the tedium of a long drive. By Ivan Berger.  GAS-GUZZLING-TAX (Undated) _ Conspicuous consumption is not enshrined in the Constitution, but even though some Americans seem to regard ownership of expensive gasoline hogs as a birthright, the government makes them pay for their choices with luxury and gas-guzzler taxes. The burden is getting lighter, though, because the federal luxury tax on cars will be eliminated at the end of the year. By Cheryl Jensen.

It has a reasonably clever script, some good acting and characters about whom it is possible to care, however outlandish their circumstances may be.

Jordan tried to get into the Charlotte picture a few years back, but owner George Shinn wouldn't give him the authority he wanted. He then hitched his wagon to the Wizards, but would not, we suspect, have any problem getting out of that arrangement. Cunningham was one of the original owners of the expansion Heat and walked away with a ton of money when they were sold.

Plagued by rumors of drug usage, O'Neal entered rehab 18 months after the couple divorced, in 1992. In 1995, she lost joint custody of their three children _ Kevin, now 16, Sean, 14, and Emily, 11 _ and has been fighting ever since to regain her legal footing with the courts, as well as to restart her Oscar-winning film career. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"

Assistant Secretary of State Gene Dewey said in Bangkok that the U.S. ``supports the sanctity of life from conception to natural death,'' a statement, we suspect, the administration would not dare make with the cameras rolling at home. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"

Its genesis, I suspect, was at the Bush-Putin meeting two weeks ago in Camp David. Bush lavished fulsome praise on Russia's semi-dictator for his supposed vision of freedom and the rule of law; Vladimir Putin, after gladly joining Bush in sinking the Kyoto global warming treaty, agreed not only to vote our way in the U.N. but also to broker a compromise that would induce France and Germany not just to abstain, but to grudgingly support our occupation. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200310.gz"

During my recent time in Beijing, I was approached but much less frequently than I was 10 years ago, and mostly, I suspect, because the 15-minute walk between my hotel and the office, along Jian Guo Men Wai Avenue, is chockablock with hotels, embassies, imported-goods stores and even two Starbucks coffee shops. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200311.gz"

"146553"	"I"	"suspect"	" How did we ind ourselves in such dispiriting straits? Much of the problem, I suspect, has to do with the obsessively star-driven nature of Hollywood filmmaking these days, a tautology from which no new stars can emerge. Which is to say: In order to sell a big movie, you need a big star.MDBR/,.MDNM/ but in order to become a big star, you need to appear in a big movie. Hollywood has tried to compensate for this hermetically sealed system by grooming would-e future stars alongside established superstars (Josh Hartnett opposite Harrison Ford in Hollywood Homicide, Heath Ledger opposite Mel Gibson in The Patriot) -- a strategy that has repeatedly failed. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"

I touched database with Google and can offer only one previous citation of that particular mouth-filler: a February 2002 use by a blogger who styles himself LoneRanger. It is related, I suspect, to hoosydingy, a word I have long used as a nonsense substitute when a specific term has slipped my mind. But even though I have tried all the variant spellings, I cannot find hoosydingy -- hoosiedinghy? -- in print anywhere.

"153459"	"we"	"suspect"	" Here's a Father's Day gift for the whole family. Some of these short essays were written by men about their experiences as parents, but most contributors look toward the older generation and write about their fathers. The result is some multiple-hanky reading that tends to reflect unabashed affection, in contrast, we suspect, to what the same writers would say about their mothers. A few keep the book from becoming smarmy by writing about some childhood wound, as when actor Beau Bridges describes, with lingering bewilderment, a trauma he suffered on a Little League baseball team coached by his father, Lloyd. Others are refreshingly ordinary. Beth Kephart's dad was an engineer, which meant that she had no idea what he did, and yet her brief essay is one of the most moving. Billie Jean King describes, humorously, how competitive her father was, yet when she showed poor sportsmanship as a youngster he threatened to cut her tennis racket in half with a power saw. Other contributors include Jimmy Buffett, Conan O'Brien, Kelly Ripa, Jon Stewart and Nina Totenberg. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"

"154376"	"I"	"suspect"	" Part of what he likes about it, I suspect, is that Audiard respects the uniqueness of the reckless, feverish movie aesthetic of the '70s, and has the wit to recognize the absurdity of trying to re-create it. Toback's film, the French director says, is very tragic, very fatalistic, and the ending is very dark, and those are also signs of its time. I wanted to give it a different, more realistic feeling. And James Toback -- with a bemused smile, and looking, perhaps, a little surprised to have survived the relentless ferocity of his '70s self -- clearly appreciates the spin Audiard has put on his story: It's as if someone has taken a dream of mine and re-dreamed it -- and at the end says, 'By the way, it wasn't a nightmare; it was just a dream.'

OPERA-SALZBURG (Salzburg, Austria) -- Cultural festivals do not get much more glamorous than the one that takes place every summer in this immaculately preserved Baroque city. At the opera here last month, the audience included men in sleek tuxedos and women in gowns that evoked the splendor of imperial ages past. You might have imagined that they were streaming in for some music by Mozart, the local hero, but this summer Salzburg opened its festival on a different, more complex note. Austria's elite was turning out for a dark opera called The Branded, by Franz Schreker. In a way it was as much a political event as a cultural one, a gesture of musical reparation. Schreker, an Austrian-Jewish composer whose career suffered under the Nazis, died after a stroke in 1934. His music was later banned and mostly forgotten. This year, the festival has tried to restore some honor to his name and to remind the public of what was once in its midst. By Jeremy Eichler.  MOVIES-CARELL (Los Angeles) -- After more than two decades of life as a sidekick, a bit player, the guy who comes in, gets his laughs and then gets out of the way, Steve Carell finds it slightly hilarious that his face is on billboards, all over town; that there are unfounded but not automatically disbelieved rumors that he might be the next Batman villain; that television shows and magazines want to talk to him. It's a bit bizarre, he is saying, in the middle of a hurried lunch at his hotel. The 40-Year-Old Virgin is the R-rated comedy opening Aug. 19 in which Carell, who came up with the idea and was a co-writer, plays the title character. Universal clearly believes that the young-adult audience that went big for this summer's Wedding Crashers and last year's Anchorman will make 40-Year-Old Virgin a hit. By Joe Rhodes.  MOVIES-GILLIAM (Undated) -- Terry Gilliam filmed his newest movie, Tideland, in Saskatchewan last fall, racing to complete the location shots before winter set in. The Mitch Cullin novel on which the film is based is mostly set in West Texas, but Gilliam had substituted the Canadian prairie instead. The evening after he wrapped, it started to snow, and the cast, crew and director all saw this as an omen. If this had been a Gilliam production beset by the kind of bad fortune that has sometimes clung to his movies, the snow would have blown in much sooner, 5 or 6 feet of it; the cameras would have frozen, turning the fingers of the cinematographer, Nicola Pecorini, black with frostbite; the stars would have been evacuated by chopper -- or rather, the budget having most likely run out, by dog sled. Tideland went on to be finished on schedule, moreover, and will have its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival next month. Meanwhile, the director has another movie, The Brothers Grimm, starring Matt Damon (with 19th-century bad hair) and Heath Ledger, opening in this country Aug. 26, after more than a year of disputes and postponements. Together, the two films mark the end of the longest dry spell in Gilliam's 31-year career. By Charles McGrath.  TV-PRISON-BREAK (Undated) -- The plot: A man purposely gets himself sent to prison in order to break someone out. That was the bare-bones gimmick around which the producing team of Marty Adelstein and Dawn Parouse asked Paul Scheuring to write a television series in September 2003. I thought it was a pretty good idea, Scheuring recalled during a recent interview at the Fox offices in Los Angeles. It was just a matter of why would anybody do anything that stupid? And why would they believe they could do it? Charged with answering those questions, Scheuring (a co-writer of the 2003 Vin Diesel movie A Man Apart) began crafting an elaborate narrative that would eventually become Prison Break, the Fox series that, in an early start to the fall television season, has its two-hour premiere on Aug. 29. By Kate Aurthur.  DANCE  DANCE-CANADIENS (Undated) -- Les Grands Ballets Canadiens used to be known as a solid but slightly musty small classical company. True, it produced the popular rock ballet Tommy in 1970, and its repertory contained work by internationally recognized ballet choreographers. But for the most part the company seemed more worthy than exciting. Then along came Gradimir Pankov, who became artistic director in 2000. Pankov, a Macedonian dancer and master teacher who directed European troupes like the Nederlands Dans Theater II and Cullberg Ballet, had a decidedly different vision, one that included moving the troupe irrevocably into the 21st century. The result will be on view this week at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass., in a new version of Les Noces by Stijn Celis, a Belgian choreographer and set designer who directs the Bern Ballet in Switzerland. By Jennifer Dunning.  ART AND ARCHITECTURE  WRIGHT-ARCHITECTURE (Los Angeles) -- In early 1924, after a tempestuous year in Los Angeles, Frank Lloyd Wright decided that the city was a desert of shallow effects and high-tailed it back to the Midwest. Angelenos didn't like him much either. Developers stood him up. Hollywood spurned him. What he did build, he couldn't even get mentioned in Architectural Digest. Decades later, while other Wright properties around the country were becoming pilgrimage sites, the Los Angeles houses were ignored and left to deteriorate. Today, there is new-found interest in them. By Hugh Eakin.  BLACKSMITH-ARTIST (Sante Fe, N.M.) -- War has been very much on Tom Joyce's mind lately. Recently he has been sampling soils at old battlefields in New Mexico. Friends around the globe have sent samples from places as diverse as Waterloo, site of Napoleon's 1815 defeat, and Gaugamela, east of modern-day Mosul in northern Iraq, where Alexander the Great defeated Darius III of Persia in 331 B.C. The dirt goes into 65 iron cannonball-size boulders that Joyce has forged as time capsules of human conflict. Holes drilled into them hold thimblefuls of once-bloodied earth; each is covered by an identifying label of smelted bullet lead. Stacked into 5-foot piles that Joyce calls Memorial Cairns, the sculptures are on view in an exhibition of Joyce's work at EVO Gallery here through Sept. 10. By Ellen Berkovitch.

Kochman hurried out of the elevator onto the 17th-floor of an office tower in West Palm Beach, where the KL Group, a hedge fund advisory firm, was based. Normally bustling with activity, the place was eerily quiet that morning as Kochman strode past the elegant conference rooms toward his destination: the corner office of Won Sok Lee, one of the firm's principals. Two days earlier, officials from the Securities and Exchange Commission had unexpectedly visited KL's offices, demanding to see documents. Now some employees were reporting that Lee was missing -- along with the money in the funds' accounts. Kochman, a prominent trust and estate lawyer in Palm Beach, had much to lose. Not only had he put all of his family's savings, about $4 million, in the fund, but he had also recently staked his professional future on the firm, becoming one of its principals. So when someone with keys to Lee's office asked him why he wanted to go in that morning, a tearful Kochman, 56, collapsed on his knees and said, It's gone. It's all gone, according to a person who witnessed the event. The money is missing and Won has jumped ship.

FREQUENT-FLIER-MILES (Undated) -- Some frequent fliers' ears are perking up at talk of possible bankruptcy filings at Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines.

ECON-COLUMN (Washington) -- When Congress comes back from its summer recess, one of the first things Senate Republicans will try to do, again, is kill the estate tax.

But the accounts have been controversial since their introduction in January 2004. Depending on whom you ask, they either are a wonderful tool to help Americans become wiser, more price-conscious health care consumers, or are just another way for employers to pass along more health care expenses to their workers.

NY-PHILLY-EMIGRES (Philadelphia) -- Philadelphians often refer to their city as the sixth borough because of the wave of artistic migration from New York to Philadelphia. Young creative types are moving by the droves, looking for a more affordable living in an art-friendly city. In the backdrop is Philadelphia's burgeoning pop culture -- indie bands, galleries, avant-garde restaurants and boutiques owned or run by former New Yorkers. By Jessica Pressler.

ETIQUETTE-UPSURGE (Los Angeles) -- Although there are no hard numbers on this, the etiquette industry (if that is the proper term) appears to be enjoying a sort of renaissance, if not a neo-Victorian age. Instructors, many of them working individually with clients as etiquette consultants, almost uniformly say there is a growing demand for their services. The upsurge, they say, is being driven not just by parents who want their children to eat without repulsing dinner guests. More adults are also signing up for etiquette instruction. Motivations vary. Some clients believe that sharpening their social skills -- how they hold a fork, enter a room, make conversation -- will make them feel more confident. Others hope that a bit of social grace will give them an edge in the competition for jobs and dates, help them stand out among the barbarians. By Mireya Navarro.  With photo.  KEVIN-BENTLEY (San Francisco) -- People could hardly have been expected to have safe sex before the concept existed, as Edmund White once pointed out, and this thought is worth keeping in mind when you pick up Let's Shut Out the World. Its author, Kevin Bentley, 49, an editor and a writer with a small but devoted Bay Area following, happens to be one of the rare men of his generation who reveled in the libertinism for which 1970s San Francisco was infamous and survived to tell the tale. By Guy Trebay.  With photo.  PART-TIME-PETS (New York) -- Pets in New York City are both privileged and pitied. While often pampered to the point of fetishization by their owners, they are also often more familiar with the feeling of sisal and concrete underfoot than gravel and grass. But even for animal lovers, city pets are usually more difficult to keep than their country cousins. There are the small apartments, the roommates, the building regulations, the allergies and the lack of outdoor spaces. So New Yorkers who cannot live without the footsteps of a millipede or the purr of a cat are turning to part-time solutions. By Anna Jane Grossman.  With photo.  MODERN-LOVE (Undated) -- Confessions of a meddling roommate. By Kirsten Allen Major.

"156721"	"I"	"suspect"	" ST. PETERSBURG - Against all odds, he seems relaxed. The voice is soothing. The eyelids, I suspect, will droop on demand. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"156795"	"I"	"suspect"	" And so someday, I suspect, we will be freed from the clash of scientists and priests. In the meantime, as we struggle with stem cell research, assisted dying and evolutionary theory, it is hard not to conclude that we're managing the schism rather poorly. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"159726"	"I"	"suspect"	" Arguably, New England's offense has been fine this year, but the defense is in desperate need of help and, I suspect, Belichick is spread too thin to devote the attention necessary to get things back on track. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"

"159919"	"I"	"suspect"	" While some may argue that Dickens is really too big a morsel to be swallowed by text, the 'Great Inimitable' himself began working life as a shorthand writer and he would, I suspect, have approved of the brevity if nothing else, he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"

"160959"	"I"	"suspect"	" And there will be, I suspect, some undertone in the media coverage to follow. There will be a mention -- tangentially, perhaps -- of the pressure of being the son of a celebrity. People, hopefully against their better natures, will find themselves asking whether the 6-foot-7 James felt he would come up short by not playing in the NFL in which his father coaches for the Indianapolis Colts, or saw in his dad's professional success a mountain that he could never scale, or something like that. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"161216"	"we"	"suspect"	" In 2002, a magazine editor suggested that poker writer McManus (Positively Fifth Street) undergo the three-day executive physical at the Minnesota's Mayo Clinic and write about the experience. Having just suffered a gastrointestinal adventure (a mild case of diverticulosis), the 51-year-old McManus agreed, although he feared it would interfere with his long and satisfying relationship with cigarettes, booze and baked ziti. His book traces his progress, often humorously, through procedures that were invasive mentally and physically, but he also addresses the broader subjects of mortality and the state of medicine today. He repeatedly condemns President Bush for his stand on stem-cell research (McManus' daughter has diabetes) and, unfortunately, finds hope in the work of South Korean researcher Hwang Woo-suk, who last month, after this book was in print, admitted that he had fabricated results in his celebrated stem-cell study. Hwang's disgrace dampens the optimism in this book's final chapter but not, we suspect, McManus' resolve to fight on. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"

"161579"	"I"	"suspect"	" More and more, I suspect, what they will want is something they can't find at home. Although traditional moviegoing has proved resilient over the decades in the face of new technologies like television and the Internet, I wonder how well it can withstand the combined new forces of large-screen high-definition TV, accelerated broadband and at-home access -- via DVD or download -- to new films at the same time the pictures are released to theaters. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"163862"	"I"	"suspect"	" I drove this very expensive SUV last fall in crisp air and on clean roads. Under those conditions, it was hard not to think about how many of these rugged and capable off-road rigs are relegated to making summer treks from LA to Malibu, or Manhattan to the Hamptons.

"165152"	"I"	"suspect"	" He continued about the protester: She would, I suspect, count herself a lover of life, a lover of the unborn, a lover of God. And yet she spoke in harshness, hatred and frightened a little child. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"165697"	"I"	"suspect"	" The truth, I suspect, is rooted in some of how Thornton was treated here, and perhaps equally some of where he landed. There is that fit with Marleau, the lack of the C, the lower glare factor, the finishing touch that is Cheechoo's. If Thornton had landed in Chicago, another squad frighteningly low on surrounding talent, then I suspect he would be on vacation this week, too. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"165906"	"I"	"suspect"	" In short order we got the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Opera and Carnegie Hall, along with Ignace Paderewski and Marcella Sembrich, as well as the occasional Raphael Madonna. It was around this time that Morgan, well into middle age, began buying art, in part from a sense of patriotic duty, in part because that was what grandees did; and in part, I suspect, to lift himself out of bouts of despondency, to which he was prone. His first wife died from tuberculosis four months after their marriage, and he never fully recovered from the loss. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"

For the latest photos and graphics from The New York Times, go to www.nytimages.com.  INTERNATIONAL (i code)  AIR-PASSENGER-DATA (Paris) -- The European Union's highest court ruled on Tuesday that an agreement providing for the transfer of extensive personal data on air passengers to the authorities in the United States was illegal. The decision forces the two sides back to the negotiating table at a time when privacy safeguards are increasingly being debated. Under an agreement reached in 2004, European airlines are compelled to turn over 34 pieces of information about each passenger -- including name, address and credit card details -- within 15 minutes of departure for the United States. Lawyers have until Sept. 30 to address the concerns raised by the court. By Nicola Clark and Matthew L. Wald.  IRAQ (Baghdad, Iraq) -- Kimberly Dozier, the CBS News correspondent who was critically injured in a bomb attack in Baghdad on Monday, arrived in Germany on Tuesday for treatment at an American military hospital. A spokesman described her condition as stable and said that it was a good sign that Dozier was responsive during the flight from Iraq to Germany, opening her eyes on command. Other developments. By Richard A. Oppel Jr.  AFGHAN (Kabul, Afghanistan) -- Developments in the wake of anti-American rioting here which left 12 dead, 138 wounded and 106 people arrested. American and Afghan security forces patrolled the capital's main intersections. A night time curfew was in effect. By Carlotta Gall.  INDONESIA-QUAKE (Bantul, Indonesia) -- Many devastated villages in central Java had yet to receive aid three days after a powerful earthquake rocked the area, residents said on Tuesday. Yogyakarta airport reopened on Monday, and land traffic was rerouted today to ease congestion caused by the large numbers of aid workers arriving in the Bantul and Klaten districts, the two most severely devastated areas south of Yogyakarta. But villagers rooting through rubble in the blazing sun on Tuesday afternoon said no relief agencies had made contact with them. Officials estimate the death toll at more than 5,000, with 15,000 injured and more than 100,000 left homeless. Some think those numbers will rise, however, because more wrecked villages have been discovered by the military and aid agencies southeast of Bantul. By Peter Gelling.  With photos, NYT7-9.  SOMALIA (Nairobi, Kenya) -- Hospitals have generally been considered out of bounds during the long years of civil conflict in Somalia, but that changed this week when gunmen seized control of a key medical facility in northern Mogadishu, prompting many injured patients to flee. Medical services have been reduced to a minimum at the hospital, as militia fighters allied with warlord Muse Sudi Yalahow entered it and took up strategic positions on the roof on Monday afternoon, officials said. By Marc Lacey.  FRANCE-UNREST (Paris) -- About 150 masked youths wielding sticks and baseball bats clashed with police early Tuesday in a Paris suburb, the worst violence since the unrest that gripped the nation in November. Dozens of youths stoned the residence of the mayor of Montfermeil, east of Paris, and then engaged in fights with the police, who responded with rubber bullets, the Montfermeil city hall and the national police said. Three people were arrested. By Ariane Bernard.  BRITAIN-POLITICS (London) -- While Prime Minister Tony Blair is away on vacation, his deputy prime minister, John Prescott, comes under waves of criticism from within his Labor Party for living lavishly. By Alan Cowell.  MIDEAST (Jerusalem) -- Israeli ground troops staged their first major operation inside the Gaza Strip since pulling out of the coastal territory last year, when they ambushed Palestinians preparing to fire a rocket, the Israeli military said on Tuesday. The Israeli soldiers killed three members of the militant group, Islamic Jihad, who were handling the rocket, as well as a Palestinian security officer. The shootout, which lasted several hours, took place around midnight Monday at the northern edge of Gaza. Confrontations between Israeli troops and Palestinian militants take place daily in the West Bank. But Israel's nighttime incursion into Gaza marked a new tactic. By Greg Myre.  SCIENCE (a code)  AIDS-REPORT (Undated) -- The number of new HIV infections declined in a small number of countries, giving hope that new measures to combat the disease are working, according to a report from UNAIDS. Countries that showed declines included Kenya, Zimbabwe, Burkina Faso and urban areas of Haiti and some other parts of the Caribbean. But the epidemic continues to grow in China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Pakistan. By Lawrence K. Altman.  WARMING-HURRICANES (Undated) -- New studies lend support to the idea that global warming is increasing the intensity of hurricanes. By John Schwartz.  SPACE-WALK (Washington) -- NASA will preview a June 1 space walk by the two astronauts at the International Space Station. It is of more than routine interest because of a Russian plan to have an astronaut hit a golf ball into space, for a commercial. By Warren E. Leary.  WASHINGTON (w code)  IMMIG-CONGRESS (Washington) -- Lawmakers have received hundreds of bricks in the mail recently from people who are pushing lawmakers to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and drop a plan to create a guest worker program and a pathway to American citizenship for illegal immigrants. Many of the bricks include a note, saying: Build a wall. Secure the border. The leading House negotiator on immigration has denounced bipartisan legislation passed by the Senate last week, saying House Republicans would never support a bill that gives illegal immigrants a chance at citizenship. By Rachel L. Swarns.  SCOTUS (Washington) -- The Supreme Court on Tuesday declared, in a ruling affecting millions of government employees, that the Constitution does not always protect their free-speech rights for what they say on the job. In a 5-4 decision, the court held that public employees' free-speech rights are protected when they speak out as citizens on matters of public concern, but not when they speak out in the course of their official duties. The ruling came in a case that has been closely watched not just by public workers but by those who have worried that it could discourage whistle-blowers from speaking out about government misconduct. By Linda Greenhouse.  CONGRESS-JEFFERSON (Washington) -- An FBI raid on a congressman's office 10 days ago was heavily criticized today during hearings before the House Judiciary Committee, with members and witnesses saying it violated the separation of powers provided by the Constitution between the legislative and executive branches of government. This is a constitutional issue and a matter of grave concern, said James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., who called the unusual session at a time when most of Congress is in recess. The 18-hour raid on the offices of Rep. William Jefferson, D-La., took place without either a lawyer for the House of Representatives or Jefferson permitted to be in attendance. Constitutionally protected legislative material was almost certainly seized in the sweep, according to witnesses, who included law professors, a former member of the House and a former Justice Department official. By Carl Hulse.  EDUCATION (a code)  EDUCATION-COLUMN (Undated) -- Visiting with a girl in South Carolina who is one of five students in the country to win the top Scholastic writing award. Previous winners include Sylvia Plath, Truman Capote and Joyce Carol Oates. The prize is comparable to the Intel award in science. The girl attends an arts high school in Charleston, S.C., but what is so touching about her is that she lives on her own. Her parents deserted her, and she supports herself as a supermarket bag girl and restaurant hostess. Scholastic pays to have the winners and their parents fly to New York to accept the award in June; she is bringing along her teacher, her closest adult friend. By Michael Winerip.  DEECEE-COLLEGE-TUITION (Washington) -- A federal program established in 1999 provides students from the District of Columbia as much as $10,000 a year to pay the difference between in-state and out-of-state tuition at state universities, with lesser amounts of assistance at some private institutions. Although undeniably a success -- since the first grants were awarded in 2000, the number of students from the District who have enrolled in college has increased 35 percent, city officials said -- some lawmakers are arguing that it has become too expensive. This debate is sure to intensify as the legislation establishing the program comes up for reauthorization next year. By John Files.  FINANCIAL (f code)  TREASURY-APPOINT (Washington) -- A ledeall. President Bush on Tuesday announced the long-expected departure of Treasury Secretary John W. Snow and the nomination of Henry M. Paulson Jr., the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, as his successor. Bush praised Snow for his strong leadership, and said that Paulson would be a superb addition to my Cabinet. Bush praised Paulson for his lifetime of business experience and intimate knowledge of financial markets. Bush also singled out one other attribute, citing Paulson's ability to explain economic issues in clear terms. Administration officials have been frustrated at their lack of success in translating what they see as a strong economic performance into higher poll ratings. By Jim Rutenberg and Edmund L. Andrews.  With photos, NYT1-2.  An early lede has moved.  TREASURY-PAULSON (Undated) -- Henry Paulson oversaw a revolution at Goldman Sachs. Once the last major partnership on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs has become a more acquisitive, a more aggressive trading behemoth. A look at the skills Paulson will bring to his new job as treasury secretary. A profile by Landon Thomas Jr. and Jenny Anderson.  With photo, NYT3.  GOLDMAN-MARKETPLACE (Undated) -- With the departure of Henry Paulson to the Treasury, it is now Lloyd Blankfein's Goldman Sachs and is at top of the investment world. Paulson will be leaving at time when Goldman's vaunted ability to manage conflicts has drawn fire, when its bold bets have raised questions. By Jenny Anderson and Landon Thomas Jr.  SAKS-FASHION (New York) -- Under chief executive Fred Wilson, Saks Fifth Avenue's sales and profit plunged as the luxury retailer began to unabashedly chase after younger women, alienating many loyal shoppers. After Wilson was pushed out last year, industry observers wondered if his successor, Steve Sadove, would begin reversing his controversial decisions. This week they will get their answer when Sadove unveils Saks Collections, a private label clothing line intended to replace Real Clothes, a wildly successful, $60 million clothing line that Wilson inexplicably eliminated. Sadove is providing the first glimpse of his plans for turning around the fashion emporium by appealing its core shoppers -- women 35 to 55 years old who crave fashion, but not necessarily the latest skin-tight, chest-baring dresses off the runway. By Michael Barbaro.  VENEZUELA-OIL (Puerto La Cruz, Venezuela) -- The sludge in the glass jar on David Nelson's bookshelf here is thicker than molasses and once thought worthless. But Chevron, whose operations he runs in eastern Venezuela, has spent about $1 billion turning what was once called liquid coal into oil, helping transform a swath of scrub grass into one of the last great frontiers for oil production. That region, the 54-square-mile Orinoco Belt some 120 miles south of here, is in fact so promising that President Hugo Chavez's populist government has contracted oil companies from as far away as China and Russia to certify that it contains up to 235 billion barrels of recoverable oil, which if true would rival Saudi Arabia's reserves. By Juan Forero.  LEONHARDT-COLUMN (Undated) -- What does the price of gold say about the where the economy is headed? Is the long-feared hard landing finally a real threat? The weekly column, by David Leonhardt.  GM-APPOINT (Detroit) -- General Motors on Tuesday named Troy Clarke president of its struggling North American division. Clarke, president of GM Asia Pacific since 2004, will oversee day-to-day operations of GM's largest sales region. Rick Wagoner, the chief executive, has been leading the division since April 2005. By Nick Bunkley.  BASF-ENGELHARD (Frankfurt, Germany) -- BASF said Engelhard had abandoned its resistance to a $5 billion takeover. Engelhard's management decided to back BASF's twice-sweetened offer of $39 a share for the Iselin, N.J.-based company and will recommend that its shareholders accept it, the companies said. By Mark Landler.  KOREA-DAEWOO (Seoul, South Korea) -- The founder and former chairman of the collapsed conglomerate Daewoo is sentenced to 10 years in prison for a range of charges including embezzlement and accounting fraud. By Choe Sang-hun.  VODAFONE-EARNINGS (Undated) -- Vodafone reported the biggest annual loss in European corporate history on write-downs. The company said it would increase dividends and return $16.9 billion to owners. The net loss in the year through March was 21.9 billion pounds, compared with a profit of 6.41 billion pounds in the period a year earlier. The loss stems from a 23.5 billion-pound write-down of assets, mainly in Germany. By Timothy L. O'Brien.

FOOD AND DINING (d code)  DISCOVERING-FISH (Undated) -- When there were plenty of fish swimming in the oceans and rivers, Americans other than Catholics on Friday had little interest in them. Now that we have discovered the pleasures and benefits of fish, many varieties are nearly depleted and many have been tainted by industrial pollution. But what of the fish you can eat without worrying? Like the shy kid at the dance whose charms aren't readily apparent, unpopularity has kept some in circulation, waiting to be discovered.

SOLDIERS-CARE-PACKAGES (Undated) -- Familiar food has long comforted troops fighting wars in foreign countries, but the care package from home has changed because of the complicated logistics of the war in the Middle East, advancements in technology and the diverse and sophisticated palates of today's troops.

ICE-CREAM-SANDWICH (Undated) -- After transcending the boundaries of conventional flavors by using everything from herbs and vegetables to even lobster, which I recently sampled in Cape Cod, ice cream is returning to its roots. Well, sort of. The ice cream sandwich will take a star turn at restaurants and shops this summer, only this time, it isn't the slab of vanilla pressed between soft chocolate wafers. Today's offspring are all spruced up: fancy flavors invitingly situated between cookies of all kinds. Ice cream sandwiches are a whole new food group, declares Emily Luchetti, author of the upcoming cookbook A Passion for Ice Cream (Chronicle Books) and executive pastry chef at Farallon restaurant in San Francisco.

It's a small, ancient region in the northwestern corner of Castilla y Leon, almost on the eastern border of Galicia, which is due north of Portugal on the Atlantic coast. Most wine drinkers, I suspect, have never heard of Bierzo, but word is getting around. And if you get the opportunity to taste a good bottle, with its haunting, exotic wildflower, licorice and fruit flavors, you can't help but remember it.  This package includes an essay on tasters' impressions of the wines, a tabular report rating the wines and a recipe for a dish that goes with the wines. By Eric Asimov.

, he believes,	 BC-FLA-LOVING-HILL-ART (undated) Two singing boy cousins grow up immersed in music that springs from a tiny, intimate church in Seffner called Loving Hill Primitive Baptist Church. The church is 120 years old. Gospel music has bound generations of men and women to it. The two cousins, Jaquan, 14, and DaMarco, 11, inherited their gift from their mothers, both of whom are well known in area black churches. Jaquan links his gift to his mother's near-death from lupus four years ago. As therapy for her hands, she picked notes on the piano by ear. Jaquan learned to play sitting beside her. He sings, he believes, to keep his mother alive. Jaquan's cousin, DaMarco, is an 12-year-old baritone who has begun to sing duets with Jaquan. He learned to sing by sitting with his grandmother and her book of hymns at her kitchen table. Their talent is being nurtured by the church's music director. The families contemplate where music will take them. Closer to God? Or away from God? By JOHN BARRY. Art: 3 photos. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz

The players get 59.5 percent of leaguewide total gross revenues, so lower-revenue teams such as the Jaguars and Arizona Cardinals end up paying a higher percentage of their take into the pot than a team such as Washington because the Redskins gross much more money. What ends up happening, some clubs claim, is that while they pay upward of 70 percent of their total revenue to cover player costs, a team such as the Redskins is only using about 40 percent and hence has a competitive advantage if it uses that extra money on the kind of perks (including a ridiculous 20-man coaching staff in Washington, which is nearly one coach per position) that attract free agents. </P> 	nyt_eng_200607.gz
