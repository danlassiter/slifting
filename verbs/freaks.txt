"30190"	"he"	"freaks"	" ``Bushwhacked'' is ``Home Alone'' rejiggered and sent on an Outward Bound trip. It reminds us that a film can spend practically all its time outdoors and never once seem natural. It also suggests that Daniel Stern could use a course of ``Home Alone'' deprogramming. Playing one of the two slapstick ``Home Alone'' burglars has left him with what's beginning to look like a terminal case of mugger's lockjaw. His eyes widen, he freaks, he screams _ and he holds the pose a few beats too long. Too bad, because Stern has a flair for physical comedy. Certainly, he throws himself into it, and he uses his lanky body in windmilling ways that suggest an aptitude for clowning. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
