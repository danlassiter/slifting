All ROLL CALL stories carry the secondary slug of ``(Roll Call)'' below the slugline.)  By JULIET EILPERIN c.1995 Roll Call (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Several adjectives can be used to describe the most recent class of House pages: bright, ambitious, committed, and white.  The class that started Sept. 3 includes no African-Americans or Latinos, according to the Clerk's office.  Out of 64 House pages, only one, an Asian-American woman, is a minority.  The Clerk's office refused to release a description of the class to Roll Call last Tuesday. However, when an aide to Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) asked the Clerk's coordinator for the page program, Karen Quinn, on Wednesday whether any blacks or Latinos were enrolled this year, she responded, ``Not to my knowledge.''  Members of the Congressional Black and Hispanic Caucuses expressed outrage at the dramatic change in the page program's demographic makeup.  ``I suppose they couldn't find any Latino or African-American youngsters qualified enough to carry flags,'' said Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.). ``Who says we don't need affirmative action?''  Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) said the program offers a unique opportunity for underprivileged students who can't afford to visit Washington to witness the inner workings of national politics.  ``To neglect those kids, I think, is a real misfortune,'' Becerra said.  Conyers sent a letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) on Friday, asking him to disclose the percentage of minorities represented in the current page class.  ``In recent weeks, I have noticed a surprising dearth of African-American pages in the House of Representatives,'' Conyers wrote. ``In fact, I have observed few if any African-Americans on the House floor or in the halls of the House.''  Conyers, who has frequently nominated pages in the past, said he was optimistic the situation could be corrected soon. ``As Jesse Jackson says,'' he quipped to Roll Call, `` `Keep hope alive.' ''  Most members attributed the transformation of the pages' demographics to the GOP takeover. For years the Democrats had the lion's share of appointments, according to former Clerk of the House Donnald Anderson, with 54 out of 66 spots.  Now, that ratio has been reversed, a Clerk official said, with Republicans getting to fill 54 spots and the Democrats controlling ten.  Rep. Dale Kildee (D-Mich.), who sits on the Congressional Page Board, said the lack of minority representation may reflect the difference between Republican and Democratic districts.  ``Many Republicans come from suburban areas. Many Democrats come from urban areas, where there's larger numbers of African-Americans,'' Kildee said. ``It raises a concern.''  Though the Clerk's office does not release demographic statistics on previous page classes, members and former House officers agreed that this year's class marks a break with the past.  Anderson, who served Congress for 35 years, estimated that past classes averaged 15 to 20 minorities each. Between five and ten of these pages usually would be African-American, he added.  ``There's never been a quota,'' said Anderson, who served as a House page himself between 1959 and 1960. ``You can't tell members who to appoint. It usually reflects their constituents.''  The Congressional page system dates as far back as 1800, when Washington became the seat of the nation's government. The House Page School was integrated in 1966 and first began admitting girls in 1972. The Senate Page School became integrated and coeducational a year ahead of the House.  Page Board Chairman Bill Emerson (R-Mo.), who also served as a page, said he was unaware of the newest class's racial breakdown.  ``We have a very open system of application,'' Emerson said. ``I've never heard any complaints about the fairness of the system.''  The page board, with one Democratic and two Republican members, sets policy for the school but does not select the class.  In the past, the Democratic and Republican personnel boards oversaw the appointments, which were largely based on a member's sponsorship.  More senior Democrats had the first shot at making recommendations, while the GOP traditionally rotated appointments. Frequently, Anderson said, members would ask a group of constituents to choose a candidate.  In the 104th Congress, the Speaker's and Minority Leader's offices determine which members nominate pages. The applications are then forwarded to the Clerk's office, which verifies that each page is a junior in high school, is 16 years old, and has maintained a 3.0 grade point average in academic subjects.  Pages must be 16, Anderson explained, or Congress would risk violating the oppressive child labor provision in the Fair Labor Standards Act.  Though potential pages write essays as part of their applications, Anderson noted that references from people in the community and a member's support play a larger role in the decision.  ``They all read pretty much the same _ an interest in the affairs of the nation, a passion for politics,'' said Anderson, who remains an honorary member of the Page Board. ``In fact, when I read them, I could have been reading the essay I wrote myself in 1959.''

All ROLL CALL stories carry the secondary slug of ``(Roll Call)'' below the slugline.)  By JULIET EILPERIN c.1995 Roll Call (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Several adjectives can be used to describe the most recent class of House pages: bright, ambitious, committed, and white.  The class that started Sept. 3 includes no African-Americans or Latinos, according to the Clerk's office.  Out of 64 House pages, only one, an Asian-American woman, is a minority.  The Clerk's office refused to release a description of the class to Roll Call last Tuesday. However, when an aide to Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) asked the Clerk's coordinator for the page program, Karen Quinn, on Wednesday whether any blacks or Latinos were enrolled this year, she responded, ``Not to my knowledge.''  Members of the Congressional Black and Hispanic Caucuses expressed outrage at the dramatic change in the page program's demographic makeup.  ``I suppose they couldn't find any Latino or African-American youngsters qualified enough to carry flags,'' said Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.). ``Who says we don't need affirmative action?''  Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) said the program offers a unique opportunity for underprivileged students who can't afford to visit Washington to witness the inner workings of national politics.  ``To neglect those kids, I think, is a real misfortune,'' Becerra said.  Conyers sent a letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) on Friday, asking him to disclose the percentage of minorities represented in the current page class.  ``In recent weeks, I have noticed a surprising dearth of African-American pages in the House of Representatives,'' Conyers wrote. ``In fact, I have observed few if any African-Americans on the House floor or in the halls of the House.''  Conyers, who has frequently nominated pages in the past, said he was optimistic the situation could be corrected soon. ``As Jesse Jackson says,'' he quipped to Roll Call, `` `Keep hope alive.' ''  Most members attributed the transformation of the pages' demographics to the GOP takeover. For years the Democrats had the lion's share of appointments, according to former Clerk of the House Donnald Anderson, with 54 out of 66 spots.  Now, that ratio has been reversed, a Clerk official said, with Republicans getting to fill 54 spots and the Democrats controlling ten.  Rep. Dale Kildee (D-Mich.), who sits on the Congressional Page Board, said the lack of minority representation may reflect the difference between Republican and Democratic districts.  ``Many Republicans come from suburban areas. Many Democrats come from urban areas, where there's larger numbers of African-Americans,'' Kildee said. ``It raises a concern.''  Though the Clerk's office does not release demographic statistics on previous page classes, members and former House officers agreed that this year's class marks a break with the past.  Anderson, who served Congress for 35 years, estimated that past classes averaged 15 to 20 minorities each. Between five and ten of these pages usually would be African-American, he added.  ``There's never been a quota,'' said Anderson, who served as a House page himself between 1959 and 1960. ``You can't tell members who to appoint. It usually reflects their constituents.''  The Congressional page system dates as far back as 1800, when Washington became the seat of the nation's government. The House Page School was integrated in 1966 and first began admitting girls in 1972. The Senate Page School became integrated and coeducational a year ahead of the House.  Page Board Chairman Bill Emerson (R-Mo.), who also served as a page, said he was unaware of the newest class's racial breakdown.  ``We have a very open system of application,'' Emerson said. ``I've never heard any complaints about the fairness of the system.''  The page board, with one Democratic and two Republican members, sets policy for the school but does not select the class.  In the past, the Democratic and Republican personnel boards oversaw the appointments, which were largely based on a member's sponsorship.  More senior Democrats had the first shot at making recommendations, while the GOP traditionally rotated appointments. Frequently, Anderson said, members would ask a group of constituents to choose a candidate.  In the 104th Congress, the Speaker's and Minority Leader's offices determine which members nominate pages. The applications are then forwarded to the Clerk's office, which verifies that each page is a junior in high school, is 16 years old, and has maintained a 3.0 grade point average in academic subjects.  Pages must be 16, Anderson explained, or Congress would risk violating the oppressive child labor provision in the Fair Labor Standards Act.  Though potential pages write essays as part of their applications, Anderson noted that references from people in the community and a member's support play a larger role in the decision.  ``They all read pretty much the same _ an interest in the affairs of the nation, a passion for politics,'' said Anderson, who remains an honorary member of the Page Board. ``In fact, when I read them, I could have been reading the essay I wrote myself in 1959.''

All ROLL CALL stories carry the secondary slug of ``(Roll Call)'' below the slugline.)  By JULIET EILPERIN c.1995 Roll Call (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Several adjectives can be used to describe the most recent class of House pages: bright, ambitious, committed, and white.  The class that started Sept. 3 includes no African-Americans or Latinos, according to the Clerk's office.  Out of 64 House pages, only one, an Asian-American woman, is a minority.  The Clerk's office refused to release a description of the class to Roll Call last Tuesday. However, when an aide to Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) asked the Clerk's coordinator for the page program, Karen Quinn, on Wednesday whether any blacks or Latinos were enrolled this year, she responded, ``Not to my knowledge.''  Members of the Congressional Black and Hispanic Caucuses expressed outrage at the dramatic change in the page program's demographic makeup.  ``I suppose they couldn't find any Latino or African-American youngsters qualified enough to carry flags,'' said Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.). ``Who says we don't need affirmative action?''  Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) said the program offers a unique opportunity for underprivileged students who can't afford to visit Washington to witness the inner workings of national politics.  ``To neglect those kids, I think, is a real misfortune,'' Becerra said.  Conyers sent a letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) on Friday, asking him to disclose the percentage of minorities represented in the current page class.  ``In recent weeks, I have noticed a surprising dearth of African-American pages in the House of Representatives,'' Conyers wrote. ``In fact, I have observed few if any African-Americans on the House floor or in the halls of the House.''  Conyers, who has frequently nominated pages in the past, said he was optimistic the situation could be corrected soon. ``As Jesse Jackson says,'' he quipped to Roll Call, `` `Keep hope alive.' ''  Most members attributed the transformation of the pages' demographics to the GOP takeover. For years the Democrats had the lion's share of appointments, according to former Clerk of the House Donnald Anderson, with 54 out of 66 spots.  Now, that ratio has been reversed, a Clerk official said, with Republicans getting to fill 54 spots and the Democrats controlling ten.  Rep. Dale Kildee (D-Mich.), who sits on the Congressional Page Board, said the lack of minority representation may reflect the difference between Republican and Democratic districts.  ``Many Republicans come from suburban areas. Many Democrats come from urban areas, where there's larger numbers of African-Americans,'' Kildee said. ``It raises a concern.''  Though the Clerk's office does not release demographic statistics on previous page classes, members and former House officers agreed that this year's class marks a break with the past.  Anderson, who served Congress for 35 years, estimated that past classes averaged 15 to 20 minorities each. Between five and ten of these pages usually would be African-American, he added.  ``There's never been a quota,'' said Anderson, who served as a House page himself between 1959 and 1960. ``You can't tell members who to appoint. It usually reflects their constituents.''  The Congressional page system dates as far back as 1800, when Washington became the seat of the nation's government. The House Page School was integrated in 1966 and first began admitting girls in 1972. The Senate Page School became integrated and coeducational a year ahead of the House.  Page Board Chairman Bill Emerson (R-Mo.), who also served as a page, said he was unaware of the newest class's racial breakdown.  ``We have a very open system of application,'' Emerson said. ``I've never heard any complaints about the fairness of the system.''  The page board, with one Democratic and two Republican members, sets policy for the school but does not select the class.  In the past, the Democratic and Republican personnel boards oversaw the appointments, which were largely based on a member's sponsorship.  More senior Democrats had the first shot at making recommendations, while the GOP traditionally rotated appointments. Frequently, Anderson said, members would ask a group of constituents to choose a candidate.  In the 104th Congress, the Speaker's and Minority Leader's offices determine which members nominate pages. The applications are then forwarded to the Clerk's office, which verifies that each page is a junior in high school, is 16 years old, and has maintained a 3.0 grade point average in academic subjects.  Pages must be 16, Anderson explained, or Congress would risk violating the oppressive child labor provision in the Fair Labor Standards Act.  Though potential pages write essays as part of their applications, Anderson noted that references from people in the community and a member's support play a larger role in the decision.  ``They all read pretty much the same _ an interest in the affairs of the nation, a passion for politics,'' said Anderson, who remains an honorary member of the Page Board. ``In fact, when I read them, I could have been reading the essay I wrote myself in 1959.''

A PRESIDENTIAL REPORT CARD By Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. NYT Magazine. (Full-length article - 3,500 words - available on request.)  Which presidents were great? Near great? Average? Failures? Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., the writer and historian, and a former special assistant to Kennedy, has polled 32 historians.

(Full-length article - 4,400 words - available on request)  Enrollment at theological schools is up. Jewish, Protestant and Roman Catholic schools are accepting more older students, most of them leaving an earlier career behind - physicians, lawyers, CEOs, sales executives, engineers, nurses and others who have had successful first careers. But they've wondered, ``Is this all there is?'' - and decided to go for the higher power. ________________________________  5. SEARCH FOR ALOIS BRUNNER From Der Spiegel. 1,500 words. (English translation available.)  One of the world's most hunted criminals appears to be aging quietly in Syria. Alois Brunner, Adolf Eichmann's right-hand man, has used a series of aliases and addresses to disguise a career that took him from the pinnacle of the Third Reich to odd jobs as a coalminer and waiter after the war. He apparently found his way to the Middle East through a CIA-financed training program for Egypt's secret service. ______________________________  5. 1996 - WHERE THE WARS WERE By David Guest. Jane's Defence Weekly. 1,500 words.  The world made some notable investments in long-term peace in 1996. The U.N. was able to announce bans on chemical weapons, land mines and nuclear testing. But away from the chambers of the Security Council, short-term interests and local goals took precedence. In many of the world's conflicts it was, sadly, business as usual. ________________________________  6. ISRAEL REVEALS COMMANDO TACTICS IN LEBANON By James Bruce. Jane's Defence Weekly. 1,000 words  The Israeli army, shedding its characteristic reluctance to discuss military and intelligence operations, has disclosed that an elite force of commandos has been ambushing and attacking Hezbollah guerillas in southern Lebanon for the past 18 months. ________________________________ 7. 'PEACE PARK' BIORESERVE PROPOSED FOR UNTOUCHED KOREAN DMZ By Joy Drohan. Technology Review. 850 words  Before being torn by civil war, Koreans referred to their country as Keum-Su-Kang-San - the land of embroidered rivers and mountains. Now most of the natural resources in densely populated North and South Korea have been devoured. But there is a novel plan to preserve the Keum-Su-Kang-San in an unlikely spot : the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ.) If the proposal for the so-called ``peace park'' is adopted, it has the potential not only to preserve biodiversity in the region, but also to stop hostility between North and South Korea by fostering mutually sustainable development of the park's natural resources. ________________________________  8. GERMANY LOOKS EAST By Steve Crawshaw. From Prospect Magazine. 2,000 words. (N/A U.K.)  Is Germany taking over in central and eastern Europe? The country has re-established a dominant presence in its eastern hinterland. But, apart from friction with the Czechs, it has been welcomed, says Steve Crawshaw. ________________________________  9.

A PRESIDENTIAL REPORT CARD By ARTHUR M. SCHLESINGER JR. c.1996 The New York Times Magazine  Which presidents were great? Near great? Average? Failures? Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., the writer and historian, and a former special assistant to President John F. Kennedy, has polled 32 historians. Here they give a report card to Reagan, Bush and Clinton and the other U.S. presidents.

Jewish, Protestant and Roman Catholic schools are accepting more older students, most of them leaving an earlier career behind _ physicians, lawyers, CEOs sales executives, engineers, nurses and others who have had successful first careers. But they've wondered, ``Is this all there is?'' _ and decided to go for the higher power. Laura Pappano is a free-lance writer and a visiting scholar at the Murray Research Center, at Radcliffe College.

By HOLLY BRUBACH c.1996 The New York Times Magazine  Legend has it that the first time Charlotte Perriand _ now 93 and living in Paris _ approached Le Corbusier about a job, he responded, ``We don't embroider cushions here.'' A designer whose steel tubular chairs and tables are famous today, Perriand is still often portrayed as a talented woman who labored in a great man's shadow. But she's being rediscovered. At the Design Museum, in London, ``Charlotte Perriand: Modernist Pioneer,'' a retrospective, is on view through April 13. And the Architectural League is planning an exhibition of her work for late 1997 in New York.

"89527"	"he"	"responded"	" The Doug Flutie signing already has helped ticket sales in San Diego. About 1,000 have been sold in the last two weeks . . . The rest of the league is a little worried that the Houston Texans could make an immediate splash a year from now. By that time, the salary cap should be in the $72 million-$74 million range. The Texans definitely want to build through the draft, but as an NFL executive noted, ``It's scary what they could do right off the bat.'' The Texans will have the first pick in every round of the 2002 draft . . . The Frankfurt Galaxy's coaching staff has really been testing Michael Bishop's aptitude for the system he'll be running. Every now and then, the coaches will throw a curve at him, and so far he's handled it well. After a recent attempt to trick him, he responded, ``You guys have to do better than that.'' . . . Agent Angelo Wright said the Patriots would not offer more than $2 million a year to his top client, Ted Washington, who is close to signing with the Bears for a deal that should be close to what Eaton and Jason Ferguson signed for _ the $3 million range. ``There's no question he would have fit nicely there, and I know Belichick has always liked him,'' Wright said. ``We weren't going to settle for less than what we think we're worth, though. I had the best player at that position.'' . . . One of Pleasant's best friends is former Jet Ernie Logan, who can play tackle and end. It appeared Logan also would be a Patriot, but he's visiting Dallas this week, and something still may happen in Miami . . . Before the Patriots signed Marc Edwards, they had made inquiries about bringing back Sam Gash . . . The Patriots have hired Tom Shaw as speed consultant. He'll work with players from April to June. He recently worked with Robert Edwards at his New Orleans camp. Among those who have hired Shaw in the past are Rod Woodson, Deion Sanders, Eric Moulds, and Sam Madison . . . Robert Kraft went out of his way at the Super Bowl to say he would give players a ``second chance'' if they proved they had turned their life around. Well, there's a pretty good nose tackle sitting out there in the free agent market named Christian Peter, who would seem to fit the Patriots' style perfectly. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200103.gz"

"163385"	"he"	"responded"	" There has been speculation Rice could be cut or approached for a contract restructure to give the team some relief as it trims as much as $19-million in salary. But Rice likely would not be amenable. When the issue of a restructuring was raised with Condon, he responded, Who's had the most sacks in the NFL the last four years? That would be Rice, who has 561/2 since 2002, including 14 in 2005, third in the league. Rice might not be a topic of discussion, but Condon and Allen have plenty to talk about as the scouting combine begins today. Among Condon's other clients are Bucs offensive lineman Kenyatta Walker and defensive lineman Chris Hovan, who are scheduled to become free agents. Condon said the Bucs have interest in both. However, it's likely both will test the waters before making judgments on what the Bucs have to offer. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
