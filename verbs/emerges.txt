"26629"	"it"	"emerges"	" Both chairs and occupations, it emerges, once belonged to people who have died, and they become increasingly overwhelming reminders of everything Jody is laboring to forget: the evanescence of life and relationships, the horrors of disease and more specifically, the fact that he has yet to be tested for HIV. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"76847"	"it"	"emerges"	" The haracters, for the record, are Pyle and Stile, the ghosts of a pair of vaguely Beckettian tramps; Boo and Mickey, longtime pals who, it emerges, don't really know each other, and Johnny and JoJo, a couple of hit men, with the requisite New Jersey accents, who have reached a crisis in their careers. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"
"148477"	"it"	"emerges"	" Germany, it emerges, is no more hospitable to Cahit and Sibel than the couple's own family and background. It also isn't any better for non-Turkish Germans. That's tough on this unlikely pair, but it's not the end of them, either. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"174468"	"it"	"emerges"	" Is this Judi's film or Cate's, Barbara's or Sheba's? Barbara inspires shudders and may be off her rocker; Sheba is totally hot but also a sexual predator and, it emerges, rather stupid. Judi looks a fright, but that works to her actorly advantage as much as her marvelous enunciation. Cate slinks around, soaking up male and female attention with confidence. Of course both characters are utterly despicable, as is the story that invites us into its trap just to prove that we all have our self-serving reasons, including the filmmakers. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
