With that, she pushed open the door to the domain of former heavyweight champ Greg Page. He sat strapped in a wheelchair with a trachea tube in his neck and a blue bicycle rider helmet on his head.  He's lost 20 pounds over the past seven weeks and you especially see it in his legs. When he breathes, you hear a wheezing sound and every now and then he or someone else must wipe away the spittle that collects on his lips. Because his left side is paralyzed, his left arm is draped motionless across his stomach. At times, his head will drift toward his left shoulder.  The helmet and the Chicago Bulls cap beneath that cover the softball-sized indentation on the right side of his head. The piece of skull that once was there is being kept at University Hospital in Cincinnati. It was removed in a desperate attempt to save Page's life after a controversial heavyweight fight with Dale Crowe, March 9, at Peels Palace nightclub in Erlanger, Ky.  Actually, Page did die that night. ``Doctor's told me he was dead on the operating table and they brought him back,'' said Patricia Love, who is Teisha's mother and Greg's fiance. Some 48 hours after Page went through surgery to remove a blood clot, Patricia said he suffered two strokes and doctors initially gave him a 10 percent chance to survive.  Although the 42-year-old heavyweight has stunned everyone and beaten that dire count, he still has a long way to go. As you sit with him in his room _ where a rosary dangles from an IV stand and an assumed name is taped to the door out front _ Page sometimes seems to drift into a haze. Other times his eyes will lock onto you with that same knowing glare he used to stare down the likes of Alfredo Evangelista and Gerrie Coetzee.  Patricia and her 19-year-old daughter said he's begun to speak with a few short, whispered words. He'll also scrawl simple thoughts on a large sketch pad Teisha keeps. Around the very few outsiders who have seen him _ and, until now, no one from the press _ he clams up.  Although he has been visited by his ex-wife, his two teenage daughters, his mother and grandmother, he seems to respond best to Patricia and especially Teisha, whom her mother said, ``doesn't treat him like he's hurt.'' That was evident Thursday as she teased Page with Mr. Fluffy, the small, white stuffed sea lion that's one of her childhood keepsakes.  ``Here's Mr. Fluffy, you know you just loooove Mr. Fluffy,'' she said as she tickled Page's chin with the toy. As he shook his head very slightly, his right hand came up and he pulled the animal from her grasp. Laying it on the tray table in front of him, he balled the hand into a fist and proceeded to give Mr. Fluffy a soft, slow-motion pounding.  As you watched you sadly remembered this same right hand and how it dropped Scott LeDoux with one punch that 1981 night in the Bahamas. You remembered how it sent a searing right cross into James ``Quick'' Tillis that left him bloodied and senseless. And it was the same right that won Page the World Boxing Association heavyweight crown as he put Coetzee down and out in the eighth round of their 1984 title fight in South Africa.  That fight put Page on top of the boxing world. The kid from Louisville _ who came from the same hometown and high school as did Muhammad Ali and had possessed many of Ali's instinctive skills and reflexes _ had finally stepped from the ever-eclipsing shadow of The Greatest. Yet, that fight and the 176 others that made up Page's glorious amateur and pro career are nothing but undercard bouts when compared to his current battle.  Greg Page now is in the fight of his life.  It's ironic that as he goes after the greatest stakes of his life, he's doing so because of a fight where the purse was one of the most paltry of his career.  Page was paid just $1,500 to fight Crowe.  ``We never thought he'd take the fight,'' Covington promoter Terry O'Brien told a TV reporter after the fight.  Just a couple of hours before the fight, Page's trainer, James Doolin said he told his fighter: ``Let me stop this fight.'' Doolin said he sensed a lack of supervision at the fight. He saw there was no oxygen at ringside and no ambulance or emergency medical crew outside. A few days before the fight, questions _ that came with inadequate answers, Patricia Love said _ had been raised as to whether the promoter was covered with insurance and on fight night the issue still wasn't settled. Doolin even was skeptical of the ringside doctor _ 75-year-old Dr. Manny Mediodia _ whose prefight exam was far from the letter of the law for an aging fighter. Doolin, nor the Kentucky Athletic Commission, knew that Mediodia twice had had his medical license suspended in Ohio (in 1976 and again in 1991) for problems prescribing controlled substances.  Doolin claims he wrote several of his concerns on a piece of Howard Johnson's motel stationery and handed the sheet to each of the four state commissioners at the fight. He said all four dismissed him and Love said one of them later told her, ``James Doolin is making trouble.''  Page decided to honor his fight contract and besides that, Love admitted, ``we needed the money.''  She had recently quit her job and Page had given up his factory job with hopes of reviving his boxing career. Neither had insurance and both had bills. As Doolin put it, ``We were desperate for a fight.''  But the Greg Page who stepped into the ring against Crowe _ a mediocre heavyweight 18 years his junior _ was a far cry from the Louisville boxer who won 90 of 101 amateur fights, won his first 19 pro fights and rose to the moment against Coetzee. Five months after winning the title _ exactly 16 years ago from today _ Page lost it in his first defense to Cincinnati's Tony Tubbs. After that his career took a rollercoaster ride that never again reached championship heights. Twice _ once for two years, then three _ Page retired from the ring.  Along the way there were contract squabbles _ with everyone from family members to promoter Don King _ and more recently there's been some contentious divorce proceedings with Brenda, his wife of 14 years. The couple has two charming teenage daughters and they remain one of the things of which Page was most proud.  Everything else _ a Las Vegas condo, a Shelbyville, Ky., farm, the bankroll _ was lost. Last year Page moved back to Louisville and that's when his path crossed with Love, who had gone to high school with him and claims ``loved him from the first day I met him.''  After high school, Page went off to a pro career and Love to a five-year relationship with Page's older brother Dennis, who is Teisha's father. Both then had failed marriages, but Love said last year they met and just clicked: ``He had battle scars, I did, too, but together we healed and started putting together a life.''  She said Page dreamed of one more climb to the top of the boxing world and cleaned off the top shelf in their living room cabinet so he'd have a place for the Kentucky Heavyweight Championship belt he would win from Crowe.  Love had a new red and white satin robe and trunks made for Page. In turn he had shirts printed for her, her kids and himself. On the front they read: ``Been There, Done That,'' On the back, it added ``Gonna Do It Again!''  Although Page dreamed of glorious days ahead, he had lost three of his last five fights and, in the words of New York promoter Lou DiBella, had looked ``like a human punching bag'' in a sustained beating he took last June from Robert Davis. That fight got Page's license suspended in New York.  At Peels Palace, Page was matched against the house fighter. Crowe trains in the Shamrock Boxing gym, which is run by O'Brien, the promoter. Ray Acri, O'Brien's associate, said he and O'Brien hoped to get Crowe under contract after the fight. Love claimed the fight was brokered by Jack Kerns, a commissioner for the Kentucky Athletic Commission: ``He called one of Greg's friends and asked if Greg would fight Dale Crowe. There's something definitely wrong there. The commissioner is supposed to oversee the fights, not negotiate them.''  Kerns could not be reached for comment and O'Brien did not return phone calls for this story. As for Peels Palace, the place has had suspect boxing matchups before. None was more glaring than the heavyweight fight a couple of years ago between Dayton's Rocky Phillips and former champ Michael Dokes.  Dokes showed up grossly overweight and after promoter Don Elbaum admitted putting a finger on the scale to make him appear lighter, he still weighed in at 282 pounds. In the second round, Phillips broke the woeful Dokes' jaw. The next week, Phillips was sent to prison for transporting 80 pounds of marijuana into Ohio.  The Kentucky Athletic Commission raised no red flags that night and if it were up to commissioner Michael Mudd, it would be even more lax. ``I think that Kentucky rules are too strict the way they are,'' he's told reporters.  The rules certainly were not strict March 9. Although KAC law says fighters over 40 must have a full physical, Love said Page _ who weighed in at 238, a good weight for him _ only had his blood pressure checked in his hotel room before the fight.  Action in the 10th round of what many saw as a close fight was spirited and then with just over 10 seconds left, fight film shows Crowe landing a short left to Page's jaw. Page leaned into Crowe, who responded with a forceful, two-handed shove that sent the former champ flying backwards. Page's shoulders and neck slammed into the second rope up from the canvas and he just sort of hung there a second, then slid down onto his butt. With his left arm still draped over that second rope, he tried to get up, but promptly slumped back down and did not move as he was counted out by referee Mike Cunningham.  Love rushed to ringside where she begged Page ``Baby, talk to me.'' She said he just stared at her with ``fixed eyes. He had a reddish froth on his lips and he was sort of gurgling. We were yelling for a doctor and a few minutes later he finally showed up. He took Greg's blood pressure and then he broke an ammonia capsule under his nose. He told me Greg would be fine, he just needed bed rest. Then he broke another ammonia capsule, told me to hold it under Greg's nose and just left.''  O'Brien has claimed that the doctor told him Page needed neither oxygen nor an ambulance. Not that it mattered because none was at the fight. ``He looked okay to me,'' Mediodia told ESPN.  Meanwhile, Love started to scream at Kerns to call 911. Nine minutes after Page went down, someone finally did make that 911 call. Love estimates Page lay in the ring 20 to 30 minutes before the rescue squad finally started to transport him.  Page was taken to nearby St. Luke's West Hospital, which had no trauma unit, and then was transported to University Hospital in Cincinnati. ``It was just terrible,'' Love said. ``I looked back while we were in the ambulance and blood was gushing out Greg's nose and mouth. He had a major brain bleed. Then he started having seizures. Greg was as bad as you can be. He was in a coma. Until he got to University, he went two hours without proper medical treatment. The rescue team said he should have had oxygen at ringside.''  At University, Love said a piece of Page's skull was removed so his swelling brain had room to expand. Although Page survived the surgery to remove the blood clot, he then had the two strokes and Love said she was told he could ``end up a vegetable.''  ``I just refused to believe it and I just kept praying,'' she said. Page slowly stabilized and remained in intensive care for three weeks. Nineteen days ago, he was transferred back to Louisville to the Frazier Rehab Center.  Two weeks after he was hurt his ex-wife arrived and for several days there was tension among the women and the rest of the Page family. Eventually there's been a bit of a truce and while Brenda went back to Las Vegas, Love and her daughter _ along with Page's mother and grandmother _ are at his bedside daily.  At the home she shared with Page, Love has some of the keepsakes of his boxing career _ including the new trunks that were cut off him after the fateful fight. So much for the big dreams _ life now is a sobering reality.  ``Not long ago University Hospital told me it still hadn't gotten any response from the promoter if he had insurance,'' Love said. ``The medical bills have to be astronomical and they think he might have another seven weeks in the hospital. He's got to go back to Cincinnati to get the piece of his skull put back in and even when he comes home, we're going to need wheelchair ramps and leg braces and I don't know what all.''  She said anyone who wants to send Page a card can mail it to their home at 208 W. Kenwood Way, Louisville, 40214. Meanwhile, she and the therapists work daily with Page. Thumbing through the pad of his scrawled notes, you can't help notice a couple of his messages. One read ``God is Good.'' Another said ``Don King Stole My Money.''  Love shook her head. ``As sad as this is, I hope something good will come out of it. I hope what happened here helps to clean up Kentucky boxing and make it safer. Everything happens for a reason. The fact that Greg is still alive must mean God has something planned for him.''  That may be, but at midday Thursday the only plans for Page were from his therapists. They wanted to get him lifted from his wheelchair back into bed. The process took five minutes with Page fighting them much of the way. He gripped the side of his wheelchair tightly with his good hand and would not let go. The guy who showed no fear against the likes of Tim Witherspoon, Coetzee, Tubbs and Bonecrusher Smith, was now deathly afraid the therapists might drop him.  As you watched the therapist wrestle and coax and cajole him _ as you saw the fear in his eyes _ you remembered one other message the heavyweight had scrawled:  ``Get me out of here ... Please!''

"103809"	"they"	"did"	" The Golden State Warriors can officially move Marc Jackson Tuesday, and there appears to be no shortage of suitors. Jackson would prefer getting shipped to one of three places: Memphis, Indiana, or Orlando. All three teams could use a big man. One complication: Jackson has veto power over any deal, so the trade will have to have his imprimatur. He also may have to expand his list if he really wants out, which he does. Jackson, who should have been Rookie of the Year last year, signed an offer sheet with Houston Sept. 28, hoping the Warriors would not match it. Alas, they did, and the rules said he couldn't be traded until a certain date (Tuesday) and without his permission. Jackson earns $3.2 million, short money for an NBA big man. Any deal also would have to have the Warriors taking back a player making about that much, unless he is dealt to a team with a trade exception or rerouted somewhere in a multiteam deal. The Warriors just returned from a brutal, bruising road trip and, in a scheduling rarity, had five days off. They expect injured center Erick Dampier to be back for Monday night's game against Miami. ``We needed this break,'' said general manager Garry St. Jean. ``We needed time for guys to heal. We had a little mini-camp. It was good for us.'' . . . Attention, NBA: There's someone who actually wants to participate in the Slam-Dunk contest and he should be a, well, slam dunk. Pardon the parochialism, but Celtics rookie Kedrick Brown wants to be in the field and has electrifying possibilities. The guy has serious hops, as the Suns saw when he scraped the rafters at America West Arena coming down for a dunk. ``It'd be great,'' Brown said. ``I don't have anything special right now, but I would if I had a couple days to work on it.'' Said teammate Milt Palacio, ``He'd win the thing.'' The selection process is a bit sketchy. The NBA handles it internally, and it is believed a dartboard and dice are involved. Participants will be announced soon. All-Star weekend is Feb. 8-10 in Philadelphia. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"

He threw for more than 200 yards only four times, more than 231 only once. But when he had to make plays to win games, he did, rallying the Steelers from behind in the fourth quarter against Cincinnati, Dallas, Jacksonville and the New York Giants.

I mean, I wasn't much in favor of his politics, but I always try to look at a guy with what he's doing as an artist. Like when they hand out an Academy Award, it's not a good citizen's award. So when they gave (filmmaker Elia) Kazan his lifetime achievement award, there was a big stink about that. Are you going to applaud or stand up for him?

"158429"	"he"	"did"	" After Manny Ramirez's second home run off Freddie Garcia sliced Chicago's lead to 4-3 in the sixth inning, manager Ozzie Guillen summoned Damaso Marte. Marte had a disastrous outing, allowing a single by Trot Nixon and walking Bill Mueller and John Olerud to fill the bases. Guillen hustled out of the dugout to ask Hernandez, who was dropped from the starting rotation and almost did not make the playoff roster, to rescue the White Sox.

, he says,	 Lincoln took the turf and, not long thereafter, so did the university. Nebraska played on national television five times that year. It would be FieldTurf's big break, one that has led the company to the top of the synthetic field heap with, according to Gilman, about 60 percent of the total market share.

, he said,	 Thomas Lesinski, president of worldwide home entertainment for Paramount Pictures, whose idea it was to cut the lines, said that DVDs offered a second chance to market a movie. Changing the rating, he said, would allow the company to aim at family audiences, the sweet spot of the home entertainment business. Retailers, he said, preferred to give prominent shelf space to movies with G and PG ratings. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he said,	 David T. Friendly, one of the film's producers, said promotions for a film with a PG-13 rating could not include the word family. The cuts were a logical choice, he said, given how well the movie played to younger audiences. There's a dog in the movie that gets a lot of laughs, and kids really like it. So this was a possible way to expand our core audience. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he said,	 Lt. Allen Carpenter of the Louisiana State Police heads a task force, which also includes the crime bureau, focused on collecting the VINs of affected vehicles and making them available to the public. But the work did not begin until three and a half weeks after Katrina hit, he said, because the police were busy with public-safety matters and because New Orleans officials reversed their decision about opening the city. Out-of-state wreckers began moving vehicles out of the city, he said, and fliers appeared under windshields offering to pay top dollar for cars. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he said,	 Carpenter said he would have preferred to crush all vehicles recovered from the most affected parishes: Orleans, St. Bernard and Plaquemines. That would have cost less than decontaminating the vehicles, he said, and we'd be sure they wouldn't be on the market. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he said,	 But some insurance companies resisted across-the-board crushing, Carpenter added. Crushing cars for scrap metal generally brings in less money than selling them whole to rebuilders or marketing their dismantled parts, said Thomas C. O'Brien, chief executive of Insurance Auto Auctions. His company is one of several handling cars salvaged from affected areas on consignment for insurers and other customers who, he said, determine how they are marketed. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he said,	 But Peter Maresca, a comics collector, wasn't happy, he said in a recent telephone interview. Even the best preserved pages of Little Nemo in Slumberland were fast deteriorating. Soon no one would be able to see them the way they originally looked. Maresca wanted, he said, to publish a selection of Little Nemo comics just the way they appeared in the Sunday funnies: in the same colors, on rough matte paper that looked like newsprint, and at the same size. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he said,	 He approached numerous presses, but none would take it on, he explained. Finally he went to Art Spiegelman, the founder of Raw and the author of the very large comic book In the Shadow of No Towers, who suggested that Maresca publish it himself. So he did. It cost him, he said, something close to the price of a three-bedroom house in Kansas. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he said,	 Maresca ignored the imperfections in the newsprint and corrected only the color within the drawings. Then he put each on a new newsprint background. It was, he said, a little crazy. He was after an imperfect ideal. He said he wanted the finished product to look just as inconsistent as the original newspaper pages did. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz

In addition, he said, the company's print division was hampered by its online division, AOL, which features news generated by media outlets besides Time Inc. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz

As a result, he said, he expected tighter cost efficiencies and fewer new magazines. Time Inc. has essentially had a hiring freeze for the last four years.

But, she said, there are magazines that need reinventing and redesigning, and there will be turnover. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz

That automobile factory became one of the most extraordinary structures ever built for industry -- four stories high and 865 feet long, with 50,000 square feet of glass windows. Known as the Crystal Palace, it was, by 1913, responsible for producing half the automobiles sold in the United States.

That's especially true in travel. I always have people calling me, asking what's new, said Becky Williams, a travel agent who specializes in the Caribbean for Brownell Travel in Birmingham, Ala. They're looking for something different. This year, it seems, travelers heading to the Caribbean can take their pick of resorts: high design, over-the-top luxury, family oriented, all-inclusive, boutique. Need somewhere to park the yacht? No problem. A deluxe hotel with both a kids' program and an adults-only pool? Sure. If it's not there now, it will be soon. By Lisa Kalis.  TRAVEL-ARUBA (Undated) -- The investigation into the disappearance of the Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway dominated the cable-news programs throughout the summer. The nonstop news coverage also generated concern among tourism officials, travel agents and hotel operators that travel to Aruba, which relies on the United States for two-thirds of its business, would suffer a hit. Even as news media coverage subsided, calls for a boycott, most recently from the syndicated talk show host Dr. Phil McGraw in mid-September, continue. But so far travel agents have reported few cancellations, steady bookings and higher prices for accommodations. By Amy Gunderson.  TRAVEL-MONSERRAT (Undated) -- Still home, still nice is no catchy tourism slogan, but for the people of Montserrat, who have faced a trifecta of natural disasters in the past 16 years, it has become a sobering maxim to live by. Hurricane Hugo came first, hitting the island with fury in 1989. Then, the Soufriere Hills Volcano erupted in 1995 and delivered the final blow two years later when it covered the capital, Plymouth, in up to 20 feet of ash and rock, forcing the government to proclaim the city and the southern two-thirds of the 40-square-mile island uninhabitable. Two-thirds of the 12,000 inhabitants fled to find new homes abroad after the eruptions, and tourism left with them. Yet today, Monserrat's 13-square-mile safe zone -- beyond the threatening grips of the volcano -- is on the rebound. By Ryan Brandt.  TRAVEL-DOMINICAN-REPUBLIC (Undated) -- A small, pothole-laden city in the central valley of the Dominican Republic, anchored by a concrete-pillared, irregularly shaped cathedral whose decidedly ugly look takes some time to grow on you, La Vega isn't high on the to-do list of most travelers. There are no beaches, a few tolerable hotels, some unremarkable restaurants and, for 11 months of the year, no real reason to go there. But that changes in February, when Carnaval comes to town. Then, the quiet streets of La Vega are crowded with visitors who seem to double the population of 200,000, the clubs fill with deafening music that keeps their customers dancing until almost dawn, and -- most notably -- grotesquely beautiful, intricately decorated, jingle-bell-draped demons race through the streets of the jam-packed town every Sunday, whipping anyone who dares to get in their way with reinforced cow bladders that carry a surprisingly nasty sting. By Seth Kugel.  TRAVEL-VIEQUES (Undated) -- A year ago, Vieques was at a crossroads: Left turn, it would have been on its way to becoming a bit like Key West before the trinket shops and theme bars eclipsed its bohemian allure. Right turn, it would have headed in the direction of St. Bart's -- a tropical playground where the painfully chic take their Hermes towels and their diamond watches to the beach. But a year later, it's still Vieques, an island six miles off the southeastern coast of Puerto Rico, just 21 miles long and four miles wide, with two small towns, lots of cows and horses roaming free and a broad stubborn streak. For many reasons -- its rough-and-tumble terrain and its willfully unambitious culture among them -- the sleepy, enchanted island is highly resistant to change. By Christian L. Wright.

And nearly every week, it seems, imaging researchers announce another finding, a potential key to understanding depression, attention deficit disorder, anxiety. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, she said,	 The findings so far are encouraging, she said, but the idea that this is something for every severely depressed patient -- well, shame on us if we suggest that. The brain is a very big place and we had better have a very good idea of what we're doing before holding this out as a treatment. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, she said,	 Dorothy Bailey, 75, retired early from General Motors in 1967 after just a decade, but she still receives benefits. Now, she said, if the cost of medical coverage goes up too much she will have to make choices like whether to spend money on pills or groceries. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz

Since then, they said, the basement has flooded a few inches on a regular basis. Monday, the women estimated their basement held 10,000 gallons of water, and perhaps a few fish. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he said,	 This is something we could have done and something we should have done, said Paul Konerko, the first baseman who was named the most valuable player of the series. Then, showing that Konerko could hear the fans who were screaming about 50 feet away, he said, Now it's a matter of four more wins. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he said,	 That trend line is not a good one, Vitaglione said. He added that better reporting and investigation of child deaths might be a contributing factor to the rising number, but that probably doesn't explain it completely. One likely explanation, he said, is the struggling economy of the last five years, when North Carolina families in particular have suffered from job losses. Abusive behavior is more prevalent with financial hardship, he said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he said,	 I said, 'GM is going to come after our benefits,' recalled Loggans, who proudly displays a plaque on his living room wall honoring his 30 years as an electrician at General Motors. Gettelfinger, he said, looked him squarely in the eye and assured him that benefits for retirees were not going to be on the table. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he said,	 At 85, Alexander relies heavily on his GM health care.

Still, he said, I understand that we're going to have to pay our part. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, they said,	 Tedy Bruschi's return to his job as a New England Patriots linebacker Wednesday is unlikely to increase his risk of another stroke because surgeons corrected the heart defect they believe triggered the first attack in February, neurologists said Monday. As long as the heart surgery works, they said, Bruschi should be in no more danger than anyone else who tackles people for a living. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz

, he says,	 Young's words were as heartfelt as Bruschi's, but he put the onus where it does not belong. It's not the team's decision to make. Bruschi is an adult with a sound mind and, he says, a sound body. It is his decision to make, and he's made it. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz

, he said,	 Specter said he was impressed that Miers had handled numerous civil cases and served on the Dallas City Council, which, he said, gave her unique experience, especially in dealing with racial issues. There's been a lot of talk about her record being thin, but I think she has an extensive record, he said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he said,	 We were apparently mistaken as a nation in believing that there were weapons of mass destruction there, so that aspect of the entry into Iraq was obviously based on faulty intelligence, Romney told reporters after meeting with the families.

, he said,	 Robert Holden, head of the U.N. Coordination Center in the earthquake-damaged city of Muzaffarabad, the capital of the Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir, said on Sunday that the outside world did not seem to grasp the stakes in Pakistan.

, I think,	 Anyone who suggests that was misinformed, said Bill Strickland, Houston's longtime agent. I never once got that impression, irrespective of what was printed. But I think Isiah, having played the game, understood how things would evolve eventually. What was important, I think, was that when this moment arrived, everybody was on the same page. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz

, he did,	 He didn't make it on the initial surge, Hammond said, describing the quarterback sneak. Then he was sort of spun around and broke the plane of the goal line. Indeed, he did, but with visible help that violated a NCAA rule that says a player is not allowed to push a teammate forward. If a flag had been thrown, the push would have earned a 5-yard penalty. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz

, he said,	 Plischke said he believed that new side effects were unlikely because moxifloxacin had already been taken by 40 million people. Overuse leading to resistance and gray-market sales were unlikely, he said, because the drug would be mixed into a four-drug pill. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz
, he said,	 Also, he said, moxifloxacin's close chemical relatives ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin have been used for a decade to treat multidrug-resistant strains of TB. Ideally, tuberculosis specialists want to get treatment down to a few weeks, because many patients stop taking their pills when they stop coughing up blood and start feeling better. Ending treatment early encourages drug-resistant strains. </P> 	nyt_eng_200510.gz

"159212"	"I"	"did"	" Yeah, I did, Garcia said Tuesday. I was talking with Mark Buehrle and said I think he's (ticked off) because he didn't throw out the guy at home plate. And he got a big swing and hit the ball out of the ballpark. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"

"160239"	"I"	"did"	" Yeah, I did, actually, Galloway said. And it didn't work out that way. This one feels pretty good. I feel good. I feel like I'm in my first couple years. I'm excited about it. I'm excited about this team and where we have a chance to go this year. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"160327"	"I"	"did"	" Yes, I did, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, a conservative member of the German Parliament, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. The thing I believe is that the United States does obey international law, and Mrs. Merkel said that she believes it too. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"

"160666"	"he"	"did"	" But when it truly counted, he did, and changed the course of history. McCarthy's moment illustrated a favored maxim of his long-ago nemesis, the Kennedys - all of us can make a difference and each of us should try. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"161598"	"we"	"did"	" It would get real complicated if I tried to explain it, he said. There's not a person to blame. It was the system, you know what I mean? We created it, we did, all of us. So it's not like it's an individual's fault. If we were going to blame anybody for the system, we'd have to blame all of us. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"161732"	"he"	"did"	" Clearly, he did, Kennedy wrote, in an opinion joined by justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. The Controlled Substances Act gives the attorney general limited powers, to be exercised in specific ways, the court ruled. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"162274"	"I"	"did"	" Lee is quick-witted and gregarious. At the ceremony, she greeted a server at the mansion whom she remembered from luncheons past. I went back to my friends, and I told everyone that I'd met you, the young woman said. Nobody believed me. I said, 'Oh, yeah, I did, and she is the nicest, sweetest lady.

"162844"	"it"	"did"	" Did it tear my gut apart? Of course, it did, Castellano said of the off-season trades. It killed me inside. But as long as they stick with me, I'm going to stick with them. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"

"164777"	"he"	"did"	" Indeed, he did, but he only needed a few of them to nail down his second PGA Tour win. It came courtesy of supreme ball-striking, most notably at the par-5 11th when he rifled a 3-iron from 230 yards and reached the green in two to set up a two-putt birdie. Two holes later, he stiffed his 8-iron to 2 feet at the 159-yarder, then he kept the engines in overdrive at the par-4 15th, a driver, 7-iron combination leading to a 10-foot birdie roll. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"165255"	"I"	"did"	" I played fairly solid, but the places where I had to get it up and down, I did, said Crenshaw, who loved the Augusta National he first played it 34 years ago, but understands why it has had to be changed, so he accepts the tighter driving holes, the first cut of rough, the massive length. What hasn't changed, of course, is the aura, and for one day, anyway, he embraced the warm breezes and enjoyed his 18-hole walk over hallowed ground. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"165974"	"I"	"did"	" It was by Mirror Lake, before all the development, and I'd take them to the thrift stores and teach them how to shop. Someone said we looked like a line of ducklings. At the public library, a woman came up to me and said, Did you notice how many of your students are pregnant? Yes, I did, because we're a school for pregnant girls, I told her. She spit in my face.

"167530"	"he"	"did"	" Reached at home on Monday, Milch sounded tired of talking about the whole thing. But then, typically, he did, arguing that the entire idea of bringing closure to a series was egotistical, paraphrasing a William James idea: The world does not begin or end with the expiration of any living thing. It just becomes an exercise in bitterness or self-congratulation. As for his final perspective on the town of Deadwood, he seemed bittersweet.

"174418"	"I"	"did"	" He did, I did, and I managed not only to slow down well but also to lift my legs high enough so my feet didn't hit the padding on the edges of the platform.
