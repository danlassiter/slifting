"58732"	"he"	"meant"	" That, he meant, is what losers of monumental playoff struggles do. They think about plays they almost made, about calls they did not get. But that is how champions are separated from also-rans. As grueling as these four games have been, as much pride as the Knicks have shown, five games is five games and the second round is the second round. The bottom line is that the Knicks either win the next three or they reach the end of the same parallel path as their hockey cousins. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"
"126053"	"he"	"meant"	" You bleeding hearts kill me. You cashed in on the big attack? Like everybody else didn't? How many books got sold? How many careers got a bump? Americans understand that you can't let a good tragedy go to waste. What's that the president said? If somebody doesn't make a buck off it, the bad guys win, right? Allow me to quote my favorite moral philosopher, Karl Rove. Remember what he told Republican candidates back in June? ``Focus on war.'' (OK, he's no troubadour, but the man gets to the point.) D'you think he meant, ``Let's all focus on the war and have a moment of silence and feel blue?'' Of course not, knucklehead, he meant, ``Take the war, and run the wussy Democrats into the ground with it.'' So, you've got nothing to feel bad about. Then again, maybe you can do something with this. How about a new album about how bad you feel about that last album? Hey, you could call it ``The Writhing.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"129777"	"we"	"meant"	" ``What is up there, we meant,'' he said. Moore put it this way: `` `The Hours' was an intense movie to make, fraught with difficult choices and time pressures. But we all made the movie I think the book warranted.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"157113"	"she"	"meant"	" One was slightly out front, taking tiny steps, staring at the ground in front of her and looking worried. I just don't know why they have to cross my path, she said, and the others laughed. Lizards, she meant, and that funny summertime habit they have of zipping across the sidewalk right in front of you. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
