, he said,	 ARTISAN _ ATLANTA _ He cultivated an image as a romantic hero, a misunderstood genius. He lived off a reputation as a charming Frenchman with a mystique _ a self-exiled artist searching for his muse and public acceptance. Since 1987, Tristan Foison has worked as a composer, conductor, pianist and music teacher in Atlanta. Until, that is, he was caught in May claiming credit for a piece of music that wasn't his. In the weeks that followed, he dropped out of sight. On June 29, he left for his native Paris, telling at least four friends he needed to attend to his father who, he said, was dying of liver cancer. </P> 	nyt_eng_200107.gz

, I daresay,	 I have looked it up, and apparently ``East of Eden'' was released in England in July 1955. So I could have seen it in that brief space before Sept. 30 and the crumpled Porsche in the rolling blond hills outside Paso Robles, Calif. But I know I didn't: I was watching and playing cricket, I daresay, or trying to get a girlfriend. I was only 14 and, no matter the indignation I would have felt then if so charged, I'm sure now that I was a child still. What this amounts to is that James Dean was dead before I ever saw him. I must have read about ``East of Eden,'' must have gathered that this newcomer had arrived. But I didn't rush to the movie, because of cricket or girls, because I was sour on what I guessed was a Bible picture (there seemed so many then), and because I had no idea who Julie Harris was. </P> 	nyt_eng_200107.gz

By Clyde Haberman.  KOREA-U.S. (Seoul, South Korea) _ Secretary of State Colin Powell said that American officials are prepared to go anywhere at any time of North Korea's choosing to resume talks on a range of issues, including ending the regime's missile program and the posture of its conventional forces on the demilitarized zone.

WATER-ARSENIC (Washington) _ The House and perhaps the Senate may vote Friday on an amendment which would force the administration to implement the Clinton administration standard for arsenic in drinking water, which the Bush administration opposes and wants to revise. By Douglas Jehl.  FINANCIAL  (Will move in `f' news category)  ECON-REPORT (Washington) _ The U.S. economy slowed this spring to its weakest pace of growth in eight years, as businesses scrambled to cut spending. Second-quarter gross domestic product, a measure of all goods and services produced in the country, rose at a 0.7 percent annual rate, slower than the first quarter's revised pace of 1.3 percent, the Commerce Department said in its first estimate of second quarter growth. While the second quarter number was lower than expected, it buoyed hopes that the Federal Reserve will be more aggressive in cutting interest rates in the months ahead. By David Leonhardt.

ECON-DOLLAR (Washington) _ A growing chorus of economists and other experts are joining American manufacturers in complaining that the strong dollar is beginning to do damage to the economy. While the Bush Administration remains committed to its current policy, pressure may build to adopt a softer approach to the dollar if unemployment continues to rise. By Richard W. Stevenson.  TAIWAN-DELL (Hong Kong) _ In a sign that Taiwan's political standoff with China is starting to alienate its corporate customers, Dell Computer has bluntly criticized the island's reluctance to establish direct trade and transportation ties with the Chinese mainland. Taiwan's president has been under mounting pressure from Taiwanese industrialists to establish direct links with China. But this is the first time a foreign company has joined the chorus.

ENTERTAINMENT/ARTS  (Will move in `e' news category or as indicated)  ROME-FRESCOS (Rome) _ A close-up examination of San Pasquale Baylon chapel, a long-neglected nook of Santa Maria in Aracoeli, a Franciscan basilica in the center of Rome, last summer revealed ghostly images lying beneath the surface of the walls. The entire chapel, it seemed, was a painted palimpsest. Now, after months of careful paint peeling, what has been revealed are dazzling fragments of a late-medieval masterpiece completed shortly after 1285, thought to be by the Roman artist Pietro Cavallini _ a painter and mosaicist whose greatest works have been destroyed. Tommaso Strinati, the art historian who made the discovery, hopes that the fully restored fresco will not only rescue Cavallini's name from obscurity, but will upend the widespread notion that the first flowers of the Renaissance budded in Florence, not Rome. By Daniel Zalewski.  PRIVY-DIGGERS (Undated) _ For a weekend of digging in an old potty-hole in Lincoln, Neb., Tim Clements was hauled into court. The charges? Criminal trespass, vandalism and theft. What was Clements doing rooting in a privy? Looking for bottles, dishes and, as one privy-digger put it, lots of ``real cool stuff.'' Privy-diggers are the outhouse equivalent of the people who sweep over old battlefields with metal detectors looking for bullets and coins. But now some treasure hunters are finding that the privies they covet are already claimed by archaeologists. And the archaeologists are playing tough. They accuse the privy-diggers of destroying history. Privies, you see, are not only treasure troves, they are perfect archaeological sites. The things that go in tend to stay undisturbed. Or at least they used to. By Sarah Boxer.  ENGLISH-BIBLE (Undated) _ There is a moment in Victor Hugo's famous novel about the Parisian hunchback when the archdeacon of Notre Dame speaks to the King of France. He gestures from a printed book open on his desk toward the arches of the great cathedral. ``Alas,'' he says, ``This will kill that. The book will kill the building.'' The 16th-century priest was proclaiming that the printing press would shake the foundations of his church, that portable texts and popularized messages would undermine the authority of orthodox religion, stimulating dissent and encouraging independence. Hugo's novel is partly an account of the archdeacon's perverse attempts to retain his fading powers. ``Wide as the Waters,'' Benson Bobrick's subtle and surprising chronicle of biblical translation, doesn't mention Hugo's churchman, but it confirms his prophecy.

To a soundtrack of soothing melodies by Satie, Mozart, and Beethoven, the parachutes rose slowly toward the ceiling. Then, one by one, they crashed, stopping just shy of the floor.

To a soundtrack of soothing melodies by Satie, Mozart, and Beethoven, the parachutes rose slowly toward the ceiling. Then, one by one, they crashed, stopping just shy of the floor.

CULTURE AND ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' code, unless otherwise indicated)  Saturday Ideas Page  ROME-FRESCOS (Rome) _ A close-up examination of San Pasquale Baylon chapel, a long-neglected nook of Santa Maria in Aracoeli, a Franciscan basilica in the center of Rome, last summer revealed ghostly images lying beneath the surface of the walls. The entire chapel, it seemed, was a painted palimpsest. Now, after months of careful paint peeling, what has been revealed are dazzling fragments of a late-medieval masterpiece completed shortly after 1285, thought to be by the Roman artist Pietro Cavallini _ a painter and mosaicist whose greatest works have been destroyed. Tommaso Strinati, the art historian who made the discovery, hopes that the fully restored fresco will not only rescue Cavallini's name from obscurity, but will upend the widespread notion that the first flowers of the Renaissance budded in Florence, not Rome. By Daniel Zalewski.  PRIVY-DIGGERS (Undated) _ For a weekend of digging in an old potty-hole in Lincoln, Neb., Tim Clements was hauled into court. The charges? Criminal trespass, vandalism and theft. What was Clements doing rooting in a privy? Looking for bottles, dishes and, as one privy-digger put it, lots of ``real cool stuff.'' Privy-diggers are the outhouse equivalent of the people who sweep over old battlefields with metal detectors looking for bullets and coins. But now some treasure hunters are finding that the privies they covet are already claimed by archaeologists. And the archaeologists are playing tough. They accuse the privy-diggers of destroying history. Privies, you see, are not only treasure troves, they are perfect archaeological sites. The things that go in tend to stay undisturbed. Or at least they used to. By Sarah Boxer.  ENGLISH-BIBLE (Undated) _ There is a moment in Victor Hugo's famous novel about the Parisian hunchback when the archdeacon of Notre Dame speaks to the King of France. He gestures from a printed book open on his desk toward the arches of the great cathedral. ``Alas,'' he says, ``This will kill that. The book will kill the building.'' The 16th-century priest was proclaiming that the printing press would shake the foundations of his church, that portable texts and popularized messages would undermine the authority of orthodox religion, stimulating dissent and encouraging independence. Hugo's novel is partly an account of the archdeacon's perverse attempts to retain his fading powers. ``Wide as the Waters,'' Benson Bobrick's subtle and surprising chronicle of biblical translation, doesn't mention Hugo's churchman, but it confirms his prophecy. By Edward Rothstein.  SPORTS (``s'' code)  FBC-BERKOW-COLUMN (Undated) _ Sports of The Times column on the death of another football player in summer practice. Why is this happening? There are not enough precautions. And no matter what the diverse reasons are for the 17 or so players who have collapsed and died since 1995, practicing midday in Florida in July just doesn't make sense. Why take the chance? By Ira Berkow.  BOX-JONES-GONZALEZ (Los Angeles) _ Advance on Saturday's Roy Jones-Julio Gonzalez fight: Is this the bout where Jones will finally be tested by a talented challenger, or is it just another in a string of mismatches that have drawn criticism to Jones? By Mike Freeman.  CYC-TOUR-DE-FRANCE (St. Amand-Montrond, France) _ Lance Armstrong dominated the competition once again Friday, winning an individual time trial by nearly 1.5 minutes to tighten his grip on a third straight Tour de France title. Wearing the overall leader's yellow jersey, Armstrong rode the 37.88 miles in 1 hour, 14 minutes, 16 seconds _ an average speed of 30.5 mph _ to win a stage for the fourth time in this year's Tour.

, he says,	 Maybe, just maybe, Warner is beginning anew to stake his claim to territory long held by the likes of Ian McKellen and Derek Jacobi. If his work in ``Major Barbara,'' Shaw's rhetorical play about guns, good works and God, is any indication, he is well on his way. His suave, unfussy and thoroughly composed portrayal of Andrew Undershaft, the munitions magnate who professes himself unashamed of a calling that wreaks havoc on the world, has won glowing notices virtually across the board. Not bad for an actor who had so blotted out thoughts of the stage that, he says, he had even developed an irrational dislike of New York. </P> 	nyt_eng_200107.gz
, it seems,	 His gratitude is, it seems, no actory helping of humble pie. Trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, where, he said, his gangly bearing and lack of matinee-idol looks consigned him to roles as old men and butlers, Warner from the very start never thought of himself as a leading man or a film star, or particularly wanted to be either. That lack of ambition helps explain the crazy-quilt career he has stitched together over the years, ricocheting from highbrow assignments to low in movies as varied as Sam Peckinpah's ``Straw Dogs,'' Terry Gilliam's ``Time Bandits'' and Wes Craven's ``Scream 2.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200107.gz
, he said,	 Warner is still saddled with trying to explain what happened, and prefers to talk about it circumspectly. Many actors have had fear and confidence problems, he said, and then added that he wanted to make one other absolutely clear point: ``Drugs have never been part of my life, and I haven't had an alcoholic beverage in nearly 20 years. And also my colleagues back home, some of them think when I moved to America I stopped doing theater. Well, I moved to America in 1987, and I hadn't done any theater since '72.

This, you sense, was the home of a working man, one bursting with a pride that came not from what he had but from what he did. ``I never want to be anything more than I am, what I don't have I don't need,'' Armstrong wrote. </P> 	nyt_eng_200107.gz

By Clyde Haberman.  WASHINGTON  (Will move in ``w'' news file.)  WATER-ARSENIC (Washington) _ In a new setback to the White House on environmental policy, 19 House Republicans on Friday joined with 199 Democrats to bar the Bush administration from easing rules on arsenic in drinking water beyond those set under President Clinton. The move was a defeat for the House Republican leadership, and it was latest in a series of congressional rebukes to President Bush and his team over issues like offshore oil drilling, mining and energy exploration in national monuments. By Douglas Jehl.  PATIENT-RIGHTS (Washington) _ Congressional backers of a patients' bill of rights sent a blistering response Friday to President Bush's latest proposal on the issue, but invited Bush to enter high-stakes negotiations to achieve a legislative compromise. Lawmakers from both parties and both houses of Congress formulated the response, which was delivered to the White House by Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., the author of the bill favored by most House Democrats. By Robert Pear.  With photo, NYT7.  BUSH-CLEAN-AIR (Washington) _ The Bush administration aims to collapse several of the most contentious air-pollution enforcement programs into a flexible and potentially less stringent system strongly favored by leading electric utilities. The plan is the firmest indication to date the administration intends to overhaul the Clean Air Act in ways that answer the pleas of utilities, which have complained for many years that the agency's rules make it difficult for them to provide low-cost electricity to consumers and businesses. By Joseph Kahn.  FINANCIAL  (Will move in ``f'' news file.)  ECON-REPORT (Washington) _ Economic growth nearly halted in the second quarter of this year, as businesses made severe cuts in investment and consumer spending grew less quickly than it had at the start of the year, the government said Friday. The nation's economy is now in its weakest condition in a decade, although most economists believe that company's swift responses to the slowdown, combined with a tax cut and declining interest rates, have made an improvement likely in the coming months. The economy grew at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 0.7 percent in the three months that ended on June 30, the Department of Commerce reported in its initial estimate of economic activity in the second quarter. Overall spending by businesses and consumers actually fell slightly, but a surge in spending by state and local governments allowed the longest recorded expansion in the United States to extend into its 11th year.

WOMEN-TRAFFICKING (Velesta, Macedonia) _ This village, tucked down in the south-western corner of the country, near the border with Albania, is one of the strangest places in this part of the Balkans. It has the high-walled brick-built homes and rutted lanes typical of villages here, but amid the haybarns there are over a dozen neon-lit nightclubs and sex bars with names like Madonna and Paradiso. And beneath the strange combination of rural quiet and nighttime glitz, the place has a very sinister reputation. Hundreds of foreign women, mostly from former communist bloc countries, have passed through Velesta over the last few years.

TOP  Lede story:  WATER-ARSENIC (Washington) _ In a new setback to the White House on environmental policy, 19 House Republicans on Friday joined with 199 Democrats to bar the Bush administration from easing rules on arsenic in drinking water beyond those set under President Clinton. The move was a defeat for the House Republican leadership, and it was latest in a series of congressional rebukes to President Bush and his team over issues like offshore oil drilling, mining and energy exploration in national monuments.

ECON-REPORT (Washington) _ Economic growth nearly halted in the second quarter of this year, as businesses made severe cuts in investment and consumer spending grew less quickly than it had at the start of the year, the government said Friday. The nation's economy is now in its weakest condition in a decade, although most economists believe that company's swift responses to the slowdown, combined with a tax cut and declining interest rates, have made an improvement likely in the coming months.

FOLD  WOMEN-TRAFFICKING (Velesta, Macedonia) _ This village, tucked down in the south-western corner of the country, is one of the strangest places in this part of the Balkans. Amid the haybarns there are over a dozen neon-lit nightclubs and sex bars with names like Madonna and Paradiso. And beneath the strange combination of rural quiet and nighttime glitz, the place has a very sinister reputation.

Records suggested that the Roman artist Pietro Cavallini _ a painter and mosaicist whose greatest works have been destroyed _ spent years decorating Aracoeli toward the end of the 13th century. Yet only one small Cavallini fresco remained visible. Strinati wondered: had other Cavallini frescoes been painted over with inferior work?

The prosecutor's office said it would not oppose her release as long as she stayed in The Netherlands, but judges who must make the decision have not yet taken a stand. Plavsic, 71, a former biology professor and hardline Bosnian Serb nationalist, was a wartime deputy to the fugitive leader Radovan Karadzic. She went to the tribunal voluntarily once she learned she was wanted there, but applied for provisional release early this month.  SCOTLAND: EXTRADITION OF NAZI BEGINS  Authorities began extradition proceedings against Anton Gecas, 85, a resident of Edinburgh, who is wanted in Lithuania to stand trial on charges of genocide. The Simon Wiesenthal Center says Gecas, formerly Antanas Gecevicius, was an officer in the police battalion responsible for the deaths of thousands of Jews in Lithuania and Byelorussia between 1941 and 1943. Gecas is in an Edinburgh hospital and will be arrested when his health permits, a government spokesman said.  GERMANY: BERLIN WALL'S LONG SHADOW  Three pieces of the Berlin Wall at Leipziger Platz were dismantled for transport to the U.N. headquarters in New York where they will be put on display, city officials said. Berlin presented the segments to Secretary-General Kofi Annan earlier this month as a remembrance of the Cold War, as symbols to be placed in a memorial garden.  ASIA  PAKISTAN: INVITES INDIA  Following a gesture made at the recent Agra summit, the military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, has sent a formal invitation to India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, to visit Pakistan. Vajpayee gave his informal acceptance when the idea was first presented. No dates have been announced, but Indian officials have said it is unlikely that such a trip could be made this year.  INDIA: TURMOIL IN NAGALAND  After a week of violent protests in the state of Manipur, the government reversed an earlier decision and will restrict its cease-fire with the outlawed National Socialist Council of Nagalim to the state of Nagaland. The cease-fire had been expanded to include areas outside Nagaland, and citizens in neighboring states feared that had been a first step toward ethnic Nagas claiming more territory.  SRI LANKA: VIOLENCE SETS BACK AIRLINE  Sri Lankan Airlines, which had three of its aircraft destroyed in an attack on the country's main international airport by the Tamil Tiger rebels, reports that thousands of travel reservations to the island have been canceled. Before the attack business had been good for the carrier, said its chief executive, Peter Hill, but now the company will wait for the ``dust to settle'' before it even resumes advertising in Europe and the Far East.  NORTH KOREA: DROUGHT PUTS THOUSANDS IN PERIL  North Koreans face increasing starvation and disease as a result of another record drought, according to two U.N. agencies. The Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Program, relying on a recent joint mission to the North, say immediate food aid is needed to rescue thousands of North Koreans. Reservoirs and irrigation systems have dried up, they say, rivers have run dry and farmers have abandoned land.

He lived off a reputation as a charming Frenchman with a mystique _ a self-exiled artist searching for his muse and public acceptance. Since 1987, Tristan Foison has worked as a composer, conductor, pianist and music teacher in Atlanta. Until, that is, he was caught in May claiming credit for a piece of music that wasn't his. In the weeks that followed, he dropped out of sight. On June 29, he left for his native Paris, telling at least four friends he needed to attend to his father who, he said, was dying of liver cancer. Foison's story, pieced together from dozens of interviews with fellow musicians and people in his social circle, is one of ambiguity. But it's also a tale of pathos, of a man who likely suffered more than he let on. (Ruhe, Atlanta Journal Constitution) </P> 	nyt_eng_200107.gz
, I think,	 If you look, the last time we went through this was with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which was essentially a war between the intellectual-property people in the broadcast industry, media industries and high tech, and it sort of became this weird compromise that people are working on.

, you see,	 One collector bragged that he had found guns, a set of brass knuckles, a pistol, glass eyes, a slave collar and a dog collar in privies. Another said he found ``marbles, pipes, ivory toothbrushes and combs, porcelain dolls' heads, dentures, cigarette holders, brass locks and many other strange items.'' But now some treasure hunters are finding that the privies they covet are already claimed by archaeologists. And the archaeologists are playing tough. They accuse the privy diggers of destroying history. Privies, you see, are not only treasure-troves, they are also perfect archaeological sites. People throw everything into them, and those things tend to stay put. At least they used to. </P> 	nyt_eng_200107.gz
, he said,	 On a Friday in late June, Peter Bleed, an archaeologist at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, picked out a privy he had intended to excavate on a new construction site at the university. ``I was going to use standard archaeological procedure,'' he said. That is, he said, he was going to ``unfill it systematically.'' But when he returned on Monday, he found that someone had broken into the locked and fenced-in site and removed some of the goodies. The dig ``wasn't very good,'' Bleed said. The looter had dug right through the middle of the site. ``He didn't get to the corners,'' he said. Privies are mounded high in the center, and things roll off to the sides. So that's where most of the riches are. </P> 	nyt_eng_200107.gz
, he added,	 Still, Clements _ who the police said turned out to be the looter _ got enough by digging through the middle. According to Bleed, he got 17 bottles, including a medicine bottle for a consumption cure and a bottle for a women's tonic called Lydia Pinkham's Vegetable Compound. The police said they had caught Clements by asking other bottle collectors in the area if they had seen anyone hanging around the site. ``The bottle collectors are organized,'' Bleed said. ``They know who did it.'' It is too bad, he added, that the archaeologists and hobbyists can't work together, since many privy diggers know a lot about the stuff that people tossed into privies. </P> 	nyt_eng_200107.gz
, he said,	 ``I've tried _ not successfully _ to collaborate with them,'' Bleed said. Some are sincere but misguided history buffs, he said, and some are just looters. This has been going on for 20 years at least, he said, but now the market for the artifacts is growing. ``The Internet has made this blossom,'' Bleed said, because it provides ``a good network and a market.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200107.gz

Crane, an archaeologist from Fairfax, Va., not only pieced together the story of 19th-century sanitation in Washington but also parsed the differences between ``filth, garbage and rubbish,'' not to mention the substance that archaeologists delicately refer to as night soil, which is to say, excrement. The first privy diggers, he found, were Washington's poorer residents, ``scavengers who cleaned privies and sold night soil to farmers for fertilizer.'' In the course of their collections, he wrote, they found ``refuse for resale, such as whole or broken bottles, cans and rags.'' Sound familiar? </P> 	nyt_eng_200107.gz

NYT News Service  INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  WOMEN-TRAFFICKING (Velesta, Macedonia) _ This village, tucked down in the south-western corner of the country, is one of the strangest places in this part of the Balkans. Amid the haybarns there are over a dozen neon-lit nightclubs and sex bars with names like Madonna and Paradiso. And beneath the strange combination of rural quiet and nighttime glitz, the place has a very sinister reputation. Hundreds of foreign women, mostly from former communist bloc countries, have passed through Velesta over the last few years. A large proportion of them are women who were forced into prostitution, and kept against their will. By Carlotta Gall.

ISRAEL-RIGHTS (Jerusalem) _ Israel's Foreign Ministry is issuing a new warning to officials who go abroad: beware of legal suits that may be served upon you by prosecutors in the new world of human rights law and in countries, notably in Europe, which believe that Israel has been unduly harsh toward the Palestinians. By Clyde Haberman.  NATIONAL _ GENERAL (Moved in ``a'' category)  FLA-BASEBALL (Miami) _ A decade ago, major-league baseball in Florida seemed so promising. How could baseball fail in a state peopled with large numbers of retirees and transplants, many of them lifelong baseball fans from the Northeast and Midwest? Hispanics, the state's fastest growing ethnicity, brought with them a love of the game from Cuba, the Dominican Republic and other points south. But fail it has. By Rick Bragg.

One hope, for instance, is new nerve cells to allow people in wheelchairs to walk again. But embryonic stem cells are just the latest candidates to come along in a field known as cell therapy that has been extremely difficult to turn into a viable business. By Andrew Pollack.

By Mike Freeman.  CULTURE AND ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' code, unless otherwise indicated)  ROME-FRESCOS (Rome) _ A close-up examination of San Pasquale Baylon chapel, a long-neglected nook of Santa Maria in Aracoeli, a Franciscan basilica in the center of Rome, last summer revealed ghostly images lying beneath the surface of the walls. The entire chapel, it seemed, was a painted palimpsest. Now, after months of careful paint peeling, what has been revealed are dazzling fragments of a late-medieval masterpiece completed shortly after 1285, thought to be by the Roman artist Pietro Cavallini _ a painter and mosaicist whose greatest works have been destroyed. Tommaso Strinati, the art historian who made the discovery, hopes that the fully restored fresco will not only rescue Cavallini's name from obscurity, but will upend the widespread notion that the first flowers of the Renaissance budded in Florence, not Rome. By Daniel Zalewski.  PRIVY-DIGGERS (Undated) _ For a weekend of digging in an old potty-hole in Lincoln, Neb., Tim Clements was hauled into court. The charges? Criminal trespass, vandalism and theft. What was Clements doing rooting in a privy? Looking for bottles, dishes and, as one privy-digger put it, lots of ``real cool stuff.'' Privy-diggers are the outhouse equivalent of the people who sweep over old battlefields with metal detectors looking for bullets and coins. But now some treasure hunters are finding that the privies they covet are already claimed by archaeologists. And the archaeologists are playing tough. They accuse the privy-diggers of destroying history. Privies, you see, are not only treasure troves, they are perfect archaeological sites. The things that go in tend to stay undisturbed. Or at least they used to. By Sarah Boxer.  ENGLISH-BIBLE (Undated) _ There is a moment in Victor Hugo's famous novel about the Parisian hunchback when the archdeacon of Notre Dame speaks to the King of France. He gestures from a printed book open on his desk toward the arches of the great cathedral. ``Alas,'' he says, ``This will kill that. The book will kill the building.'' The 16th-century priest was proclaiming that the printing press would shake the foundations of his church, that portable texts and popularized messages would undermine the authority of orthodox religion, stimulating dissent and encouraging independence. Hugo's novel is partly an account of the archdeacon's perverse attempts to retain his fading powers. ``Wide as the Waters,'' Benson Bobrick's subtle and surprising chronicle of biblical translation, doesn't mention Hugo's churchman, but it confirms his prophecy.

, he said,	 TRISTAN _ ATLANTA _ He cultivated an image as a romantic hero, a misunderstood genius. He lived off a reputation as a charming Frenchman with a mystique _ a self-exiled artist searching for his muse and public acceptance. Since 1987, Tristan Foison has worked as a composer, conductor, pianist and music teacher in Atlanta. Until, that is, he was caught in May claiming credit for a piece of music that wasn't his. In the weeks that followed, he dropped out of sight. On June 29, he left for his native Paris, telling at least four friends he needed to attend to his father who, he said, was dying of liver cancer. Foison's story, pieced together from dozens of interviews with fellow musicians and people in his social circle, is one of ambiguity. But it's also a tale of pathos, of a man who likely suffered more than he let on. (Ruhe, Atlanta Journal Constitution) MOVED. </P> 	nyt_eng_200107.gz

, it seems,	 Over time, it seems, this stigma has grown worse. In the recent presidential campaign, the media roasted George W. Bush for lacking passion and commitment during his college days in the '60s. Unlike Al Gore, who supposedly wrestled with the issues of war and peace while at Harvard, George W. was portrayed as the polar opposite: a good-time preppie who snored his way through Yale as president of Delta Kappa Epsilon, described in the Washington Post as ``the hardest drinking jock house on campus.'' The implication was clear: anyone not sufficiently engaged in the moral turmoil of the '60s was unfit to lead America today. </P> 	nyt_eng_200107.gz

, he says,	 Max describes his childhood as surprisingly normal, but the reality must have been painfully complicated: a soft kid in a chaotic, fatherless home, surrounded by the framed reminders of Camelot and so allergic to the pollen blowing in off the Potomac that he couldn't be without an inhaler.

, they said,	 Many northern Mainers say that may be true, but they don't want a national park to be the glue holding the land together.

That, they said, would destroy life as many know it in northern Maine. </P> 	nyt_eng_200107.gz
, she said,	 Her vision for a park, she said, was shaped in part by the scars of clearcutting she saw in more than a dozen overflights of the North Woods. ``I don't have any problem taking logs for lumber or tomatoes for spaghetti,'' said Quimby. ``But we have overharvested the wood. We overdid it and now it's time to underdo it.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200107.gz
, he said,	 ``The original perception was that it is drier than it is today,'' said Dr. Michael D. Voegele, the chief science officer of Bechtel SAIC Co., the Energy Department's chief contractor for investigating the mountain. The site is still extremely dry, Voegele said. Most of the six or seven inches of annual rainfall evaporates, he said, so a square centimeter of Yucca's surface would generally see a column of water only one centimeter high move through it in a year. Even if climate change triples rainfall at the site, it will be dry enough, they say. </P> 	nyt_eng_200107.gz
, they say,	 But some scholars challenge this theory, arguing that the signs are not true writing based on a spoken language. And, they say, one sample with three or four characters on a thumbnail-size stone is hardly sufficient to establish the existence of a writing system. On that, the discoverer, Dr. Fredrik T. Hiebert of the University of Pennsylvania, agrees. </P> 	nyt_eng_200107.gz

, they said,	 After hearing Hiebert explain the excavation methods, colleagues at Penn said they agreed that the seal belonged where it was found, in a layer of the ruins dated at 2300 B.C. There was no evidence, they said, that the dirt-encrusted artifact could have been introduced by rodents or water seepage, or by a hoaxer straight from the antiquities market.   (STORY CAN END HERE.
