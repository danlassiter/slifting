Burnett _ and we're not talking about his elbow _ as he watched the Marlins win a World Series without him last season. (Stoda, The Palm Beach Post)  NOTE TO COX EDs: Photos available to Cox papers only via Budget Tool in the Palm Beach database.  BBN-NUXALL -- DAYTON, Ohio -- To use baseball terminology for an in-flight home run, Cincinnati Reds broadcaster Joe Nuxhall is going, going ... but not gone. After broadcasting nearly every game for 37 years, the 75-year-old Nuxhall is cutting back to 80 games this season, preparatory to retiring from the booth after the 2004 season. (McCoy, Dayton Daily News)  GLF-EXEMPTIONS -- WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The art of who receives sponsor's exemption has become more scrutinized since The Bank of America invited Annika Sorenstam to Colonial last year, then the Sony Open in Hawaii gave one to Michelle Wie last month. In both cases, the sponsors were rewarded with ernormous television ratings and a spike in interest. Many players, however, believe the tour is heading down a slippery slope. (Dolch, The Palm Beach Post)  SAVANNAH-STATE -- SAVANNAH, Ga. -- Savannah State has the worst athletic program in major college sports. The football team's losing streak stands at 15, the longest in Division I-AA. The men's basketball team is 1-22 and has lost 17 in a row, the longest streak in Division I. The women's basketball team set an NCAA record by scoring just three points in the first half of a game this season. What does losing like this do to school spirit? (Knobler, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution)  BKC-GASTATE -- ATLANTA -- Feature story on Georgia State guard Patechia Hartman, who has been named Atlantic Sun player of the week a record five times this season. Hartman is also an accomplished musician and plays several musical instruments. (Parker, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution) W/PHOTO.

TRANSMITTED Feb. 11  IN ENGLAND, WATER POLICY MAY THREATEN WETLANDS  NATGEO-WATER-CONSERVATION _ By last October, wildlife along the Wylye Valley in Wiltshire, southern England, was thirsting in the aftermath of a hot summer. But the fly fishermen who rescued many hundreds of brown trout from dried-up tributary streams of the Wylye River aren't blaming the weather. Nor are environmentalists, wildlife groups and even government agencies. They are pointing the finger at water utility companies, which, they ain, and Gland, Switzerland, claim that the water companies are siphoning off vast and environmentally unsustainable quantities of ground water.
