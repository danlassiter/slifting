The owners promote the property, which has been on the market for several years, as both a cutting-edge ``extreme home'' and a nostalgic curiosity. And now, a year after the terror attacks, the owners are appealing to Americans' renewed sense of vulnerability. The former missile control room mis now a kitchen and living space, top.

They have come down from the trees and in from the fields, forced into neighborhoods by a strangling drought that has gripped the region.

Dzerzhinsky's statue, erected in 1958, was one of the most reviled symbols of Soviet rule, standing as it did in front of the KGB's dreaded headquarters. It came to symbolize the vast terror committed in the name of the revolutionary cause. The idea of resurrecting Dzerzhinsky -- rehabilitating him in Soviet parlance -- has been nurtured like a grudge for years by those still ambivalent about the Soviet Union's collapse.
