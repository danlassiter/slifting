Includes a 200-word sidebar By MICHAEL CASTLEMAN Excerpted from ``Nature's Cures'' by Michael Castleman with permission of Rodale Books c.1996 Michael Castleman  What do the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster, the 1986 space shuttle Challenger tragedy and the 1979 near meltdown of the Three-Mile Island nuclear power plant have in common? Sleepiness. All these disasters resulted from human errors caused by a lack of sleep.  These events became major media headlines, but to understand the real toll of sleepiness, you need to look beyond the news coverage to the thousands of motor vehicle, rail and airline accidents lack of sleep causes every year, not to mention the increased risk of several serious illnesses.  ``Nearly all of us need more sleep than we get,'' says Dr. William Dement, director of the Stanford Sleep Disorders Clinic in Palo Alto, Calif., and chairman of the National Commission on Sleep Disorders Research (NCSDR).  ``Drowsiness is an urgent warning that should not be ignored, particularly in situations where dozing, inattention or impaired performance could lead to catastrophe.'' GOOD REASONS FOR A GOOD SNOOZE  There is no ``normal'' amount of sleep. But according to the NCSDR, the vast majority of adults need at least seven hours of sleep a night, and most need eight or more to function optimally.  Yet about half the adult population sleeps less than eight hours a night, and 13 percent _ some 20 million Americans _ get by on seven or less.  Preventing a motor vehicle accident is reason enough to get more sleep, but a good night's sleep contributes to your health in other ways as well.  _ Colds and other infections: ``A person with a large sleep debt is much more vulnerable to infections and other illnesses,'' says Dr. Peter Hauri, director of the Insomnia Research and Treatment Program at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.  Without adequate rest, the immune system has difficulty defending against disease-causing microorganisms. Surveys show that compared with normal sleepers, chronic insomniacs develop more illnesses and recover from them more slowly.  _ Recovery: Why do so many illnesses send us straight to bed?  An increased need for sleep is the body's way of orchestrating recovery, according to Hauri. Most growth and recovery from illness occur during sleep, specifically during the deepest, or delta, stage.  _ Longevity: A nine-year study by the California Department of Health showed that adults who slept six hours or less a night had significantly higher death rates from all causes than those who slept seven hours or more.  Not surprisingly, motor vehicle accidents accounted for many of the fatalities among those who slept the least. But there was also a significant association between untimely death and shift work, the increasingly common practice of working through the night or the even more hazardous practice of switching shifts frequently.  If you do shift work, you might want to reconsider your schedule, or at least make sure you sleep eight hours out of every 24. THE SECRETS OF SLEEPING WELL  Sixty-five million Americans _ 36 percent of us _ have trouble sleeping. For one-fourth of this group, the problem is chronic, according to the NCSDR.  The good news is that there are plenty of ways to get more zzz's. Here, advice from Dement and Hauri as well as Dr. Richard Bootzin, a psychologist at the University of Arizona, and Dr. Donald R. Sweeney, a psychiatrist at Yale University.  _ See your doctor: Have him or her rule out the many illnesses that can interfere with sleep. Be sure to mention all the medications you take.  _ Reduce stimulant consumption: ``Caffeine and other stimulants cause more sleep problems than most people realize,'' Hauri says.  Cut back on coffee, chocolate, tea and drugs that contain stimulants (ask your pharmacist).  _ Limit alcohol: Drinking within a few hours of retiring can keep you from sleeping or cause troubled, fragmented sleep.  _ Quit smoking: Where there's smoking, there's often insomnia. Nicotine is a powerful stimulant.  _ Watch when you eat: Avoid large, heavy meals within an hour or two of bedtime, because digestive processes can disturb sleep.  _ Take your vitamins and minerals: ``Deficiencies in the B vitamins, calcium, copper, iron, magnesium and zinc can all contribute to sleep problems,'' Hauri says. Consider taking a multivitamin/mineral supplement that contains the recommended daily allowance of every essential vitamin and mineral.  _ Try tryptophan: Tryptophan is an amino acid needed to make serotonin, a chemical in the brain that helps induce sleep.  ``About 25 studies show that 1 to 2 grams of tryptophan help induce sleep in people with mild insomnia,'' Hauri says.  Tryptophan is available only with a doctor's prescription. Milk, however, is naturally rich in tryptophan _ a possible explanation for the popular ritual of a glass of warm milk before bed.  _ Ditch the double bed: Switch to a queen- or king-size bed so you'll be less likely to be disturbed if your spouse has a restless night.  _ Pamper yourself: Buy a comfortable mattress and cozy sheets and pillows (including specially shaped therapeutic ones).  _ Be quiet: For more quiet, try foam earplugs, install double-pane, noise-reducing windows or run a fan at night to drown out disturbing sounds.  _ Shut out the light: For a darker bedroom, you might invest in blackout drapes, blinds or shades.  _ Never work at going to sleep: If at first you don't succeed, please don't try again. If you're having problems sleeping, get up and work at a boring routine activity until you feel sleepy. Then go back to bed.  _ Get out of bed: If you need only seven hours of sleep a night but try staying in bed for nine, your sleep will get spread thinly over the nine, making it more troubled and less restful.  _ Get regular: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. Many people find their sleep seriously disturbed if they don't stick to regular sleep/wake cycles.  _ Adopt bedtime rituals: To help yourself wind down before bed, try adopting bedtime rituals such as taking a hot bath, drinking a cup of herb tea or doing some light reading.  _ Try deep relaxation: Relaxation techniques _ such as aromatherapy, deep breathing, listening to music, massage, meditation and yoga _ help minimize the stress that often contributes to sleep problems.  _ Keep a ``to do'' pad: If you toss and turn because you're concerned that you might forget some of the many things you must do the next day, buy a small pad and jot down all the concerns that might keep you up. Then let go of them until morning.  _ Try sex: At its best, lovemaking is deeply relaxing and can lead to a good night's sleep.  ``But if the sex is unsatisfying and takes place in a problematic relationship, it might contribute to a very poor night's sleep,'' Hauri notes.  _ Stop making excuses: Think about what you gain from your insomnia. Some people use it as an excuse for poor productivity or a chance to be the object of sympathy.  Ask yourself what might change for the worse if you slept better. Work to resolve those issues, and you just might start sleeping better. -0- SIDEBAR: ARE YOU SHORT ON SHUTEYE? A TEST  Those who are sleep-deprived often don't realize it. The problem is so pervasive, it's not even perceived.  Take this simple test devised by Dr. William Dement, professor of psychiatry and behavioral science at Stanford University. If you answer ``yes'' to even one question, you need more sleep.  1. Do you have to rely on an alarm clock to get you up in the morning?  2. Do you ever sleep through your alarm?  3. Is getting out of bed a struggle?  4. Do you ever experience powerful waves of drowsiness in school, at work, at the movies or in theaters?  5. Do you ever fall asleep without intending to?  6. Do you ever wonder where your get-up-and-go has gone?  7. Does a single glass of beer or wine hit you unexpectedly hard?

Includes a 200-word sidebar By ANNE FIELD c.1996 McCall's (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Your local grocery store may seem tame enough. Even friendly, perhaps. But really, it's a jungle in there _ a thicket of sales tactics aimed at you and your wallet.  ``You'll find little in a supermarket that's designed to provide you with the best products at the best prices,'' says Steve Gardner, a lawyer formerly with the Texas attorney general's office in Dallas.  In fact, your market's layout is the result of years of research devoted to getting you to spend as much of your hard-earned cash as possible.  While there's nothing illegal about some businesspeople trying to make a few extra bucks, it's your bucks we're talking about here! So read on and learn the tricks of the trade. The more you know, the more you'll save. FREQUENT-FLYER COME-ONS  Like clockwork, your supermarket's weekly circular arrives at your home, plastered with discount offers. Immediately, you spot an item that you buy regularly _ orange juice, for instance _ being sold at a phenomenally low price.  This sale product is called a loss leader, and often it's not the deal it seems to be.  When you run into the store to pick up a couple of cartons of juice, you may discover that the prices of complementary items _ breakfast cereal and eggs, perhaps _ have been jacked up. You may actually spend even more than you would have had you bought all the same products when the juice wasn't on sale.  Circulars don't serve only to reel in cost-conscious consumers. With page after page of colorful pictures of expensive prepared foods and baked goods, they also pique shoppers' interest in the market's most lucrative departments, such as the deli and the bakery. WHEN DISTANCE MEANS DOLLARS  Does it seem as if you have to walk through half the market just to pick up some jelly? You're not imagining things: Grocers deliberately place such necessities as milk and bread at opposite ends of the store.  ``Otherwise shoppers would run in, grab a few things and leave,'' explains Elaine Notarantonio, a professor of marketing at Bryant College in Smithfield, R.I.  En route to the items you really need, you'll pass luxuries like cookies _ goodies you might not see if the must-haves weren't spread out. And if you see the temptation, the chances are greater that you'll buy them. DANGEROUS DUOS  As you reach for a bag of potato chips, you nearly topple a container of onion dip. It's not something you usually buy, but what the heck, it'll go great with those chips. At least, that's what the marketers are hoping you will conclude.  Those side-by-side treats are called adjacencies, and the logic behind them is simple: When grocers want to boost sales of an infrequently bought item, such as canned dip, they place it right next to a popular product, like ... you guessed it.  Another tactic is to transfer staples, such as peanut butter, to aisles dominated by impulse buys, such as candy bars, to increase sales of the latter.  Marsh Supermarkets, an 80-store chain in Indiana and Ohio, did just that, moving some essential groceries alongside less popular foods, market-research director Mark Heckman says.  The result: Traffic in some infrequently visited aisles jumped by 30 percent. WATCH OUT FOR SPEED BUMPS  You're zipping through the frozen-foods section when suddenly you find yourself smack in front of a waist-high ice-cream display case, awkwardly located in the middle of the aisle. Poor planning on the store's part? Hardly.  The mini fridge forces you to slam on the brakes and do some browsing. That's also the reason you often have to wind your way around mid-aisle pyramids of oranges in the produce section.  Why are grocers eager for you to linger? The longer you shop, the more you'll spend _ about one dollar for every additional minute you're in the store, says Judy Graham, an associate professor of management at St. John Fisher College in Rochester, N.Y.  Erecting an obstacle course isn't the only way to discourage speedy shopping. Next time you're in a grocery store, stop and listen. You'll probably discern a pleasant tune with a slow tempo playing in the background. The cheerful music is part of a plan: Its happy melody lifts your mood while its relaxing rhythm encourages you to keep a similarly slow pace. ... AND THE CHEESE STANDS ALONE (AND SELLS)  As you head for the baked-goods aisle, you veer around a freestanding cardboard box with built-in shelves that are stocked with bags of cookies. If you're like most consumers, you'll grab a bag.  Point-of-purchase displays, as these single-product, custom-made showcases are called, are a grocer's dream. They attract attention and increase sales of whatever they're filled with, whether or not the item is actually marked down.  Shoppers often mistakenly assume the product is on sale, when in fact, it's at its everyday price.  Be doubly wary of such displays placed at the end of an aisle. Strategically positioned in high-traffic areas, they practically pop out at you as you wheel your cart along. Before stocking up, make sure the price of the item really is reduced. BOGUS BARGAINS  OK _ a point-of-purchase display may not be filled with great buys, but what about a jumble of soap bars, say, thrown willy-nilly into a bin? They're a bargain, right?  Beware: The bin may actually be what's called a dump display, purposely arranged in a haphazard fashion so that the items inside it look cheap. However, several aisles away you may find those same soaps neatly stacked at exactly the same, full price.  Also be suspicious of open cartons piled on top of one another, warehouse-style. The items they contain probably aren't on sale _ they just look as if they are.  Even signs can lead you astray. Handwritten tags peppering store shelves create the impression of recently lowered costs, though the items may remain at regular prices.  Banners touting specials can be misleading as well. Contrary to what you may believe, ``special'' doesn't always mean sale. Stores sometimes raise an item's price for a few days, then return it to the original amount and call it a special. TECHNOTRACKING  Has your supermarket been offering more gourmet coffees lately? Or fewer hot dogs? The change may be the result of information gleaned from your electronic shopping card.  Recently, some chains have been issuing special cards that award shoppers access to exclusive discounts and promotions. In return, the market records every purchase cardholders make. Stores then use the information to fine-tune their sales strategies, enticing customers to spend even more than before.  Grocery stores are utilizing sophisticated technology in other ways as well. Remember how Marsh Supermarkets increased traffic by moving the peanut butter to the candy aisle? That move happened as a result of two-way infrared technology linking transmitters in 50 shopping carts and baskets with sensors in the ceiling that tracked shoppers' movements.  The result: Marsh was able to detect seldom-visited aisles and make changes to attract shoppers to them.  Big Brother is watching after all _ from the checkout counter. -0- SIDEBAR: 5 SMART THINGS SHOPPERS DO  1. Buy store brands _ sometimes: Products packaged by supermarkets cost about 20 percent less than name-brand counterparts. Find the worthy house brands through trial and error.  2. Set their sights high _ or low: Supermarkets place high-profit products from big manufacturers on shelves at eye level and display them in quantity, because studies show that the sale of an item increases 5 to 10 percent when there is more of it visible.  You'll find perfectly acceptable products from smaller companies on shelves below or above eye level _ at lower prices.  3. Make a list, and check it twice: Only about one-third of purchases are preplanned. Write down exactly what _ and how much _ you require, and follow your list to the letter.  4. Crunch numbers: Economy-size items aren't always the cheapest. If you live in a state that requires unit pricing, do the math and figure out whether you're really getting a deal.  5. Clip coupons only for necessary items: No point in buying something, even at a great price, that you're never going to use.

By DAVID CORN From Mother Jones magazine. c. 1996 The Foundation for National Progress (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  The music on Bruce Springsteen's 13th album, ``The Ghost of Tom Joad,'' is sparse _ mostly Springsteen's voice and acoustic guitar, more folk than typical rock.  The album explores the travails of immigrants, dislocated workers and America's economically dispossessed. Its title track invokes John Steinbeck's ``The Grapes of Wrath'' (1939) and protagonist Tom Joad, the displaced Okie who confronts social injustice and is transformed into a radical.  On a solo tour that will keep him on the road through the summer, Springsteen punctuates his performances with commentary between the songs.  ``There is a part of our population whose lives and dreams are declared expendable as the price of doing business,'' he says, introducing one number.  At another point, he paraphrases Joad: ``Maybe they got it wrong and we're not all individual souls, and maybe our fate is not independent at all. Maybe we're all just little pieces of one big soul.''  Sipping Jack Daniel's, the 46-year-old Springsteen talked about the album and contemporary America after a recent performance in Washington, D.C. -0-  QUESTION: At a recent benefit, you dedicated the song ``The Ghost of Tom Joad'' to the ``Gingrich mob.''  BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: With that song, I had been watching what's happening in the world and seeing 30 years of work undone. It seems disastrous to me _ and everybody is compliant.  I don't think there is any such thing as an innocent man. There is a collective responsibility. That's in the song's line: ``Where it's headed everybody knows.''  Everybody knows there are the people we write off, there are the people we try to hang on to and there are the people we don't (mess) with. And that very knowledge could come back and haunt this next election.  Everybody knows that, ``Hey, maybe I'm just on the line. And maybe I'm going to step over from being one of these people to one of those people.''  QUESTION: Some of the themes you deal with, such as immigration, have become hot-button political issues in the last year or two. Did you plan on addressing political issues on this album?  A: No. I never start with a political point of view.  I believe that your politics are emotionally and psychologically determined by your early experiences.  My memory is of my father trying to find work, what that does to you and how that affects your image of your manhood, as a provider. The loss of that role is devastating.  I write coming from that spot, the spot of disaffection, of loners, outsiders _ but not outlaws. It's about people trying to find their way in, but somebody won't let them in. Or they can't find their way in. And what are the actions that leads to?  That pretty much obsesses me to this day _ and probably will the rest of my life. I don't like the soapbox stuff. I don't believe you can tell people anything. You can show them things.  I don't set out to make a point, I set out to create understanding and compassion and present something that feels like the world. I set out to make sure something is revealed at the end of the song, some knowledge gained. That's when, I figure, I'm doing my job.  QUESTION: You've said the original idea for the album was sort of an ``American noir'' theme, but then you shifted and some of the major characters and subjects became immigrants, itinerant workers and down-and-out people. Why?  A: Part of it is due to my living in California, where there is a lot of border reporting. And when I get the chance, I take motorcycle trips and go out to the desert _ southern California, Arizona. I'11 go 1,000 miles, 2,000 miles, where nobody recognizes you. You just meet people.  That whole thing probably began with this Mexican guy I bumped into in this Four Corners desert town at the end of the summer. We were all sitting outside at a table, drinking beers.  It came up that his brother had been a member of a Mexican motorcycle gang in the San Fernando Valley, and he told us the story of his brother's death in a motorcycle accident.  Something about that guy stayed with me for a year. Then I read an article on the drug trade in the Central Valley. All that led to the song ``Sinaloa Cowboys'' (about two brothers, Mexican immigrants, who mix methamphetamines).  The border story is something that I hadn't heard much of in the music that's out there. It's a big story. It's the story of what this country is going to be _ a big, multicultural place.  QUESTION: People think that the country _ rightly or wrongly _ has taken a turn to the right. You're cutting against that. What brought you to this point?  A: I believe that the war on poverty is a more American idea than the war on the war on poverty. I believe that most people feel like that.  We've gotten to this sad spot where we're talking about how much should be cut from what we need. It would take a tremendous concentration of national will, on the order of a domestic Marshall Plan, to do the things that need to be done to achieve a real kind of social justice and equality.  Whether people's hearts and wills are into it, I don't know. I tend to be pessimistic. I want to believe in hope.  QUESTION: There are a few moments of hope on the current album, but they're very small.  A: I got to the end of the record and there had been a lot of mayhem. I wanted to leave the door open, so I wrote ``Across the Border.''  That song is a beautiful dream. It's the kind of dream you would have before you fall asleep, where you live in a world where beauty is still possible. And in that possibility of beauty there is hope.  Then I had this idea of writing a song (``Galveston Bay'') about the Vietnamese and the Texas fishermen, about a guy who makes a particular decision not to add to the brutality and violence. (In the song, fisherman Billy Sutter goes to kill a rival, Le Bin Son, but instead returns to his sleeping wife.)  He decides to let it pass on this night, to leave it alone, for whatever the reason. That's a miracle that can happen, that does happen. People get to a certain brink and they make a good choice, instead of a deadly choice.  QUESTION: Do you ever feel the urge to direct your audience toward a course of action?  A: Music doesn't tell you where to go. It says, ``Go find your own place.''  That's what it told me. I heard a political message in rock music _ a liberation message, a message of freedom. I heard it in Elvis' voice. That voice had its implications. You weren't supposed to hear Elvis Presley. You weren't supposed to hear Jerry Lee Lewis. You weren't supposed to hear Robert Johnson. You weren't supposed to hear Hank Williams.  And they told the story of the secret America.  QUESTION: What is the effect of the concentration trend within the media industry on the diversity of pop-culture voices?  A: You mean the hegemony of the homogeneous? I have faith in a lot of the new, young, vital rock bands that came up through independent labels. They found core audiences before they hit a major label.  If the industry executives think you will make them money, they will do what you ask. It's a bottom-line job for those guys. But kids who are supposed to be invisible and never be heard, who are kicked out of high school, who are losers _ they make their way through, generation after generation.  Nirvana, Dr. Dre, Pearl Jam ... hell, they weren't supposed to become powerful, but they did. It's a business that depends on the kid in his garage, and it always will.  That's the irony of the whole thing. (The executives) are sweating about some kid in the Midwest in his garage right now. Then it's up to that kid to hold on. It's a question of your toughness, your survivability and how hard you hold onto what you originally wanted to do.  (David Corn is the Washington, D.C., editor of The Nation.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Don Johnson in a scene from ``Nash Bridges.'' By JEANNE WOLF (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  On the set of ``Nash Bridges,'' they affectionately call him ``Big Don.''  The aura of stardom has stayed with Don Johnson since the days when he made his name on ``Miami Vice,'' which aired from 1984 to 1989. As the intense, wisecracking Sonny Crockett, Johnson chased drug dealers while sporting a rainbow of designer outfits that drove women wild.  Now ``Big Don'' is back on the small screen, hoping to work the same magic as a San Francisco police inspector in ``Nash Bridges,'' debuting March 29. CBS has even positioned the series in the same Friday-night time slot in which ``Miami Vice'' once grabbed ratings glory.  If Nash Bridges seems a bit more mature and philosophical than the go-go Sonny Crockett, so too does the actor who plays him.  ``Nash is not unlike the rest of us boomers in that he's got some baggage and wreckage that he's bringing forward into the 1990s _ a couple of ex-wives, a teen-age daughter and an aging father with the onset of Alzheimer's,'' Johnson says during an interview on the show's set.  ``But we don't play it maudlin or overly dramatic,'' he hastens to add. ``We play a lot of it for comedy. We're taking a different tone with it. We have the police action, of course, though I definitely am downplaying the guns, and we also go for some laughs.''  Style may not be the key this time, but it will not be ignored. Bridges is anything but run-of-the-mill as he prowls the San Francisco hills in a 1970 Plymouth Barracuda.  ``There were only 14 of them made, and we have three on this set,'' Johnson says, beaming. ``I wanted something very boylike, a holdover from being a kid that he just couldn't give up. And did I mention it's Sahara yellow?''  Johnson knows that any new series he does will be compared with his first big hit.  ``Of course, one way or the other people will bring up `Vice,' but when I made up my mind to do a series again I also made up my mind not to avoid the things that I do well just for the sake of saying, `Well, this isn't anything like that, you know.'  ``Some of it will be reminiscent, but I think this is a different time and a more evolved project _ there's more content involved here. It's more about the guy's private life than his cases.''  Johnson shows no sense of pressure to succeed or defensiveness about the choices he's made since his hit series ended, despite a string of failed films such as ``Paradise'' (1991), ``Born Yesterday'' (1993) and ``Guilty as Sin'' (1993).  ``I've picked some films that didn't score at the box office, but I always picked them for the right reasons, and I don't sit around and rethink those decisions. I'm not going into `Nash Bridges' feeling that I have something to prove.''  Johnson hand-picked San Francisco as the setting for his new show.  ``In this city they call detective `investigators,''' he says. ``The city has all the urban problems _ murder, burglary, home invasion _ but it is also a major port, which means some international themes to deal with.''  Like Miami when Johnson first shot ``Miami Vice'' there, San Francisco is a city that's not yet jaded about TV production. People still get a rush from seeing cameras and actors in their streets. Johnson gets his share of high signs as he moves through the city _ a cautiously encouraging sign, at least until he plunges into the unpredictable waters of prime time.  The fact that Nash Bridges is a worldly sort who has to deal with former wives and a child inevitably invites comparisons to Johnson's own life, including his highly publicized split with two-time ex-wife Melanie Griffith and his closeness with his own kids.  ``I can assure you that this show is not my story,'' Johnson says, picking his words carefully. ``It is not autobiographical. We all have those past issues, and I sure have mine, which everyone thinks they know about. My experience plays a hand here, but I'm not Nash.''  Johnson avoids commenting on Griffith's very visible romance with actor Antonio Banderas, with whom she is expecting a child.  ``What I feel about that stuff is that the most important things in my life are my children, and that's what my concerns are about,'' he says. ``Everything else is just part of life and part of living and part of loving and giving and moving on.  ``Melanie and I now share time with the children equally. They've been here with me in San Francisco for a month, and now they are going to be with her. I want things to be fine for all of us.''  His answer to stress and doubts, Johnson says, is to maintain a sense of humor.  ``I think that if you don't have a sense of humor in life, you've pretty much lost about half of the experience, if not more than that. I'm certainly not trivializing anybody's pain, and certainly not my own, but I don't necessarily think that you need to dwell on it.''  Work helps keep Johnson focused. As co-executive producer of ``Nash Bridges,'' he is involved in every aspect of the show. The process is tiring yet also exhilarating.  ``Doing a series is a marathon,'' he says. ``I forgot what these kind of days are like, but I was rapidly reminded. It's long hours and a lot of focus.  ``We have the requisite amount of chases and shoot-outs, but I admit the commands to my body aren't as quick as they used to be. And the recovery time is a little bit longer.  ``I'm having a blast,'' he adds. ``We're putting together something that's a hell of a lot of fun to do, and I'm doing it with the finest artists and craftsmen of my career.''  There's a big contrast to where Johnson was not long ago, when substance abuse left him on the verge of personal and professional self-destruction. Today he is secure enough to address even that subject.  ``That part of my life is always going to be something that I'm going to be aware of, but I'm feeling great,'' he says. ``I'm clicking with the work, and I feel that way about my life. I feel like I'm clicking with my life.  ``I feel like I'm right where I need to be, and when that happens personally it makes the work that much easier, because you're confident about where you are.''  In retrospect, there may be more of Johnson in Nash Bridges than he's letting on.  ``The way I've decided to play him is that he's a guy who has made some mistakes,'' the actor says, ``but he's hell-bent on picking up the pieces and figuring out how to make the best of what there is left and to do it with a sense of dignity, style and aplomb.  ``As an artist, I've always been very confident about getting to that place that I need to portray a character. But when you feel that way personally, then it's doubly exciting.  ``As far as the show,'' he concludes, ``with all of my experience I kind of know when we're in the neighborhood, and we're damn sure in the neighborhood.''

If you have any questions, please call Vinton Supplee on the Republic News Desk at (602) 271-8108.  MONTINI-COLUMN (undated) _ I've come across an easy and effective shortcut for the good people hoping to take a few guns off our streets this weekend. Volunteers will offer $50 gift certificates in exchange for any gun brought to them at two churches this weekend, with plainclothes Phoenix police officers on hand to assist in the collection. The Police Department has agreed to melt down the weapons. All this hard work won't do much good, of course. There are too many guns and too few individuals willing to trade them in. A better plan, I figure, would be to eliminate the middleman. Instead of a buyback program, the gift-certificate money should be used to purchase weapons before they hit the streets, perhaps by dealing directly with one of the biggest gun dealers around: Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. The county has a long-standing policy of reselling confiscated weapons. Sort of a recycling program from hell. By E.J. MONTINI. Story will move in the ``A'' and ``K'' categories.  GOODY-COL (Undated) _ I finally saw a band do something I've always wanted to see done recently. No, they didn't give away free drinks. But they did silence hecklers in an entertaining way. By BILL GOODYKOONTZ. Story will move in the ``L'' category.  KIDTALK (Phoenix) _ Three days before child molester Keith Wiedman was to be sentenced to prison, one of his victims stepped into traffic to die. ``My life was crappy. I couldn't stand living any longer,'' the 13-year-old boy said. ``I just thought I would get it over with, stop my suffering, so I tried to commit suicide.'' He survived, the sentencing was delayed and on Wednesday he stood up to Wiedman in court and asked a judge to send him away for a long, long time. Wiedman got 21 years. By KAREN FERNAU. Story will move in the ``A'' category.  WIRING (Phoenix) _ Neoprene-covered wiring could have caused a fast-spreading fire that quickly knocked out the crew of a doomed, 27-year-old ValuJet DC9, aviation experts in the Phoenix area say. The wiring, which is bundled above the pilots in the roof of the cockpit, does not meet today's standards for melting insulation when it is overloaded. By ED FOSTER. Story will move in the ``A' category.  WHITEFLIES (Phoenix) _ Whiteflies, those tiny, sticky pests that have made hot-weather jogging simply disgusting and gardening nearly futile, are finally in for a real fight. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has approved the Arizona Agriculture Department's emergency request for the state's cotton farmers to be the first in the nation to use two new insecticides in the battle against whiteflies.

"71043"	"they"	"figure"	" A couple of turns of the interest rate screw, they figure, would buy some permanent progress on the inflation front. That, in turn, would lower long-term interest rates, which are now more than a full percentage point higher than the recent nadir of just under 6 percent at the end of 1995. That, they argue, would ultimately stimulate investment. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"
"73705"	"they"	"figure"	" When a team is losing by as many as four runs, most managers and players don't believe in stealing bases. The risk, they figure, is not worth it. If the runner is thrown out, a potential threat can go with him. Torre lets Williams steal on his own. In Friday night's game Williams ran on his own and ran the Yankees into a stunning inning-ending, threat-ending double play. That was the play where Williams broke for second base prematurely, was caught in a rundown and tagged out, and Tim Raines was out trying to score from third during the rundown. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"

A vicious circle is at work with the GPA, Johnson argues. Teachers can ladle out high grades without having to discriminate much among their students. Students don't complain, and neither do their parents: for $1,000 a week, they figure, Junior ought to bring home some snazzy grades.

TOP  Lede story:  AFGHAN-CIVILIAN-CASUALTIES (Kabul, Afghanistan) _ From the first days of the American air campaign until the disastrous strike in Oruzgan province earlier this month, American commanders have relied on a high-tech, out-of-harm's way strategy that has led to the deaths of hundreds of Afghan civilians.

Off-lead story:  SCI-MEDICAL-CARE (Undated) _ A growing body of research is leading many medical experts to ask whether more is really better when it comes to health care.

They trusted corporate executives to be truthful about their companies' performance and prospects. They felt sure that the stock market was the path to a prosperous future. And they trusted Alan Greenspan to steer the economy through any storm. But by the end of last week, the investor trust on which the bull market of the 1990s had been founded seemed to have almost entirely vanished. By Gretchen Morgenson.  (Scheduled to move by 3 p.m. ET in ``a'' news file.)  BUSH-ECON (Washington) _ With the stock market plunging the other day and surveys depicting Americans as increasingly worried about the way the Bush administration is dealing with the economy and corporate fraud, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, the administration's main voice on economic issues, was in Kyrgyzstan. O'Neill's absence reinforced the view on Wall Street and in political circles here that President Bush's economic team was not responding sufficiently to growing economic and political pressures.

Every day she comes by bus to the Trump Taj Mahal. The casino gives her a voucher worth $20 just for showing up. After subtracting the $11 price of her round-trip bus ticket, Miss Zhang is $9 ahead of the game and only a dollar short of her rent. She has no interest in gambling and follows other day-tripping Chinese immigrants to a church soup kitchen for lunch. By Susan Sachs.  (Scheduled to move by 3 p.m. ET in ``a'' news file.)

American contempt for a weak Europe is producing a pressure for more unity, more outspoken independence and a clearer understanding that Europe must spend more money on its military forces if Washington is going to take it seriously.

Tom Knoblauch, left, and Eric Wilson of the New Mexico Green Party in their Santa Fe office on Thursday. ``We now have leverage,'' Wilson said. (Steve Northup/The New York Times)  (NYT7) COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- July 20, 2002 -- MILITARY-LAW-ENFORCEMENT -- Gen. Ralph E. Eberhart will lead the newly established Northern Command for the military, with a central goal of domestic security. Eberhart at Petersen Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colo., last week. (Kevin Moloney/The New York Times)  (NYT6) NEW YORK -- July 20, 2002 -- WTC-FUTURE -- About 5,000 people came to the Jacob Javitz Center Saturday for a forum on rebuilding Lower Manhattan after the terror attacks. It was sponsored by the Civic Alliance to Rebuild Downtown New York. (James Estrin/The New York Times)  (NYT5) TAMRA, Israel -- July 20, 2002 -- ISRAEL-ARAB-WORKERS-2 -- Many jobless Palestinians have come to the fields of Tamra, Israel to earn some money to tide them over a few more months. They are here illegally, sneaking into Israel with their wives and children despite border closings that have prevented them from reaching their previous jobs in Israel for nearly two years. In July,a boy carried a bucket past his family's tent in a field in Tamra.

In July, Fayez Hushiyeh, right, and his sister-in-law, Kifaya Hushiyeh, filled a sack with cucumbers as their children sorted the vegetables in a field in Tamra. (Ruth Fremson/The New York Times)  (NYT3) NEW YORK -- July 20, 2002 -- AOL-INTEGRATE -- Could anyone have done Robert W. Pittman's job? For the media industry, it is no idle question. Pittman was the America Online executive charged with integrating his company with Time Warner after they merged, and he resigned last week under pressure from the same executives he was supposed to bring together. Now, as AOL Time Warner struggles to convince Wall Street that its disparate businesses are worth more together than apart, some analysts are wondering whether anyone could have more successfully integrated the two companies, or even whether they should. Pittman in New York in June. (Chester Higgins Jr./The New York Times)  (NYT2) NEW YORK -- July 20, 2002 -- TIBET-SAMDHONG -- Samdhong Rinpoche is the Dalai Lama's first elected prime minister, or kalon tripa in Tibetan. He was chosen last summer by members of the Tibetan diaspora to bring some secular organization to a movement that has for decades revolved around the personal charisma, spiritual strength and towering reputation of the Dalai Lama. Rinpoche in Manhattan during a recent visit. (Librado Romero/The New York Times)  (NYT1) TOKYO -- July 20, 2002 -- JAPAN-RIGHTISTS -- The noise sneaks up on you from afar, starting with the low beat of a bass drum. What follows is a performance of emperor worship and militaristic propaganda that is as deafening. This is the world of the right-wing sound truck. For decades in Japan, the perennially aggrieved men in paramilitary fatigues who operate these vehicles have made earsplitting public disturbances a regular feature of life. Former far-rightists, retired policemen and historians say, though, that many of the nationalists disturb the peace and intimidate people freely because of their deep ties to the country's conservative political elite. Tokyo police officers kept a bus of a right-wing group from passing through a red light in early July as it broadcast slogans against a teachers union.

"129675"	"they"	"figure"	" They don't believe that digital technology is inundating modern life at the alarming speed of ``a Bengali typhoon,'' as Wired magazine once put it, but view it more as a rising tide whose impact is spreading steadily.

"132797"	"they"	"figure"	" Created by the British comedy team of Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders (the latter best-known for her sitcom ``Absolutely Fabulous''), this parody opens with some inept special-effects grunts trying to figure out how to create a fearsome army boasting half a million soldiers. Ants should do the trick, they figure, if you scratch that fearsome part from the equation. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"144276"	"they"	"figure"	" Bush strategists look on these three smaller states, especially Wisconsin, as insurance. A loss in hard-fought Ohio, where Bush won four years ago, could be at least partly offset, they figure, by victories in one or more of the three. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"144281"	"they"	"figure"	" Wisconsin, with 10 electoral votes, is probably Bush's best chance to take a Midwest state that went to Gore last time -- slightly better than Minnesota, also with 10, and Iowa, with 7. A loss in hard-fought Ohio, where Bush won four years ago, could be at least partly offset, they figure, by victories in one or more of the three. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"144616"	"we"	"figure"	" It would, we figure, be startling to have the unoccupied Caddy start up, but we're not going to do it. It's more rewarding, when convenient, to go out and ask what they think about the car, tell them the price and ask if they'd seriously consider buying it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"

"152704"	"you"	"figure"	" Lee and his company have freshened it considerably, not through any updates or contemporizing. It's in the cheeky way Margo takes over the aforementioned bar -- pairing off with leather-clad bikers -- with the song But Alive. It's in the theater gypsies extemporaneously putting on a show, explaining (through the title song) the need for Applause. That marvelous number (choreographed with high brio by Mark Esposito) is led by Bonnie (played by single-named actress Scarlett), whose contemporary equivalent, you figure, could be found today at some watering hole. Or she could be a hopeful movie extra. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"153876"	"we"	"figure"	" So now that a slice goes for as much as $2.25, what are the long-term prospects for the $2 fare? Probably no better, we figure, than the odds that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie will still be together by this time next year. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"160870"	"I"	"figure"	" I guess I can't begrudge them that bit of hay, he said, shrugging good-naturedly. It's a fair trade-off, I figure, for our getting to see them. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"161979"	"you"	"figure"	" Sometimes as a young guy, you see Montana and Elway earn their stripes in the playoffs, you figure, 'This is what I need to do -- I've got to win this game,' running back Jerome Bettis said, referring to Joe Montana and John Elway. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"170648"	"I"	"figure"	" That, I figure, is as good a way to start things with a new family member as you're going to get. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
