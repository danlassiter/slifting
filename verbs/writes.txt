Probably the most difficult principle for well-meaning parents to follow, but the most central, is to tell children the truth, with the details adjusted to suit their ages.

"4920"	"he"	"writes"	" Since he's been compared to Wharton so often, it's interesting to read how Auchincloss himself reads her. He notes that much that has been written about Wharton lately ``adheres faithfully to the legend of the thorny path of her coming of age.'' You can hear in his words the lawyerly skepticism, gently expressed. Wharton, he writes, ``is seen as the lonely child of a fashionable and uncaring mother who scorns her scribbling habits and gives her only discarded brown wrapping on which to compose her silly tales.'' More skepticism. ``Growing up,'' he continues, ``she is forced into the straitjacket of a debutante's idle career, with no end but a loveless marriage to a socially eligible bachelor. It is not until her late 30s that she breaks at last through the confining walls of Philistia and escapes to freedom and Paris and the joys of creation. . . .

In the introduction, Evans continues his fulminations about the megalomania of Murdoch, not only in Britain but in the United States. He attacks Ted Kennedy for letting Murdoch buy the New York Post despite owning a New York TV station (after Kennedy had earlier blocked Murdoch from buying Boston's Channel 25 because he owned the Herald). And he gets in a few licks at William Shawcross, who, he writes, ``had remarkable access to Murdoch'' in researching his biography, an obvious hint that Shawcross was in Murdoch's pocket. He writes, ``I am often asked my feelings about Murdoch today. ... When I come across him socially in New York I find I am without any residual emotional hostility. ... I have to remind myself, as he wheels about the universe of `the Big Deal,' that Lucifer is the most arresting character in Milton's `Paradise Lost.'''

"13744"	"she"	"writes"	" Is ``The Tightwad Gazette II'' worth $11.99? Definitely. It's worth that as entertainment alone. And to be fair -- I am trying to be fair -- it's much more than just a collection of far-out pennypinching suggestions. Some of Dacyczyn's money-saving strategies are far from radical. And her essays about living the frugal life are thought-provoking. In one, ``Wealth, Poverty and Frugality,'' she points out that most Americans are confused about the relationship between frugality and wealth and the confusion has an impact on the way they spend. We mistakenly think frugality has to do with being poor, she writes, and we see it as an admission of economic failure. In fact, many poor people aren't frugal and many wealthy people are. But because people don't want to be seen as economic failures, they spend their money the way they think the wealthy do, on day-to-day extravagances. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199502.gz"
"13745"	"she"	"writes"	" This is a trap Dacyczyn is in no danger of falling into. Sometimes people ask her, ``Can you be too frugal?'' If you think of being frugal as simply saving money then yes, you can be too frugal, she writes, but if you think of frugality in terms of not being wasteful, asking ``Can you be too frugal?'' is like asking ``Can you be too happy?'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199502.gz"

It is as if someone, he writes, ``set all the reformers loose to build a perfect government, and they were so enamored of the utopian notions of democracy -- searching for the one true answer, making sure every interest is fully heard, requiring every act to be documented by a form -- that they lost sight of what it is government is supposed to be doing.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199502.gz"

I hope that the power of the story is felt through the starkness and clarity of the musical expression. I can assure the listener that I was not interested in reflecting any current trend or style or fad (nor was I trying to load the work with historical references) -- for each scene, I have strived to compose music which proceeds from the heart of the narrative.

His main protagonists are two Princeton University scientists, Peter and Rosemary Grant, who for more than 20 years have measured variations in things like beak size in some 13 varieties of finch that live on a small island in the Galapagos chain, not far from where Darwin himself did his pioneering research.

It's a lark, but it sells like mad, and suddenly Sam and his family are under the influence of rampant celebrity. This novel's narration changes periodically, which is a shame because Sam's voice is so funny and engaging that Spencer ``(Endless Love)'' should have left the story in his care. A small quibble.

"31286"	"she"	"writes"	" What is ABOI-appropriate? Last week it was a funny story by a New Orleans resident named Meredith who protected her garden shed from Hurricane Erin by wrapping duct tape around it. As luck would have it, Erin missed -- missed the shed, New Orleans, everything. So Meredith is contemplating the many yards of sticky tape she must unwind in Delta heat so the lawnmower can be freed. If she and her husband had kept their wits about them, she writes, they would have left the five gallons of bottled water in the store and bought more than two six-packs of beer, but the coming storm had the stores crowded and there were no shopping carts available. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"

"32119"	"he"	"writes"	" Having grown up without a father, Jacques (and Camus) were forced to invent themselves, a fact that explains Camus's lifelong preoccupation with questions of morality, with questions of ``how we should act'' and how we should live if we do ``not believe in God or in reason.'' Jacques, he writes, ``was 16, then he was 20, and no one had spoken to him, and he had to learn by himself, to grow alone, in fortitude, in strength, find his own morality and truth, at last to be born as a man and then to be born in a harder childbirth, which consists of being born in relation to others.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"32395"	"he"	"writes"	" This must be what they mean by a ``guy thing.'' Women are always telling men that size doesn't matter, reassuring them, boosting their egos. Guess what? They don't care what we think. All they care about is how the other guys in the locker room are sizing them up. The problem, Taylor writes, is known in penile augmentation circles as ``shower syndrome.'' Its torment is summed up, he writes, in the headline on an ad for Dr. Rosenstein's services: ``Even After Two Hours of Racketball, He Wouldn't Take a Shower.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"32575"	"he"	"writes"	" Rifkin predicts a ``deep recession,'' citing large drops in payrolls and manufacturing jobs, rising inventories and declining consumer spending and confidence. He outlines the global economy's shift from ``mass labor'' to highly skilled ``elite labor.'' ``Factory workers, secretaries, receptionists, clerical workers, salesclerks, bank tellers, telephone operators, librarians, wholesalers, and middle managers are just a few of the many occupations destined for virtual extinction.'' Rifkin envisions products manufactured in ``near-workerless factories'' marketed by ``near-virtual companies.'' The model, he writes, is the toll that automation took on unskilled jobs where black workers were concentrated in the mid-'50s, a toll that created an ``underclass'' that is now expanding to white males. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"32576"	"she"	"writes"	" In her article, Pyenson delineates the ``work zombie'' who ``awakens, washes, gulps down coffee, goes to work for an interminable day, then drags home, only to get up the next morning and do it all again.'' Indeed, she writes, ``the average worker is spending more and more time at the office and increasingly less time at home.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"32604"	"he"	"writes"	" The key to the relation between esthetic and monetary realms, in Shell's view, is that both are symbols of something else. In both, he writes, the physical substance of a thing is separate from its intellectual or spiritual meaning. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"

"32879"	"he"	"writes"	" Should gay marriage be recognized by the government? Sullivan's argument that it should be is powerful. Marriage, which he calls ``a profoundly humanizing, traditionalizing step,'' is, he writes, ``ultimately the only reform that truly matters.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"33005"	"he"	"writes"	" Graham grew up in comfortable circumstances in an upscale, white Westchester County neighborhood outside New York. He attended predominantly white schools and today works in institutions dominated by whites. Yet, he writes, he and other middle-class African-Americans feel alienated from the white community ``by daily reminders that while we can shop in the same stores, work in the same firms and live in the same neighborhoods as our white peers, our acceptance will be challenged as we are shadowed by store clerks, passed up by cabdrivers, ignored by bosses who are looking for proteges and rejected by clubs that offer networking opportunities.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"33101"	"she"	"writes"	" In her new book, ``Children First'' (Alfred A. Knopf), she writes, ``All of us are shareholders in society's children and it is time we widened the focus of our attention from what is happening at the bottom, in individual families, to what is happening at the top in society as a whole.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"33839"	"he"	"writes"	" Army life, too, had its share of frustrations. But in much the same way that Powell dealt with early experiences of racism by gritting his teeth and vowing to work harder (``If I was to be confined to one end of the playing field, then I was going to be a star on that part of the field''), so he tended to cope with military foul-ups by keeping his head down and soldiering on.

"34459"	"she"	"writes"	" Sephardic Jews, from the Mediterranean and North Africa, ``don't know from chicken soup,'' Sheraton says.

"34820"	"he"	"writes"	" And of his amusing relations with close friends like Art Buchwald, the columnist, and Edward Bennett Williams, the Washington lawyer, he writes, ``Male friends are important to me, and the ones that I love are vitally important.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"35017"	"he"	"writes"	" In the book, he chronicles 500 plants in fond scientific, historic and culinary detail. For example, he writes, tea made from mullein leaves and flowers quiets a cough. The steamed leaves of stinging nettles are a superb vegetable. Protein-rich cattail stalks taste like corn. And the supply of epazote, the resinous herb prized in Mexican cooking, is plentiful. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"35027"	"she"	"writes"	" Ms. Jutras takes aim at the older generation of separatists, who have ``suffocated'' her with their endless rehashing of the same issues. They are responsible, she writes, for the stultifying atmosphere that has made the province ``a ghetto of expectation, walls that are as high as human stupidity and narrow-mindedness can make them.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"35247"	"he"	"writes"	" In ``The Pioneers,'' the heroine _ a character loosely modeled on the novelist's older sister _ exclaims that Judge Temple ``is taming the very forests.'' And this is an area which Taylor explores carefully. William Cooper, he writes, ``was guilty of the inconsistency'' which his son attributes to Judge Temple. Cooper supported the incompatible economic activities of maple-syrup and potash, the latter reducing to ash the trees that produced the sap. For his part, Temple decries, but then joins in, the settlers' slaughter of wild pigeons and fish. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"

"35422"	"he"	"writes"	" Why were West Indian immigrants so successful? The British, he writes, were ``absentee landlords,'' leaving West Indian slaves more or less on their own. ``Their lives were hard,'' he writes, ``but they did not experience the crippling paternalism of the American plantation system, with white masters controlling every waking moment of a slave's life.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"35694"	"he"	"writes"	" In these pages, Baker repeatedly argues that politics and policy ``are inextricably linked'' and that ``politics drives diplomacy, not vice versa.'' He found, he writes, that ``common sense was an effective guide to action''; he says he would call himself ``a realist'' who believes in solving ``the problems of the present before tackling the problems of the future.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"36120"	"he"	"writes"	" More important, perhaps, is the fact that, after tasting literally thousands of wines, his enthusiasm remains undiminished. Reporting on Burgundies in the current issue of The Wine Advocate, he finds the 1993s of the Domaine Meo-Camuzet to be ``thrilling wines.'' On the Domaine Leroy, he explains that his tasting notes will be brief because ``it is almost criminal to describe wines that may be the greatest red Burgundies I will taste in my life.'' Of the 1986 Penfolds Grange Hermitage, from Australia, he writes, ``This may turn out to be superior to the 1971 and 1976 _ imagine that!'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"

"36727"	"he"	"writes"	" This isn't the first time Boas has been accused of being an amoral apologist for inferior and degenerate peoples; the Nazis burned his books. Boas aside, what is the evidence that sociopathology is an accepted part of the conscious culture of black American society, of blacks ``as a group''? For one thing, D'Souza points out, some black intellectuals have been known to excuse, or at least try to rationalize, the behavior of young urban blacks. And he doesn't hear prominent black leaders denouncing the perpetrators of degenerate behavior. On the contrary, he writes, ``As with mainstream black scholars, leading African American politicians and civil rights leaders have endorsed the activities of criminals and gang members.'' Also, ``while most immigrant groups tend to look to their most successful citizens for emulation and self-definition, on many issues the moral tone in the black community is set from below.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"

"38489"	"he"	"writes"	" Baker records that he strongly endorsed the idea of getting congressional approval.

"39148"	"he"	"writes"	" Such severe self-denigration informs a good deal of this memoir, which is roughly divided into three parts: one on the author's childhood, one on his years in the Royal Navy during World War II and the rest on his career as a critic and teacher.

BRAVERY : KNOWING WHEN TO FIGHT By Edward Hoagland. New York Times Magazine. 1,000 words.  In this very personal piece, Edward Hoagland looks back at acts of ``cowardice'' in his childhood and remembers the simple rules he learned that he carried with him into the army, then to Africa as a roving journalist and later to the internecine matrix of academia and literary politics. Bravery, he writes, may more realistically be described as knowing when to fight - and cowardice, as not.  2. OLD AND NEW DEMOCRACIES ARE TROUBLED, BUT FIRST, PEACE By Flora Lewis. 800 words.  Just the serious prospect of ending the ravaging war in Bosnia, instead of spreading it ever wider, is a great relief. This is not the time for quarrels about why it wasn't done much sooner, or how to share blame, which is ample, and credit. There is too much to do ahead to make sure the peace works.  3. From DER SPIEGEL (English translations available):  a) In-depth interview with Poland's new president, Alexander Kwasniewski, about his communist past, NATO membership and the power of the church. 1,500 words.  b) ``Bulldozer in Paradise'' - Extinction of Species : Mankind is robbing itself of one of its most precious resources. The diversity of nature is the raw material on which the pharmaceutic and agricultural industries feed. But only three out of four species will survive the next 25 years. Researchers call for wise resource management to replace the ``Red Lists.'' 1,500 words.  4. EXCLUSIVE SHIMON PERES INTERVIEW From Newsweek. 750 words. (Not available in Japan.)  ``There have been many threats on his life, says Israel's prime minister Shimon Peres, but he considers them a ``professional risk,'' and refuses to live in fear. ``You can die from fear. And I prefer not to fear death. I'm not worried at all.''  5. JOURNEY TO JUPITER By Thomas Mallon. New York Times Magazine. 2,500 words. (For release December 3.)  On December 7, Galileo, a backyard-barbecue-size probe, will plunge into Jupiter, hitting the planet's atmosphere at more than 100,000 miles an hour. After parachuting down, it will collect 75 minutes worth of data and possibly add to our knowledge of the origin of the planets. Thomas Mallon, author of the novel ``Aurora 7,'' reports on the historic mission that will ``put the first human fingerprints onto one of the outer planets.''  6. MUSEUMS OF THE WORLD UNITE By Max Frankel. New York Times Magazine. 1,100 words. (For release December 3.)  Computer technology can extend the audience for art ... if museums will work together to produce CDs with images and historical data on their holdings. They will greatly augment the experience of publics everywhere and all they have to lose is a few million frames.  7.

"41786"	"he"	"writes"	" As he points out in this volume, Wiesel realized he had a duty to testify to what he had seen in the camps and to speak for the survivors. Survivors, he writes, ``have been subjected to countless analyses, dissected, exhibited, and made `presentable' for theological, scientific, political and commercial puposes. Treated like objects, they have been insulted, belittled, and betrayed. To resist this tide survivors _ and they are becoming ever fewer _ have only words, poor, ineffectual words, with which to defend the dead. So some of us weave these words into tales, stories and pleas for memory and decency. It is all we can do, for the living, and for the dead.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
"42292"	"she"	"writes"	" Buffalo, N.Y., was suffocated by a blizzard Sunday. More than 25 inches fell by 2 p.m., setting a new 24-hour record snowfall. The Lovejoy section of the city had more than 3 feet while a few miles away, the sun shone. A 10-mile-wide band of heavy snow wavered north and then south across the heart of the city during Sunday. Within the squall, snow fell at the rate of 5 inches per hour. The combination of 25-mph winds and readings in the low teens made all travel very dangerous. By evening, the snow was expected to shift south allowing the city time to recover for Monday. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19951210.0063 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (AM-PAGE1-CONSIDER-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> (HLW)  EDITORS:  New York Times editors are CONSIDERING these stories for Monday's Page 1:  INTERNATIONAL  RUSSIA-ARCTIC (Vorkuta) _ Miners in the Russian Arctic are in a deeply anti-incumbent mood.

NATIONAL  BRAGG-MOOD (Fayetteville, N.C.) _ A mood piece from Fayetteville and Fort Bragg, where the black community is in shock, having thought that racial killings were a part of the past. Now three white soldiers have been charged in the killing of a black couple, and the army is investigating possible extremist activity at Fort Bragg. Rick Bragg.

NY-RABIN-MEMORIAL (New York) _ A memorial at Madison Square Garden on Sunday for Rabin includes logistical problems, as the first-come-first-seated policy plays out badly as long lines of people are left standing in the cold.  NY-SUBWAY-FIRES (New York) _ Token booth clerk Harry Kaufman died on Sunday as police investigated the third recent token booth incident: a booth set afire in Long Island City on Saturday. But police said they have not found a link between the robbery and arson at Kaufman's booth in Brooklyn and other incidents. Robert D. McFadden.  WASHINGTON  CONGRESS-MEDICARE (Washington) _ As the two sides square off the last week of this round of budget talks, much of the partisan passion stems from a rather arcane dispute, and we take Medicare as a case study. Democrats want to focus on proposed savings while Republicans want to focus on the leval of spending. Republicans argue that if the president would talk about spending, only then would the two sides be close together -- maybe a 2 percent difference. Robert Pear.

In one of this year's projects, which went on exhibit over the weekend at the O.K.

If a monument or marker were to be placed to indicate the site of your remains, what would it be, and what would it say? Is there anything in particular you'd like to wear or take with you?''  Among the responses:  Artist/photographer William Wegman sent a simple sketch of ``Wegman in the Mountain,'' a Mount Rushmore-size marble sculpture in which his face would be carved.  Cartoonist Roz Chast wishes to be ``compacted into something about the size of a bouillon cube. This would take a very powerful machine. The Defense Department probably has one lying around.'' The cube could be placed in a small box for someone's mantle, she writes, or just ``be buried under a little tombstone that would say something like, `Don't Mind Me.'''  Poet Mark Strand wants his body, dressed perhaps in a tuxedo, to be encased in Lucite. ``My hope is that I would be used as a coffee table in my daughter or son's living room. . . . I believe that despite dying, I could still be the life of the party.''  Novelist Jane Smiley says she wants a black walnut coffin, and she doesn't want to be ``embalmed or made up.

Artist/writer Richard Kostelanetz wants to be buried with copies of his own works _ books, audiotapes and videotapes _ ``if only to give me something to do with myself and perhaps, should the opportunity arise, entertain others.''  Writer Ariel Dorfman wants to take along ``a peephole, so when I awaken from time to time I can see what is going on. My deepest desire: to be a voyeur of the future of the species.''  Artist/filmmakerBruce Conner wants to take along ``a toothbrush and a fluffy towel.''  Writer T. Coraghessan Boyle rejects the ``presumptuous'' question because, he says, ``I have no intention of dying _ not now or ever.''

After a foot and a half of wet snow falls on Cooper's Boston garden, snapping off his stately 10-foot juniper and breaking his old lilacs in two, he can still enjoy the beauty of his snow-covered conifers ``stooped in the bent postures of old men.''

"46070"	"he"	"writes"	" But in the analysis that follows these accusations, Fallows's points seem indisputable. Whatever has gone wrong with journalism, he writes, can be traced to the distorting effects of television, particularly its tendency to focus on the ``brief now'' in which events occur, and its overwhelming power to make people seem larger than life. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"
"46071"	"he"	"writes"	" As a consequence, he writes, television reporters have evolved from authorities into celebrities, whose newscasts depend less on knowledge and research than on pure performance.

"46072"	"he"	"writes"	" That media coverage can actually ``get in the way of the nation's business'' Fallows demonstrates with an arresting analysis of the reaction to the Clinton administration's attempt to change the nation's health care system.

Please notice eight gulls drilling for crabs in the shallow water. Please look beyond the unmolested surf to your vision's final boundary, where the deepest and brightest blue runs into the lighter sky.

"49040"	"he"	"writes"	" Draper's treatment of the Stamp Act crisis of 1764 provides a good example of his analysis of an event based on documentary evidence. That year, he writes, was ``the annus mirabilis of American political pamphleteering.'' Four ``extraordinary'' pamphlets presenting the colonial taxation-without-representation opposition appeared that year, a key one from James Otis in Boston. Draper quotes extensively from them all as well as from others arguing the British position. ``The larger questions'' of colonial policy ``had never before been thrust into the public arena,'' Draper writes. And moving beyond the political dispute, Draper chronicles the increasingly violent colonial opposition with extensive quotations from contemporary reports. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"
"49041"	"he"	"writes"	" An even greater concern was the growth of colonial manufacturing _ a growth that had been predicted by the author of the very first pamphlet cited by Draper on the Canada/Guadeloupe question. Draper traces the markedly unsuccessful British efforts to control the production of wool, hats and iron in the colonies. The colonies, he writes, were no longer economic partners _ the customers for British goods they had been for close to 150 years _ but rivals. As one British observer put it, ``nothing remains but to part with them on as friendly terms as we can.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"

"53048"	"she"	"writes"	" Finally, her vision of the future of sexual relations in America seems just a touch utopian. Analyzing what she calls ``the new sexual revolution,'' in which both sexes take part in ``peer counseling and education'' on campuses and in secondary schools, she writes, ``This movement promises to change American sexuality because many of the participants and leaders are individuals just beginning their sexual life cycles.''

"59621"	"he"	"writes"	" This is scarcely an original argument, but Goldhagen advances it with unusual force. Extending back into the Middle Ages, he writes, anti-Semitism became a part of the way ordinary Germans saw the world. It became everyday ``common sense'' that Jews were a fundamentally different people whose existence in Germany was a malignity. Long before Hitler, Jewishness was seen as ``inimical and deleterious, if not life-threatening, to all things German. . . .

According to Kamp, so-called political wits concentrate too much on personal attacks and not enough on the issues. Most of them, he writes, seem to have skipped their homework, and are unable to focus on what's important.  ``Today's comedians aren't offended by the established order at all,'' says Mort Sahl, a satirist who made his name in the '50s. ``Everyone makes the obvious jokes about the irony of Al D'Amato leading an ethics investigation, but no one dares devote their act to dissecting Whitewater itself. Everyone calls Clinton a waffler and talks about his jogging shorts, but no one's doing anything about how he's not really a Democrat.''  Kamp says the trend started when Chevy Chase portrayed President Gerald Ford as a slapstick figure prone to falling, ignoring such large issues as the fact that he had pardoned Nixon. Chase's shtick gave rise to today's political satirists, including Al Franken, Bill Maher andDennis Miller, whose humor includes ``lots of throw-the-bums out palaver and unimaginative ridicule,'' but little on-target commentary.  The only TV show that has been a ``consistently funny, consistently smart source of political humor,'' writes Kamp, is ``The Simpsons,'' wherein the residents of Springfield are ``constantly embracing jingoism, whipping themselves into a frenzy over perceived threates to their way of life and harboring suspicions that someone else is living high on the hog at their expense.''  ``Springfield is, in essence, a town full of Perot voters. . . .

WASHINGTON  AIRLINE-SECURITY _ WASHINGTON _ Amid initial suspicions that a bomb destroyed TWA Flight 800, questions already are being raised about why the FAA has not ordered the installation of sophisticated explosives-sniffing security devices that are in use at airports elsewhere in the world. And former Transportation Department Inspector General Mary Schiavo says that in a recent test her staff was able to penetrate security at airports throughout the country. Critics today are likely to renew claims that domestic airport security is too lax. But airtight security has a cost. The price tag for the bomb-sniffing devices: up to $5 billion. (Malone). MOVED.  POLITICS  LAMM _ WASHINGTON _ If Ross Perot is the Reform Party's rich and rambunctious Superman, Richard Lamm now is campaigning hard to get credit as its underpaid, mild-mannered Clark Kent. Perot's challenger for the party's presidential nomination said that as president he would be less of an ``autocrat'' and ``genius'' than Perot, more of a ``politician'' and ``accountant'' and less secretive. The former Democrat said the successes of state governors who were independents show that, once in the White House, a third-party president would find that ``the oil can is mightier than the sword.'' On a more pragmatic level, Lamm said he now has raised $50,000 of the $300,000 he hopes to spend by Aug. 11 in order to seek the Reform Party's nomination, but can't afford to take the party up on its offer to let him use its entire 1.3-million name mailing list.

"65525"	"she"	"writes"	" Much of Russell's interest in archaeology, she writes, ``comes from the image it offers of a healthy America _ clean air, clean water, abundant wildlife. This is my definition of wealth.'' On that wistful premise, she builds a book about the present state of American archaeology, its controversies and how its practitioners might deal with them. Crucial to this is Russell's ability to draw back, contemplate, then get to the heart of things. ``Ambiguity remains the truer science,'' she writes. ``Mystery is central. First settlement reads like a whodunit with an aggravating number of suspects, plot twists, wild cards and missing evidence.'' The science that is seen by many as ``a feud about dates'' is to Russell the elusive story of people who long ago experienced ``that giddy and frightening smell of newness, the impact of being human in a non-human world, the meaning of loneliness.'' This is an engaging, thought-provoking book about our study of the past. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"

Political analyst Michael Barone, author of the biannual Almanac of American Politics, told Diana McLellan of Washingtonian magazine that the American swing to the right isn't about financial issues.  ``One thing that's been widely assumed since the New Deal days is that politics is mostly about income distribution _ that it's the state's job to redistribute it and that people are motivated by a desire to get more money from other people.

Times News Service  Mother Teresa, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, is expected to be discharged Wednesday from the Woodlands Nursing Home in Calcutta, where she was hospitalized Sept. 16 after having fallen from a chair, Reuters reported Tuesday.  Doctors said that a brain scan had detected a black spot on her brain, which could indicate a hemorrhage or stem from an earlier injury, and that they were awaiting the results of a second scan.  Dr. Dinamani Banerji said a second scan was needed to confirm that the spot posed no danger. Mother Teresa was also hospitalized a month ago for heart trouble, malaria and pneumonia.  c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service  When Brigitte Bardot retired from the movies in 1973, her only public appearances were on behalf of animal rights. Now, she has something to say about humans.  Her memoir, ``Initials B.B.'' was published Tuesday in France by Grasset, The Associated Press reported.  In the book, which is in French, she writes about some of her love affairs, including those with the actors Jean-Louis Trintignant, Sami Frey and Serge Gainsbourg, and her marriages to Roger Vadim, Jacques Charrier and Gunter Sachs. She is now married to Bernard d'Ormale.  But not everyone was a lover. Picasso, she writes, kept his distance when he gave her a tour of his studio.  Ms. Bardot, who will turn 62 on Saturday, began writing the book when she was 40.  c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service  When the British playwright Harold Pinter wrote ``Betrayal,'' the inspiration was autobiographical. The play, which was first presented in 1978, was, a new biography by Michael Billington reports, inspired by Pinter's seven-year affair with Joan Bakewell, a British television news broadcaster and journalist.  The biography, ``The Life and Work of Harold Pinter,'' in which Pinter cooperated with Billington, will be published in Britain by Faber in November.  Billington writes that the affair took place from 1963 to 1969, while Pinter was married to the actress Vivien Merchant and Ms. Bakewell to Michael Bakewell, a radio and television producer.  Stories about the affair, based on the book, were reported in Monday's Daily Mail and Observer. In an article published Tuesday in The Guardian, Billington wrote that Pinter had read the final manuscript of the book and made no changes.  In the article, Billington said: ``When I spoke to Pinter yesterday he said he had variously been reported as being `angry' and `furious' at the disclosure of the affair. `Why should I be, when I knew perfectly well it was in the book? The only thing that made me furious was being rung at 11:30 at night by reporters asking for a comment.' ''  Billington said Pinter had suggested he interview Ms. Bakewell, who confirmed that ``Betrayal'' was about their affair. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960924.0678 type=story > <HEADLINE> PEROT FILES FCC COMPLAINT AGAINST NETWORKS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> DALLAS (BC-PEROT-TEX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"

CASH BASHING  A woman came in to see her veterinarian with a serious problem:  ``Doc, my dog isn't moving.''  ``How long has this been going on?'' the vet said.  ``Two days.''  ``This doesn't look good,'' said the vet, ``but put him up on the exam table and we'll see.''  She put the dog up on the exam table, and the veterinarian examined him.  ``Ma'm, I'm sorry to have to tell you this,'' he said, ``but your dog is dead.''  ``He can't be. I've had him for over 20 years! Doctor, there's got to be something you can do.''  ``Well, there is one more thing we can try,'' said the vet. ``I have a cat. If there's any way to get any reaction out of this dog, he'll do it.''  ``Yes, please try it.''  The vet opened a door, and a cat came out. ``Go to it, Scruffy,'' he ordered.  The cat jumped up on the exam table sniffed at the dog and marched around him. No reaction. The cat took a couple of swipes at the dog. No reaction. The cat backed up, took a run at the dog and bit him. No reaction.  ``I'm very sorry ma'm,'' said the vet. ``If Scruffy couldn't get a reaction out of your dog, no one could. He's dead.''  The woman dabbed her eyes and said, ``Thank you for trying. How much do I owe you?''  ``$330.''  ``$330!'' the woman exclaimed. ``What for?''  ``$30 for the office visit,'' said the vet, ``and $300 for the cat scan.''

If the objectives were too broad, then there could be no end to demonstrating.''

"79853"	"he"	"writes"	" In the '90s the black community continues to provide the most fruitful and innovative source of youth slang. The hip-hop movement, Dalzell writes, is without doubt ``the most vigorous youth culture to arise since the demise of the hippie movement.'' Rap, hip-hop's musical component, is, he writes, ``a true source of Afrocentric pride, bright and bold, street and chic, fly and fresh.'' Rap's influence on youth slang has been tremendous, Dalzell points out, especially since it has been vilified by parents, religious leaders and the government, thus increasing its appeal to kids in general. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"

And, with 9 million people in this country alone who have recently had to leave their jobs involuntarily, that's a lot of lost self-esteem. Adam Khan, a Bellevue, Wash.-based columnist for ``At Your Best,'' a monthly newsletter for people in the workplace, writes on how to recover from being downsized, and re-entering the work force sooner, stronger and feeling better about yourself.

From Parents By KATHY SEAL  The idea that self-esteem forms the basis of healthy emotional and intellectual growth was popularized in the 1960s. Soon ``self-esteem'' became a buzzword used to explain everything from why some kids couldn't read to why some were _ or weren't _ drawn to drugs or gangs. But is there such a thing as too much self-esteem? Santa Monica Calif.,-based free-lance writer Kathy Seal explains the difference between going overboard with superficial praise and instilling confidence in your child.

Excerpted from ``Staying Young, Looking Great'' (Rodale Press, 1997) Edited by MICHAEL LAFAVORE  One of the central traits of maleness is wondering how you measure up to other men. This book excerpt saves men the trouble of peeking at the pay stubs of their pals, or peering into bedroom windows to catalog other guys' sexual prowess by providing stats on the Average joe in categories such as: amount of sex he has per month, amount he makes per year and pounds of muscle on his body.

Adam Khan, a Bellevue, Wash.-based columnist for ``At Your Best,'' a monthly newsletter for people in the workplace, writes on how to recover from being downsized, and re-entering the work force sooner, stronger and feeling better about yourself.

From Parents By KATHY SEAL  The idea that self-esteem forms the basis of healthy emotional and intellectual growth was popularized in the 1960s. Soon ``self-esteem'' became a buzzword used to explain everything from why some kids couldn't read to why some were _ or weren't _ drawn to drugs or gangs.

Excerpted from ``Staying Young, Looking Great'' (Rodale Press, 1997) Edited by MICHAEL LAFAVORE  One of the central traits of maleness is wondering how you measure up to other men. This book excerpt saves men the trouble of peeking at the pay stubs of their pals, or peering into bedroom windows to catalog other guys' sexual prowess by providing stats on the Average joe in categories such as: amount of sex he has per month, amount he makes per year and pounds of muscle on his body. Who knows? Maybe you _ or your husband, boyfriend or son _ beats out the Average Joe. If not, tips for improvement are also included in this playful piece.

In this blunt and humorous essay, Glicksman denounces our view that older is not better and that ``you look great for your age'' is a bigger compliment than ``job well done.''

Despite knowing little about bond trading, he managed quite well for a while. His salary at Daiwa was only $40,000 when he was offered a $150,000 job elsewhere in 1983, but, he writes, he could not accept because he had already piled up several million dollars in losses. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

A GUIDE TO GIVING AND HANDLING CRITICISM Excerpted from ``The Confidence Course: Seven Steps to Self-Fulfillment'' (HarperCollins,1997).) (1,000 words) By WALTER ANDERSON (North American rights only. Not for use in magazines.) (Editor's note: This piece is not available for use until after Jan. 20, 1997.)  ``Learning how to handle our emotions under criticism is a sign of maturity and is immensely valuable in the business and professional world. Socially, it's indispensable,'' says Walter Anderson, editor of Parade magazine. In an excerpt from his book ``The Confidence Course,'' Anderson writes on six easily applicable steps to giving criticism and four steps to taking criticism.

And, with 9 million people in this country alone who have recently had to leave their jobs involuntarily, that's a lot of lost self-esteem. Adam Khan, a Bellevue, Wash.-based columnist for ``At Your Best,'' a monthly newsletter for people in the workplace, writes on how to recover from being downsized, and re-entering the work force sooner, stronger and feeling better about yourself.

From Parents By KATHY SEAL  The idea that self-esteem forms the basis of healthy emotional and intellectual growth was popularized in the 1960s. Soon ``self-esteem'' became a buzzword used to explain everything from why some kids couldn't read to why some were _ or weren't _ drawn to drugs or gangs.

In the book ``Darkness Visible,'' author William Styron chronicles his own depression, and argues that the very word is wholly inadequate to describe the turmoil he endured.

"85313"	"she"	"writes"	" Since she was 2 1/2, or maybe younger, Cutting writes, her father abused her, sexually and, on occasion, physically.

When Cutting, at age 35, confronted her mother, her mother, in quick succession told her: ``if it were my father I'd never forgive him,'' ``you've got to forgive your father,'' and, finally, ``my husband would never do that.'' All Cutting says about her younger sister's experience is that ``no one escaped all this domestic violence in our family.'' Her sister, Cutting says, is uncomfortable with the book and with discussing their childhood. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

Adam Khan, a Bellevue, Wash.-based columnist for ``At Your Best,'' a monthly newsletter for people in the workplace, writes on how to recover from being downsized, and re-entering the work force sooner, stronger and feeling better about yourself.

"86297"	"he"	"writes"	" Gordon, who writes ``The Business of America'' column in American Heritage magazine, thinks not. The problem, he writes, isn't the size of the debt, but instead its recent trend. ``For that trend results not from a deliberate political decision to spend in deficit, but rather from nothing more than the sum of myriad decisions regarding taxing and spending that, collectively, now substitutes for fiscal policy.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"86298"	"he"	"writes"	" For another thing, Gordon argues, reducing the burden of taxes on the rich has repeatedly increased revenues, at least until the tax code became too unwieldy to adjust. In short, supply-side economic theory works! The trouble is that Congress has evolved into a body that can no longer adjust spending to revenues. In fact, he writes, ``in recent years, Washington, wrestling with the budget deficit, has come to resemble more and more a drunk wrestling with alcoholism.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"

"87139"	"he"	"writes"	" One of the most thoughtful cases for a downturn comes from Frank Lalli, the managing editor of Money magazine. In an article titled ``The Real Dow,'' he argues that most of the companies that make up the Dow Jones industrial average are using accounting practices that, while perfectly legal, are making the total earnings of the Dow 30 about 20 percent higher than they would otherwise be. As a result, he writes, the Dow is about 1,400 points higher than it should be, and it could drop 15 percent to 20 percent in the next year or so as this practice runs its course. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"

"87656"	"she"	"writes"	" Farrow has had an impressive public career, but she's lived most of her private life in the shadow of famous men. Her marriage to Sinatra was about as unlikely a match as could be imagined. She was a 19-year-old virgin who looked 15; he was 50 and, well, he was Sinatra. But the attraction was genuine, and deep, on both sides. (And it may have been pheromonal on her part at least. Her father and Sinatra, she writes, ``had the same identical smell.'') She still adores him. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"

It wasn't just that she was traumatized. She didn't know what else to do. She was emotionally dependent on him and afraid to lose her job working in his films.

"91510"	"he"	"writes"	" In ``Tense Present,'' David Foster Wallace reviews six books on usage for Harper's with a forest of footnotes, admitting that he is ``the last remaining kind of elitist nerd,'' one who shudders at seeing ``10 items or less,'' (instead of fewer), or hearing ```dialogue' used as a verb.'' He is a self-described SNOOT, a member of ``Syntax Nudniks of Our Time'' . . . the Few, the Proud, the Appalled at Everyone Else.'' Wallace confronts the strict cadences of what he calls PCE.

Although you'll find most of the label's recordings in the world music section of your CD emporium of choice, don't call it a world music label to Byrne, who wrote a superb piece called ``I hate world music'' for The New York Times a couple of years ago (available at www.davidbyrne.com).

"92103"	"she"	"writes"	" But Gitter's primary interest is in Bridgman as an artifact of Victorian morality and psychology. Her account, somewhat more colorful than Freeberg's, shows how Bridgman corresponded to treasured Victorian archetypes well established in the literature of the period. Bridgman, she writes, was a real-life version of Dickens' ``pathetic but valiant little girl heroine,'' Little Nell; more generally, she fit into the vogue for ``suffering and rescue that animated many popular literary works.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"

"93762"	"he"	"writes"	" Movieline has another of those pointless, entertaining features its editors seem to love, a space-filler that manages to both give props to old Hollywood while airing its dirty laundry. In ``Hollywood's Women Who Loved Too Much,'' Charles Oakley catalogs the between-the-sheets activities of actresses who, he writes, ``competed in the boudoir Olympics with as much style and ferocity as their male counterparts.'' The hall-of-fame _ all conveniently dead so they can't sue _ includes Natalie Wood, Rita Hayworth, Ava Gardner, Grace Kelly, and Joan Crawford, who gets points for variety, having had John Wayne and Martha Raye as lovers. Then there's Lupe Velez, who had affairs with both Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Jr. The funniest thing is how often, among the 10 women, the same men pop up. Frank Sinatra, David Niven, and Clark Gable are each mentioned four times, and both Jimmy Stewart and Spencer Tracy clock in three times apiece. Gable is a no-brainer. But Jimmy Stewart _ who knew? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"93821"	"she"	"writes"	" Lowe says Welch does not consider his pay excessive, noting that he and other executives like him are paid based on supply and demand.

"94277"	"he"	"writes"	" But while Shippey notes that Tolkien ``dismissed contemptuously'' the speculation that ``The Lord of the Rings'' was an allegory of World War II _ not least of all because he had started work on it after the publication of ``The Hobbit,'' in 1937 _ he argues that by the time the first book of the trilogy, ``The Fellowship of the Ring,'' was published, in 1954, ``it was for the first time in the history of the world possible for political leaders to say they would have `naught' and make it come true,'' in the destructive power of the atomic bomb, for which the Ring can be seen as a stand-in. Tolkien, he writes, could not say ``nuclear fire'' in Denethor's prophecy ``It shall all go up in a great fire, and all shall be ended. Ash! Ash and smoke blown away on the wind!'' _ ``but the thought fits.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"95485"	"he"	"writes"	" As always, Zinsser, who may be best known for his widely used books on writing, is a beguilingly plain-spoken writer. He has a knack for coming up with apt phrases that accomplish a lot with just a few words. George Gershwin's ``Swanee,'' a ``faux ode to Dixie,'' as he calls it, was sung with ``maudlin gusto'' by Al Jolson. Cole Porter's language, he writes, ``ideally suited his jaded characters and their studied boredom.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"

"96069"	"she"	"writes"	" P.S. Washingtonian magazine says there's been Hollywood talk about making a movie about Graham's life, but the Graham family isn't interested.  SIPOWICZ IN FRANCE II: Having read herein that tough-guy actor Dennis Franz had gone antiquing in France, reader Linda Swarz wrote of seeing him in Provence on a gray day in May at the antique market in Isle-sur-la-Sorgue. When the market closed at lunchtime, Swarz went to a tiny cafe, where Franz and his wife were seated near the door. As she left, she writes, she couldn't help notice the waitress at the table. In a scene that looked like a satirical skit about American tourists, ``Dennis Franz was holding up one of those small cups of French coffee in one hand, pointing at it, and then making an animated pouring motion with his other hand, while looking at the waitress and repeating very loudly and slowly in English, `Milk?

Indeed, she dropped out of graduate school and worked for some eight  years as an auto mechanic. But when a French novel set during a  19th-century cholera epidemic turned her mind back to that  half-forgotten research, she writes, ``I could not stand it anymore''  and had to pick up the subject again. Her preliminary research, she  writes, yielded ``many surprises,'' the most stunning of which ``was  simply that I was on to something big.'' That kind of enthusiasm, rarely  acknowledged by scholars, is what lifts ``Pox Americana'' out of the  mainstream. Fenn's story is a wide-ranging one, from the particular _  Washington had come by his concern through contracting a relatively mild  case of smallpox (and thus acquiring lifelong immunity) while visiting  Barbados in 1751 _ to the general, recounting the epidemics that swept  the North American continent and its native people. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"101182"	"he"	"writes"	" ``Q: The Autobiography of Quincy Jones,'' Doubleday. $26. This book has an appropriately improvisational feel, with some chapters written by Jones and some by family and friends, including lifelong pal Ray Charles and ex-wife Peggy Lipton. It's strongest when Jones is writing about the topic he knows best: music. Dinah Washington, he writes, ``could take the melody in her hand, hold it like an egg, crack it open, fry it, let it sizzle, reconstruct it, put the egg back in the box and back in the refrigerator, and you would've still understood every single syllable.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"102110"	"he"	"writes"	" In making this argument, Hanson joins a group of scholars who do not explain Western dominance as a result of modern imperialism. Jared Diamond (in ``Guns, Germs, and Steel'') sees geography and environment as the primary influences on the development of Western technology and power; David S. Landes (in ``The Wealth and Poverty of Nations'') argues that differences in cultural values and social organization made the difference. Hanson disagrees with Diamond but amplifies Landes' argument, suggesting that culture, however admirable, creates a ``very deadly reality'' in the outcomes of war. The West, he writes, possesses a ``weighty and sometimes ominous heritage'' in which its manner of war ideally ``serves, rather than buries, our civilization.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"

This book has endorsements (they are gushier than most) from Steve Martin, Christopher Buckley and P.J. O'Rourke. So it's a funny book, right? Well, yes, in an odd sort of way. McCall satirizes the 1950s with illustrations of ``the cars Detroit forgot to build.'' During the '50s, he writes, ``the automobile was no longer just an appliance but a rolling boudoir, a metal mistress, a leather-clad dominatrix with great big pointed silver bumpers.'' In that spirit, he gives us the ``Redscare Phantom Witchhunter'' (inspired by Joseph McCarthy, it's a ``rolling hearing room'' with surveillance mikes and a slot for anonymous tips); the ``Quizfire 5000 Jackpot'' (the driver sits in a soundproof isolation booth); and the ``Nixoneer Squelchoramic'' (it has kitchen appliances ``on the outside, for all the free world to share'').

"102476"	"he"	"writes"	" Earlier writers on Wagner have dealt with these issues, but few with the clarity and focus and professional expertise of Magee. And Magee goes further: He explores how Wagner's shifting beliefs either shaped or reflected his shifts in compositional practice. Wagner first encountered Schopenhauer in 1854, which led directly to ``Tristan,'' which has widely and rightly been seen as Schopenhauer in sound. But Magee makes a strong case that ``Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg'' and ``Parsifal'' are equally in Schopenhauer's debt. What the three operas are respectively about, he writes, ``are the three ways in which Schopenhauer thought it possible for us in this life to get a glimmer of contact with whatever it is that is noumenal: through sexual love; through the arts, especially music; and through a compassion-based, self-abnegating mysticism.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"

"102981"	"he"	"writes"	" Goldberg dissects five contemporary plots, including the specter of Communist infiltration (borrowing his title from J. Edgar Hoover's handbook for red hunters, ``The Enemy Within''), the impending arrival of the Antichrist (which, he writes, ``has become as essential to repentance as faith in Jesus''), the roots of hostility between blacks and Jews, and several variations of the Kennedy assassination (at least some of which required few leaps of faith). Completing the quintet are the UFO sightings and cover-ups that supposedly percolated up from accounts by ordinary people and became collectively known as Roswell. (The twisted plots-within-plots in television's ``X-Files'' produced this epiphany: ``The U.S. military saw a good thing in '47 when the Roswell story broke. The more we deny it the more people believed it was true. Aliens had landed, a made-to-order cover story for generals looking to develop the national war chest.'') </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"103053"	"she"	"writes"	" In this volume, a companion to her 52-part PBS series, she writes, ``I offer you not only the classic Italian-American recipes ... but some of my own creations and some classic Italian dishes that have become part of the American culinary culture.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"103192"	"she"	"writes"	" Questions of identity are also thoroughly explored. In a poem called ``Ode to the Diasporican,'' Maria Teresa Fernandez, a 30-year-old Bronx poet known as Mariposa (Butterfly), takes on those who say she is not ``the real thing'' because she was not born in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rican, she writes, ``is a state of mind, a state of heart, a state of soul.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"103584"	"she"	"writes"	" Some of her best recipes, as with David, are written as suggestions within the text. ``How to Eat'' is full of them. In the introduction to a chapter on weekend lunch, she describes the lima bean and tuna salad her great-aunt Myra used to make. Her aunt, she writes, ``would gently mix the two, squeeze lemon over, and cover with a fine net of wafer-thin onion rings.'' She gives instructions for a portobello mushroom sandwich with butter, garlic, parsley, mustard and lemon juice. (It's great.) </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"104724"	"he"	"writes"	" According to the venerable Adam Smith, ``the great commerce of every civilized society is that carried on between the inhabitants of the town and those of the country,'' who are, he writes, ``mutually the servants of one another.'' In some deep-down sense that must still be true, though everything has changed since those words were published. Food still comes from farms, and farmers still buy products made in cities. Farmers, of course, never forget that reciprocity. But to city dwellers, who now make up nearly the entire population of America, agriculture tends to look, unfortunately, like an afterthought, a remnant industry fighting in Congress for a disproportionate share of the national wealth. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"104789"	"he"	"writes"	" In 1913, he writes, ``merchandise trade as a percentage of gross output totaled an estimated 11.9 percent for the industrialized countries,'' a level unmatched until the 1970s. Capital flowed across borders, while transportation costs plummeted. Newly developing nations entered the world marketplace. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"104791"	"he"	"writes"	" A result of this change in perceptions is, he writes, not a universal triumph of markets but a struggle: Adam Smith's invisible hand against what he calls the ``dead hand'' of central planning. Old institutions and habits remain, producing contradictions and turmoil. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"

"107114"	"he"	"writes"	" The result is ``L'Imposture des Mots,'' a short book in which he describes what occurred when Yasmina Khadra became Major Moulessehoul. More than an attack on his critics and fair-weather friends, it is a painful self-examination in which, in the style of a novel, he resuscitates characters from some of his earlier books to criticize, challenge and advise him. The question that he had to face, he writes, was: ``Now that I am no longer a soldier, who am I?'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"107584"	"he"	"writes"	" Not par for the course: As tee time for the Masters approaches this spring, the famous course at Augusta National has been ``Tigerproofed.'' Cigar Aficionado ($4.95) writer Harry Hurt III describes how nine holes have been lengthened to compensate for technological improvements in equipment as well as for Tiger Woods' talent. Meanwhile, he writes, expect to see similar changes in other courses as well. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"108427"	"she"	"writes"	" So she would rise at 5 a.m. for an hour on the water and then slip back into bed by 6:30 every morning for what her husband called ``family time.'' Or sex.

"109303"	"she"	"writes"	" When Arieff discusses neighbors' objections that the house glows, she writes, ``well, it does _ but only on the rare occasions when the Wyatts choose to light it from within. When they do, it's breathtakingly beautiful.'' Translation: The complaint is valid, but the perpetrators don't usually commit the offense, and besides, the cretins would love it if they had any taste. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"109304"	"she"	"writes"	" What we call a canteloupe, by the way, is usually a muskmelon. The true canteloupe, she writes, is native to Armenia, and was taken by missionaries to the papal gardens at Cantelupo (whose name means singing wolf) near Rome. From there, this savory melon swept through France, Spain, England and the Netherlands. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"109972"	"she"	"writes"	" Webster, she writes, believed that ``America could never be fully independent from England, or fully united as a nation, without its own peculiar but common tongue.'' Lepore writes of Webster ``scribbling words he considered distinctly American into a draft of a new dictionary, to make sure the people of the United States remained as separate as possible from the rest of the world.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"110780"	"she"	"writes"	" Early pieces are decorated with the feathers of birds captured in Cambodia, once called Funan, she writes, and some believe the export trade funded the building of the majestic and ancient buildings of Angkor Wat. The superior Cambodian feathers were often used in bridal tiaras, commissioned pieces that brought a high price. Although the finest items were reserved for royalty, even the poor might own a small piece, sometimes given at New Year's. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"111028"	"he"	"writes"	" Almost from the beginning, things went badly. Maier was given menial tasks, which he bungled, he writes, to the delight of more experienced colleagues. All around, chaos reigned. In Maier's account, Cramer is to computer terminals what Pete Townshend once was to electric guitars. Cramer's shouting, he said, drove secretaries to tearful fits. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"111294"	"she"	"writes"	" To Meier, the tests are good for one thing: ranking people, schools, and districts. To that end, she writes, ``they have always done a good job of making sure the winners in the rest of life's stakes stay ahead and the losers stay behind.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"111410"	"he"	"writes"	" There are few writers toiling on the edges of ground zero better equipped to express what happened. In an early poem, titled ``There Is a God Who Hates Us So Much,'' he wrote ``the city is the shadow/strapped to my back/I am the poet of that shadow'' and then that ``God gives the world/the brown and black frost/the city climbs through/to stars no one can see.'' In another poem, ``When You've Been Here Long Enough,'' he asks what kind of God allows us to suffer. It is, he writes, a God who ``answers your prayers with dust and you swallow it.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"112034"	"he"	"writes"	" It was a puzzling friendship, from the book's description. Hassleman was 6-foot-3 and rippling with muscle, an unstable, hot-tempered drug addict who merely posed as an alcoholic for the camaraderie of AA. Hassleman was not only a knife and gun collector, he was also a closet homosexual who lied about a beautiful ex-wife. Although Lerner had other friends, he writes, he was lonely without his family or job. So he started hanging out with Hassleman over games of video blackjack. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"112161"	"he"	"writes"	" Lee is understandably deeply scarred by his ordeal. He admits that he made a mistake by creating the personal tapes and failing to hire an attorney as soon as he was approached by FBI investigators. Still, he writes, ``the fact that I could be released after being so wrongly accused is evidence of the good in America. I can still say that I am truly glad that I am an American.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"112582"	"he"	"writes"	" Referring to ``Schindler's List,'' the Steven Spielberg film, he writes, ``Can you imagine a team of executives coming out of a huddle at a major studio and saying to their boss, `JB . . . the story's set in a concentration camp, see? And there's this really noble guy . . . some kinda businessman . . . a metal fabricator maybe . . . and he saves Jews by having them make pots and pans in his factory. It'll be smash-ola!'

"124806"	"he"	"writes"	" It was a case that sent shivers through any parent whose child has been bullied at school. On Nov. 2, 1998, Jonathan Miller, a Cherokee County student who was barely 15, struck 13-year-old Joshua Belluardo in the back of the head on his way home from school. After Belluardo died two days later, Miller was tried as an adult and sentenced to life in prison. Was Miller a terrible boy and a bully? That and other questions are explored by Atlanta writer Tom Junod in the October issue of Esquire ($3) as he talks with the Millers and the father of a high school student who committed suicide after being harassed. Finally, he examines his own history as a bully who terrorized a fifth-grade classmate. ``I was a kid who cried whenever my father yelled at me,'' Junod writes. ``My tears were a source of great shame, so when I found a boy whose tears I could turn on and off like a faucet _ well, it gave me what shrinks would call a necessary sense of mastery.'' Had this happened today in one of the schools with zero-tolerance policies in response to bullying, Junod says he would have been expelled or possibly sent to a juvenile detention center.

COMMENTARY:  MARTINEZ--COLUMN _ While more discerning and less conventional Americans _ like Susan Sontag and Norman Mailer _ think the United States will use the war to create a new map of the Middle East, even at the risk of increased Islamic terrorism, a great part of the country simply watches the transfiguration of George W. Bush in amazement. He has ceased being a colorless leader, oft scorned by the press, to become not only a crusader of a new imperial faith but its most successful promoter, observes Argentinean writer Tomas Eloy Martinez.  Bush's bearing is that of an enlightened preacher, he writes, whose version of democracy is the only true one. This is in spite of the fact that many individual rights are being torn to shreds in a turnabout that if not fascist, looks very much like it.

Hughes published his own esoteric works after her death, but Middlebrook argues that he was, more importantly, the guardian of Plath's literary legacy, Plath's husband. It was in that role, she writes, that he would build _ knew he would build _ his posterity. Plath's writing, so much of it autobiographical and molded by this marriage, made her an icon of American literature, more so posthumously. Together, they left a compelling account of the orbits of two huge minds _ how they crossed and tried to make room in the same universe. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200310.gz"
"138449"	"she"	"writes"	" A crucial work Middlebrook cites is Hughes's ``Birthday Letters,'' published in 1998, which Hughes himself described as ``my own drama with the dead.''

"139103"	"he"	"writes"	" Biskind ends his book on an elegiac, auld lang syne-ish note. The era of the true indies is just about over, he writes, the victim more of success than of failure. Miramax, with its addiction to bigger-budget films (``Gangs'') and what he sees as treacle like ``Chocolat'' and ``Shakespeare in Love,'' is not the nimble company it was. Sundance went Hollywood long ago. And now that almost every major studio has its own boutique ``indie'' division, who's to say what an independent film even is anymore? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200401.gz"
"139207"	"he"	"writes"	" Hitchens calls the biblical Crucifixion ``a quasi-mythical account of a ritual killing.'' If the Jewish leadership had any guts, he writes, ``it would turn on those who taunt it with `Christ-killing' and say, `Yeah, all right, since you keep mentioning it, we did you a favor. Judas too. Where would your faith be without us?' '' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200402.gz"
"139375"	"she"	"writes"	" Now 55, Lane is scheduled to be released in November 2006. At one point in the collection of seven essays she contributed to the book, called ''Puzzle Pieces,`` in which she interweaves recollections of abuse she experienced in her childhood and her marriage, she writes, ''Women like me don't hit back.`` </P> "	"nyt_eng_200404.gz"

"140420"	"he"	"writes"	" Today, he writes, we live in the era of 'Frankenfoods,' cloning, in vitro fertilization, synthetic polymers, Artificial Intelligence, and computer generated 'Artificial Life, an era in which Pope John Paul II has warned of the Promethean ambitions of biomedical science, and the President's Council on Bioethics has studied Hawthorne's alchemical story, The Birth-Mark </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"140940"	"he"	"writes"	" While Byrd is most concerned about the imperial presidency, his wrath has other targets as well. The senator directs some of his sharpest criticism at the institution in which he has spent most of his political career. The Congress since Sept. 11, he writes, has been unwilling to assert its power, cowed, timid, a virtual paralytic. In his mind, on no issue has this been clearer than on the war in Iraq. Byrd was appalled that most of his Senate colleagues were willing to pass a resolution in October 2002 with almost no debate, giving Bush a free hand to use the armed forces of the United States ... as he determines to be necessary, especially after the administration had announced its radically new doctrine of pre-emptive war. The senator minces no words in condemning what he regards as Congress' abdication of its constitutional war powers: In this terrible show of weakness, the Senate left an indelible stain on its escutcheon. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"141080"	"he"	"writes"	" A minuscule portion -- generally well under 5 percent -- of the assets of Islamic banks consist of loans based on genuine profit and loss sharing, writes Kuran. He argues that the Quran's famous ban on riba is not, in fact, a ban on ordinary interest, which moneylenders have charged throughout Islamic history. Riba, he writes, was a pre-Islamic practice in which a borrower saw his debt double following a default and redouble if he defaulted again. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"141081"	"he"	"writes"	" Islamic economics, he writes, has promoted the spread of anti-modern, and in some respects deliberately anti-Western, currents of thought all across the Islamic world. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"141422"	"he"	"writes"	" The author also points out that mental health professionals are overwhelmingly white, and so, he writes, even if black men overcome the perceived shame of seeking professional help, it may be difficult to find someone with whom they can build the rapport that allows a patient to reveal his most intimate secrets. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"141423"	"he"	"writes"	" In the end, the author says, black men must be reassured that we will not be diminished in our communities if we suffer from depression. They must end denial when the disease strikes, he writes, and must step out of the shadows of stigma and shame, into the light of acceptance and hope. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"141436"	"he"	"writes"	" His argument is pretty straightforward: If there are no brown recluses where you live, then you can't get bitten by one. California is his best case. In the last 40 years, 10 brown recluse spiders have been found in the state. But, he writes, I have personally heard of several hundred brown recluse spider bite diagnoses made in California in the last decade. Even if they missed a few, 10 spiders in 40 years are just a few lost arachnids, not colonists. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"141926"	"he"	"writes"	" Finished with his breakfast, Vidal lifted his loafered feet up on a capacious, tufted sofa, tailored 30 years ago in Rome to the scale of his big study. Behind the couch, a long wooden desk, another distinguished leftover from the previous owner, serves as the cockpit of his active universe. Between two antique world globes at the ends of the desk, he writes, by hand or typewriter, under a lamp shaped like a classical column. Bookcases line three walls. All the furniture faces a tufa fireplace decorated with floral tiles, under a lofty vaulted ceiling characteristic of local vernacular architecture. Two long windows open to the view down the Amalfi coast to Paestum. A television keeps him informed about current events. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"142077"	"he"	"writes"	" Rifkin by no means conceals these facts. He writes accurately about anti-immigrant sentiment in Europe even as he describes recent gestures, like the French banning of Muslim head scarves in school, a product, Rifkin says, of the French assimilationist ideal. What is strange is that in one breath Rifkin can identify an assimilationist ideal in France even while characterizing the United States as assimilationist and Europe as culturally diverse. Europeans, he writes, seek to establish a politics based on inclusivity -- that is, honoring everyone's individual dream equally. A nice sentiment, but there is nothing indicating that Europe is doing better in this area of life than the United States and a good deal to suggest that it is doing worse. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"142832"	"he"	"writes"	" After his compelling account of the country's first flirtation with empire, Judis directs his fire at the Bush administration, persuasively arguing that it has revived the errant imperialism of the late 19th century. After the relatively easy victory in Afghanistan, he writes, President Bush and his advisers experienced the same rush of national power and the same illusion of omnipotence that the McKinley administration had experienced after the 'splendid little war' against Spain. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"143321"	"she"	"writes"	" And, she writes, their quandaries are also my family's quandaries. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"143322"	"she"	"writes"	" Farmers can sell the development rights, thus preserving the land for farming, but few do so, Brox writes, because it goes against a grain deep in most of them, who have viewed the land itself as their only legacy, integral to their lives and to their sense of independence, which has always gone along with working the land. And, she writes, They cannot imagine it may be different after their time. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"143768"	"he"	"writes"	" He also accuses Cuomo of political cowardice, that he never dared to push for some restrictions on unlimited abortion on demand nor to push for changes in the Democratic Party platform. The intent of the Notre Dame speech, he writes, is the spurious justification of a Catholic politician who wants it both ways. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"143867"	"he"	"writes"	" And that is where Duelfer's story ends. Duelfer makes clear on the very first page of his report that it is a story. It is a mistake and a distortion, he writes, to pick out a single frame of the movie and isolate it from the rest of the tale. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"143957"	"she"	"writes"	" Diana Kennedy deemed this drink, which incorporates the seeds and pulpy center of the cantaloupe that are generally thrown away, an exception to her general indifference to horchatas. After eating fresh cantaloupe at a friend's house, she writes, she observed the maids saving the seeds to make the drink, which she found delicious. Yieldsabout 2 servings per cup of cantaloupe pulp and seeds||| </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"143958"	"she"	"writes"	" Horchatas: In Fort Worth restaurants, you'll probably find horchata listed with the aguas frescas, although the process of making it is quite different. It is made by soaking raw rice in water, sometimes for days, and adding vanilla, cinnamon and, often, sweetened condensed milk. Mexican food authority Diana Kennedy writes that it was brought t Mexico from Spain, where it is often made from the Egyptian chufa nut. Horchata is especially popular in the Yucatan, she writes, where they often add almonds to the drink. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"144093"	"he"	"writes"	" It's possible, he writes, to be hip in Paris or in Prague, but chances are you're building on some American archetype. Hip is as American as apple pie, although apple pie itself could never be called hip. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"144534"	"he"	"writes"	" The mailbox would be overflowing, if electronic mailboxes could, with comments and questions on a couple of recent columns. So we're devoting this week's space to tying up the loose ends, hoping to get some closure on a few topics. First is King Canute, the 11th-century monarch of England mentioned as an emblem of futile opposition. Jeff Woodward of Plano, Texas, says this is slander: Yes, Canute told the tide to turn back -- or so the legend goes -- but he was no self-deluded control freak, notes Woodward: He did it not in the belief that he could really make it happen, but to show his fulsome courtiers they were exaggerating his greatness. Let all men know how empty and worthless is the power of kings, the modest Christian leader is supposed to have said as the waves lapped at his toes. (The full story, unfortunately, reduces Canute to merely a symbol of common sense. Would we remember him at all if we hadn't mistakenly cast him as a nutcase?) Art Amolsch of Washington, D.C., likes his real McCoy story better than the one we offered as definitive. He learned from the History Channel, he writes, that the phrase is derived from the name of an American inventor who created a device for oiling some part of a steam locomotive. Thus, a locomotive equipped with one of these things was said to have the real McCoy. I thought that was a nifty story. . .. Now you tell me the phrase is derived from a Scotch whisky? Pooh. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"145061"	"he"	"writes"	" Britain and France in particular, he writes, need to overcome their narcissism of small differences, nurtured by centuries of rivalry and competition, and join hands in a consistently Euro-Atlanticist partnership with the United States that can keep the collective eye on the big picture. The big picture is knowing that only by working together can Europe and the United States achieve the common objective of enhancing democratic values in the parts of the world where they do not yet exist. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"145310"	"she"	"writes"	" I was drawn to the wise guys. Kaplan publishes a half-dozen titles geared toward the new SAT, including a last-minute, storm-the-barricades guide for super busy students and a little volume titled Inside the New SAT that distills the Kaplan philosophy. It reminds me of books on handicapping the horse races. It even feels a little shady, which is good, although the editors do claim, dubiously, that we know what's on the new SAT, and we know exactly how you should prepare for it. Well, I'm inclined to put more faith in Laurie Rozakis, author of McGraw-Hill's SAT 2400! (a reference to the SAT's new perfect score). Her book, she writes, is based on the press releases issued by the College Board. There is a chance, she adds, that the board will adjust the format as it develops the test. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"

"145547"	"he"	"writes"	" Like Ensler, LaBute has struggled with his weight and body image. In a preface to Fat Pig, he notes that he recently lost 60 pounds. In the process, he writes, he discovered the preening fool who was living just beneath the surface of my usual self. Suddenly, the mirror became my friend. How I loved to rush home from a walk or jump up in the morning and study myself, checking to see if I looked a bit thinner. But, LaBute adds, I also noticed that I was writing less and less. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"

"145994"	"he"	"writes"	" For anyone of a mind to sit out Christmas excess, a big hurdle is finding the fortitude to dodge everyone else. After all, as Tom Flynn writes in The Trouble With Christmas, People who do celebrate Christmas have a terrible time understanding people who don't. It is part of the unconscious arrogance that this ubiquitous festival breeds. It is almost impossible, he writes, to find psychic peace amid a commercial cacophony that leaves no void into which a nonparticipant could retreat. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"146182"	"he"	"writes"	" Ward overlooks few details. Reporting about the Grand Princess, which will sail from Galveston beginning in November, he writes, This ship is the culmination of the best Princess has to offer from its many years of operating what is now a well-tuned, good-quality product. But he decries the many extra-charge items and suggests that cabin attendants are overworked, which cannot translate to fine personal service. He even notes the small bath towels. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"

In the title piece, Rushin goes on a golf tour of Scandinavia, where he played at a course on which golfers cross an international border four times during a single round. Our favorite story is about roller coasters, because it contains a short, hilarious passage describing Rushin's ride on Fujiyama, the highest complete-circuit roller coaster in the world.

TERROR-CONGRESS (Washington) -- Congressional negotiators on Monday said they believed they were within hours of a final deal on an intelligence-overhaul bill that would create the job of national intelligence director to oversee the CIA and the government's other spy agencies. The negotiators said a few sentences of the bill were being rewritten with White House assistance on Monday afternoon to satisfy several House Republicans, who have protested that the bill would dangerously dilute the Pentagon's control over intelligence from spy satellites. The revisions followed a weekend of intense negotiations among the lawmakers and the White House, specifically the office of Vice President Dick Cheney. By Philip Shenon.  With a photo.  SAUDI-ATTACK (Jidda, Saudi Arabia) -- Militants stormed the heavily fortified American consulate in Jidda in a raid on Monday and 12 people died in gunbattles before security forces regained control. It was the first major militant assault in Saudi Arabia since May and the first against a Western diplomatic mission, and appeared to take Saudi authorities completely by surprise. Saudi security officials said four of their men died in the assault. Security forces killed three attackers and wounded two, who were then captured, the Interior Ministry said. None of the dead were American. By Neil MacFarquhar.  With a photo, NYT6, and a graphic.  An early lede has moved.  SOLDIERS-LOANS (Undated) -- Financial hardships are becoming more common among men and women in military service as high-cost easy-money lenders increasingly make them a target market. As a result, many military people have become trapped in a spiral of repeated borrowing at rates that can ruin their finances, distract them from their duties sometimes in the midst of battle and even destroy their military careers. The cost of these loans range as high as 650 percent when expressed as an annual percentage rate, as the law requires. In 2003, at least 22 percent and, more likely, more than 30 percent of the nation's military households did business with high-cost instant lenders, an analysis of a credit industry association's figures by The New York Times shows.

Millions of employees must write more frequently on the job than previously. And many are making a hash of it. E-mail is a party to which English teachers have not been invited, Hogan said.

Hundreds of inquiries from managers and executives seeking to improve their own or their workers' writing pop into Dr. Craig Hogan's computer in-basket each month, he says, a number that has surged as e-mail has replaced the phone for much workplace communication.

FINANCIAL  With story BC-OPEC-OUTLOOK-NYT  Oil prices have been at record highs this year, with money gushing into the coffers of oil producers thanks to the world's growing thirst for oil. But as OPEC leaders head into a fifth and final meeting this year, the topic on their minds and on Friday's agenda is whether there will be too much oil sloshing around the world next year. For some, production cuts may be in order.  We plan OPEC_Producing companies -- size to be determined  Top five OPEC-producing companies, quota and production capacity.  With story BC-AIRLINES-LENDERS-NYT  Bankrupt airlines, which thought they could use the tools of court restructuring to get their houses in order, have gotten a rude awakening from the companies that finance their planes. In just the last week, creditors tried to take 14 airplanes from United and told US Airways it has to come out of bankruptcy by next June.  From Puget Sound in the Pacific Northwest to the Virginia coast, the landscape is the same: The main gate of a large military base opens onto a highway lined with shops eager to make small, fast and remarkably expensive loans, no questions asked. There are more than 200 of these quick-loan outlets around the Navy bases of Norfolk and Hampton in Virginia; almost two dozen around the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton in California; and three dozen within three miles of the Army's Fort Lewis in northwest Washington State.  The New York Times Bestseller lists for the week: hardcover, paperback, and children's books.  SCIENCE  With story BC-SCI-HANGOVERS-NYT  Recent studies suggest that help for at least some aftereffects of intoxication may be available.

, they argued,	 The winner of the award receives almost $50,000 and the finalists nearly $10,000 each. Intended to promote new discussion of contemporary art, the Turner Prize must officially go to a British artist under 50 and has been something of a lightning rod since its inception 20 years ago. Critics in 1984 faulted the first choice, the painter Malcolm Morley, who was born in London but had not lived there for more than 25 years and, they argued, was more American than British. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz

, he says,	 Poetic License does not champion Baraka, but it does defend his right to say stupid things. There are some interesting arguments and some disturbing ones, but perhaps the most astute comment is that of Stanley Crouch, a Newsday columnist and critic. Crouch says that Baraka is a mediocre and vastly overrated poet but argues that he should nevertheless have been allowed to keep his laureate title. Instead, he says, The people who gave it to him should have been fired. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz
, he says,	 It's no accident that Court TV and The Sundance Channel picked Tuesday night to air the first two films in their First Amendment Project, which examines challenges to free speech. Court TV CEO Henry Schleiff says Dec. 7 was selected to remind Americans of the entry into World War II and the freedoms at stake.

, they said,	 To explain to ordinary mortals why the world appears to have only four dimensions -- one of time and three of space -- string theorists adopted a notion first bruited by the German mathematicians Theodor Kaluza and Oskar Klein in 1926. The extra six dimensions, they said, go around in sub-submicroscopic loops, so tiny that people cannot see them or store old National Geographics in them. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz

TERROR-CONGRESS (Washington) -- Congressional negotiators announced a deal Monday afternoon on a bill that would overhaul the country's intelligence bureaucracy in line with recommendations of the Sept. 11 commission. Rep. Duncan Hunter, the California Republican who heads the House Armed Services Committee, said he was now strongly in support of this legislation. Since he had been leading House opposition to the measure, his change of mind appears to guarantee that the legislation will pass in the House of Representatives. By Philip Shenon.  IRAQ-OUTLOOK (Washington) -- Some officials express pessimism on the course of events in Iraq. By Douglas Jehl.  SAUDI-ATTACK (Jidda, Saudi Arabia) -- Militants stormed the heavily fortified American consulate in Jidda in a raid on Monday and 12 people died in gunbattles before security forces regained control. It was the first major militant assault in Saudi Arabia since May and the first against a Western diplomatic mission, and appeared to take Saudi authorities completely by surprise. Saudi security officials said four of their men died in the assault. Security forces killed three attackers and wounded two, who were then captured, the Interior Ministry said. None of the dead were American. By Neil MacFarquhar.  With a photo, NYT6, and a graphic.  (An early lede has moved; a 1stld-Writethru is scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in i news file.)  WTC-INSURE (New York) -- A federal jury said Monday that Larry A. Silverstein, the developer who controls the commercial lease at the World Trade Center site, was entitled to collect up to $2.2 billion, or double the insurance coverage provided by nine insurers at the complex. The jury's decisions, which came at the end of 11 days of deliberation and represented a major development in the rebuilding effort, almost certainly ensures that the proposed $1.5 billion, 1,776-foot Freedom Tower will be constructed at the trade center, although it may be some time before all the insurance money is paid out. It also ensures that Silverstein, who leased the trade center only six weeks before it was destroyed, will remain in control of the rebuilding effort for some time. By Charles V. Bagli.  (Scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in a news file.)  BBO-DRUGS (Undated) -- Developments as Major League Baseball and its players seek common ground on drug testing. By Lee Jenkins.  SOLDIERS-LOANS (Undated) -- Financial hardships are becoming more common among men and women in military service as high-cost easy-money lenders increasingly make them a target market. As a result, many military people have become trapped in a spiral of repeated borrowing at rates that can ruin their finances, distract them from their duties sometimes amid battle and even destroy their military careers. The cost of these loans range as high as 650 percent when expressed as an annual percentage rate, as the law requires. In 2003, at least 22 percent and, more likely, more than 30 percent of the nation's military households did business with high-cost instant lenders, an analysis of a credit industry association's figures by The New York Times shows. By Diana B. Henriques.  With photo and graphic.  (Scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in f news file. An abridged version is also planned.)  WORKERS-WRITING (Bloomington, Ill.) -- Craig Hogan, who heads an online school for business writing here, received an anguished e-mail recently from a prospective student. i need help, said the message, which was devoid of punctuation. i am writing a essay on writing i work for this company and my boss want me to help improve the workers writing skills can yall help me with some information thank you Hundreds of inquiries from managers and executives pop into Hogan's computer in-basket each month, he says, a number that has surged as e-mail has replaced the phone for much workplace communication. Millions of employees must write more frequently on the job than previously. And many are making a hash of it. E-mail is a party to which English teachers have not been invited, Hogan said. It has companies tearing their hair out. A recent survey of 120 American corporations found that a third of employees in the nation's blue chip companies write poorly and that businesses are now spending as much as $3.1 billion annually on remedial training. By Sam Dillon.  CALIF-JANITORS (Undated) -- Three of California's largest supermarket chains agreed Monday to pay $22.4 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by 2,100 immigrant janitors, many of whom earned just $3.50 an hour and were never paid overtime. By Steven Greenhouse.  (Scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in a news file.)  SCI-STRING-THEORY (Undated) -- Twenty years ago, a couple of scientists stood before their peers at a convention in Aspen, Colo., and announced that they had just completed a calculation. They had shown that it was possible for the first time to write down a single equation that could explain all the laws of physics, all the forces of nature -- the proverbial theory of everything that could be written on a T-shirt. There, the concept of string theory emerged, so named because it depicts the basic constituents of the universe as tiny wriggling strings, not point particles. But even as they toasted the 20th anniversary, the string theorists admitted that after 20 years, they still don't know how to test string theory, or even what it means. One expert has called string theory a colossal failure. Even string theorists agree that it has been a long strange trip, but they still have faith that they will complete the journey.

OCEAN-FINANCING (New York) -- The difficulty in finding financial backing for Gem of the Ocean, which just opened on Broadway is understandable: Not a single play that has opened on Broadway in the last 2 1/2 years has made a profit. With big-budget musicals and star-studded revivals with limited runs considered the only thing close to a safe bet, the roster of those producing new plays has shrunk to the very wealthy few, driven by reckless artistic idealism, personal vanity or very often both.

, he said,	 The first to appear was Mihajlo Markovic, a former close ally of Milosevic and a major political strategist of his Serbian Socialist Party. Testifying on Nov. 16 and 17, he denied there had ever been a state policy to try to annex the lands inhabited by Serbs and to attach them to Serbia proper to create a Greater Serbia. Rather, he said, Milosevic had played a conciliatory role while Serbia was being demonized, especially in European -- and specifically German -- news media. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz
, they say,	 Experts give several reasons for the return to favor of an indulgence that has been around since the 1920s but that only became a fixture at hotels in the 1970s and '80s. Some corporations are beginning to loosen their purse strings in an improving economy, they say, and are allowing more employees to pay a surcharge of $10 to $50 at hotels like Marriott and Sheraton and $85 to $200 at InterContinental and Ritz-Carlton hotels. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz

, it said,	 The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network could have filed the lawsuit in any district where one of its plaintiffs lives. The group chose Boston, it said, in part because it wants the case heard before a court that has not yet considered a lawsuit challenging the military's policy. Four federal district courts have upheld the policy in the past decade. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz
, she said,	 Initially, Norwalk said, our thought was that you could have really large regions for the prescription drug plans. But, she said, insurers were very nervous about the amount of risk they would be taking on in such regions. The elderly are heavy users of prescription drugs, and insurers have almost no experience covering drug costs in isolation from other medical costs. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz

, he said,	 But Alan G. Raymond, a spokesman for Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, a nonprofit insurer based in Wellesley, Mass., said, This is not the configuration we expected or would have preferred. The company, he said, has decided not to offer a free-standing drug plan and is unlikely to offer a preferred provider plan to Medicare beneficiaries. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20041206.0207 type=story > <HEADLINE> REPORTER FACING JAIL SAYS SOURCE REJECTED HIS PLEAS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> BOSTON </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz

, she said,	 The couple asked Kosse to speak on their behalf because, she said, they were concerned about losing their security clearances and possibly their jobs if they were identified. The military considers excessive debt a security risk, saying it leaves a service member vulnerable to financial inducements to commit espionage. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz
, he said,	 It would be reasonable to conclude, he said, that 2 percent, or 180,000, of those 9 million households are military families. That would be just under 26 percent of all military households, based on Pentagon personnel figures. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz
, they said,	 No military bases in New York state were included in the professors' study, they said, because payday lending is illegal there. But that came as news to Tonya Duncan, whose husband is completing a year in Iraq with the Army in the 10th Mountain Division, a unit based at Fort Drum in Watertown. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz
, she said,	 Their role as payday lenders seems clear to customers like Duncan. To borrow $300 in cash from N.Y. Catalog Sales, she said, she writes a check for $390, which the catalog sales shop will not cash until payday. But there's a twist: in addition to $300 in cash, she gets $90 in gift certificates to spend on merchandise shown in a dog-eared catalog chained to the counter. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz
, she said,	 Besides, she said, Who on earth would buy gift certificates to order stuff to be delivered months from now, when you can buy better, cheaper stuff at Wal-Mart the same day? Obviously, you go there to get a loan. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz
, he said,	 Last spring, just after signing a lease on an apartment, Foster was sent to sea earlier than he had expected. Unable to arrange for his rent to be paid in his absence, he said, he was evicted. The resulting expenses drove him to seek a $500 loan from Florida Internet. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz
, she said,	 The credit insurance sold to most Pioneer borrowers is a waste of money, said Jean Ann Fox, consumer protection director for the Consumer Federation of America. Most military people have ample insurance, she said, and if they want more to cover a debt, there are far less expensive ways to get it. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz
, he said,	 By early 2003, Brown, the credit union executive, had started to see a stream of sailors coming in to refinance Pioneer loans, he said, many of them with rates of more than 30 percent. At least half of those sailors qualified for credit union loan rates of no more than 18 percent, he said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz
, they said,	 Sisters Nina Bush, Myla Fraser and Daniella Zax wanted to get into the clothing business, somehow mixing their Jewish heritage with hip fashion. They told their father, Rabbi Jerry Cutler, that they envisioned a line of T-shirts emblazoned with Yiddish phrases and that they wanted to take it national. This was a surefire hit, they said, printing a snug tank top with shayna punim, declaring the wearer had a pretty face. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz

, he said,	 The prosecutor said investigators were trying to reconstruct Salinas' last hours, using a cell phone found on his body. There was also a note with an address outside the state. Investigators had visited that location, he said, without elaborating. The car in which Salinas was found did not belong to him. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz

, he said,	 Walter G. Ricciardi, the SEC's administrator in Boston, declined to comment on any enforcement investigation. With regard to the separate examinations by SEC into broader industry practices, he said, We're looking hard at conflicts of interest in the mutual fund industry. SEC rules require that mutual funds disclose conflicts of interests including payments that might affect their decisions. Certainly receiving excessive gifts from people who are trying to secure business from you presents a conflict of interest. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz

The county, she added, had issued 20 use and occupancy permits. The family of Derrick Potts, including three children, was living in a new house close to one that burned and had to evacuate. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz
, they say,	 My favorite example of their three-card-monte logic goes like this: first, they insist that the Social Security system's current surplus and the trust fund it has been accumulating with that surplus are meaningless. Social Security, they say, isn't really an independent entity -- it's just part of the federal government. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz

For now, he said, There is no shortage of supply in the market. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz
, he said,	 We are well on our way to return-to-flight, said John Casper, planning manager of the shuttle program. A year ago, he said, NASA had not complied with any of the investigators' recommendations or an additional 14 that the agency had imposed upon itself before flights could resume. Now the agency has resolved a third of the investigators' requirements and half of its own, he said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz
, he said,	 The adequacy of those rules has been reconsidered in recent months by the governing body of the public finance industry, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which has expressed concern that government agencies, known as issuers, have pressured underwriters seeking their business to hire certain consultants or make political contributions, according to the board's executive director, Christopher A. Taylor. The board members are well aware of what practices are going on, the pressures being brought to bear on them by issuers, Taylor said. We were looking at trends that caused concern on the part of the board: increased use of consultants, increased compensation, increased political giving.

But that, he lamented, was back before society's standards -- indeed, etiquette itself -- had been cheapened and coarsened. Which is where the whole spiel began to strike me as odd -- as odd as, say, Bacchus lamenting an erosion of sobriety. After all, Severin is to gentlemanly standards what the Vandals were to Rome. He has called Al Gore Al Whore and said Gore would murder his daughter to become president; he has labeled Hillary Clinton a lying bitch; and has stated that mere impeachment wasn't enough for Bill Clinton, whom he labeled a traitor.

IRAQ-RUMSFELD (Camp Buehring, Kuwait) -- In an extraordinary exchange at this remote desert camp, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld found himself on the defensive Wednesday, fielding pointed questions from Iraq-bound troops who complained that they are being sent into combat with insufficient protection and aging equipment. A scout with a Tennessee National Guard said soldiers have had to scrounge through local landfills here for pieces of rusty scrap metal and bulletproof glass -- what they called hillbilly armor -- to bolt on to their trucks for protection against roadside bombs in Iraq. The question drew cheers and applause from many of the 2,300 troops assembled in a cavernous hangar here to meet the secretary. Rumsfeld responded that the military was producing extra armor for Humvees and trucks as fast as possible. A few minutes later, a soldier from the Idaho National Guard's 116th Armor Cavalry Brigade asked Rumsfeld what he and the Army are doing to address shortages and antiquated equipment that National Guard soldiers heading to Iraq are struggling with. Rumsfeld said all organizations had equipment, materials and spare parts of different vintages, but he expressed confidence that Army leaders were assigning the newest and best equipment to the troops headed for combat who needed it most. Moreover, he said, adding more armor to trucks and battle equipment did not make them impervious to enemy attack. If you think about it, you can have all the armor in the world on a tank and a tank can be blown up, he said. And you can have an up-armored Humvee and it can be blown up. By Eric Schmitt.  IRAQ-ABUSE (Washington) -- The military has disciplined four members of a Special Operations unit for abusing detainees in Iraq, in particular for administering electric shocks with the Taser weapon, the Pentagon spokesman said Wednesday. Charges of abuses at a temporary interrogation center in Baghdad used by Special Operations Forces hunting insurgent leaders became public Tuesday with the release of a letter written in June by the chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency. By Thom Shanker, Neil A. Lewis and Douglas Jehl.  UKRAINE (Kiev, Ukraine) -- President Leonid D. Kuchma and Ukraine's parliament adopted an overhaul of the country's political system on Wednesday, defusing a bitter political crisis that erupted following last month's discredited vote for Kuchma's successor. The agreement, which amended the constitution and refined election laws intended to prevent a repeat of widespread fraud that marred the Nov. 21 vote, smoothed the way for a new presidential run-off on Dec. 26 between Prime Minister Viktor F. Yanukovich and Viktor A. Yushchenko, the opposition leader. By Steven Lee Myers.  An early lede, UKRAINE-ELECT, has moved.  TAIWAN-ELECT (Taipei, Taiwan) -- With three days remaining until legislative elections on Saturday, the streets here echo with slogans belted out from truck-mounted loudspeakers belonging to the Taiwan Solidarity Union, the smallest but fastest-growing of Taiwan's main political parties. The party favors immediate steps toward greater independence for Taiwan from mainland China. It has benefited from a strong and unexpected surge in the polls here in the last two weeks. The TSU's policies are anathema to Beijing, which has threatened war if Taiwan moves too far toward independence. But they are also alarming to Washington, which does not want a conflict now in this part of the world, especially while large numbers of American soldiers are in Iraq and while the United States is seeking Beijing's help in dealing with North Korea's nuclear weapons program. By Keith Bradsher.  CHINA-LABOR (Dateline TK) -- China has canceled a meeting of international union and business leaders scheduled for next week that was aimed at getting multinational companies to guarantee workers in China basic labor rights. The Chinese director general of international cooperation sent AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and other labor leaders a letter calling off the meeting and revoking their visas, according to statements released on Wednesday by the labor groups. The summit meeting, organized by the 30-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, was to be the first in China. The meeting was to address workers' rights to organize, health and safety standards, stopping child and forced labor, and preventing discrimination. By Joseph Kahn and Steven Greenhouse.  WASHINGTON  (Will move in w news file.)  BUSH-SNOW (Washington) -- President Bush asked Treasury Secretary John Snow on Wednesday to stay in his administration, and Snow agreed, keeping a key member of Bush's economic team in place. Snow walked to the White House to have lunch with other members of the team, and met with Bush, said White House spokesman Scott McClellan. The president is pleased Secretary Snow agreed to continue to serve, McClellan said. Snow has been a loyal supporter of Bush's economic policies since joining the administration in February 2003 after Paul O'Neill's ouster. By David E. Sanger.  DEMS-DEAN (Washington) -- A year after he electrified the Democratic party with his maverick campaign for President, Howard Dean returned on Wednesday in a renewed effort to revitalize his party. Here in Washington, it seems that every time we lose an election there's a consensus reached among the decision-makers in the Democratic Party that the way to win is to be more like the Republicans, Dean said. If we accept that philosophy someone else is going to be here in four years giving this same speech. Dean's first big post-Election Day speech was timed two days before he goes to Orlando, Fla., to appear with a line-up of Democrats who are seeking to become the new chairman of this party. This is a prospect that even his own advisors acknowledged has not exactly thrilled many members of the Democratic Party, who remember the implosion of his campaign and his tireless advocacy on the left-wing of his party, particularly on foreign policy issues. It accounts for a wide field of Democrats seeking to become the alternative to Dean when the party makes its selection in the fall. By Adam Nagourney.  TERROR-CONGRESS (Washington) -- After its passage by the House, and anticipating late-afternoon passage by the Senate, a look at what's in the new intelligence overhaul bill and asking how and how soon it will be implemented. By Philip Shenon.  FINANCIAL  (Will move in f' news file.)  IBM-PENSION (Undated) -- IBM, dogged by complaints about changes it made to its employee pension plan in the 1990s, is planning to close the plan to new employees at the end of the year and give all workers hired in the future a 401(k) plan instead. The plan has been a flashpoint for a nationwide debate about corporate pensions. IBM and many other large corporations began in the late 1990s to move away from traditional, defined benefit plans toward offering their workers 401(k) and cash-balance plans, which combine some features of traditional pensions with those of 401(k) plans. Older workers soon discovered that a shift to cash-balance plans caused them to lose a significant amount of benefits, and in 2003 a federal judge ruled that IBM had violated age discrimination laws in the way it changed its pension plan. By Mary Williams Walsh.  SCIENCE  (Will move in a news file.)  NASA-HUBBLE (Washington) -- NASA should send a space shuttle mission, not a robotic one, to repair the Hubble Space Telescope, says a National Academy of Sciences panel in a report requested by Congress. The agency should consider launching the manned mission as early as possible after the space shuttle is deemed safe to fly again, because some of the telescope's components could degrade to the point where it would no longer be usable or could not be safely taken from orbit, said the committee that wrote the report. By Warren E. Leary and Dennis Overbye.  SPORTS  (Will move in s news file.)  FBC-NOTRE-DAME (Undated) -- The fissures that developed at Notre Dame over the firing of football coach Tyrone Willingham widened Wednesday as the university's president, Rev. Edward Malloy, said that he was upset about how his university had fired Willingham last week. In my 18 years, there has only been two days that I've been embarrassed to be president of Notre Dame, said Malloy, who was speaking a panel at the Sports Business Journal's Intercollegiate Athletics Forum. Tuesday and Wednesday of last week. Malloy said he was not part of the decision-making process because he will retire in June. By Pete Thamel.

He said the European management and employee representatives had agreed on an accord late on Tuesday while negotiating the carmaker's reorganization plans. The carmaker said in October that it planned to cut 12,000 of its 63,000 employees, focusing on the Adam Opel division, to save 500 million euros over the next two years. GM officials declined to comment, but details are to be announced Thursday.  -- PETRA KAPPL  BRITAIN: HIGHER OFFER FOR KIDDE  The British manufacturer of fire extinguishers Kidde said that it had received an improved takeover offer from United Technologies, but that it had not agreed to a deal. United Technologies, which is based in Hartford, Conn., bid 1.38 billion pounds ($2.69 billion), or 165 pence a share, for Kidde, an increase of 5 pence a share from its last offer, made in October. Under British takeover rules, United Technologies must secure Kidde's approval for a deal by Dec. 16 or step down for six months. Kidde, which is based in Berkshire, will give United Technologies limited access to information to conduct due diligence, Kidde said.  -- HEATHER TIMMONS  BRAZIL: INFLATION RISES  Inflation in Brazil rose in November for the second consecutive month, adding to expectations that the central bank will increase interest rates next week for the fourth time in four months. The government's statistics agency said its IPCA consumer price index, the central bank's main gauge in setting interest rates, rose 0.69 percent last month, a larger-than-expected increase, pressured by rising fuel costs. In October, the index rose 0.44 percent. So far this year, inflation has climbed 6.68 percent, and it is expected to hit 7.4 percent by the end of December, according to a central bank survey released this week. While that would be higher than the government's year-end target of 5.5 percent, it would still be within a tolerance band of 2.5 percentage points. In 2005, the central bank hopes to bring inflation down to 5.1 percent.  -- TODD BENSON </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20041208.0144 type=story > <HEADLINE> AN APPLE ORCHARD IN A GLASS </HEADLINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz

FINANCIAL  With story BC-CALIF-AUTOS-PAYLEY-NYT  Fran Pavley, a retired schoolteacher turned Democratic California assemblywoman, probably never expected to be defending the environmental credentials of Arnold Schwarzenegger.  The federal loan board that was created to oversee an airline industry bailout is about to play a key role in determining the next phase of industry competition.

The Connecticut wrestler was shot while on patrol, looking for roadside bombs. At different moments in the war, it has seemed that different portions of the country have borne their share of the casualties, and the distribution of the deaths has been spread across the map. But the last five weeks have seemed to mark the New York region's turn to suffer. Since Nov. 7, 19 servicemen from Connecticut, New York and New Jersey have died in Iraq, the bloodiest term for the region's soldiers since the start of the war. By Alan Feuer.

NEPAL-CHILDREN (Pokhari Chauri, Nepal) -- On a frigid night last February, Nepalese army soldiers rousted 17-year-old Reena Rasaili from the warm bed where she lay curled beside her aunt and accused her of being a Maoist guerrilla. They smashed her feet with rifle butts and dragged her out behind the house, past a lemon tree and the stone watering bowl used by the family ducks. There, they tied her to a tree, stripped most of her clothes and, eventually, shot her in the head, her parents and neighbors recounted in interviews. The incident in this otherwise pastoral village in eastern Nepal is just one in a country where families say they are increasingly caught in the middle of an eight-year civil war that, after already having claimed more than 10,000 lives, is now devouring Nepal's children. Human rights groups estimate that tens of thousands of children younger than 18 -- many in the last year -- have been abducted, forced to attend indoctrination camps or sent into exile by frightened parents. By David Rohde.  With photo.  HKN-LOCKOUT-IMPACT (Buffalo, N.Y.) -- The neighborhood is so dark and lonely these days, that the Cobblestone bar, literally in the shadow of the HSBC Arena here, put up window bars. And with few customers the Cobblestone no longer serves draft beer because the kegs go bad before they're empty. In Columbus, Ohio, Nationwide, the insurance company which has spent $500 million to build an arena for the city's new NHL team, the Blue Jackets, and the business district around it, has recently had to halve the rent for nine restaurants until the hockey season resumes. And near Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, which calls itself Hockeytown in its loyalty to the hometown Red Wings, businesses are suffering. It has been nearly three months since owners of the 30 National Hockey League franchises locked out their players, and the loss of the hockey season has begun to take its financial toll. On Thursday, the two sides are to meet for the first time since Sept. 9, a lonely hopeful sign for a season that appears all but lost. It may be true that in New York and Los Angeles, where hockey is not the center of the entertainment universe; or in places like Denver and Chicago, where the hockey teams share an arena with a pro basketball team and a host of other programmed events, the effects of the lockout are somewhat muted. But in the many smaller cities that are reliant on hockey to enliven downtowns at night, the loss of a season is a significant blow. By Bruce Weber.  With photo.

"147463"	"he"	"writes"	" The lack of input from major artists of earlier years is a severe loss to the company, he writes, but on the other hand it suggests that those earlier dancers have been invaluably spreading the Balanchine canon around the United States and the Western world, as directors of other companies and restagers of Balanchine's ballets. (It is a circumspect way of handling a disappointment that colors much of Gottlieb's reviewing of City Ballet today -- a disappointment, Teachout suggests, that may have deepened when Martins asked Gottlieb to resign from City Ballet after The New Yorker published a disapproving essay by the magazine's dance critic at the time, Arlene Croce, in 1988.) </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"

Balanchine the artist comes suddenly and immediately alive in Gottlieb's graceful description of the making of that seminal Balanchine classic in 1941. A member of the original cast, he writes, remembers that there was a movement in the adagio that Balanchine called the Harlem strut. There was a lot of kidding around in the rehearsals, he quotes that cast member, Fred Danieli, as saying.

When Billy Collins left the laureateship after an intense campaign to bring poetry to a larger public, he was succeeded by Louise Gluck, who declined interviews and stated that she had no interest in widening her audience. Gluck was followed in turn by the amiable Kooser, who, like Collins, is deceptively accessible and has recently announced plans to write a free weekly column on poetry for local newspapers.

His tone is jokey and familiar, and the potted biographies often read a bit like Cliff's Notes, but more often than not Geary comes up with neat formulations. E.M.

"163548"	"she"	"writes"	" THE WHOLE EQUATION: A History of Hollywood, by David Thomson. (Vintage, $15.) For Thomson, the whole equation means not just the history of American movies, but the history of America in the time of movies. This ambitious book describes the groundbreaking work of early filmmakers; how the roles of directors, writers and producers changed as the movie business evolved; and how films have affected our sensibilities. In THE BIG PICTURE: Money and Power in Hollywood (Random House, $15.95), Edward Jay Epstein outlines the transformation of the movie business since the end of World War II and explains why movie studios are less interested in the moviegoing audience itself than an ever-growing variety of revenue sources (toy and burger tie-ins, video sales and rentals). In REBELS ON THE BACKLOT: Six Maverick Directors and How They Conquered the Hollywood Studio System (Harper Perennial, $14.95), Sharon Waxman, a Hollywood correspondent for The New York Times, profiles a group of iconoclastic filmmakers -- including Quentin Tarantino and Steven Soderbergh -- who, she writes, fought their way through the Hollywood system to bring their signature films into the daylight of broader popular culture. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"163803"	"she"	"writes"	" Grandin is autistic, which has made her life difficult, and yet she believes it has given her a special understanding of animals. New in paperback is her engaging discussion of why she says animals saved me when she was a girl, of the many things she has learned about them and of her long-held belief that animals and autistic people are visual thinkers. The result, she writes, is that autistic people can think the way animals think. Autism is a kind of way station on the road from animals to humans, which puts autistic people like me in a perfect position to translate 'animal talk' into English, she writes. I can tell people why their animals are doing the things they do. Her book is anecdotal, provocative and appealingly chatty, whether she's talking about dogs, horses, cattle, pigs or cats. One book critic called it hilarious, fascinating, and just plain weird. And Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, author of The Hidden Life of Dogs and a devoted observer of animals, noted that Grandin has a Ph.D., but the autism has probably served her better. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060308.0107 type=story > <HEADLINE> SENATE PANEL WEIGHS WHAT TO DO ABOUT 12 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WASHINGTON </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164121"	"he"	"writes"	" As he's done in so many of his earlier books, Phillips draws a lot of detailed analogies in these pages, using demographics, economic statistics, and broader cultural trends to map macropatterns throughout history. In analyzing the fates of Rome, Hapsburg Spain, the Dutch Republic, Britain, and the United States, he comes up with five symptoms of a power already at its peak and starting to decline: 1) widespread public concern over cultural and economic decay, along with social polarization and a widening gap between rich and poor; 2) growing religious fervor manifested in a close state-church relationship and escalating missionary zeal; 3) a rising commitment to faith as opposed to reason and a corollary downplaying of science; 4) considerable popular anticipation of a millennial time frame; and 5) hubris-driven national strategic and military overreach in pursuit of abstract international missions that the nation can no longer afford, economically or politically. Added to these symptoms, he writes, is a sixth one, almost too obvious to state: high debt, which can become crippling in its own right. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"

Miller, who is a contributing editor to The Wilson Quarterly, finds countertrends, as well -- Internet communities that lead to new forms of conversation, diverse gatherings in which disagreements become an expected aspect of conversation. But, he writes, the forces sapping conversation seem stronger than the forces nourishing it. So Miller, in response, is recounting another kind of conversation that has taken place over the centuries, one whose subject is conversation itself. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"

In 1973, he writes, President Richard M.

"165401"	"he"	"writes"	" Phillips was eerily foresighted in his 1969 book, The Emerging Republican Majority, but he thought the conservative era he predicted would take the country in a positive direction and that as a political analyst for the Nixon administration he would be part of the process. It's not a cheery sign that the final chapter of his new book is called The Erring Republican Majority. Phillips sees the United States as following in the paths of Rome, the British Empire, Hapsburg Spain and other powers that peaked and then crossed an invisible threshold into a period of decline. He blames American hubris for our vulnerability and cites three specific problems as our collective Achilles' heel: the spread and influence of radical religion; our dependence on a dwindling supply of oil; and the soaring national debt. For all of them, he writes, the Republican majority bears a hefty share of the responsibility. His point is well-argued, disheartening and clear: In our arrogance and shortsightedness, he says, we have ignored the lessons of history, and the consequences are knocking at our door. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"

As the book begins, he writes, the old network structure of prime-time lineups designed to amass enormous numbers of viewers all at the same time was everywhere under attack. The networks' news divisions were losing their Big Three (Brokaw, Rather and Jennings), and TiVo, downloads and the rise of reality TV were eating into their prime-time franchise. Here Carter tracks the decisions that saw ABC's fortunes rise, NBC's plummet and Simon Cowell's star continue to rise on Fox. Much of the result was determined, he writes, by chance, by whim, by blind, stupid luck. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060518.0279 type=story > <HEADLINE> RAPPER'S DEATH STRUCK CHORD WITH REVOLUTION'S DEMPSEY </HEADLINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"

And the album's final track, I Hope, co-written by Keb' Mo', has a gutsy gospel refrain, with the trio's lush harmonizing about tough times working as a sonic salve for a wobbly state of the nation.

As a former chief of the state's office of coastal restoration efforts and a leader of the hurricane center, he had long been one of the state's best-known Cassandras on the coming crisis for New Orleans. In the months since the storm, as leader of the state's team of investigators of the disaster, he has helped reveal the flaws in design, construction and maintenance of the city's hurricane protection system that contributed to the destruction. Seeing the storm-ravaged homes and smelling the stench of death in them, he writes, convinced me to try to get the federal government to own up to the fact that this city was flooded by the failure of its levees. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
