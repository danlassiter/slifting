"42928"	"they"	"aren't"	" ``That was 14 games ago,'' Switzer said. ``I'd like to have that success, but we're not the type of football team that we were as far as being physical like we were then. Hopefully, they aren't, either.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
"75674"	"they"	"aren't"	" Despite escalating activity levels at many resorts, there are still outposts for laggards. At Jake's, (809) 965-0635, reservations (800) 688-7678, reservations fax (305) 531-5543, a casual, funky nine-room inn at Treasure Beach on the scenic southwest coast of Jamaica, there is a choice of jaunts to nearby natural wonders, such as riding a mountain bike to Lover's Leap on the south coast, or watching crocodiles bask along the Black River. But the manager, Jason Henzell, said, ``To be honest,'' most guests ``absolutely do nothing.'' The rates start at $75 a night. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19961024.0136 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-BUDGET-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> COX NEWS SERVICE BUDGET c. 1996 Cox News Service  These stories for release Thursday, Oct. 24, 1996, are moving today to clients of the New York Times News Service.

(d)  National  JEWELL-BOMBING _ ATLANTA _ A federal judge Wednesday ordered public disclosure of affidavits used in the investigation of Richard Jewell and said he believes the former Olympic security guard is no longer a target of the bombing probe. (a)  PLANET _ AUSTIN, Texas _ If you could stand on Texas astronomer Bill Cochran's new planet, about 100 light years from Earth, you'd see two suns in the daytime sky. (a)  REPROGRAM _ TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ The end of time is at hand, as far as the state's computers are concerned. It will cost up to $120 million to reprogram state computers not to blow a fuse in 2000, experts told Gov. Lawton Chiles in a Cabin et meeting this week. (a)  FLUNOSE _ HOUSTON _ Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine are testing a needle-free flu vaccine on children age 15 months to 5 years. While the nasal-spray vaccine's effectiveness hasn't been established, lead investigator Dr. Pedro Piedra reports fewer tears from his pint-size subjects. (a)  QUAYLE _ BOCA RATON, Fla. _ The end of the Cold War has left too many voters complacent and too willing to overlook President Clinton's foreign policy failures, former Vice President Dan Quayle said Wednesday. (p)  SUGAR _ undated _ In the political war over the proposed penny-a-pound tax on the sugar industry, sugar producers and environmentalists are battling for the black vote. Both sides have stepped up their campaigns with radio ads that target black audiences. (p)  BAXTER-COLUMN _ MACON, Ga. _ For a few days, at least, this will be pretty close to the middle of the political map. (p)  Sports  BBC-TEXAS-2takes _ AUSTIN, Texas _ It was photo day for the University of Texas baseball team earlier this month. And new coach Augie Garrido allowed his Longhorns to wear their game-day burnt orange and white caps, the ones decorated with the big orange T, for the first time during fall drills. Garrido made an exception for the camera, but he quickly made the players return to his new rule as soon as the photos were snapped. He will not allow any Longhorn to wear the block T until he is satisfied that the team, collectively, has earned it. The team's practice uniform, which the Longhorns have used through fall drills, also lacks the script ``Texas'' printed across the chest. (s)  ROADKILL-2takes _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas fans were stunned earlier this year when the Longhorns were manhandled 37-13 on a rainy night in Virginia. They shouldn't have been so shocked. Such a hard road rout is the rule, rather than the exception, in the last decade of University of Texas football. (s)  LONGHORNSCENE _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Nebraska has a Jumbotron video board at its stadium. Fans call it Husker Vision, and it even has Barry Switzer, who never had a kind word for a Husker when he was coach at Oklahoma, singing Nebraska's praises. And boy, does the Jumbotron make Nebraska's Memorial Stadium a rocking, intimidating place to play. A Big 12 official commented that the music blasted from the video board far overshadowed the Huskers marching band, making it almost unnecessary for the band to be there. Big 12 coaches earlier this week were talking about how the Jumbotron was one reason Nebraska never loses at home. (s) TEXAS POINTS  Business  MEGABANKS _ ATLANTA _ While Southeastern megabanks such as NationsBank Corp. and First Union Corp. try to create a national name for themselves, several of the area's top regional banks are increasing business in their own back yards. (f)  Commentary  HAY-COLUMN _ GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ We hear a lot of moaning today that ``things aren't like they used to be.'' No, they aren't, but I can't understand why people are so surprised. Two world wars and several smaller ones, a youth rebellion in the '60s and the feminist movement in the '70s have forced major social changes. I grew up in those ``used to be'' years, and I don't think the changes are all bad. (k)  For answers or resends, call the Cox News Service at 202-331-0900.

"99296"	"you"	"aren't"	" This book, the first to appear on the events of Sept. 11, is a joint project of the Internet forum Blue Ear and the New York University Department of Journalism. It seemed a bit rough around the edges as we read introductions by NYU's Jay Rosen and Blue Ear's Ethan Casey, but in the text that follows that roughness becomes an asset. Most of these eyewitness accounts of events in New York and Washington that morning were submitted by e-mail. They have what newspapers and magazines don't offer: a breathless, urgent quality that Rosen calls ``the basic act of journalism, when someone says `I'm there now, you aren't, so let me tell you.''' Some are outdated, as when writers wonder how America will respond to the attacks, but that serves to convey the sense of immediacy as Americans were left shaken and afraid. As one contributor wrote to his stepdaughter about the night after the attack, ``I sat there in the dark, Kate, and trembled for us all.'' The book is available through the Web site BookSurge.com. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
