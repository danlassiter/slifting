"32075"	"we"	"shouldn't"	" ``We seem to stumble each year in a couple of games that, theoretically, we shouldn't,'' said Davis, a Fort Worth (Texas) Brewer High School product. ``It's mental more than physical. We get a couple of games under our belts and we get too confident, too lackadaisical. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"

Then, sand the cedar with medium to coarse sandpaper to reveal fresh wood, which will restore the aroma. There is no need to seal the wood; in fact, you shouldn't, because that will stop the aroma. By the way, cedar is a moth repellent, not a moth killer. So, clean the closet very thoroughly. Vacuum everything in sight, then wash all surfaces except the cedar with a mild bleach solution: 1 part liquid chlorine bleach and 10 parts water. Wear skin and eye protection when working with bleach. Then hang moth cakes or similar crystals in the closet in a high spot; the fumes tend to drop instead of rise. And be careful using moth crystals; they are toxic. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
"90899"	"it"	"shouldn't"	" No, it shouldn't, and maybe the Kathy Irelands of the world are likely to change it. Her beauty certainly wouldn't be a ratings-killer. LPGA audiences on ESPN and the Golf Channel run about 70-30 more men although viewership among women is up 47 percent. A shot of Kathy here and there wouldn't exactly hurt the 18-34 male audience demographics, would it? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"111752"	"it"	"shouldn't"	" SARK _ AUSTIN, Texas _ First of all, let's get one thing straight: ``Prosperity'' does not mean ``money.'' At least, it shouldn't, in the world according to SARK. Who is SARK? (We knew you were wondering. The acronym can throw people off.) SARK is really Susan Ariel Rainbow Kennedy, and if you haven't read or heard of her books, it's a likely bet that one of the women you know has.

"151931"	"we"	"shouldn't"	" No, we shouldn't, not if we care about PBS and its potentially valuable place in the TV landscape. We need to expect from it nothing less than good and sometimes great things. And Cooking Under Fire, which premieres Wednesday night at 8 on Channel 2, is not a very good thing.

"151944"	"we"	"shouldn't"	" No, we shouldn't, not if we care about PBS and its potentially valuable place in the TV landscape. We need to expect from it nothing less than good and sometimes great things. And Cooking Under Fire, which premieres Wednesday night at 8 on Channel 2, is not a very good thing. It's a formulaic show that merely mimics the countless niche reality contests all over TV grids, including Bravo's Project Runway, the Food Network's Iron Chef, and NBC's The Apprentice. There's nothing fresh about it, as it pits 12 young competitors against one another to win a job at a restaurant run by celebrity chef Todd English. Nothing distinguishes it from generic for-profit TV fare, as the wannabes nervously perform tasks for judges English, Blue Ginger chef Ming Tsai, and author Michael Ruhlman. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"156087"	"it"	"shouldn't"	" Does that take the wind out of your black-and-gold sails? Well, it shouldn't, at least not completely. Because rest assured that O'Connell has his A list of targets in hand, and it holds some interesting names (perhaps Adam Foote and Peter Forsberg among them). If he also has the gut feeling that Messrs. Thornton, Samsonov, and Gonchar aren't to be had for the long term - or, in Gonchar's case, not to be had at all-then he'll have no choice but to be more aggressive and less controlled. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
