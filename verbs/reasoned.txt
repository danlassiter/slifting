"19397"	"they"	"reasoned"	" The men who uncovered all this evidence at various archeological sites interpreted it in keeping with their own beliefs. If the Judeo-Christian model is patriarchal with men at the top, they reasoned, any earlier matriarchy must have subordinated men. But according to Riane Eisler, author of ``The Chalice and The Blade,'' the archeological story, drawn from excavated wall paintings, reliefs, stone sculpture and other religious objects, does not support claims of female domination. Though women today are still fighting for equal standing in the clergy after more than 5,000 years of the Judeo-Christian tradition, the evidence suggests there were both priests and priestesses in goddess-centered societies. Though the God at the head of the Christian family and his Son are divine, Mary, the sole female family member, is mortal. In contrast, the entire family of the Goddess -- mother, father, sons and daughters -- were gods. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"

GOP-CONVENTION  SAN DIEGO _ After all the hype and hoopla of the pre-convention activities, the curtain rises on the Republican National Convention, bringing yet more hype and hoopla. By RON HUTCHESON. Story will move in ``p'' political category.  GOP-PLATFORM  SAN DIEGO _ Final action is scheduled Monday on the Republican Party's controversial, conservative platform. By MAX B. BAKER and JOHN MORITZ. Story will move in ``p'' political category.  LUCRATIVE TEMPING  FORT WORTH, Texas _ Joe Mott expects to lose his job in a couple of months, and he couldn't be happier. Not that Mott, a systems engineer, doesn't appreciate working for EFW, an electronics and aviation company in Fort Worth. He just prefers to not stay around too long. Mott is part of a growing group of elite workers _ highly skilled, highly mobile and highly paid _ who don't labor as corporate employees. Instead, they're private contractors, joining companies for limited projects that can last from a few months to a few years. By MITCHELL SCHNURMAN. Story will move in ``f'' financial category.  VIRTUAL GIFTS  FORT WORTH, Texas _ If you wake up tomorrow and there's a venomous lionfish in your mailbox, you may have two guys in Philadelphia to thank. The operators of the Cyber Loft Internet cafe have found a way to send ``virtual gifts'' _ everything from exotic marine animals to lipstick to flowers _ for free, trucked along the information superhighway. The presents are fake, of course, little more than a bunch of pretty pixels on a computer screen along with a personalized message. By LESLIE GORNSTEIN. Story will move in ``l'' lifestyle category.  GRAMM-SON  UNDATED _ So you want to be a rock 'n' roll star? Get an electric guitar, and learn to play, and have an indulgent father. Jeff Gramm, 21, has all three, even though he doesn't necessarily like to play up that his father is Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. By MARIA RECIO. Story has moved in ``l'' lifestyle category.  CLANCY-NEW BOOK  UNDATED _ For months, Tom Clancy fans have been awaiting Aug. 13 in the same fever of anticipation small children sweat out the days until Christmas. It's been 25 long months since the cliffhanger ending of Clancy's last tome, ``Debt of Honor,'' but ``Executive Orders'' (Putnam, $27.95) finally hits bookshelves on Tuesday. By JEFF GUINN. Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment category.  FILM-KANSAS CITY  UNDATED _ Clocking in at a brisk 110 minutes, ``Kansas City'' is the briefest of Robert Altman's recent films. It is also the most substantial and efficient, steering clear of the digressions and studied eccentricities of ``Pret-a-Porter'' (132 minutes; 1994) and ``Short Cuts'' (189 minutes; 1993) to cut directly to a desperate encounter between the haves and the have-nots of Depression-era Kansas City. By MICHAEL H. PRICE. Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment category.  FILM-TIN CUP  UNDATED _ The more Kevin Costner believes in the material, the better he will respond to it with a convincing performance. Costner seems to identify with the discredited underdog fighting for a chance at survival, and as a consequence we find his best work in such films as ``Bull Durham'' (1988), ``JFK'' (1991), ``A Perfect World'' (1993) _ and now, ``Tin Cup.'' By MICHAEL H. PRICE. Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment category.  FILM-ALASKA  UNDATED _ Robust and fulfilling ``family entertainment,'' Fraser C. Heston's ``Alaska'' works as both high adventure for the general trade and satisfying fare for the younger audience. By MICHAEL H. PRICE. Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment category.  FILM-HOUSE ARREST  UNDATED _ Jamie Lee Curtis, Jennifer Tilly, Kevin Pollak, Christopher McDonald and Wallace Shawn are altogether too fine a bunch of players to be wasting their artistry on some cutesy dysfunctional-family situation comedy. This concept in search of a story is called ``House Arrest.'' By MICHAEL H. PRICE. Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment category. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960812.0484 type=story > <HEADLINE> CHOICE OF KEMP MAY BOOST MARKETS, WALL STREETER SAYS (UPDATE1) </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-GOP-CONVENTION-UPDATE1-BLOOM) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199608.gz"

"72048"	"they"	"reasoned"	" Yet, that very question became a prevalent one in the weeks leading up to last October's Million Man March in Washington, D.C. Many black gay men supported the march as an important show of unity and solidarity among black men. But they were also deeply conflicted about the march's organizer, Louis Farrakhan, the controversial leader of the Nation of Islam who has made derogatory remarks about gays as well as Jews. Participating in the march, they reasoned, could be construed as an endorsement of Farrakhan and his inflammatory statements. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"

"84664"	"he"	"reasoned"	" Quantum electrodynamics became a respectable theory in the 1920s, and since then it has been rigorously tested by many experiments and found to be perfectly sound. But the Casimir Effect had not been directly measured. The effect is named for Hendrick B.G. Casimir, the Dutch physicist who predicted it in 1948. Based on calculations derived from quantum electrodynamics, he concluded that if two parallel metal plates were held very close together, a force generated by vacuum quantum effects alone would push the plates together. If the two plates are so close that their separation is less than the longer wavelengths of fleeting particles in the quantum foam, he reasoned, the longer wavelengths would be excluded from the space between the plates. The vacuum outside the plates, however, would contain its normal full complement of all wavelengths of virtual particles, which would then exert a force tending to push the plates together. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

Which was no more than I'd sought and found in hundreds of trips I'd taken for newspapers over the years to strange parts of America and the world. Everywhere I went, I tried to taste local cuisine, something they whipped up only in Mobile or Moscow, Huntington, Hong Kong or Havana. Ireland, I reasoned, would be especially easy since even in far-away Boston there are seven restaurants listed as ``Irish'' in the Yellow Pages, and lots more like South Boston's Amrhein's that feature corned beef and cabbage, pot roast and other dishes I assumed were traditional Irish. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"

He and Gotzsche began looking for well-conducted studies that divided patients into three groups, giving one a real medical treatment, one a placebo and one nothing at all.

"135202"	"I"	"reasoned"	" Did I learn from this? No-o-o-o. In Cuba recently, I bought a bottle of 7-year-old dark Havana Club rum at a distillery on the first day of the trip and carried it all over the country for a week. (This visit, by the way, was totally on the up and up. I'll tell the full story in a few weeks.) For the plane ride home I wrapped the bottle in several T-shirts and placed it in the center of my carry-on luggage, where it would be buffered, I reasoned, from any sharp jolts. I had to spend the night at an airport hotel in Los Angeles, and in the morning, when the shuttle driver let me off at the curb, he tossed my bag onto the sidewalk from a height of 3 feet. At first, everything seemed OK. But minutes later, as I was going through security, I was hit by the sharp, overpowering reek of alcohol. A big wet spot had formed on the side of the bag and a puddle was forming on the X-ray machine conveyor belt. Curiously, the security people said nothing. And fortunately, the Montecristo cigars I'd brought home were in sealed metal tubes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"139402"	"he"	"reasoned"	" Cheney didn't seem to realize he had chosen the very word that had helped spur the congressional smut crackdown in the first place -- the one Bono had used at the Golden Globes last year. Has the vice president no sense of indecency? Had C-SPAN only caught his transgression on camera, we might have seen Brian Lamb placed under house arrest and fined on the spot. Later Cheney said he felt better after I had done it, and of all commentators, only Jon Stewart had a theory as to why. The vice president's demand that Leahy commit an act of auto-eroticism, he reasoned, may be a signal that the Republicans are belatedly endorsing the gay-friendly ethos of the Clinton administration. I think it's them opening up their hearts to a different lifestyle, Stewart said to Larry King. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"140054"	"he"	"reasoned"	" Hamilton revealed his little secret Saturday, but he most certainly didn't mind doing it again, now that he's The Open champion and all. Simply put, the entire idea was to stay away from Troon's notorious pot bunkers, if at all possible. You're not going to score, he reasoned, if you're hitting out sideways or backward all the time. He tried to hit either way over them or way behind them -- it didn't matter. The only thing was to make sure he wasn't in them. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"

"140853"	"he"	"reasoned"	" DJ-SCHOOL (New York) -- A DJ is someone who controls the music, so you're all already DJs. That's what Rob Principe, president and chief executive of Scratch DJ Academy in Greenwich Village, told the class on the first day. Anyone who had spent time fiddling with an iPod or stuffing CDs into a stereo, he reasoned, had already grasped the basic concepts. Now all that remained was to follow the technological trail backward, from iPods and CDs to turntables and vinyl records. The class was an intensive one-week program called DJ 101, and the instructor, an enthusiastic and -- more important -- patient turntablist named DJ Damage, started at the very beginning. The Times' Kelefa Sanneh takes the introduction to scratching course. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"

"143362"	"they"	"reasoned"	" They thanked her and moved on. It is not worth their time, they reasoned, to convert people. The object is to register people to vote and to get Kerry supporters to join the ranks of volunteers to canvass other voters, work the phone banks and decorate signs for events like the big squeeze, in which volunteers swarmed upon drivers during the afternoon rush with free orange juice and their views on Bush administration policies that affect the middle class. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"

"144853"	"he"	"reasoned"	" The Chappo displayed Nakamura's determination to create cars that were proudly, unabashedly Japanese but would nonetheless have wide global appeal -- like the best Japanese electronics products.

He instructed the system to allow any customer to withdraw $100 -- but no more than $100 -- a day. Even before the bank was finally hooked into the network, which happened on Sept. 8, 10 days after the hurricane hit, McDonald had upped that limit to $500.

They were both artists with busy professional lives in separate cities: She is a ceramicist and a project director for the department that looks into overseas ventures for the Guggenheim Museum; he paints portraits and is a partner at R&amp;F Handmade Paints, a fine-art paint company in Kingston, N.Y.

"168608"	"they"	"reasoned"	" If anything, the couple thought their house would be a good thing for the city. For years they lived outside of town, on several acres. But, as environmentalists, they disapprove of sprawl. By living closer to the center, they reasoned, they would be less dependent on their car, and they would be building on land near developed property rather than on virgin territory. Eventually, they found a lot they liked. It had been on the market for more than a year, Mills said, in part because it was narrow, treeless and on a major thoroughfare, and people thought a house there would lack privacy. But the couple had seen some work by Jordan, which we loved, Mills said, and they entrusted him to make the best use of the site. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"

But he was above all a pragmatist, and he emphasized the superiority of the negative income tax over conventional welfare programs on purely practical grounds. If the main problem of the poor is that they have too little money, he reasoned, the simplest and cheapest solution is to give them some more.
