"34804"	"they"	"might"	" So far, Miami is exciting a lot of people. It has a defense to complement its high-powered offense, led by quarterback Dan Marino, whom everybody wants to see win a Super Bowl. According to something called the NFL Power Index, three teams have ratings of 100 or better: the Cowboys, the Niners and, yes, the Dolphins. Great.

NATIONAL  HOMELAND -- WASHINGTON -- President Bush on Monday kicked off the biggest government reorganization in more than 50 years, signing legislation creating a Department of Homeland Security. Bush also nominated his top homeland security adviser, Tom Ridge, to be its first leader. (Schatz, Austin American-Statesman)  STATES-ECONOMY -- WASHINGTON -- Americans soon will see higher state university tuitions, fewer grade school teachers, higher taxes and fewer health-care benefits as states cope with a massive budget crisis, the National Governors Association said Monday. ``It's a pretty dire outlook,'' said Raymond Scheppach, executive director of the governors' association. (Geewax, Cox News Service)  BLIND -- WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Yael Laufman, a 26-year-old Hollywood resident and University of Miami medical student, will become the fourth legally blind person in the country to receieve a Jordy2, star-trek like headgear designed by NASA that gives some eyesight impaired people nearly 20/20 vision. Laufman was born with detached retinas and struggles to keep up with her rigorous medical training. (Eisenhauer, The Palm Beach Post)  BOBBY-BROWN -- DECATUR, Ga. -- A metro Atlanta judge has refused to dismiss DUI and other charges against singer Bobby Brown. The charges stem from a 1996 traffic stop. Brown appeared in court Monday with his wife, Whitney Houston. His trial date has been set for Jan. 21. (Gentry, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution)  Moving in (a) National and (e) Entertainment categories.  HORSEVET -- WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Starting today, Dr. Deborah Harris has 400 new patients under her care. As the official National Horse Show veterinarian she is responsible for treating all the sprains and sore muscles that crop up over the next week _ as well as protecting the steeds from West Nile and equine fever. How has she prepared for the challenge? Are there horse paramedics and horse ambulances? Surgeons on call? (Vento, The Palm Beach Post)  INTERNATIONAL  IRAQ-AMUSE -- ATLANTA -- The man known as a leader in Atlanta's Arab-American business community has another title in his native Iraq: King of Amusement. Hisham Araim pioneered amusement parks in the Middle East, and his family members still run several of the parks he helped build in Iraq. In a country that has suffered so much, amusement parks make for a cheap and clean diversion, says Araim, who left Iraq after Saddam Hussein took power. (Basu, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution) W/PHOTO.  OPED/EDITORIAL  TEEPEN-COLUMN -- Conservative talk radio jocks _ and there is hardly any other kind _ insist on having it both ways. They swank around as the sidewalk toughs of politics, but when you call them on it, they retreat into indignation and plead, ``Hey, lighten up. This is just entertainment.'' (Teepen, Cox News Service). MOVED.  SCHULKEN-COLUMN -- GREENVILLE , N.C. -- A battle with a tenacious disease will make this Thanksgiving different from those of other years and puts matter of a meal in perspective. (Mary Schulken is senior associate editor and editorial page editor for The Greenville, N.C., Daily Reflector). MOVED.  SCHUETT-COLUMN -- GIBSONBURG, Ohio -- ``Didja' hear about the guy who called 911 because his wife died?'' As usual, everyone is talking at once, so no one answers Benny right away. He clinks on his coffee cup with a spoon and tries again. ``You want to hear my joke or not?'' Herbie says he does. Nine of us are crowded around the corner table this morning -- Robin is refilling our cups and telling us if we don't hold it down she's going to call the bouncer. We know she's joking because she's grinning. (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED.  EZZARD-COLUMN -- ATLANTA -- The chestnut paneled rooms in the old farmhouse where my husband grew up, in the tiny North Georgia town of Tiger, are alive with Thanksgiving memories. But the giant, gnarled chestnut trees that once grew on Tiger Mountain are dead. Sickened by blight in the early 1900s, the American chestnut had disappeared from the Southern Appalachians by 1950. Weak sapling descendents of the mighty trees still appear, but they are forever stunted and short-lived .......The chestnut's demise is a perfect analogy for Republican environmentalism. In the early 20th century, President Teddy Roosevelt was a conservation giant_ today, President Bush presents a stunted environmental vision. (Ezzard, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution)  LANE-COLUMN -- DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- Distressingly few automotive problems are solved with superglue. Still, I started the project believing I had happened upon a new exception in the dome light assembly's tiny plastic tabs. I have come to the belief that a person's optimism, sense of things being half full -- not half empty -- confidence that ill fortune can be overcome by technology, cunning and stick-to-itiveness are things that can be objectively measured by the variety, number and sophistication of glues and gluelike substances found around his or her kitchen. (Lane, Daytona Beach News-Journal) MOVED.  GARCIA-COLUMN -- AUSTIN, Texas -- Between bites of breakfast, Frank Thompson opened his mouth to commit what would be considered heresy in Texas: ``The Alamo has more cultural, mythic importance rather than historical significance. It wasn't much of a battle, it was more of melee.'' Now that we have your full attention, let me hasten to introduce Thompson fully.

You pushed little plastic pegs into a grid on the front of a box and turned on a light bulb in the back of the box to light up the colored designs. Irwin Toys has come up with a successor, the SpectraColor Image Pad, that lets children make designs of colored light without the removable plastic pegs that tended to get lost.

FAO Schwarz has started offering something called Lingerie Barbie, who wears a ``peekaboo peignoir'' and frilly little undergarments and is marketed to girls 14 and older. Also this month, Mattel is rolling out My Scene Barbie who wears skin-tight T-shirts displaying Barbie's first belly button. Obviously Mattel is trying to appeal to older girls more interested in MTV than dolls, but the toy is bound to raise objections. (Emling, Cox News Service) W/PHOTO.

(DeLuca, Marshall News Messenger.)  CONSUMERQ&amp;A -- AUSTIN, Texas -- Consumer Q&amp;A. (Greig, Austin American-Statesman) (l, a) MOVED.  SCIENCE/MEDICINE  CONTACTS -- ATLANTA -- They may make your brown eyes blue (with apologies to Crystal Gayle), but the FDA is warning the flood of new colored contacts can cause serious eye trouble, if you're not careful. Experts say colored lenses should only be prescribed by a licensed eye doctor, but that message may be lost in the marketing blitz that may make some consumers turn a blind eye to the warnings. (Moore, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution) W/PHOTO.  ENTERTAINMENT/ARTS  TV-OSBOURNES -- The Osbournes, TV's kookiest heavy metal family, is back for a 10-episode run on MTV.

Also includes other tips on preventing damaged hair. (Minor, Waco Tribune-Herald) W/PHOTO.
