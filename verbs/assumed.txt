NEW YORK _  Dear Diary:  Despite all the complaints about the seemingly unending rain in June, there actually were a few enjoyable side effects. Across the street from my house, there was a gush of the most beautiful burgundy roses anyone would ever want to see _ at least 150. Farther up the block were the most exquisite-smelling, stunning-looking bright pink peonies I have seen.  But my favorite find from the deluge came after another rain-filled Sunday. Directly under the awning in front of my building on the sidewalk was a perfectly shaped yellow snail, very much alive and trying, I assumed, to find some dry land. I picked it up, took it to my back yard, put it among some not-too-wet .leaves and hoped for the best.  When I checked on the snail the next day, it seemed to have happily wandered off. A smile crossed my face as I thought that maybe we city folks are not so far removed from nature after all. If it takes a deluge for us to see it, so be it.  _ CAROL MARSH  Dear Diary:  I traveled to Sun Valley, Idaho, on the Fourth of July weekend, arriving at Hailey/Sun Valley airport aboard a puddle jumper from Salt Lake City. As I entered the tiny airport, I saw several dozen people carrying red, white and blue balloons and placards announcing, ``Welcome home, Nick.'' While waiting at the car rental counter, I heard shouts of ``There he is!'' and turned to see a crew cut, 20-something young man stride into the airport, a duffel bag slung over his shoulder.  He was immediately swarmed by friends and family, hugging and handshaking and backslapping him in welcome. At the same time, a beefy man with bagpipes bearing the NYPD logo began playing ``The Marines' Hymn,'' followed by ``America.''  Later, in |4809547367:$7;2942092:421038482977;06772072449'2;,79501127::nmistakable, say into a cell phone: ``You wouldn't believe what I just did. I got off the plane and some people asked me whether I'd play to welcome this Marine who was coming home from Iraq, so I did.'' It was the perfect start to a lovely weekend.  _ LESLIE R. CALDWELL  Dear Diary:  On our recent trip to Italy, my husband, a friend of ours, and I went to lunch at a rged us to sit outside. I was wary because of the very narrow walkway right next to the tables, but he convinced me that there would be few passers-by at that time of day.  We had just been given our menus and were talking with the very urbane proprietor, who spoke perfect English, when a group of street vendors carrying huge duffel bags rushed past us and hid in doorways nearby. In the areas of Venice most frequented by tourists, it is common to see street vendors selling knock-off designer handbags on blankets. The scurrying fugitive vendors rushed up and down the alley several times, playing run-and-hide with the carabinieri who were evidently on one of their cleanup campaigns.  As we discussed the situation, the proprietor, obviously unhappy that our serenity was being disrupted, blurted out, ``What we need in Venice is Mayor Giuliani.''  _ SUSAN BRAMUCCI  Dear Diary:  At the theater recently, the two mid-60-ish men were having a lively discussion about computers. One seemed much more knowledgeable and was instructing the other. The lights dimmed, the conversation stopped, and we saw ``The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci.'' About 85 minutes later, the actors took their bows, and the two men took up their conversation without seeming to miss a beat. The play had just interrupted them.  _ ALISON GOODWIN SCHIFF  Dear Diary:  It was a hot, oppressively humid night, and I thought it would be fun to take my sons, ages 6 and 8, out for Japanese food after their annual checkups.  As soon as we were seated at the Upper West Side restaurant, I could tell this was a misguided adventure in parenting. The tables were shoehorned together, the air-conditioning wasn't working, my younger son quickly managed to spill his pineapple juice all over himself and the table, my older one launched all of our chopsticks onto the floor and the staff, wilted from the heat, was nowhere to be found.  I was phylking of giving up and heading home when my older son pointed to a table nearby and said, ``Look, I think it's the guy from the box of Harry Potter tapes,'' which we'd listened to nonstop the past }288$72222:42607179209:94547392926160712:7:4201:79%46062;4792179222:421775977:082072;4ose photo appears on the packages. ``Go ask him if I'm right,'' my son whispered.  Figuring that the evening was already in a downward spiral, I decided to risk embarrassing myself and went over. I asked if the man was indeed ``the guy from the box of Harry Potter tapes.''  It was _ and Dale graciously said in his mesmerizing voice, ``Let me come meet your boys.''  He left his party and introduced himself to my sons, questioning them about their favorite Potter characters and adventures, and explaining his inspiration for the 130-plus voices he does on the recording of the new ``Order of the Phoenix'' book. (Harry's voice is quite simply ``a young Jim Dale.'')  He returned to his table. Our tempura still hadn't arrived. We were still chopstickless. The table was still sticky with pineapple juice. Sweat beaded on everyone's upper lips. But none of us minded a bit anymore.  _ JANET SIROTO  Dear Diary:  My husband and I were delighted to see ``Nine'' recently at the Eugene O'Neill Theater. Our seats were in the mezzanine, mine on the aisle.  Two women arrived and sat in the seats just behind us. Alas, the aisle seat on their row had a steep step down to reach the floor. The small woman in that seat, whose feet could not touch ground, fidgeted to get comfortable but finally asked if she could place her legs on my armrest to be more comfortable.  I will always remember Antonio Banderas and the women of ``Nine'' and their superb performances as well as the  Dear Diary:  One recent Sunday afternoon, I was walking down Broadway and saw a young boy heading in my direction on a bicycle. He had a helmet on, and his bike had training wheels. As I got closer, I could tell that he was chanting something in a sing-song voice, and I figured it was some sort of children's song or something he had picked up from TV.  Finally I got close enough to hear the chant. It went like this: ``Ladies and gentlemen, this is 96th Street. Transfers available for the 1 and 9 trains.''  _ SHIRA ABILEVITZ </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20030727.0043 type=story > <HEADLINE> ROCK REVIEW: ORGY OF CURLED LIPS AND DROPPED CONSONANTS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> NEW YORK  (BC-ISAAK-PRESLEY-MUSIC-R) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200307.gz"

Four straight finishes of 21st or worse had left him 18th in points and a few more bad finishes from a complete freefall. Positive results were gone.
