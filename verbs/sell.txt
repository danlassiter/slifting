Typically, when there is serious talk of a capital gains tax cut in Washington, some investors will hold onto their stocks until the tax cut becomes a certainty. Then, they sell, paying tax on their gains at the new, lower rate -- and pushing stock prices down in the process. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"

Treasury bonds dropped and the dollar slipped to a four-year low against the British pound. Led by Aluminum Co. of America and Coca-Cola Co., the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 11.55 to 6418.47, paring an early loss of 36.15. The broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index sank 1.23 to 742.72 while the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 6.86 to 1258.08. ``With investors thinking this is as good as things get, you sell,'' said Rob Brown, chief market strategist at Ferris Baker Watts. ``Stocks have risen to reflect 1997 earnings expectations and the low rates.'' U.S. bonds fell for the first time in four days as investors declined to accept the lowest yields in eight months without more evidence of slower growth and inflation. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell about 1/4, or $2.50 per $1,000 bond, driving its yield up 1 basis point to 6.42 percent.

The sale comes 18 months after Bellcore, created as part of the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T Corp. that spawned the Baby Bells, hired Morgan Stanley &AMP; Co. to find a buyer. Bellcore did research for the group, snagging more than 600 patents and creating the software that carries 80 percent of U.S. local phone calls. The Bells are Nynex Corp., Bell Atlantic Corp., BellSouth Corp., Ameritech Corp., SBC Communications Inc., Pacific Telesis and U S West Inc. In April, SBC said it would buy Pactel, and Bell Atlantic said it would buy Nynex. The February overhaul of the nation's telecommunications laws allows the Bells to move into each other's territories, making collaboration a liability. ``With deregulation and competition, the Bells had to get rid of Bellcore,'' said Melodie Reagan, analyst at TeleChoice Inc., Verona, New Jersey-based consultants. Closely held SAIC is weaning itself from government contracts, which provide 83 percent of its business, and looking to profit from the exploding telecommunications arena.

Buys 103 Boeing Jets Valued at $6 Billion By Anthony Effinger and Loren Steffy  Dallas: AMR Corp.'s American Airlines said it will buy 103 aircraft from Boeing Co., part of a plan to replace its entire fleet with the Seattle-based company's planes in the next 20 years. The order is valued at about $6 billion, based on Boeing's list prices. AMR didn't say how much it would pay. Airlines usually pay well below list price because of fierce competition for large orders. The purchase is a major blow for McDonnell Douglas Corp., which for years counted on American Airlines for its struggling commercial aircraft business. It also gives Boeing a coup over its only other competitor in jetliners, Airbus Industrie, the European consortium. ``This is a spectacular win for Boeing. My only concern is how much they had to give away to get it,'' said Wolfgang Demisch, an analyst at BT Securities in New York. Demisch estimated American will pay 20 percent less than list prices.

That amounts to a 10 percent cut in the combined companies' payroll and would comprise 55 percent of the $2 billion in savings expected in the next decade, Baker said in an interview. ``We'd be looking at a 10 percent or 1,200 employee reduction,'' Baker said. Wisconsin Energy and Northern States have a total workforce of about 12,000, he said. Some 30 percent, or $600 million, of the $2 billion in proposed cost cuts would come from combining administrative activities, and the rest should come from less-expensive bulk purchases of fuel and other products, Baker said. Wisconsin Energy and Northern States first agreed to merge in May 1995, creating a Minneapolis-based holding company to be called Primergy Corp. The link-up creates a utility with $10 billion in assets. Clinton Tax Proposal Could Spark Wave Of Merger Activity By Paul Nyhan  Washington: Companies contemplating mergers and acquisitions could accelerate their plans out of concern the Clinton administration and Congress are about to take away a valuable tax break. Abolishing the tax break, which allows public companies to sell portions of their operations tax-free, could provide some revenue the White House and Congress need to pay for a tax cut aimed at middle-income families. W.R. Grace &AMP; Co., U.S. Trust Corp. and Tenneco Inc. are among corporations that previously took advantage of the tax break rules, according to Robert Willens, a tax and accounting analyst at Lehman Brothers. Now, executives of companies like Raytheon Co. that are on the lookout for acquisitions are watching to see if Congress will take the tax tool away. If ``the window is going to close, everyone is going to want to get through,'' said Gilbert Bloom, a tax partner at the accounting firm of KPMG Peat Marwick.

Gore isn't along this week as Clinton tours the Asia-Pacific region -- but he needn't worry. The environment will be a central concern when Clinton sits down with 17 other leaders in Manila this weekend for the yearly Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting. While trade takes center stage, Clinton will urge counterparts to adopt production methods that curb pollution and to coordinate steps to spread clean technologies -- the theme of next year's APEC meeting in Vancouver, Canada. The message has meaning for U.S. companies. White House officials estimate that U.S. environmental technology exports will amount to $600 million a year by 2000. ``The environment right now isn't getting better,'' said Ellis Anderson, executive vice president of a California water purification company. ``It is getting worse. Next year is going to be a big year for environmental companies like ours.''

The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its index of regional manufacturing inched up to 6.4 in November from 5.3 the previous month, meaning business activity barely increased. Meantime, the U.S. Labor Department reported first time jobless claims increased by 17,000 to a seasonally adjusted 344,000 for the week ending Nov. 16 -- the highest level since July 13. That's still a winning combination both for investors and Federal Reserve policymakers, who decided last week to leave the overnight lending rate for banks unchanged. The U.S. is enjoying ``almost a perfect economy,'' Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert McTeer said today in San Antonio, Texas.

Perkins Opportunity Fund (second-best U.S. fund in 1995) now is among the bottom-dwellers, ranked 2,078 of 2,095 ``general'' equity funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. Govett Smaller Companies Fund, last year's No. 4, was 2,085 at the end of last week. Wasatch Mid-Cap Fund, which ranked 13 in 1995, now is 2,074. The three aggressively managed funds share at least one common trait: Their managers make big bets on little-known stocks. ``Last year we had all hits,'' said Karey Barker, lead manager of the $125 million Wasatch Mid-Cap Fund, who works in Salt Lake City. ``This year we've had some misses.''
