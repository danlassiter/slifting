"169197"	"we"	"mountain-biked"	" In the next two days, we mountain-biked, rode the alpine slide, and took the gondola to Moose Mountain for a long hike with some berry-picking attached, all with freaky, gorgeous views of Lake Superior. I chose to sleep in a hammock on the porch in a sleeping bag, and a ferocious storm blew in from Lake Superior. I watched in amazement as it enveloped the porch and then me, forcing me inside.
