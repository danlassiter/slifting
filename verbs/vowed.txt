Barry Jr. always knew he could depend on the city's poor black community for their votes in the Democratic primary for Mayor, his triumph over Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly and five other candidates on Tuesday reflected a surprising and much broader base of support.   In winning with 47 percent of the ballots cast, he attracted a large number of more-affluent blacks, voters that the runners-up, John Ray and Mrs. Kelly, and wooed hard and counted on heavily.   But despite his unexpected wide reach and promises in his victory speech to unify and heal the city after four years of deficits and cutbacks under Mrs. Kelly, Barry's election could well leave the troubled city more polarized than ever, with white voters, many of whom supported him in the past, said they were angry and resentful that he could be mayor again.   WASHINGTON (NYT) Researchers have isolated one gene that causes the inherited form of breast cancer -- and discovered the existence of a second.   Scientists say the breakthrough, to be published in the journal Science next month, will allow them develop a test, probably within two years, to help determine women's risk for inherited breast cancer.   ``This is a very, very exciting time in genetics cancer research and women should take home the fact that there is real progress,'' Dr. Harmon Eyre of the American Cancer Society said Wednesday.   Only about 5 percent of all breast cancer is inherited, but identifying the estimated 600,000 women at risk early could save their lives.   (NYT) -- Fresh off his resounding victory in the Republican primary for governor, New York State Senator George E. Pataki began sharpening his campaign message against Gov. Mario M. Cuomo Wednesday by calling for term limits and other government reforms and by releasing three commercials that call Cuomo ``too liberal for too long.''   The coordinated assault on Cuomo, a three-term Democrat, marked the official opening of a gubernatorial race that is widely expected to be the most contentious in 12 years.   Cuomo, who also coasted to victory in Tuesday's Democratic primary, used the day to campaign in Buffalo while his surrogates attacked Pataki for opposing crime and health care initiatives that would have helped New York City.   In releasing his five-point ``agenda for change'' on a day of intensified media attemtion to the race, Pataki seemed intent on quickly putting Cuomo on the defensive while also innoculating himself from criticisms that he has dithered in defining his platform.   (NYT) -- Baseball's labor mess is a case study in dreadful marketing. The 34-day-old players' strike, compounded Wednesday by the cancellation of the remainder of the season, has transformed a month-long blunder into a disaster.   ``I'd give it Hall of Fame status for bad decisions,'' said Jack Trout, a marketing strategist with the Trout &AMP; Ries firm in Greenwich. ``It's a classic. Up there with New Coke and Edsel.''   The losses transcend the owners' losing revenues of about $442 million for a season that will end 52 days and 669 games early, or players losing $229 million in salaries. Or the revenues and pay from playoff and World Series play.   It goes beyond the 30 layoffs of Mets' ticket and clubhouse staff, (and similar layoffs by the Yankees) and early joblessness for thousands of ushers, ticket takers, security workers and vendors at both Shea and Yankee Stadiums.   ``The strike creates a real feeling of helplessness,'' said Leigh Steinberg, a player agent.   The impact will be felt in the tarnished image of major league baseball, which will lose further ground to more stable, better marketed sports such as football, basketball and hockey.   (NYT) -- To fans who had already suffered and smoldered their way through five weeks without baseball, Wednesday's formal cancellation of the 1994 season was a distinctly non event, merely confirming what had become all too obvious.   As many of them made clear, well before the official announcement, embittered fans had already cancelled baseball, some, they vowed, forever.   ``This is an obituary that doesn't deserve to be on the first page,'' said Neal Kendall, a long-time Yankee fan who works in Chicago as a producer of the syndicated Jenny Jones talk show.   ``Especially since the start of the National Football League season,'' he added. ``The first day of the NFL was the last day of concern for the strike.''   Like other Yankee fans, Kendall expressed particular distress that the strike had come in the midst of the team's best season in years.   ``It was the most excited I've been about baseball since the late '70s and early 80s,'' he said. ``It's sad, but as far as I'm concerned it's onto other things.''   WASHINGTON (NYT) -- After months of having failed to make his case, President Clinton has left himself with little time to persuade Americans and Congress that the cost of restoring democracy to Haiti is worth the costs of a military invasion.   In fact, White House officials acknowledge, time is so short that the case Clinton will make will be aimed less at persuading the public of the necessity of the action than of heading off an ugly clash with Congress that has become the culmination of months of flawed public diplomacy.   With a small-group interview Tuesday afternoon and an address to the nation that is scheduled for Thursday night, Clinton is trying harder than ever before. Wednesday, in a preview of his prime-time address, he described Haiti as a watershed whose slide back to dicatorship would bode ill for the entire Western hemisphere, and as a killing field where the United States has a moral obligation to halt human rights abuses.   Having threatened since May to launch an invasion unless Haiti's coup leaders stepped down on their own, Clinton declared that the crediblity not just of the administration but of the United States would be at stake unless he made good on his word.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19940914.0224 type=story > <HEADLINE> CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS DEEPLY DIVIDED OVER HAITIAN INVASION </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WASHINGTON  (BC-HAITI-CBC-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199409.gz"

TOP  Lede story: 1-col. hed, with 4-col. photo  BRITAIN-TERROR (London) -- The police in London and Rome arrested four suspects on Friday in an effort to round up the men involved in the unsuccessful effort to set off bombs on subway trains and a bus in London on July 21. In west London, police officers in body armor, some wearing gas masks and dark ski masks and some toting automatic rifles, stormed two apartment houses, arresting three men. Shortly afterward in Rome, Italy's interior minister said the Italian police had arrested a Somali-born man with British citizenship, identified as Osman Hussain. A statement from the minister, Giuseppe Pisanu, said the man was the fourth attacker of July 21 in London, suggesting that all four known suspects from the failed attacks, identified in closed-circuit television images, had been seized.

Off-lede:  CONGRESS (Washington) -- The Senate was expected on Friday to approve an industry-backed measure that would shield gun manufacturers from liability lawsuits, as Congress broke for a monthlong recess with a rush of legislation led by energy and highway bills sent to President Bush after years of impasse. Long sought by the gun lobby, the Senate measure would prohibit lawsuits against gun manufacturers for misuse of their product during the commission of a crime. By Carl Hulse.  PROPERTY-RIGHTS (Santa Cruz, Calif.) -- Barely a month after the Supreme Court ruled that governments could take one person's private property and give it to another in the name of public interest, the decision has set off a storm of legislative action and protest, as states have moved to protect homes and businesses from the expanded reach of eminent domain. In California and Texas, legislators have proposed constitutional amendments, while about a dozen other states and some cities are floating similar changes designed to rein in the power to take property. But at the same time, the ruling has emboldened some cities to proceed with development plans on private land. Here in Santa Cruz, for example, officials started legal action this month to seize a parcel of family-owned land that holds a Zagat-rated restaurant, two other businesses and a conspicuous hole in the ground so it could give it to a developer who plans to build 54 condominiums. Far from clarifying government's ability to take private property, the 5-4 court decision has set up a summer of scrutiny over a power that has been regularly used but little-discussed for decades.

LATAM-CORRUPTION (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) -- As he campaigned for the presidency in 2002, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva boldly pledged to clean up the sordid politics of this country. His, he vowed, would be an ethical, honest and moral government the likes of which Brazil had never seen. That pledge helped him win the votes of more than 50 million Brazilians and a sweeping mandate. But now, in a gloomy echo of what has happened time and again across Latin America, da Silva's government is mired in the biggest, most audacious corruption scandal in his country's history. Brazil's unseemly scandal is just the latest reminder of the unremitting corruption that has marked Latin American politics since colonial times, when absolute rulers regarded newly conquered realms in the New World as their personal property. The important difference today is that popularly elected governments now hold sway, and corruption has emerged as one of the gravest threats to the hard-won democratic gains of the last 20 years.

MURDOCH (Undated) -- One of the business world's most-watched family dynasty succession sagas took a sudden twist Friday when Lachlan Murdoch, son of News Corp. chairman and chief executive Rupert Murdoch, resigned from the company after an apparent family rift. The decision by Lachlan Murdoch, 33, to step down, means just one of Rupert Murdoch's children is a clear front-runner to potentially succeed him: James Murdoch, who runs British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite service 34 percent owned by News Corp. and where Rupert, 74, is the chairman. Rupert has made clear that he would like to be succeeded by one of his children. By Richard Siklos.  With a graphic.

Astronomers are announcing that they have found a lump of rock and ice that is larger than Pluto and the farthest known object in the solar system. The discovery is likely to rekindle debate over the definition of planet and whether Pluto should still be regarded as one. The new object, as yet unnamed, is currently 9 billion miles away from the sun, or more than twice as far away as Pluto. But its 500-year orbit also takes it as close as 3.3 billion miles. Pluto's distance from the Sun ranges from 2.7 billion to 4.6 billion miles. By Dennis Overbye and Kenneth Chang.  (Scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in a news file.)  Photo refer:  STEM-CELL (Washington) -- Conservative Republicans, irate that Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist has broken with President Bush on the volatile issue of human embryonic stem cell research, lashed out at Frist on Friday, warning that his support for the work could cost him the Republican nomination for the presidency, should he seek it in 2008. While Frist took his colleagues by surprise in announcing that he would support a bill to expand federal financing for the research, backers of the measure showered him with praise. Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., the chief Senate sponsor of the bill, likened Frist's shift to an earthquake. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.  IRAQ (Mosul, Iraq) -- A suicide bomber wearing a vest laden with explosives blew himself up outside an army recruitment center in a remote northern village on the Syrian border on Friday, an official with the Iraqi Interior Ministry said. The official said the attack killed 26 people and wounded at least 30, though American military officials put the casualties figures far lower, with 10 dead and 21 wounded. By James Glanz.

ECON-REPORT (Undated) -- Businesses and households went on a shopping spree this spring, causing warehouse stockpiles to shrink and setting the stage for faster economic growth during the rest of the year. The spending helped extend a solid if unspectacular expansion in the second quarter, when the economy grew at an annual rate of 3.4 percent, down from 3.8 percent in the first quarter, the Commerce Department reported. Companies took advantage of the weaker dollar to ship more goods abroad, while imports reversed course and fell slightly. It was the first time since 1991 that exports rose and imports dropped in the same quarter. By David Leonhardt.  (Scheduled to move by 7:30 p.m. ET in f news file.)  NOCERA-COLUMN (Undated) -- In case you missed it, Andrew S. Grove has an article in this week's issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. In his 68 years, Grove has written six books, including a management classic, Only the Paranoid Survive. But it's not every day that he makes an appearance in an eminent medical journal like JAMA. The article, Efficiency in the Health Care Industries, was labeled commentary, but it was more akin to a jeremiad. Grove took dead aim at the lack of efficiency in health care. By Joseph Nocera.

NY-BAG-SEARCHES (New York) -- In the past eight days, the New York Police Department has randomly searched through the bags of several thousand commuters in more than 400 subway stations. About 20,000 other travelers have been subject to inspections of their belongings in bus terminals and commuter train stations in and around the city. The fallout from the first full week of this unprecedented, systematic search of New Yorkers: One arrest for possession of illegal fireworks, zero legal challenges and, according to the police and transit officials, minimal resistance.

His, he vowed, would be an ethical, honest and moral government the likes of which Brazil had never seen. That pledge helped him win the votes of more than 50 million Brazilians and a sweeping mandate. But now, in a gloomy echo of what has happened time and again across Latin America, da Silva's government is mired in the biggest, most audacious corruption scandal in his country's history. Brazil's unseemly scandal is just the latest reminder of the unremitting corruption that has marked Latin American politics since colonial times, when absolute rulers regarded newly conquered realms in the New World as their personal property. The important difference today is that popularly elected governments now hold sway, and corruption has emerged as one of the gravest threats to thehard-won democratic gains of the last 20 years.  NATIONAL (a code)  PROPERTY-RIGHTS (Santa Cruz, Calif.) -- Barely a month after the Supreme Court ruled that governments could take one person's private property and give it to another in the name of public interest, the decision has set off a storm of legislative action and protest, as states have moved to protect homes and businesses from the expanded reach of eminent domain. In California and Texas, legislators have proposed constitutional amendments, while about a dozen other states and some cities are floating similar changes designed to rein in the power to take property. But at the same time, the ruling has emboldened some cities to proceed with development plans on private land. Here in Santa Cruz, for example, officials started legal action this month to seize a parcel of family-owned land that holds a Zagat-rated restaurant, two other businesses and a conspicuous hole in the ground so it could give it to a developer who plans to build 54 condominiums. Far from clarifying government's ability to take private property, the 5-4 court decision has set up a summer of scrutiny over a power that has been regularly used but little-discussed for decades. By Timothy Egan.  WASHING-MT-RUSHMORE (Mount Rushmore National Monument) -- No soap, no chemicals, no whitener or bleach. The faces carved in granite 64 years ago got a fittingly old-school treatment for their first ever washing this month: plain old hot water blasted from a hose. The cleanup project began July 5 and is expected to last until early August. President Abraham Lincoln is completed, and George Washington and Thomas Jefferson are close. Cleaning began last on Theodore Roosevelt, the baby of the bunch. Members from a crew of 15 workers rappel down the faces at 6 a.m. every weekday, working until shortly past noon, when the heat and wind pick up. By Michael Wilson.  NY-BAG-SEARCHES (New York) -- In the past eight days, the New York Police Department has randomly searched through the bags of several thousand commuters in more than 400 subway stations.

Roberts papers from the Reagan library. By David M. Broder and Carolyn Marshall.  FINANCIAL  (Coded f)  LABOR-REVIVE (Chicago) -- Even as he was leading the revolt this week that has divided the labor movement into warring camps, Andrew Stern's union, the Service Employees International Union, kicked off an effort to unionize 8,000 janitors in Houston, focusing on a state that is particularly hostile to labor. In one of the most ambitious organizing drives in the South, the service employees have set their sights initially on the Houston operations of ABM, the nation's largest cleaning contractor. If the service employees can unionize the biggest cleaning company in the city, Stern argues, other companies will quickly follow. For all their ferocious infighting, labor's chieftains agree on one thing: The new economy still offers plenty of opportunities for old-fashioned organizing. By Stephen Greenhouse.  NOCERA-COLUMN (Undated) -- Andrew S. Grove, the former chairman of Intel, has an article in this week's issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. Labeled commentary, it was more akin to a jeremiad, where he took dead aim at the lack of efficiency in health care and the extent to which medicine lags behind other industries in using technology to store and retrieve data, to the detriment of doctors and patients. By Joseph Nocera.  AIRLINES-MARKETPLACE -- With planes full and ticket prices rising, the nation's airlines had been counting on this summer to lift them out of five years of doldrums. Instead, the industry is again awash in bad news potentially including another series of bankruptcies, labor strife and service reductions. By Micheline Maynard and Roben Farzad.  MARKETS (New York) -- Despite falling on Friday, two of the three main stock gauges rose for the fifth consecutive week. But the Dow Jones industrial average wound up down slightly for the week, ending a four-week run. And the overall stock rally over the last five weeks appears a little sluggish in light of surprisingly positive economic reports recently and double-digit profits growth for the second quarter. By Jonathan Fuerbringer.  CONGRESS-CAR-SAFETY (Detroit) -- A look at the safety provisions of the new transportation bill, including the first mandate for a minimum rollover performance standard, a requirement for the first upgrade to roof strength in 30 years and a requirement that crash test ratings be placed on window stickers. By Danny Hakim.  CONGRESS-HYBRID-CARS (Detroit) -- The new energy bill has a complex tax credit provision so that each automaker can only offer consumer credits on the first 60,000 hybrids they sell, then the amount of the credit starts to decrease over several months.

WENDYS (Undated) -- Wendy's International plans to sell part of its Tim Hortons doughnut-store business in an initial public offering and close or sell about 450 Wendy's restaurants. The company's shares surged 12 percent. Wendy's will offer as much as 18 percent of Tim Hortons in a sale that could raise up to $828 million. By Ian Austen.  RETIRING-ABROAD (Undated) -- These days, some Americans heading for retirement are as concerned with pesos as pensions, and foreign language classes as Medicare. They are part of an emerging population expecting to spend their retirement abroad. In January, baby boomers will start hitting 60 at a rate of more than four million a year. More mobile, active and adventuresome than prior generations, these 78 million Americans are rethinking retirement. Many will be lured overseas by a more affordable cost of living and temperate weather. Some will want to return to their native countries or to places where they once worked or studied.

By David Picker.  HS-QB-CAMP (Aliso Viejo, Calif.) -- Cody Hawkins arrived from Boise wearing Converse sneakers and a rainbow-colored polo shirt he bought for $3 at Goodwill. These problems were quickly addressed. As soon as he set foot on campus here Monday, Hawkins, along with eleven other top high school quarterbacks, was handed more appropriate gear: an oversized black Nike duffle bag with pairs of Nike running shoes and cleats, and a Nike football, the only brand of football he'd be allowed to spin for the next four days. Nike is an official sponsor of the EA SPORTS ELITE 11 quarterback campetition. Wicked Orange flavored Cytomax is the camps official sport drink . The Elite 11 is a gathering of the top 11 high school quarterbacks in America. It was a chance for the younger players to ask about campus life, about the pressures of playing at the college level. And, undeniably, to get acclimated to the business side of major college sports. By Robert Andrew Powell.  COLUMNS  (Coded k)  An Op-Ed column by John Tierney.
