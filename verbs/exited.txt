"168140"	"he"	"exited"	" It was an MCL strain -- Reyna had knocked knees with Draman -- and although he returned to the field a few minutes later, he wasn't the same. In the 40th minute, he exited, with Ben Olsen taking his place. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"174058"	"we"	"exited"	" En masse, we exited, and entered the School for Spies, the museum's permanent collection -- its entrance adorned, aptly, with a large black-and-white photo of Maxwell Smart talking on a shoe phone. The exhibits, in a labyrinth of well-conceived displays, are varied, interactive and exhaustive. Poster-size photographs allow you to test yourself by identifying suspicious activity, spy signals, dead drops and surveillance systems. Training films cover locks and picks, types of bugs and listening posts. Computerized exercises on imagery analysis make what some former colleagues have described to me as mind-numbing work seem fascinating. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
