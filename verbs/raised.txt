ECON-REPORT (Washington) _ The November jobs report is weaker than expected _ which, given Greenspan's speech Thursday night, in which he may (or may not) have indicated he thinks the stock market is overvalued _ undoubtedly has kept share prices from falling more than they have. Payrolls grew by 118,000 jobs during November, below expectations of a gain of about 175,000 jobs. But October's increase was revised upward to 224,000 jobs from the 210,000 jobs reported intitially. Two other economic reports are out today: Factory orders rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in October; data for consumer-credit growth in October will be released this afternoon. By Robert D. Hershey Jr.  ECON-GREENSPAN-ASSESS (Washington) _ What is Greenspan up to? The markets would love to know. In his speech last night, he raised, but did not answer, the question of whether stocks were too high. The mere act of his raising the question was taken by the markets as an indication that he thought they were. He is scheduled to deliver another address this afternoon.  ECON-MARKETS (New York) _ Like the rest of the world's markets, Wall Street is shaken by Greenspan's comments, but the weaker-than-expected jobs data keep things from being worse. At noon, the industrial average _ off more than 140 points earlier in the day _ was down 64 points, or 1 percent. The long bond was off 2/32 point, with the yield at 6.51 percent. The dollar stood at 112.83 yen, up from 112.46 yen in late New York trading yesterday, and at 1.5464 marks, down from 1.5516 marks. Earlier, stocks fell 3.2 percent in Tokyo, 2.9 percent in Hong Kong and 2.9 percent in Australia. In Europe, shares fell 4.1 percent in Frankfurt floor trading. London shares are off 2.5 percent.
