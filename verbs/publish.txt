"160699"	"they"	"publish"	" The European group's election-monitoring arm, known as the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, or ODIHR, sends long-term and short-term observer teams to countries holding elections. The teams analyze each campaign period and election day, including voter and candidate registration, safeguards against multiple voting, ballot counting, use of state resources, media coverage, police conduct and more. As they work, they publish, producing assessments that have become prominent report cards of the balloting. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
