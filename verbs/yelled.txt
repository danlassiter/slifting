(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) By JUDI DASH c.1995 Family Circle magazine (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Good news for the family that plays together: Travel has never been easier _ nor a better buy. The entire industry has jumped on the bandwagon, offering special rates and amenities only for families.  The further ahead you can start planning, the more options you'll have for savings. Look for ads in newspaper travel sections and/or consult a travel agent to find out where and when the best deals can be found.  Parents of young children should opt for off-peak travel to save money and hassles. Even those with school-age kids might consider letting them miss a few days of classes for a special trip.  Join the American Automobile Association. Membership entitles you to commission-free traveler's checks, free maps and route-planning assistance. It also gets you discounts on car rentals and hotel rates. With an AAA credit card you can charge traveler's checks up to your credit limit, and owe no interest if you pay your bill in full when it's due.  Join as many airline frequent-flier clubs as you can. You don't have to fly a lot to become a member, and there's no charge to belong. Members are often sent coupons for deals on air travel as well as discounts on hotels, car-rental companies and sometimes even cruises.  You needn't even fly to earn mileage. Most major credit cards offer mileage tie-ins with airlines, long-distance phone services, hotel chains and car-rental agencies.  Consider getting an Entertainment Book for your destination _ books are currently available for about 125 cities. These books often contain coupons for airline tickets, hotels, theme-park entrance fees and a slew of other family activities. Order in advance at (800) 374-4464.  Contact local and state tourist boards at your destination _ they may offer free or low-cost discount coupon books to area attractions. They also may know of special family deals in lodgings, food and entertainment. Also check the local papers. -0- AFFORDABLE AIRFARES  + Comparison-shop for airfares, since many destinations are served by competing airlines. Be on the lookout for free or discounted companion tickets.  Beware how you book companion fares, however: Often the paying passenger must be over 18, so a family of four will want to pair one adult with each child instead of the adults together and kids together.  + On most airlines, children age 2 or younger fly free if they sit on your lap. If there's an empty seat, there's no charge for buckling junior into it. Try to book flights at midweek and midday, when empty seats are more plentiful.  + Many airlines offer package deals. Among those to consider are TWA Getaway Vacations, United Vacations and USAir Vacations.  + If no one is picking you up at the airport, check ahead about alternatives to using a taxi _ buses, vans, subway connections. When flying into an area with more than one airport, opt for the one with the lowest-priced transportation to your hotel, assuming the airline price is competitive.  + Charter flights can be cheaper than regularly scheduled flights. But they can be delayed and may involve convoluted connections. -0- CAR SAVINGS SMARTS  + When renting a car, check to see if your credit card covers the collision-damage waiver _ it can save you an extra $8 or more a day.  + If you'll need a child seat for a rental car, reserve one ahead of time. Make sure the brand is of a quality level you respect, or consider taking your own along. If flying, check the car seat through as luggage, packed in a duffel bag surrounded by clothing, or use it on the plane for your ticketed child _ but check with the airline first. You'll save about $5 a day on the car-seat rental.  + Take picnic food for eating in the car or at parks along the way. Rest-stop restaurants can often be high-priced. -0- TRACKING TRAIN DEALS  + Traveling by train through the night can save you time and money. On Amtrak, kids ages 2 to 15 pay half the adult rate as long as there's one adult per child.  + Good timing of a train trip can save you plenty. Amtrak usually has weekend specials, particularly on routes dominated by business travelers on weekdays.  + Round-trip rates often are less than one-way, and if you're traveling cross-country, think about buying an excursion fare that gives you unlimited travel within a certain zone, with a specified number of stopovers.  + The cheapest way to travel overnight is to sleep in your seats, but on long-distance trips consider renting a family cabin, which sleeps four. Dinner and breakfast are included. Call (800) USA-RAIL. -0- LODGING LOGISTICS  + All-suite hotels and motels can be a great boon, with a room for Mom and Dad and a sofa bed in the living-room area. Many have kitchenettes or provide breakfast and offer free parking. Renting a fully equipped condominium is also an enticing option for families.  + Think about getting two rooms, preferably adjoining. You can save 25 to 40 percent by booking one room for each adult with an accompanying child, since each adult may be charged a single rate and kids often stay free or at a discount when staying with an adult. You can always pair up again after you've checked in.  + Weekend rates are available at most chains, and many define the weekend as Thursday through Monday. At some places you get a free third night with two weekend nights booked.  + All-inclusive resorts such as Club Med's Family Villages help you keep to your budget, with most food, services and activities included in the price. During selected weeks, one child age 2 to 5 stays free for each paying adult at certain Club Med Villages. Some have special Baby Clubs, with free child care for children age 4 months to 23 months.  + Off-season, ski resorts can be a great bargain. When the snow melts, rates go down dramatically. Summer boasts lots of outdoor activities, nursery services and kids' day camps.  + Consider renting a family cabin in a state park. These reasonably priced lodgings often have several bedrooms and a fully equipped kitchen. Book way ahead, since demand can be great.  + Another great source of bargain accommodations are college-campus apartments and dorms. The Budget Lodging Guide _ $14.95 from B&AMP;J Publications, P.O. Box 5486, Fullerton, CA 92635 (800) 525-6633 _ is a good resource.  + Be aware of your hotel's room phone rates before you or your kids pick up the receiver _ huge surcharges are added to long-distance calls made from the room, and fees are also charged for local calls and calls made with a calling card. Use a pay phone in the lobby. -0- CRUISE CONTROLS  Cruises are great if you need to know exactly how much your trip will cost: Except for some drinks and optional shore excursions, they're all-inclusive.  + Cruise companies often offer bargain air-cruise tie-ins, but comparison-shop to make sure you're getting a deal, and that the ship has specific programs for children and/or teens.  + Early-booking discounts can save you as much as 50 percent, and some lines offer special airfare deals and credits for purchases made on board. You also can get good rates if you book at the last minute.  + Be clear with your kids about which purchases they can sign for. Soft drinks and snacks can add up on your bill, so give your children firm limits.  + Shore excursions can cost a bundle and are not always worth the price. You may find your family on a bus for hours or shepherded through shops that give the guide a kickback on purchases. You may have more fun exploring on your own. Thoroughly check out the specifics before signing on.  + Buy cancellation insurance. With kids' penchant for sudden sickness, as well as the possibility of missing a plane connection, you'll want this protection.  (Judi Dash is a contributing editor at Family Circle.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) By WILBUR MANN c.1994 Diversion magazine (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Time was when the rules on men's fashion were as rigid as an overstarched collar. They left little if any room for creativity, which was probably a blessing for a lot of men: It was hard to go wrong.  These days there's much more freedom, as even a quick glance at a men's magazine or a morning commuter train will reveal. Freedom means the sartorial landscape is more interesting and fun, but along with freedom comes plenty of room for mistakes.  Here are some of the most common of them, as well as a few guidelines to keep you looking sharp without having to buy a whole new wardrobe. -0- OUT OF SYNC  A look, whatever it is, should be consistent.  If you like to wear ventless suits, you shouldn't be thinking about the traditional button-down-collar-and-rep-tie combination. Long, pointed Italian collars and slinky, silk ties are the right accompaniment.  Conversely, if you're the original preppy, slick Italian accessories will clash with your tweeds and penny loafers. In the end, you'll look like a gigolo trying to crash a staff party at L.L. Bean. -0- TIGHT FIT  There's nothing wrong with a robust figure, until you try to squeeze it into Italian tailoring designed for people who will never need Lean Cuisine.  Dress with your shape in mind. Heavyset men, particularly if they're short, should not wear double-breasted jackets. Thin men should be wary of vertical stripes, lest they be mistaken for No. 2 pencils. -0- A SOLID BORE  We're people, not flags, yet few men venture beyond a solid-color suit (usually blue), a solid-color shirt (usually blue or white) and a solid-color or discreetly patterned tie.  There isn't anything wrong with that, but just because nothing's wrong doesn't mean everything's right.  We owe the world a little more dash, a little more ``joie de vivre.'' So take the outfit above and substitute a flamboyant tie that looks like a Pollock or a Picasso. It's acceptable because the other two solids keep you right in bounds.  Give up the plain shirt for a big Bengal stripe or a tiny gingham check. You're still mainstream, but considerably more sophisticated. -0- PATTERN OVERLOAD  Baby boomers will remember that before cable, fascinating patterns could be created on TV sets by manipulating the horizontal and vertical dials.  This is roughly the same effect that some men _ the opposite of the solid bores _ achieve when they add a striped tie to a striped shirt while wearing a striped suit.  If you have doubts about your ability to pair colors and patterns, start simply and proceed from there.  For example, take a blue tie with small, yellow polka dots. Try matching it with a solid-yellow shirt, provided that the yellow in the shirt matches the yellow in the tie. Even better, try a shirt with alternating narrow yellow and white stripes, perhaps even with a solid-white collar and cuffs.  Now what? A navy-blue suit works, or navy pinstripes. If you must have a handkerchief visible, make sure it's white.  The logic of the preceding is that you haven't worked too many individual colors or patterns into the mix, thereby avoiding ``fashion overload,'' a condition that can keep people from noticing there's a head on top of your clothes. -0- THE ODD COUPLE  Few things look better in the evening or on weekends than a perfectly matched sport jacket and pants.  It's hard to go wrong with a navy blazer, the man's equivalent of a woman's ``little black dress.'' But what about Harris tweed or houndstooth check?  One way to proceed is to pair the latter with solid trousers that pick up the dominant color of the jacket. For example, if the check in the houndstooth is a mahogany brown, find a pair of pants as close to that shade as possible.  Don't trust your memory with something like this, because two almost-the-same colors go together about as well as marinara sauce and ketchup. Wear or take the jacket to the store when looking for the pants. -0- UNSIGHTLY WHITES  Except as the color of your shirt, your summer dinner jacket and your tennis gear, white is a very dangerous choice. Avoid white suits in particular, unless you're sure you have Tom Wolfe's panache.  White shoes that don't have a specific boating or athletic function should be discarded. And in a uniformly well-dressed world, ``white belts'' would be an oxymoron. -0- SHORT SOCKS  Maybe there are worse offenses than sitting down, crossing your legs and exposing six inches to eight inches of hairy calf between the top of your sock and the bottom of your cuff.  Maybe.  But this is the one that has fashion editors lining up to vote for capital punishment. Better you should pair mismatched socks than commit this faux pas.  Either make sure your socks are at least midcalf length, or keep both feet firmly on the floor. -0- WAVERING LENGTHS  When you stand, the back of the pants leg, whether cuffed or not, should rest just at or slightly above the point where the sole of the shoe meets the vamp.  The front of the pants should sit atop the instep with a folding break in the crease, while the hem should rim the contour of the shoe in such a way that when you walk, virtually no sock is exposed.  If your pants are too short, you open yourself to the charge of wearing ``high waters.'' If they are too long, you may end up looking like Charlie Chaplin's tramp. -0- TIED IN KNOTS  All ties are not created equal.  Those sexy Italian ties that everybody on ``Miami Vice'' used to wear, the ones with their tight little filter-tip-size knots, look ridiculous worn with cotton button-downs.  Why? Because those shirts have a so-called tie notch, designed for stiff rep and school ties that knot up much more broadly.  Ties should match the style and spread of your collar. The narrower the notch, the narrower the knot. Should you need to broaden your knot or shorten the overall length of your tie, a Windsor knot which involves taking an extra loop is often the solution. -0- EXCESSIVE ACCESSORIES  Handkerchiefs, like hats, have fallen on hard times. But handled well, they can give a man a certain swagger.  Remember, though, that the louder one's tie, the softer the handkerchief. The two should not be identical. Save the matchmaking for your socks.  When it comes to suspenders and belts, make up your mind: one or the other, not both. -0- DATED DUDS  Periodically, for many complex reasons, the culture takes leave of its senses.  This happened in the 1970s, as the decade's wider-than-wide ties attest. Should you still own any of these, stash them away _ they may eventually become collector's items.  Otherwise, don't be afraid to discard clothing that no longer fits or suits you _ or is long out of fashion. Even if a style makes a comeback, it's usually mutated just enough so that the genuine older clothes won't make you look dapper, only dated.

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Whitney Houston in a scene from ``Waiting to Exhale.'' By CINDY PEARLMAN  Whitney Houston may never have laughed so hard.  Twenty minutes into an interview in Houston's hotel suite with 10 reporters, a 40ish woman asks for some background information. What's the singer's favorite song? Favorite color?  ``Are you married?'' the reporter asks, quite blandly.  Houston can't check a whoop of laughter. ``Yeah, I'm married. Haven't you heard?''  After several months in tabloid hell, Houston needs a good laugh. Her husband, singer Bobby Brown, began the summer with a bar brawl. In the fall, he was involved in a shooting incident. Most recently, Brown entered rehab and the couple separated.  ``I am still married,'' she says in a steely voice, emphasizing every word. ``I am still married.''  Amid the personal trauma, Houston's career is soaring. This December will bring the releases of both her long-awaited greatest-hits album and the film ``Waiting to Exhale,'' based on Terry McMillan's best seller.  The movie is Houston's second, following ``The Bodyguard'' (1993), which earned a blockbusting $400 million. There has been understandable pressure to live up to the expectations created by that smash hit, but early word on the film is positive. Already, its soundtrack _ featuring Houston, naturally _ is topping the pop charts.  Nevertheless, Houston portrays herself as a reluctant movie star.  ``I don't want it all,'' she says. ``I don't want to be a movie star.'' This, despite her upcoming role opposite Denzel Washington in ``The Bishop's Wife.'' Houston has also optioned the rights to ``The Dorothy Dandridge Story.''  ``I swear I tell my agent, `I do not want to be a movie star,''' she insists. ``I got enough problems with this madness. Then my agent will say, `Okay, Whitney, we're just going to go see this one director. Read one script. You might like it.'''  It isn't easy being Whitney Houston. According to her co-star and new best friend Angela Bassett, ``She lives in a fishbowl. On the set of `Exhale,' photographers were paying homeowners near our set $5,000 so they could use their living-room windows to get a picture of Whitney. Yet Whitney doesn't get crazy and paranoid about it.''  ``People won't let me be a regular person,'' Houston says. ``I see this person made up in the media that they try to sell people. So now I go to the park and the other mothers just stare at me. It's like, `Is she really this diva?' People watch me. `What is she gonna do next?' They watch me drink my tea.  ``I go into a restaurant and I think people expect me to do handstands or something. I'm really just a normal, boring person.''  Normal she may be, but ever since 12-year-old Whitney Houston stood up in a Newark, N.J., church with her knees knocking to sing her first song in public _ ``Guide Me O Thou Great Jehovah'' _ she's been anything but boring.  Her track record of hits is amazing, adding up to more than $80 million worth of records sold. Her debut album, ``Whitney Houston,'' sold over 13 million copies, and spawned the single ``Saving All My Love for You,'' which won her a Grammy for Best Pop Female Vocalist. Her second album produced four consecutive number-one singles.  ``The Bodyguard'' soundtrack alone sold more than 27 million copies, so that when Houston's third album sold only 7 million copies, what for most other singers would be a career-maker seemed mildly disappointing for Houston.  Of all her achievements, Houston is proudest of her daughter, Bobbi Cristina Brown.  ``This child is so special to both of us,'' Houston says. ``I can only speak for myself, but I've changed. You start living for your child and you stop living for yourself.  ``I look at her and she moves me. She motivates me. She makes me say, `Ahhh, forget all that stuff.' Bobbi makes me get up and take her to school. It's `C'mon, mom, let's go.' `Okay, I'm coming.'  ``Jesus is the greatest love of all. She's next,'' Houston says.  ``Giving birth was the toughest choice I've ever made,'' she says. ``I got to the labor room and said, `Why? Why did I do this? I must be crazy. This is a person in my body moving.' It was the most incredible thing I've ever done.  ``I was so horrible in the delivery room,'' she says with a giggle. ``I'm screaming, `Wait! I want to change my mind! Excuse me. Give me drugs! Give me all of it!'''  Houston's own childhood was anything but ordinary. She grew up in New Jersey as the daughter of Cissy Houston, who sang lead vocals for a group called Sweet Inspiration and did backup vocals for Aretha Franklin.  ``My mom didn't have enough white fans,'' says Houston, who has plenty. ``She never crossed over. She should have been the big star in the family.''  With a famous mother and an aunt named Dionne Warwick, Houston was an easy mark in town.  ``I had to fight girls all my life who would chase me down the street yelling, `You think you're cute. I'm gonna kick your butt.'  ``I didn't like to fight. I'd always try to talk. I would yell, `You don't want to fight me. Look at me! I'm a nice girl.' Then they would wind up chasing me all the way home with umbrellas.''  One day, Houston recalls, eight umbrella-wielding girls tormented her all the way home.  ``My mother met me at the front door and told me, `Stop running. Turn around. Turn around!'  ``She had a belt in her hand. She yelled to the other girls, `I want the baddest one of you. I want the one who wants her so bad to step out now 'cause she's gonna fight you today and this will be over.'  ``To the other girls, she yelled, `If anyone of you think you can jump in I'm gonna spank you. I'm gonna beat you with my belt like your mother should have.'''  The girls retreated with a timid ``Never mind.''  ``Now I see these same girls when I go back to my old neighborhood,'' Houston says with a smile. ``Those girls tell me, `We love your records.' Mm-hmm. Right, girlfriend.''  Other things may be complicated, but for Houston singing is simple. Sometimes she even amazes herself.  ``Sometimes I will be on stage and I'll hit some note and I stop myself,'' she says. ``Sometimes I just go, `Ohhhh, sing, girl _ right on!'''  Despite her upcoming album of greatest hits, Houston doesn't have an answer when asked about her greatest hit.  ``I don't know, man,'' she says. ``I was having this same discussion with my dear friend Clive Davis, and we were talking about my greatest-hits album. We were going through all my songs and looking at the whole list of things I've done.  ``He said, `Whitney, what do you think is your greatest song?'  ``I said, `I have no idea.'  ``Clive said, `That's good. Don't think you've had your greatest song yet. Don't think you've done your greatest work. Because when you do that's when you stop. That's when the juices stop flowing and the creativity leaves you.'''  To judge from Houston's current output, that isn't likely to happen anytime soon.

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Jon Secada By JOSEPH D. YOUNGER c.1995 Amtrak Express Distributed by New York Times Special Features  The squeals started this summer, from the moment Jon Secada stepped onstage at Broadway's Eugene O'Neill Theatre. The high-pitched ``Eeeeeees'' greeted his first appearance as the ultracool Danny Zuko in the current revival of ``Grease,'' and the crowd's whistles and cheers introduced every one of his songs.  The squeals haven't stopped yet. Although Secada is scheduled to depart the production Dec. 31, his megawatt star power has re-energized the Broadway smash. That's a tall order for a 33-year-old singer who had never before acted professionally, much less starred in a Broadway musical.  ``It's been a blast,'' says Secada, an Afro-Cuban-American singer-songwriter who has been called the most hyphenated man in show business. ``It's been a pleasure and a great opportunity for me so early in my career.''  Secada may be a rookie on Broadway, but he's no stranger to the stage or to screaming fans. Before ``Grease,'' he completed a worldwide concert tour that cemented his international appeal.  ``But this is different,'' Secada says. ``It's one thing when they're screaming as part of the concert experience. In the theater, you have to concentrate on your part as you're doing it and stay focused in the role. You can't break your concentration because of the audience reacting and everything.''  Audiences everywhere just can't seem to get enough of Jon Secada. His eponymous first album sold more than 6 million copies and spawned four hit singles, including ``Just Another Day,'' which spent nearly four months on Billboard's Top 10.  Secada followed with ``Otro Dia Mas Sin Verte,'' his first entirely Spanish album. It wound up as the longest-running album on Billboard's Latin charts and won a Grammy in 1992 for best Latin pop album.  Last year, Secada's ``Heart, Soul &AMP; a Voice'' yielded another hit, ``If You Go.'' And anyone with a radio must have heard his duet with Shanice, ``If I Never Knew You,'' from Walt Disney's ``Pocahontas'' soundtrack. Meanwhile, ``Entre Cuatro Paredes,'' the single from ``Amor,'' his latest all-Spanish album, has been climbing the Latin charts.  Critics have struggled to describe his fusion of musical styles. From the lush romanticism of ``Just Another Day'' to the funkier, more percussive ``If You Go,'' his sound comes across as salsa-flavored soul-pop, with an occasionally heavy dose of rhythm-and-blues.  It's no surprise that this musical melange comes out of Miami, Secada's hometown since age 9. His parents, Jose and Victoria Secada, settled in southern Florida after trying for years to escape Castro's Cuba.  Jose Secada spent three years in a Cuban prison for attempting to smuggle his own father to freedom in the early 1960s. His official application for emigration came at the price of an additional 18-month sentence in one of Castro's work camps.  In 1971, when the Secadas finally made it to the States, they opened a coffee shop in Hialeah, Fla., while young Jon applied himself to learning English, studying in school and soaking up American pop music.  ``Stevie Wonder, Billy Joel and Elton John are the guys I listened to all the time,'' Secada says. ``I loved their music so much. I looked up to them.''  A polite, quiet, studious teenager, Secada didn't unveil his own musical talent until he was a junior in high school.  ``We were in a theater class together, and he came in for auditions,'' says Miguel Morejon, Secada's longtime friend and co-writer. ``He opened his mouth to sing and we all said, `Oh, my God, what a voice!'''  After he graduated in the top 10 of his class, Secada's teachers encouraged him to pursue his studies as a music major at the University of Miami. He later earned a master's degree in jazz vocal performance, and taught voice at Miami-Dade Community College.  The friendships Secada formed in college eventually proved as important as his formal training. Two of his college pals, Jorge Casas and Clay Ostwald, were members of the Miami Sound Machine, the legendary crossover band that brought Latin rhythms to mainstream America in the early 1980s and catapulted lead singer Gloria Estefan to stardom.  ``My friends also produced some of my stuff at first, and they played one of my demo tapes for Emilio,'' Secada says. Emilio Estefan _ Gloria's husband, as well as the group's manager _ liked what he heard and immediately signed the young Miami hopeful.  Secada went to work for the Estefans as a writer and arranger. ``Eventually I got the opportunity to write for and work with Gloria herself,'' he says. ``For me it all started to happen when I worked with her on her first song on `Into the Light.'''  The record _ Estefan's first after a bus accident in which she sustained a serious back injury _ became an emotional and artistic landmark for Estefan and a watershed for Secada's career. ``Coming Out of the Dark,'' the song that they co-wrote, rocketed to number one.  ``Songwriting was always my forte, and I always considered myself a songwriter first,'' Secada says. ``That was such a big song for Gloria. I feel lucky just to be a part of it.''  Estefan returned the favor by showcasing Secada the singer on her concert tour, launching his career as a performer.  ``One thing just led to another,'' Secada says. ``I've never really sat down and analyzed what was happening and when. I just try to keep working through it, giving my best. I've been very fortunate that things have worked out the way they have over time.''  Although most people think of songwriting as a solitary pursuit, Secada sees it as a collaborative process, just like acting in a play or performing in a concert.  ``I like to work with other people. I like the co-writing experience,'' he says. ``And I'm pretty disciplined when it comes to writing.  ``I set a schedule and get together with my co-writers. The melody and the lyrics come together while we're working on a song. At the same time, we're working on the arrangement. So it's a process where I might have ideas beforehand, but it's not until we sit down and work them out that everything comes together.''  When he signed his first record deal, for example, Secada characteristically went back to his roots and turned to his old high-school friend Morejon for help in creating material. ``Just Another Day'' was the first song they wrote together for the record.  ``Sometimes, as artists, we have feelings we want to bring out,'' Morejon says of their collaboration. ``So, like me, Jon may walk in with a mood or a color that he wants to express. We go with the feeling we feel that day. When we work together and exchange ideas, it's like working with family.''  As a composer and as a singer, Secada claims to be equally comfortable in Spanish and English.  ``Coming from Miami, which is completely bilingual, I grew up speaking both languages,'' he says. ``For me, they're both the same, to tell you the truth.''  Nevertheless, just as some people believe rock-'n'-roll sounds best in English and opera's primo language is Italian, some critics claim that Secada has to be heard in Spanish to be truly appreciated.  ``Anglos who listen to my Spanish stuff sometimes say the Spanish translation sounds better,'' says Secada, who always includes a few Spanish-language songs on his English recordings. ``I think that's just because Spanish is such a passionate language itself.''  Secada is now devoting himself almost single-mindedly to perfecting his craft. His five-year marriage to a former student ended in divorce in 1993, a casualty of career pressures. These days, his nights are spent on stage in ``Grease,'' and his days are taken up with work on his next album.  Having invested weeks of intensive work with an acting coach to get ready for his Broadway debut, Secada wouldn't mind trying out for more roles, perhaps in feature films.  ``Definitely I'd like to do more acting,'' he says. ``But at this point, I'm concentrating on this show and loving it. Hopefully, it will carry on to other things. It's just been great.''  All those fans squealing in their seats couldn't agree more.  (Joseph D. Younger is an Ohio-based free-lance writer.)

A little after 10 in the morning, from out of the jostling masses trodding down the street, the tall gunman appeared. Freddy's was open for business, and when the man went in, the police said, he yelled, ``It's on now!'' and told all the blacks to leave. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19951209.0175 type=story > <HEADLINE> RICHARD BARNETT, MARITIME LAWYER, IS DEAD AT 68 </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-BARNETT-OBIT-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
"50511"	"you"	"yelled"	" After departing the Rahal-Hogan outfit, which itself dissolved into two teams, Raul Boesel jumped ship to Barry Green's 1995 PPG Championship team. Boesel, who replaces Jacques Villeneuve behind the wheel of the Brahma Sports Team entry, will be one of five drivers piloting the experimental Ford-Cosworth XD engine this season. So will he feel pressure to duplicate what Villeneuve did last season? ``Of course there is some pressure,'' said Boesel, a Miami native who remains winless in his Indy car career. ``But I don't really look at it and say, `Well, I'm driving for the team that won the championship last year, so I need to win as well.' I think everybody knows that some changes have been made in terms of the rules, so everybody is starting from ground zero to develop their car.'' ... When Carl Hogan departed to form a partnership with Penske and field a car for Emerson Fittipaldi,Bobby Rahal took over sole proprietorship of his racing outfit. However, Rahal recently took on a minority partner in the person of David Letterman. The popular talk show host said the top three perks (we don't have space for a Top 10 list) that went along with team membership were No. 3, The ability to get pit passes by simply sucking up to himself; No. 2, Getting to check Bobby's helmet for hair after each race; and, No. 1, Finally having someone to talk to about his ``half-shaft problems.'' Rahal said of his partnership, ``It's an outstanding opportunity for the team and our sponsors. It's also going to be a lot of fun. Dave is far from a casual observer of motor sports. He's been with us at a number of races already, and is an informed and knowledgeable enthusiast.'' ... Almost three decades after he unveiled his first Eagle chassis, legendary driver and car owner Dan Gurney will debut his Eagle MKV, which will be powered by the new purpose-built Toyota Indy car engine and driven by Juan Manuel Fangio Jr. ``It's exciting to be back, but we've really only tested about seven days with this car and this engine,'' said Gurney. ``The team knows from the Indy Car spring training session (Feb. 5-9 at Homestead) where the program stands, and we are moving forward. I tried to explain during spring training that this was a situation similar to when you were a kid playing `hide and go seek.' Once you finished counting, you yelled, `Ready or not, here I come.' Well, it is going to be that way for us this year.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"

Times News Service  AIR FORCE REVIEWING BROWN CRASH  WASHINGTON (NYT) _ The Air Force said Monday that it is reviewing ``every procedure'' that might have played a role in the crash of the military plane in Dubrovnik, Croatia last week that was carrying Commerce Secretary Ron Brown.  But so far, according to an assistant secretary of the Air Force, there have been no changes in guidance to pilots on VIP flights or other missions as far as when to land. The plane, a modified version of the Boeing 737, crashed into a hillside on its approach to the airport during a driving rainstorm, killing all 33 Americans on board.  On Monday the government also said that it had turned over to families the bodies of 16 crash victims, who had brought to a military mortuary in Dover, Del., on Saturday.  Meanwhile in Dubrovnik, Croatia, investigators _ handicapped by the lack of flight data recorder and a cockpit voice recorder _ examined the engines, the control surfaces, the readings on instrument dials and other pices of the wreckage in an effort to determine why the T43A slammed into the rocky hillside when approaching the airport.  STARVING BOSNIAN MUSLIMS COME OUT OF HIDING  TUZLA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (NYT) _ Early Saturday morning, six bony, weak frostbite-scarred men, some of them teen-agers, showed up saying they had spent the last 9 months literally underground, hiding in Serbian territory since the Serbs took the U.N. safe area of Srebrenica.  They say they came out now because they were running out of food. Although they certainly look like their story is true, some refugee officials, who have not seen the mean, said their survival would not have been possible unless they had been sheltered by sympathetic Serbs.  FORMER BLACK PANTHER REMAINS FUGITIVE  HAVANA (NYT) _ More than a quarter of a century after he sought political asylum in Cuba, William Lee Brent still seems American to the core. He speaks a Spanish tinged with the Louisiana accent of his boyhood, prefers whiskey to rum, and continues to focus his attention on many of the same causes he once espoused as a member of the Black Panther Party.  But Brent has cast his lot with the Cuban Revolution, and even if he wanted to, he could not return to the land of his birth. He arrived here in 1969 after hijacking at gunpoint an airliner bound for New York from San Francisco with 76 people on board, and after all these years he remains a fugitive from American justice.  U.S. WAR PLANES PREPARING TO FLY OVER IRAQ  BAGHDAD, Iraq (NYT) _ For the first time since the Persian Gulf war, American warplanes are preparing to carry out patrols over southern Iraq from neighboring Jordan, a step that could elevate tensions between Baghdad and Amman.  Jordan sided with Iraq during the war, in 1991, and it remained aligned with Iraq until eight months ago.

WORLD NEWS IN BRIEF (JT) c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service  AIR FORCE REVIEWING BROWN CRASH  WASHINGTON (NYT) _ The Air Force said Monday that it is reviewing ``every procedure'' that might have played a role in the crash of the military plane in Dubrovnik, Croatia last week that was carrying Commerce Secretary Ron Brown.  But so far, according to an assistant secretary of the Air Force, there have been no changes in guidance to pilots on VIP flights or other missions as far as when to land. The plane, a modified version of the Boeing 737, crashed into a hillside on its approach to the airport during a driving rainstorm, killing all 33 Americans on board.  On Monday the government also said that it had turned over to families the bodies of 16 crash victims, who had brought to a military mortuary in Dover, Del., on Saturday.  Meanwhile in Dubrovnik, Croatia, investigators _ handicapped by the lack of flight data recorder and a cockpit voice recorder _ examined the engines, the control surfaces, the readings on instrument dials and other pieces of the wreckage in an effort to determine why the T43A slammed into the rocky hillside when approaching the airport.  STARVING BOSNIAN MUSLIMS COME OUT OF HIDING  TUZLA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (NYT) _ Early Saturday morning, six bony, weak frostbite-scarred men, some of them teen-agers, showed up saying they had spent the last 9 months literally underground, hiding in Serbian territory since the Serbs took the U.N. safe area of Srebrenica.  They say they came out now because they were running out of food. Although they certainly look like their story is true, some refugee officials, who have not seen the mean, said their survival would not have been possible unless they had been sheltered by sympathetic Serbs.  FORMER BLACK PANTHER REMAINS FUGITIVE  HAVANA (NYT) _ More than a quarter of a century after he sought political asylum in Cuba, William Lee Brent still seems American to the core. He speaks a Spanish tinged with the Louisiana accent of his boyhood, prefers whiskey to rum, and continues to focus his attention on many of the same causes he once espoused as a member of the Black Panther Party.  But Brent has cast his lot with the Cuban Revolution, and even if he wanted to, he could not return to the land of his birth. He arrived here in 1969 after hijacking at gunpoint an airliner bound for New York from San Francisco with 76 people on board, and after all these years he remains a fugitive from American justice.  U.S. WAR PLANES PREPARING TO FLY OVER IRAQ  BAGHDAD, Iraq (NYT) _ For the first time since the Persian Gulf war, American warplanes are preparing to carry out patrols over southern Iraq from neighboring Jordan, a step that could elevate tensions between Baghdad and Amman.  Jordan sided with Iraq during the war, in 1991, and it remained aligned with Iraq until eight months ago. It has since reversed its course, but its decision to permit the American aircraft to use Jordan as a base for flights over Iraq is being seen as evidence of a a wholesale transformation in its policy toward Iraq.
