"6149"	"I"	"confess"	" Citing extensive research of the painting, offering to send a copy of the report and inviting me to come to California to personally inspect the painting -- for a nominal charge of $2,000 -- astonishes me because, I confess, the most I ever paid for a piece of art was for an artist's proof of the official poster of the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199410.gz"
"7335"	"I"	"confess"	" For a few moments this past week, I confess, I did wrestle with the very notion of ``celebrity gossip'' and the human desire for it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199410.gz"
"8322"	"I"	"confess"	" These proposals (which, I confess, would not do much to reduce the demagogy and lunacy of talk radio) are not original and probably not enforceable; they involve technical and economic as well as legal problems. So if other approaches serve better, fine. The object is simply to add more accurate information to the campaign commotion and reduce the vicious nonsense. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"
"9259"	"I"	"confess"	" By the time I approached the newsroom bulletin board, order forms already overlapped. So I tried niche marketing -- penning my plea in the business staff's electronic mail. (Too narrow a market, I confess, based on results.) </P> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"
"35754"	"I"	"confess"	" I feel bad about saying this the same week that the pope is visiting America but, I confess, years of watching Christmas Eve midnight mass on television had ill-prepared me for the rampant commercialism and tourism at the Vatican. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"35755"	"I"	"confess"	" I feel bad about saying this the same week that the pope is visiting America but, I confess, years of watching Christmas Eve midnight mass on television had ill-prepared me for the rampant commercialism and tourism at the Vatican. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"35764"	"I"	"confess"	" I feel bad about saying this the same week that the pope is visiting America but, I confess, years of watching Christmas Eve midnight mass on television had ill-prepared me for the rampant commercialism and tourism at the Vatican. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"35772"	"I"	"confess"	" I feel bad about saying this the same week that the pope is visiting America but, I confess, years of watching Christmas Eve midnight mass on television had ill-prepared me for the rampant commercialism and tourism at the Vatican. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"35782"	"I"	"confess"	" I feel bad about saying this the same week that the pope is visiting America but, I confess, years of watching Christmas Eve midnight mass on television had ill-prepared me for the rampant commercialism and tourism at the Vatican. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"35973"	"I"	"confess"	" I feel bad about saying this around the time the pope was visiting America but, I confess, years of watching Christmas Eve midnight mass on television had ill-prepared me for the rampant commercialism and tourism at the Vatican. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"35974"	"I"	"confess"	" I feel bad about saying this around the time the pope was visiting America but, I confess, years of watching Christmas Eve midnight mass on television had ill-prepared me for the rampant commercialism and tourism at the Vatican. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"

"39202"	"I"	"confess"	" Here, I confess, I'm torn. Midwestern cornball that I am, every Thanksgiving when Marilyn's father puts his arm around my shoulder and asks how's his daughter-in-law, I almost start to cry. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"
"39203"	"I"	"confess"	" Here, I confess, I'm torn. Midwestern cornball that I am, every Thanksgiving when Marilyn's father puts his arm around my shoulder and asks how's his daughter-in-law, I almost start to cry. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"
"39863"	"I"	"confess"	" I like to keep things simple. At the same time, I tend to use Thanksgiving as an excuse to pull out special bottles, or expensive ones that I've been saving for just such occasions. But, I confess, I'm less likely to open those bottles if there are a lot of wine drinkers seated at the table _ there won't be enough to get a decent taste _ or if the guests simply don't care for or appreciate fine wine. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"
"48531"	"I"	"confess"	" I had worked for Loeb, I confess, and when there were not enough letters to the editor to fill the page, reporters were told to stop working on stories and begin writing letters to the editor that were published anonymously. ``Oh, really?'' says Chancellor, surprised. ``That's a great story.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"
"49957"	"I"	"confess"	" The fact that a 24-hour general strike over a wage dispute in Athens was in full swing, I confess, interested me not at all. But the play on words, ``...woe to Grecian earners'' brought a chuckle. (Keats' ``Ode on a Grecian urn'' _ get it?) </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"
"60972"	"I"	"confess"	" Well, I know it, I confess, </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"

"62020"	"I"	"confess"	" Since the mid-'60s, I confess, I've slithered my way under false pretenses into the Baby Boom set. I mistrusted people over 30; tuned in, turned on and dropped out; wore the hairstyles and fashions of the first wave of Baby Boomers. No one suspected! </P> "	"nyt_eng_199606.gz"
"75108"	"I"	"confess"	" ``If I have become a tool for Your plans, it was not, I confess, because I was an especially docile tool,'' he says in a 1991 entry, written on Feb. 5, his birthday. ``Sometimes I wonder whether it might have been better if I had not spread my interest and my activities so wide, if I had chosen to concentrate on one thing. So I am what I am, mostly because You have made me what I am and for that I have no regrets. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"
"95375"	"I"	"confess"	" I was clueless, and starting to think this wasn't such a good idea. Quickly, my mentor told me what was happening, and I got the correct score and  accurate position of the baserunners onto the screen. And then, I confess, I prayed for the Mariners to do no more damage that inning. I was spent. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"
"96804"	"I"	"confess"	" How so? It is hard to trust anything after such an attack, because trust is based on a certain presumptive morality, a sense that certain actions are simply outside the bounds of human behavior or imagination. That 19 people would take over four civilian airliners and then steer them into buildings loaded with thousands of innocent people, and not even leave a suicide note behind, was, I confess, outside the boundary of my imagination. The World Trade Center is not the place where our intelligence agencies failed. It is the place where our imaginations failed. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"
"96822"	"I"	"confess"	" How so? It is hard to trust anything after such an attack, because trust is based on a certain presumptive morality, a sense that certain actions are simply outside the bounds of human behavior or imagination. That 19 people would take over four civilian airliners and then steer three of them into buildings loaded with thousands of innocent people was, I confess, outside the boundary of my imagination. The World Trade Center is not the place where our intelligence agencies failed. It is the place where our imaginations failed. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"
"102996"	"I"	"confess"	" The n-sport day began before dawn with a snowshoe hike up a hill behind the resort. (All right, I confess, I didn't get up for the beginning of the hike, but I did meet Stephen on his way down.) The Balsams has several well-marked snowshoe trails, some up to spots of panoramic splendor, and last winter's deep snow and low temperatures had them in prime condition. (At mid-December this year there was still not enough snow for skiing, but since for the last 35 winters the Balsams has averaged over 250 inches of snow, the management is not worried.) </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"110329"	"I"	"confess"	" No, the Rangers' general manager isn't waving a white flag nine short days from Opening Day in Oakland; he's just being realistic. And, I confess, I might be putting a few words in his mouth, but not many. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"120958"	"I"	"confess"	" OK, I confess, I saw just one hole up close and personal. That one was enough to convince me that the day should be called on account ... on account of it being too wet, too windy and too cold for a polar bear, much less a human being. The other 17 holes of this train wreck I watched in macabre fascination on the press center big screen. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"
"121346"	"I"	"confess"	" Wills concludes the book with a poignant reflection on the Apostles' Creed, the anchor of Catholic faith. To Wills, the creed articulates pure Catholicism and is the basis for his own beliefs. As he puts it, in a rare moment of sarcasm, ``I do not, I confess, continually meditate on the evil of condoms, or the horror of letting women be priests. That is not `church teaching' in the same sense that the creed is.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"
"141498"	"I"	"confess"	" Finally, the 36-year-old mayor alights at City Hall, ready to assess the sweeper's effectiveness. These machines, I confess, are not so beneficial to our street-cleaning effort, he says. When we were in Boston I saw some other machines I want to look at. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"142400"	"I"	"confess"	" Another evident need, a display of contemporary art, is met by the Warhols, Rauschenbergs, Twomblys, Judds and Lichtensteins, Americans all, assembled in the Hamburger Bahnhof, a former train station, along with seminal works by the Germans Joseph Beuys and Anselm Kiefer. Kiefer, I confess, had never meant much to me, but this time -- maybe it was the news from Iraq -- I was stirred by the pacifist fervor of pieces like Poppy and Memory, a sculpture of a disintegrating warplane. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"142926"	"I"	"confess"	" Her daughter, I confess, is much more lackadaisical. The shower gets scrubbed when alien life forms emerge in crevices; and dust bunnies are vanquished only when they outweigh the cat. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"143081"	"I"	"confess"	" Nepotism, I confess, was the way I got into the carpentry business since I have little or no practical experience beyond musing dreamily in the electric drill department of a nearby home improvement store. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"157381"	"I"	"confess"	" Sometimes it's uncertainty: Did I really hear what I thought I heard? Sometimes it's that medicolegal desire to check every box. Suppose the child gets sicker, could I really justify not having gotten an X-ray? And sometimes, I confess, it's just the awareness that the X-ray is possible, the X-ray is there, the X-ray is easy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
"164003"	"I"	"confess"	" Sam Dunn used to be like me: A mid-'80s metalhead, awash in horror-movie nihilism, black concert T-shirts and hair I can only liken to Cheryl Ladd circa 1978. We rocked to the chunky throb and slashing grind of Metallica, Slayer, Mot?rhead, Saxon, Venom and, I confess, Ratt and Twisted Sister. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"

"164291"	"I"	"confess"	" Language does change, I confess, and give examples of how that comes about, but I also firmly remind them that until what they're speaking becomes acceptable, they're stuck with the current rules. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"165037"	"I"	"confess"	" Last Sunday, I confess, I had the same feeling as I watched Lesley Stahl on 60 Minutes exposing what she deemed to be a conspiracy involving SAC Capital Advisors, the secretive $8 billion hedge fund run by Steven A. Cohen, and Gradient Analytics, the independent research firm that specializes in accounting and quality of earnings research. As you probably know by now, the two firms, along with a handful of others, have been accused of stock manipulation by a Canadian pharmaceutical company called Biovail. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
