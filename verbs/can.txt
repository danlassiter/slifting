SEAGRAM GROWS AT FCB/LEBER KATZ WPP UNIT GETS MORE IBM BILLING BOMBARDIER UNIT SELECTS HARRIS DRURY (ll)  c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service  The Seagram Beverage Group said Thursday that it had expanded its relationship with FCB/Leber Katz Partners in New York by naming that agency to handle its North American Dole juices account, which had been at Lord, Dentsu &AMP; Partners in Los Angeles, a joint venture of Dentsu Inc. and Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc., for the last five years. The billings were estimated at $5 million to $10 million.  Mark Gutsche, a spokesman for the Seagram Beverage Group, a unit of Seagram Co. in Bradenton, Fla., said the move consolidated Seagram's Tropicana Dole Beverages North America business at FCB/Leber Katz, a unit of True North Communications that was awarded the $25 million account for Tropicana juices in August. Seagram acquired the Dole global juice business from the Dole Food Company in May. Gutsche added that FCB/Leber Katz had been awarded the account without a review.  c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service  IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., said Thursday that it had consolidated its Personal Systems Group's worldwide promotions account at the Einson Freeman Promotional Campaigns unit of the WPP Group in Paramus, N.J.  The account, with billings estimated at $20 million to $30 million, was previously divided among local agencies. Einson Freeman was awarded the account after a three-month review that began with 12 agencies and was narrowed to Einson Freeman and three undisclosed finalists.  A sibling WPP Group unit, Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide in New York, handles the worldwide advertising account of IBM, with billings estimated at $400 million to $500 million.  c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service  Bombardier Motor Corp. of America, a unit of Bombardier Inc., has retained Harris Drury Cohen in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to handle its Sea-Doo personal watercraft account.  In addition, the company has expanded its relationship with Harris Drury Cohen by naming that agency to handle its Sea-Doo jet boat and Celebrity boat accounts. The combined billings were estimated at more than $15 million.  Harris Drury Cohen, which previously handled the Sea-Doo personal watercraft account for the last five years, was awarded the combined accounts after a two-month review that included four other agencies: BVK/Tuzee Inc. in Cape Coral, Fla., which previously handled the Sea-Doo Jet account; HMV/McFarland &AMP; Drier in Miami; Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Detroit, a unit of the WPP Group, and the West Group in Tampa, Fla.  In May, Bombardier acquired the Celebrity boat brand from Jupiter Industries in Chicago; under the previous owner that account was handled by Prom Krog Altstiel in Mequon, Wis., on a project basis. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960222.0723 type=story > <HEADLINE> MARIST HOPES THE BEST OF TIMES IS NOW </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y.

It's the second of this summer's blockbusters, following Star Wars: Episode 3 -- Revenge of the Sith , to illuminate the backstories of iconic and beloved characters -- and, just like Sith , about the only reaction it's apt to inspire is a polite shrug. It's not so much that these movies lack imagination as they lack a sense of storytelling urgency; the filmmakers tell us everything we might have wanted to know but nothing we needed to know. Prequels, by their nature, are stingy, undemocratic affairs -- the filmmakers are reclaiming those parts of the story that had previously been left to our imaginations. But even by those standards, Batman Begins is a cheat. It cannibalizes Bruce Wayne's early years but contributes nothing to the Batman iconography, other than shrillness and explosions. And those things, especially during the summer movie season, are a dime a dozen. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20050616.0135 type=advis > <HEADLINE> EARLY-FRONTPAGE-NYT </HEADLINE> <TEXT> Here are the stories New York Times editors are planning for Page 1, Friday, June 17.

IRAQ (Baghdad, Iraq) -- Iraqi political leaders broke weeks of deadlock on Thursday, with Sunni Arabs accepting a compromise offer made by senior members of a Shiite-led parliamentary committee to include Sunnis in the drafting of Iraq's new constitution. The agreement was a significant step forward in Iraq's political process, which had been mired in arguments between Shiite legislators and Sunni Arabs over the number of seats Sunnis would be given on Iraq's 55-member Constitutional Committee. Progress on the constitution came as American military forces in the northern city of Mosul announced they had captured an insurgent leader they identified as the No. 2 to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the commander of al-Qaida in Iraq and the country's most-wanted terrorist.

RIGHTS-TRIAL (Philadelphia, Ms.) -- Rita Bender's husband and his two fellow volunteers had been missing for five days when she heard that his car had been found, burned, in the Bogue Chitto swamp. She was with a fellow civil rights worker, Fannie Lou Hamer, when the news came, and they cried together, their tears mingling, Bender told the jury on Thursday as the first witness in the trial of Edgar Ray Killen for the murder of Andrew Goodman, James Earl Chaney and her husband, Michael Schwerner in 1964. I think it really hit me for the first time that they were dead, Bender said. The jury paid close attention as Bender told of their marriage (she was 20, he 22), their move, soon after, to Mississippi to open a community center and help register black voters, and the constant threats against them and those who took them in. But absent during the drama was the defendant, Killen, who had been taken from the courthouse on a stretcher after complaining of a suffocating feeling, his lawyer said. By Shaila Dewan.  LIVING-WILLS (Undated) -- Interest in living wills -- the documents that let people specify what medical measures they want or do not want at the end of life -- has surged in the wake of the fierce nationwide battle over the fate of Terri Schiavo, according to lawyers and other experts on all sides of the issue.

On the road from the airport, she had watched rickshaws surge past women street sweepers, bone-thin in their bright saris. Now, in a language she barely understood, unfamiliar aunts and uncles lamented her fate: to be forced to leave the United States, her home since kindergarten, because the FBI had mysteriously identified her as a potential suicide bomber. I feel like I'm on a different planet, the girl, Tashnuba Hayder, said. It just hit me. How everything happened -- it's like, 'Oh, my God.'The story of how it happened -- how Tashnuba, the pious, headstrong daughter of Muslim immigrants living in a neighborhood of tidy lawns and American flags, was labeled an imminent threat to national security -- is still shrouded in government secrecy.

DISNEY-SHARK (Hong Kong) -- Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are being drawn into an unusual showdown between Western sensitivities and Chinese tradition, setting off a debate that has this city buzzing. It began when Hong Kong Disneyland, a new theme park scheduled to open on Sept. 12, announced that it would serve shark's fin soup -- a chewy, sinewy, stringy dish that has been a Chinese favorite for two centuries. But plans for the culinary delicacy, to be served at wedding banquets, have drawn a biting response from environmental advocates. They say that so many sharks wind up floating in soup these days that there are not enough left swimming in the world's oceans. By Keith Bradsher.  With photo.

Four more soldiers were killed Sunday, and two U.S. Embassy workers were injured in attacks. The deaths bring the toll to more than 60 Americans this year, much higher than in previous years. By Carlotta Gall.  With graphic.  (Scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in i news file.)  EVOLUTION-WARS-II (Undated) -- At the heart of the debate over intelligent design is this question: Can a scientific explanation of the history of life invoke the actions of an unseen higher being? The proponents of intelligent design, a school of thought that some have argued should be taught alongside evolution in the nation's schools, say that the complexity and diversity of life go beyond what evolution can explain. Biological marvels like the optical precision of an eye, the little spinning motors that propel bacteria, the cascade of proteins that cause blood to clot, they say, clearly point to the hand of a higher being at work in the world.

NEW-RURALISM (West Bay, Fla.) -- What is a striving Florida developer to do when most of its vast holdings are not beach chic but rural, remote and mosquitoey? The St. Joe Co., which owns 800,000 mostly inland acres in the scrubby, unremarkable pine forests of the Panhandle, is invoking Thoreau. The company, Florida's largest private landowner, is pushing new ruralism, a concept it hopes will entice city and suburban dwellers who are weary of civilization and long to own a tractor, a pickup truck or at least a kayak and a few large dogs.

In a nutshell, here's what he'll say: There's nothing wrong with the Social Security system that cannot be fixed by a little show of governmental responsibility. Due to simultaneous tax cuts and increased spending over the past two decades, four presidential administrations have raided the (Social Security) trust fund to pay for federal programs that should have been financed from the income-tax levy. Why, he asks, can't wealthy Americans who benefited most from tax cuts now refund the system via a raise in the taxable income cap? Hiltzik traces the history of Social Security and opposition to it, and proposes other ways to fix the system and guarantee low- and middle-income Americans financial support when they need it most.

Despite the drama, tears and moments of violence, the prophecies of civil war have proved hollow. The essential solidarity of Israelis as an embattled people, even in a country where everyone argues about anything, has been exemplified by the somber, careful and even sensitive behavior of the army and police toward their fellow citizens. By Steven Erlanger.  IRAQ-RECONSTRUCT (KUWAIT CITY) -- A U.S. general who commanded 38,000 soldiers in the securing and rebuilding of Baghdad writes in a new essay that success in Iraq cannot be achieved solely by training local security forces.

Chiarelli, commander of the Army's 1st Cavalry Division, the military must also work to provide essential city services, create jobs and promote local governmental control. By Thom Shanker.  BRITAIN-VIGIL (London) -- It is just over four years since Brian Haw began camping on the sidewalk across the way from Britain's Parliament to protest government policies in Iraq. In that time, his single placard has blossomed into several dozen banners, sculptures and photographic displays that stretch about 20 yards across the green at Parliament Square, becoming perhaps this country's longest-running, and possibly loudest, peace vigil.

Mark Lanier preached to a jury in Angleton, Texas, telling seven men and five women to remember the story of David and Goliath and smite the drug maker Merck with a verdict that would be heard around the world. On Friday, the jury fulfilled Lanier's request. And on Sunday, Lanier was preaching again, this time at his regular Sunday school Bible class at a church in northwest Houston, about 60 miles from Angleton. For Lanier, Friday's verdict capped an exhilarating six-week trial that cemented his place as one of the nation's top civil trial lawyers and may fuel his nascent political ambitions. His folksy style resonates with juries, but underneath his Texas twang is a fierce desire to win, a love of media attention and a healthy ego. By Alex Berenson.  GOOGLE (San Francisco) -- In all the speculation that followed the announcement from Google on Thursday that it planned to raise an additional $4 billion by selling stock, no one seemed to recall the space elevator. The elevator -- a fanciful alternative to rocket boosters to reach earth orbit -- is one of the dozens of business ideas that have been considered by the company's wide-eyed founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page. Of course, such fringe ventures could easily consume any number of billions of dollars that Google might raise on the stock market. But whatever direction Google turns, it is likely to disappoint those expecting a blockbuster acquisition. By John Markoff.

HOUSING-BOOM (Undated) -- The world's online betting markets have done quite a nice job of predicting the future lately.

FOREIGN  With story BC-AFRICA-CELLPHONES-NYT  Africa is the world's fastest- growing cellphone market. From 1999 through 2004, the number of mobile subscribers in Africa jumped to 76.8 million from 7.5 million, an average annual increase of 58 percent. South Africa, the continent's richest nation, accounted for one-fifth of that growth.  Asia, the next fastest-expanding market, grew by an annual average of just 34 percent in that period.  Developments as Iraqi leaders raced to meet deadline for completing a new constitution, which is still hung up on issues concerning the role of Islam and the clergy in family matters.  After nearly 40 years of occupation, Israel pulled its last settlers out of Gaza on Monday, leaving to the end this symbolic and devout settlement, surrounded on three sides by Palestinians. Under an agreement with the army and the government, the roughly 1,000 residents here, plus another 300 or so who had come to support them, left their homes without resistance  A 10 percent discount for bikini wearers is one of the stratagems rural areas are using to lure urbanites in South Korea.  If there is a front line in the border crisis stretching from Arizona to Texas, it might be the 14 miles of wide open boundary that the Johnson clan shares with Mexican counterparts to the south. As many as 500 immigrants a day use their ranches and farms as a welcome mat, they say, with bandits and smuggling guides making some sections too dangerous to visit. Crops disappear; cattle have turned up in a butcher shop on the other side. Once they were robbed of a truck at gunpoint.  MEXICO--NM Border map -- Size to be determined  Illegal immigration along the New Mexico border.  We plan BESTSELLERS--Weekly 0821 -- Various files of Besteller Lists  For some students, expanding their expertise beyond computer programming is crucial to future job security as advances in the Internet and low-cost computers make it easier to shift some technology jobs to nations with well-educated engineers and lower wages, like India and China.  For many Americans, figuring out the monthly phone bill has become the consumer's equivalent of deciphering the Rosetta Stone, with half a dozen or more baffling fees like subscriber line charge, property tax allotment and carrier cost recovery fee tacked on.  The world's oldest continuing neighborhood could be in Erbil, Iraq, at the Citadel, an ancient and teeming city within a city girded by stone walls. Resting on a layer cake of civilizations that have come and gone for an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 years, the Citadel looms over the apartment blocks of this otherwise rather gray metropolis in Iraqi Kurdistan. The settlement rivals Jericho and a handful of other famous towns for the title of the oldest continuously inhabited site in the world. The difference is that few people have heard of the Citadel outside Iraq. And political turmoil has prevented a full study of its archaeological treasures.  We plan IRAQ--Erbil -- 60p9 x 10 1/2  A look at Erbil, Iraq, one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world  Two brains are better than one.

And:  BUSH (Salt Lake City) -- President Bush on Monday hailed the writing of an Iraqi constitution as a landmark event in the Middle East and then vowed, before an audience of military veterans, that the United States owed it to the more than 1,800 Americans killed in Iraq not to withdraw troops from the country prematurely. Bush made his remarks at his first public appearance in nine days, interrupting his monthlong vacation at his Texas ranch.

This universal feeling, he said, is evidence for the plausibility of God. </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz
, he added,	 Most scientists he knows who do believe in God, he added, believe in a God who is behind the laws of nature but who is not intervening. </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz
, he said,	 For Miller and other scientists, research is not about belief. Faith is one thing, what you believe from the heart, said Joseph E. Murray, who won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1990 for his work in organ transplantation. But in scientific research, he said, it's the results that count. </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz
, he presumes,	 Depending on the day, you're a teenager who wants to be an adult, but also you want to be a kid, Rogow said, referring to his characters and, he presumes, many in his audience. I try to speak to these moments of transition. </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz
, he said,	 When Rogow made the deal to put Lizzie on the Disney Channel, he had little leverage. A trained lawyer who had produced an NBC legal drama (Shannon's Deal) and a few Disney movies of the week (including Rock 'n' Roll Mom with Dyan Cannon), he was unable to lay much claim to the proceeds of the various subsidiaries Lizzie would spawn. Much of them are controlled by Disney divisions. These include a full-length feature film (2003) that, he said, cost about $17.5 million and grossed more than twice as much, and an accompanying soundtrack that was certified double platinum, meaning it sold at least 2 million copies. </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz
, he added,	 'Lizzie' didn't reach 'Lizzie' proportions at this stage, either, he said. In a follow-up e-mail message, he added, With luck, we're building the better 'mouse.' </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz
, we cut,	 We play within the rules, Mora said. Yes, we cut, but we emphasize and teach fair play. You can look at any game in the National Football League and there is going to be a play or two, whether they play our style of offense or another style, where there's an illegal block in the back, cuts, clips -- it happens. We never, ever ask our guys to do anything illegal or to hurt anybody. We're not out to hurt anybody. </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz

, he added,	 Sherwood said that at Bartle Bogle, we've always had in our minds the potential for having a very strong American in the management team, as part of getting the right balance of BBH people and the best talent we can find locally. But it was only in the last six months that the idea began to crystallize, he added, as the agency -- which is 49 percent owned by the giant French agency Publicis Groupe -- became aware of Harty's availability. </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz
, it said,	 Charter schools in California, for instance, receive on average about $4,800 per student in federal, state and local taxpayer money, compared with the $7,000 that traditional public schools there receive, the study found. In New York, it said, the average charter school receives $10,500 per student, compared with $13,300 at traditional public schools. </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz
, it said,	 The report found that charter schools received less operating money from local taxes than did traditional public schools. But another major cause of the financing disparity, it said, is that traditional schools can draw on state and local money to build and renovate schools, while such funds for those purposes are generally not available to charter schools. As a result, many charter schools must use operating money to pay for classroom space, reducing what they can pay teachers, who often work extra hours trying to make their schools succeed. </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz
, she said,	 In large part, Khandelwal said, the transition from formally arranged marriage reflects social changes in India itself, where assisted marriage is now common among highly educated middle-class people in urban areas. That is because, she said, there are fewer extended-family living arrangements and more women pursuing higher education. </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz
, they say,	 As many as 500 immigrants a day use their ranch and farm lands as a welcome mat, they say, with bandits and smuggling guides making some sections too dangerous to visit. They say their fences have been torn down, their crops pilfered and their watering tanks fouled with human waste. </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz
, they say,	 But that is of little comfort to the Johnsons, particularly James' uncle and aunt, Joe and Teresa Johnson, ranchers who say they have had brushes with smugglers. Particularly scary, they say, are the forbidden zones on their own land, first settled by the family in 1918 in the marauding days of the Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa, who plundered Columbus. </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz
, they say,	 Everyone captured is fingerprinted and checked against government files. Non-Mexicans are held for deportation proceedings, but because jail space is limited, Mexicans without criminal records are generally released across the border. They can be caught and released a dozen times before facing charges, Border Patrol agents say. In fact, they say, when they stop seeing certain repeat offenders it means they finally made it in. </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz
, she replied,	 One of the women, Maria Guadelupe Chavez, 51, from Durango, Mexico, said she had been living in Oregon illegally for the past 13 years, had married an American but it didn't work out, and was working there as a licensed home aide. Asked why she had returned to Mexico and risked an illegal re-entry, she replied, stupidity. </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz
, he said,	 The others escaped to a farmhouse where, he said, his mother, scared to death, retrieved a gun and held them for the Border Patrol. </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz
, she said,	 Riding the fence in July, Teresa Johnson said, she heard walkie-talkies and came face to face with two strangers with binoculars. Last fall, she said, she stepped out of her door to find a woman outside holding a list of names, clearly migrants to be smuggled, like you'd go to the grocery store with a list of things to pick up, she said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz
, she said,	 On July 3, she said, a lost migrant set their pasture afire to alert the Border Patrol. And just two weeks ago, she and Joe were leaving home for a meeting of the border task force, a monthly community gripe forum, when, at their door, they found another illegal immigrant who said he was lost and wanted to give up. </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz
, he said,	 Despite their frustration, family members are not looking for help from any of the civilian border patrol groups that have formed in recent years, like the Minuteman Project, James Johnson said. For one thing, he said, the area is without cell phone service, hampering civilian communication. Also, he said, You don't know their agenda -- it's too much of a liability. </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz
, he said,	 The feeling of helplessness is constant, but not altogether new. A dozen years ago, Joe Johnson said, he and his brother Bill were held up by five gunmen who took their pickup truck and fled toward Mexico, getting stuck in a ditch just before the border, he said. About eight years ago, he said, 30 head of their cattle were herded into Mexico; a few were found alive before slaughter in Palomas. </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz

, they didn't,	 Weir says that at the time he had no idea that reality shows were coming, but that his friends' bafflement told him, I must be very careful with the logic because people might reject this film. Well, they didn't, of course; the film, which is out in a new remastered special edition along with Weir's 1985 Witness, was both a critical and commercial success. </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz

, she said,	 Colby, however, said she was struck by the lack of information in some parts of Boston: In her West Roxbury neighborhood, parents often enroll their children in private test-prep programs to get ready for Latin School's entrance exam. But in inner-city schools, she said, she has met with parents and students who have never heard of Boston Latin School. In another instance, parents thought Latin School was a private school and assumed that they couldn't afford the tuition. </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz
, he said,	 But the direction the war in Iraq takes could affect the prospects of Romney or other Republicans in 2008. Jim Nuzzo, a Massachusetts-based Republican strategist, said the best scenario for the governor in 2008 would be if Iraq stabilizes. If Iraq is still a front-burner issue, he said, Romney will have a tough time against candidates with deeper international résumés. </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz

In the first call, Nahmias said, Rudolph told the dispatcher, This is a statement from the Free Militia, we defy your new world order and you -- before the call cuts off. Twelve minutes later, he said, Rudolph made a second call to warn of the bombing, but did not give the location of the bomb because he was afraid he had been spotted. </P> 	nyt_eng_200508.gz

Since the late 1940's, Dr. Stamler, professor emeritus and founding chairman of the department of preventive medicine at Northwestern University's medical school in Chicago, has been at the forefront of efforts to identify the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and establish the concept that heart disease, strokes and sudden cardiac deaths can be prevented through measures people can control -- better diets, regular exercise and not smoking.

Resting on a layer cake of civilizations that have come and gone for an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 years, the Citadel looms over the apartment blocks of this otherwise rather gray metropolis in Iraqi Kurdistan. The settlement rivals Jericho and a handful of other famous towns for the title of the oldest continuously inhabited site in the world.

It misses both the grace and the moral depth of knowing that humans have only the same stake, the same right, in the Earth as every other creature that has ever lived here.

Some scientists say no, regarding religious belief as little more than magical thinking -- an attitude that has been cited by religious conservatives who denounce science as a godless enterprise performed by secular elitists who are contemptuous of God-fearing people. But disdain for religion is far from universal among scientists. And now, these believers are beginning to speak out about their faith. By Cornelia Dean.

Ongoing coverage of the controversy over teaching alternatives to evolution: nytimes.com/evolution.)  With photo.  INDIAN-IMMIG-MARRIAGE (Undated) -- For thousands of young Indian immigrants, the venerable South Asian tradition of arranged marriages has taken on a new, American twist. Less than a decade ago, the decision about whom a South Asian woman in America might marry was still often left to her parents. But recently, purely arranged marriage has morphed into a new culture of what might be called assisted marriage, in which parents are free to arrange all they like, allowing their sons and daughters choice among a roster of nominees screened for caste, lineage and geography, among other measures. And their children are free to veto their choices. By Ginia Bellafante.  With photo.  MEXICO-N.M.-BORDER (Columbus, N.M.) -- If Joe Johnson were any closer to Mexico, he would be in it. And if there is a front line in the border crisis stretching from Arizona to Texas, it might be the 14 miles of wide open boundary that the Johnson clan shares with Mexican counterparts to the south. As many as 500 immigrants a day use their ranches and farms as a welcome mat, they say, with bandits and smuggling guides making some sections too dangerous to visit. Every day, just feet from their property, old school buses and vans with windows blacked out disgorge luggage-less passengers. Often thought of as a federal or international concern, illegal immigration has reached such a pace along parts of the border that officials are now expressing fear for the people who live and work there.

FINANCIAL  (Coded f)  RENAISSANCE-GEEKS (Undated) -- Jamika Burge is heading back to Virginia Tech this fall to pursue a Ph.D. in computer science, but her research is spiced with anthropology, sociology, psychology, psycholinguistics -- as well as observing cranky couples trade barbs in computer instant messages. It's so not programming, Burge said. If I had to sit down and code all day, I never would have continued. This is not traditional computer science. For students like Burge, expanding their expertise beyond computer programming is crucial to future job security as advances in the Internet and low-cost computers make it easier to shift some technology jobs to nations with well-educated engineers and lower wages, like India and China.

VIDEO-MARKETPLACE (Undated) -- Ever since Blockbuster and Movie Gallery opened their first video stores 20 years ago, predictions of their imminent demise have been as common as late fees. The drumbeat of doom for the traditional video rental store intensified this month after Blockbuster and Movie Gallery, the country's two largest chains, with more than 50 percent of the market, announced their second-quarter results. Yet that trip to the video store remains a stubborn fixture in the rapidly changing entertainment landscape. Complaints about the lack of selection, a paucity of hits and annoying late fees have not overcome the joys of browsing. Even the newer threats -- the convenience of online subscription services like Netflix and the ability to order movies at the touch of a cable remote's button -- are not expected by many analysts to crush the rental experience anytime soon.

Although August sales data is not in yet, the analysts expect sales to come in above last year's sales, although they disagreed in their estimates of how much above. What they did agree on was that students of all ages were stocking up on expensive denim. And they said college students, who represent more than half of the multibillion dollar back-to-school season, will help drive sales, with the purchases of computers, MP3 players and televisions, along with furniture and linens to decorate their dorm rooms and apartments. By Louise Story.  JAPAN-POST (Kobe, Japan) -- Given Japan's propensity to spend lavishly on public projects that may or may not have much use, let alone economic return, the proposed sale of Japan Post, the government-run bank that has provided billions of dollars for such projects, has raised a firestorm. Japan Post, which still delivers the nation's mail, is also Japan's largest savings bank, with $3 trillion in assets, and sells insurance as well. The question posed by its sale is, will Japan take a decisive turn toward free markets and privatize Japan Post, converting the world's largest state-run bank into the world's largest private bank? Or will the country continue as a semi-socialist economy where bureaucrats and politicians make multi-billion dollar investments with little regard to the country's economic health? By James Brooke.

At least that is the rationale for the close -- sometimes too close -- relationship between the human body's two brains, the one at the top of the spinal cord and the hidden but powerful brain in the gut known as the enteric nervous system. For Dr. Michael D. Gershon, the author of The Second Brain and the chairman of the department of anatomy and cell biology at Columbia, the connection between the two can be unpleasantly clear. Every time I call the National Institutes of Health to check on a grant proposal, Gershon said, I become painfully aware of the influence the brain has on the gut. In fact, anyone who has ever felt butterflies in the stomach before giving a speech, a gut feeling that flies in the face of fact or a bout of intestinal urgency the night before an examination has experienced the actions of the dual nervous systems.

By Nicholas Bakalar:  -- Choices: Despite complaints, women with breast cancer, not their doctors, most often choose mastectomy.  -- At Risk: Babies born at night are more likely to die than those born during the day, new research shows. The study included 3.3 million babies born in California from 1992 to 1999. Babies born at night had a 12 percent increase in mortality (death within four weeks after birth) if born from 6 p.m. to midnight, and up to a 16 percent increase if born from midnight to 6 a.m. compared to those born during the day. The authors offer several possible explanations.  -- Testing: Women may be avoiding colonoscopy because they prefer to have a female colonoscopist. According to a study, 87 percent of women would be willing to wait 30 days for a woman physician and 14 percent would be willing to pay $200 more for the procedure if done by a woman.

By Dexter Filkins.  BUSH (Boise, Idaho) -- President Bush gave his support to the nascent Iraqi constitution on Tuesday, saying that the charter would protect women and minorities and be a guiding force beyond Iraq. The fact that Iraq will have a democratic constitution that honors women's rights, the rights of minorities, is going to be an important change in the, in the broader Middle East, Bush said in a session with reporters in Donnelly, about 70 miles north of here. By Elisabeth Bumiller.  MIDEAST-WESTBANK (Sanur, West Bank) -- Thousands of Israeli soldiers and police evacuated two West Bank settlements on Tuesday, meeting little of the resistance they had expected from outside protesters, as Israel completed its scheduled removal of settlers from the occupied territories. Two settlements, Sanur and Homesh, were home to only a few residents, and many had left before the security forces arrived Tuesday morning. Residents of the other two West Bank settlements to be evacuated, Ganim and Kadim, have already left on their own, the military said. Bulldozers began knocking down structures in Ganim, the first demolitions in a West Bank settlement. Other parts of the West Bank are heavily settled and there are no plans for their evacuation. By Steve Erlanger.  IRAN-NUKES (Washington) -- While European countries suspend negotiations with Iran, because of its decision to resume nuclear enrichment, scientists announce that traces of bomb-grade uranium found in Iran came from contaminated Pakistani equipment. (Byline TK)  NKOREA-NUKES (Washington) -- Developments on talks with North Korea, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's meeting with South Korea's foreign minister. By Steven R. Weisman.  EGYPT-TERROR (Cairo, Egypt) -- Egyptian security forces swept through the craggy mountains of the northern Sinai Tuesday, arresting suspects as part of an effort to determine if the attacks on Sharm el Sheik last month were solely the work of local citizens or if there was some link to international terrorist groups, government officials said. By Michael Slackman.  SCIENCE (a code)  FETUS-PAIN (Undated) -- A team of doctors has studied one of the most politically and emotionally charged questions in the debate over abortion, and has concluded that during the first 6 months of pregnancy fetuses are probably not capable of feeling pain and therefore do not need anesthesia while they are being aborted. By Denise Grady.  UNITED STATES -- National General (a code)  ROBERTSON-ASSASSINATE (Undated) -- Pat Robertson said on his television show on Monday that the US should assassinate Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez: I think we really ought to go ahead and do it. It's a whole lot cheaper than starting a war. And I don't think any oil shipments will stop. Robertson's conservative Christian allies have grown used to his inflammatory comments, but do they think he's gone too far this time? Meanwhile, at least one liberal group is calling for the ABC Family network to stop carrying Robertson's show. By Laurie Goodstein.  EDUCATION-COLUMN (Shamokin, Pa.) -- The weekly column: If you're lucky, once in a lifetime you have a teacher like Jean Louise Stellfox. For 39 years she taught English at Shamokin High School in the Appalachian coal fields, and inspired generations of students. And so when Miss Stellfox died at 64 in a hit-and-run accident, there was an overflow crowd at the funeral home. But even buried, Stellfox was not done teaching. She had saved prodigiously, invested wisely, and left most of her $1.5 million estate to her alma mater, Dickinson College. By Michael Winerip.  UNITED STATES -- Washington (w code)  BORDER-SECURITY (Washington) -- Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said on Tuesday morning that the American public has the right to be distressed with the job the federal government is doing in controlling illegal migration across land borders, as the system in place to apprehend, detain and deport illegal aliens is broken and must be restructured. Homeland Security, he said, is working to rebuild the system, a task that includes a detailed analysis of every mile of the land border. He said he hopes this will soon result in the deployment of new Border Patrol agents and electronic surveillance equipment. By Eric Lipton.  FINANCIAL (f code)  AUTOS-EMMISSIONS (Detroit) -- The Bush administration will release its proposal on auto emission standards in late afternoon. By Danny Hakim.  NORTHWEST-REPLACEMENTS (Undated) -- In the shadow of one of the most important battles that formed the labor movement, dozens of men are taking part in another historic moment of a completely different time. Each dawn, yellow school buses with brown paper taped over the windows pull up to the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Dearborn, Mich., where the men, replacement workers for Northwest Airlines, get on board. Accompanied by security guards, the men are taken to a back entrance of Detroit's airport, where they are working as mechanics, airplane cleaners, tug drivers and in other jobs replacing striking members of the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association. The replacements, some 1,500 in all, are the critical element in Northwest's sweeping contingency plan to keep operating and redesign its work methods. By Micheline Maynard and Jeremy W. Peters.  KMART-FRAUD (Undated) -- The SEC on Tuesday accused two former top Kmart executives of misleading investors about the company's financial condition in the months preceding its bankruptcy. The agency accused the former chief executive, Charles Conaway, and the former chief financial officer, John McDonald, of making materially false and misleading disclosures about the company's liquidity and related matters in its quarterly report for the quarter ended Oct. 31, 2001. By Louise Story.  ECON-REPORT (Washington) -- Sales of previously owned homes dropped 2.6 percent in July as mortgage rates increased, but even with the decline, sales posted the third-highest level on record. The latest snapshot of housing activity, released by the National Association of Realtors, suggested that the housing market may be cooling a bit but nonetheless remains in healthy shape. The 2.6 percent decline pushed sales down to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.16 million units. By Vikas Bajaj.  ECUADOR-OIL (Undated) -- The government of President Alfredo Palacio in Ecuador, executives from private oil companies operating in the country and local leaders from the Amazon region are seeking to end protests that have cut oil output. The protest leaders, including a number of mayors and regional governors, want the oil companies to pave a road, to provide more jobs to local residents, to buy more local goods and services, and to give 25 percent of income tax and royalty payments directly to local governments. By Juan Forero.  VW-MINIVAN (Frankfurt, Germany) -- Volkswagen plans to introduce a minivan for the U.S. market in cooperation with DaimlerChrysler. By Mark Landler.  INTEL-CHIPS (Undated) -- Intel announces an advance in producing lower-heat chips. By John Markoff.  Editors, the News Service will file these briefs, except when all items are from other news agencies:  In addition, many clients receive condensed versions of 15-20 major news stories, summarized in the TIMES-EXPRESS-BUDGET.  ENTERTAINMENT/ARTS (e unless otherwise indicated)  MOVIE-SLUMP (Los Angeles) -- As the summer movie season ends with the box office take substantially down, a number of studio chiefs are blaming a common culprit: Lousy movies. By Sharon Waxman.  SPECTATOR-THEATER (London) -- Even without dramatic embellishment, the extramarital shenanigans at Britain's Spectator magazine last year constituted a bedroom farce all by themselves. It was as if someone had spiked the water: at various times (and in different permutations) the cast of characters included the editor in chief, a columnist, an associate editor, the receptionist, the publisher and the British home secretary. Not that any of it was secret, either: London's chattery newspapers reveled in all the prurient details, re-christening the magazine the Sextator. Which brings us to the successful new play Who's the Daddy? by Toby Young and Lloyd Evans -- set entirely in the office of Boris Johnson, The Spectator's actual Latin-quoting, mop-haired, shambling editor. By Sarah Lyall.  ROCK-STAR-BOOK-REVIEWS (Undated) -- Room Full of Mirrors: A Biography of Jimi Hendrix (Hyperion) AND Love, Janis, by Laura Joplin (Harper). Reviewed by Janet Maslin.875w.  SPORTS (s code)  CYC-ARMSTRONG-DRUGS (Paris) -- In a major challenge to Lance Armstrong's domination of the Tour de France, the French sports newspaper L'Equipe charged Tuesday that the American rider frequently used an illegal performance-enhancing drug in 1999 to win his first of seven consecutive Tours. Armstrong, 33 years old, who retired July 24 after his latest victory, strongly denied the charge. He has been under suspicion and investigated a handful of times since his comeback in 1999 from testicular cancer, but has never been proven guilty of doping. By Samuel Abt.  DINING (d code)  WINE-TIMES (Undated) -- The fortnightly feature: The Wines of the Times panel drinks Sicilian reds. This package includes an essay on tasters' impressions of the wines, a tabular report rating the wines and a recipe for a dish that goes with the wines. By Eric Asimov.

"160148"	"you"	"can"	" If you want to view this as a corrective action, you can, Senate President Robert E. Travaglini, an East Boston Democrat, told reporters Thursday. He said the decision was based on fairness and it's certainly based on a set of circumstances that at the time was unintended and spontaneous. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"

"167623"	"it"	"can"	" The third hole is a par-3 that is listed on the scorecard at 216 yards. However, it can, and almost certainly will for at least one day, play as long as 243 yards. During his practice rounds there two weeks ago, Phil Mickelson played from the expanded distance and hit a 4-iron -- and then pitched it up to the green from 50 yards away. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"168141"	"we"	"can"	" I think since the House is making a point of having hearings, we can, too, Specter said. The House members have said repeatedly that the Senate is out of touch with what Americans want ... let's have hearings on the Senate provisions and I think when it's more fully understood, Americans will want that. The polls have been moving in our favor on the guest worker program, and I think people don't realize the difficulties of having a big fugitive class in this country, people in hiding. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"168937"	"you"	"can"	" If you aren't, you can, of course, blame your parents. Your level of optimism, Segerstrom says, is determined to the tune of about 25 percent by heredity. But, she says, that's a lower hereditary factor than many other personality measures. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"
"169493"	"you"	"can"	" Then there is the rich residue of the region's czarist past. In Alupka, a pleasant morning's ferry ride from the Yalta docks, you can, before boarding the Ai Petri cable car nearby, visit the spectacular half-Moorish, half-Scottish palace of Crimea's 19th-century governor-general Mikhail S. Vorontsov. The famous Massandra winery -- Crimea is carpeted with vineyards -- east of Yalta is an excellent day trip. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"172050"	"you"	"can"	" In the Piedmont, you can, and should, request your barbecue with brown, the intensely flavored, caramelized outer skin that can only be described as pork candy. Not everyone follows rules. Take Snook's, where Reavis puts her pork, brown and all, through a coarse grinder to wonderful effect. At Village Barbecue, in Elkin, the sandwiches are as saucy as sloppy Joes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
