"14401"	"he"	"wonders"	" It seems to him that Johnson left his estate in chaos intentionally. Why else, he wonders, would the artist have opened his safe deposit box two days before his death -- and then hidden the key? </P> "	"nyt_eng_199502.gz"
"14590"	"he"	"wonders"	" Does the country blame him, he wonders, for Ferguson's explanation that the real shooter stole his gun while he dozed on the train? For Ferguson's often obscure, sometimes harsh questioning of the survivors? Do people realize that although he offers Ferguson advice, Ferguson rarely follows it? </P> "	"nyt_eng_199502.gz"
"17370"	"she"	"wonders"	" ``Where is the public reaction to this?'' Langley asks. Could it be, she wonders, that we're all in shock? One week, orphanages. The next, take away school lunches. Now, scare people away from the courthouse. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"
"18300"	"she"	"wonders"	" Mrs. Sakamoto wonders what little Tatsuhiko is like today, if he is still alive. Is he being given the drugs that the cult is accused of using on believers? And, she wonders, does he call ``Daddy'' a man who killed his real Daddy? </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"

"19268"	"he"	"wonders"	" As Jimmy traverses Queens, he shares with his sullen or cringing passengers a warped world view that revolves, not surprisingly, around MTV. Is it a conspiracy, he wonders, that the names of so many artists played on MTV, like Madonna and Megadeth, begin with ``M''? Or perhaps it should be ``WTV,'' he declares, because he adores ``the women of MTV.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"20827"	"she"	"wonders"	" But, she wonders, is it realistic to think in terms of ever achieving a society without the economic drag and souring promise of Social Security? </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"23348"	"she"	"wonders"	" Allende wastes no time with unnecessary words as she evokes wonderment and humor in one paragraph, tears in the next. She also shares an agonizing dilemma: Should she relinquish her spiritual ties to Paula that seem to keep the young woman breathing, but are unable to transform her vegetative state? Perhaps, she wonders, she ought to help her daughter die instead. It is as though Allende has opened her heart and allowed an audience to peer inside. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"23728"	"he"	"wonders"	" But we began with a reference to the other guy's court, you may recall, which brings up the most interesting thing in Esquire this month, Ron Rosenbaum's ``The Revolt of the Basketball Liberals.'' It is an odd bit of business, at once glib and, however glancingly, profound. The profundity comes from Rosenbaum's eagerness to grapple with what remains, some 219 years after the Declaration of Independence put forth that ``all men are created equal,'' this country's most fundamental problem: race and its discontents. The grappling comes courtesy of Rosenbaum's enthusiasm for the National Basketball Association. That league's rosters are dominated by blacks. Of late (and this is what set him off), the NBA has been getting all sorts of bad press for its players' disagreeable behavior, and the media's hoop screams constitute the revolt in Rosenbaum's title. Can it be, he wonders, ``That what was really going on in the revolt of the Basketball Liberals was an emblematic moment: the collapse of the last attenuated remnant of the dream of integration''? </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"41428"	"he"	"wonders"	" Those contentions don't sit well with O'Dwyer, who played for Northwestern rather than ``football factories like Nebraska.'' Now, he wonders, will his mother have the wrong opinion of him. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"

"56633"	"she"	"wonders"	" In the absence of being able to pull together to fight an identifiable, external threat, Pipher says, family members end up pointing fingers at each other. With stress high and communication low, everyone functions as individuals, not as members of a unit. Whatever happened to family loyalty, she wonders, or family love? </P> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"
"57265"	"he"	"wonders"	" RICHARD THOMPSON: From the English folk songs he treasures, Richard Thompson drew a bitterly unsentimental view of the human condition: a world of hard toil and venal betrayals, where love rarely lasts, loneliness endures, and death is never far away. ``You? Me? Us?'' (Capitol) is a double album, half electric and half acoustic, with 17 new songs. In most of them, love is a thwarted thing; the husky-voiced singer is usually a luckless suitor or a heartbroken ex-lover. In one cheerful Cajun-style tune, with a slip-and-slide guitar solo, he wonders, ``Am I Wasting My Love on You?'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"
"59083"	"he"	"wonders"	" But, he wonders, if they lingered on in out-of-the-way corners of Europe until 28,000 years ago, ``why not 20,000, or 15?'' Then, ``take this one step further,'' he said, ``and picture one last enclave samewhere, left alive today.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"

"63664"	"he"	"wonders"	" Why, he wonders, is that so hard for everyone to understand? ``He likes driving around and just enjoys being Ariel Hernandez,'' said John Hornewer, a Chicago attorney who is close to Hernandez and the Cuban program. ``If somebody offered you a million dollars to walk away from your family, would you do that? Ariel loves being Cuban. It's like saying to an American, `We'll give you a chance to enhance your life but you have to live in Iceland.' Do you go?'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"
"68902"	"she"	"wonders"	" Allen contends that the courts have blurred a line between the judiciary and other branches of government. How, she wonders, can judges take over duties which, by law, are assigned to court clerks? </P> "	"nyt_eng_199608.gz"

"74640"	"he"	"wonders"	" And in the sharpest segment, there are candidates who parade their household pets. Roosevelt had Fala, Nixon had Checkers; Dole has Leader and Clinton has Socks. Klein notes that ``there seems to be some sure-fire thing between politicians and animals.'' Is it that the animals humanize them, he wonders, or do they identify with poor dumb beasts being led around by the nose? </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"
"84861"	"she"	"wonders"	" She eavesdrops like a spy and penetrates the culture more and more deeply. But the question posed so wittily by ``Le Divorce'' is whether Isabel is listening to banalities or embodying them. Is she an American spy or a French one? Early in her affair with Uncle Edgar, she wonders, ``Am I impeded by my crude, direct sexuality from interesting a sophisticated, nuanced lover?'' Her eagerness to connect leaves one to wonder, in her search for an identity, which culture has Isabel finally divorced? </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

"90357"	"she"	"wonders"	" The case may not relate at all, de Braga notes, given the absence of Fallon leukemia cases in the mid-'90s. But if it does, she wonders, might others? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"

"93646"	"he"	"wonders"	" The supervisor understands that his regular job description exempts him from overtime pay requirements under federal wage and hour laws. But is it legal, he wonders, for the employer to refuse to pay him for working the hourly wage-level job? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"

"102065"	"he"	"wonders"	" Next, however, come the questions. Where, Al-Hashimi asks, is the proof that Osama bin Laden and the al-Qaida network are to blame? Will the evidence ever come to light, he wonders, if bin Laden is far more likely to die than he is to stand trial for the Pentagon and World Trade Centers attacks? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"

"125608"	"he"	"wonders"	" He's sharper and more passionate about his work. If the Versailles can afford to hide a million-dollar discrepancy, he wonders, what other shady things are going on? When he is treated dismissively by Silas Bodnick (Jon Polito), the thug who runs the casino, he coolly and insistently asks: ``Do you know why taxes are higher than they should be, why they are a burden to honest people? Do you?'' With dialogue both sincere and comically inflated, he answers his own question. ``Fraud. You. You, sir, are the reason decent people shoulder the albatross of an inequitable tax burden.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"131056"	"she"	"wonders"	" During the next 10 years, she would learn graphically what it meant to have the condition.

"153956"	"she"	"wonders"	" Those words could describe Dufu (who did not participate in the poll). As a newcomer, she can't help comparing Boston with Seattle, where she lived for a decade. Why, she wonders, are interracial couples so much more scarce in Boston, where nearly one-quarter of the population is black, whereas in Seattle, such couples were a dime a dozen, even though the black population is only 8 percent? It's quite a mixed city, and I did not think of it that way till I came to Boston, she says. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"154875"	"he"	"wonders"	" He says he looks forward to some aspects of the move to the Bronx: not freezing in winter, for example, and not paying for so much ice in the summer. Still, he wonders, couldn't the city have built an enclosed market here, alongside exhibitions that celebrated New York's inextricable connection to the water? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"

"157566"	"she"	"wonders"	" Director and writer Scott Derrickson gets extra credit for not trying to lead us all the way to the front pew. Linney is left with many questions, though not a lot of answers, and the movie's closing is a redemption for storytelling.

Here's where the film starts showing its teeth. Rhett's one of those earnestly crunchy young men who loves to lecture people on their insensitivity while remaining blind to his new-age caddishness. Why bother with a puffy chair, he wonders, when the brothers can be their own surprise gift to dad? He has a point, but he's still insufferable. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
