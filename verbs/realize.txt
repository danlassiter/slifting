Stories are moving in category shown at end of each budget item.  Lifestyle, Entertainment  INDIAN _ undated _ MOVIES: Based on a prize-winning children's book by Lynne Reid Banks, ``The Indian in the Cupboard'' is another splendid summer-movie surprise _ a kid's fantasy that will captivate adults as well. (e)  MIGHTY MORPHIN _ undated _ MOVIES: The subtext of most summer flicks is this: You've seen the movie, now buy the toys. The one novelty about ``Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' is that it reverses the formula. (e)  THE-POSTMAN _ undated _ MOVIES: Just as ``Cinema Paradiso'' is a tale of friendship built on a love for film, ``The Postman'' is a tale of a friendship built on a love for language. The fact that both movies are Italian-made is surely not by chance. Chalk it up to that Mediterranean passion for life. (e)  APOLLO-13 _ undated _ MOVIES: Despite being shrouded in technical jargon, the palm-sweating drama never bogs down because the movie stays focused on the personal heroics of the crew, the harrowing ordeal of their families and the brainpower and determination of the space center techno-nerds. (e)  National  MATTER _ undated _ A new state of matter, with properties fundamentally different from those of solids, liquids and gases, has been produced in a Colorado laboratory _ a feat scientists hail as a major breakthrough in modern physics. The bizarre new state of matter, at which atoms are virtually frozen in their tracks, forms only at temperatures colder than those that occur in the darkest and most remote reaches of interstellar space. (a)  HIV _ undated _ The nation needs stronger leadership and a more cohesive system to respond rapidly when the blood supply is threatened by emerging or unknown infectious diseases, according to a report from an Institute of Medicine committee. That conclusion is based on a year-long review of events that led to contamination of the blood supply by HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, in the early and middle 1980s. A lack of leadership, slow decision making by several federal health agencies and conflicts of interest due to the involvement of private blood banks were some of the shortcomings cited in the report. (a)  OLY-PARALYMPIC _ ATLANTA _ By the time the 1996 Paralympic Games open 399 days from Friday, the sports movement for the world's top disabled athletes will be as familiar to the public as the Olympics. At least that is the goal of an aggressive marketing campaign unveiled Thursday by the Atlanta Paralympic Organizing Committee. Developed by advertising whiz Joey Reiman and his Bright House advertising agency, the ads are designed to grab the public's attention and invoke pride, not sympathy, for disabled jocks. One print ad featuring Atlanta long jumper Al Mead, who won a silver medal in long jump in the Barcelona Paralympics, reads: ``Al Mead has one leg. He uses it to kick butt.'' (a)  OLY-ECON _ ATLANTA _ Yes, the Georgia economy will slow down after the Olympic torch burns out. And yes, some people will lose their jobs. But both economists and business leaders predicted Thursday that the pain following the 1996 Games will be mild, while the gains will be felt by employers and workers for years to come. Atlanta, that wannabe international city, may finally get its wish. (a)  OLY-ROUGHTON-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ Over the next week, we're going to hear a lot from Billy Payne. He's going to be telling us all that the Atlanta Games are humming happily along as we turn the corner into the final year, thank you. When yo u hear that, quietly chant two words: Sinking dorms. (a)  CORONER _ CLARKSDALE, Miss. _ Like all good undertakers, Charles Scott and Scotty Meredith understand the importance of a good impression. Indiscretion, they realize, is the final nail in the coffin of any mortician's career. So outwardly serene are these two men that people here in Coahoma County, the heart of the Mississippi Delta, confess mild shock _ tempered by hilarity _ at the recent spectacle the two morticians have made of themselves. Undertakers do have pulses after all. (a)  Sports  RACEYOURCAR _ ATLANTA _ While other stock car racing divisions _ including NASCAR's Winston Cup Series _ feature cars that are stock in appearance only, spectator racers drive their cars to the track, and to work, and to the store, and sometimes to pick blackberries. (s)  OLY-KAYAK _ WESSER, N.C. _ There I was, jammed between my kayak and a big rock, icy water pouring over me and the roar of the rapids in my ears. Within a few minutes, I was wobbling onto the rocky bank and thinking: ``People die in this sport.'' It was not the best way to start my first full day in a kayak on a whitewater river. (s)  BRADLEY-COLUMN _ undated _ I understand that Monica Seles is frightened. If somebody stuck a knife in my back, I'd be, too. I could understand if Seles never played tennis or appeared in public again. To me, this would seem a not- unreasonable response. But here's the part I don't get: I don't understand why she should be ranked No. 1. (s)  PREP-(2takes) _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Is the three-sport athlete disappearing? (s)  STRAWBERRY _ COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Darryl Strawberry cuts an imposing figure _ even in a baseball uniform. Wound tightly at 6-foot-6 and 215 pounds, the newest Yankee Clipper possesses a lean, powerful look with bulging biceps and shaved head.  Strawberry is 33, but doesn't look it, despite all the poison he's placed in his body over the years. And even though he's on the verge of playing in his 13th major league season, even though he needs just six home runs to become the 68th player to reach the 300 plateau, the eight-time National League All-Star with the New York Mets is really starting over. (s)  MOTOCROSS _ DAYTON, Ohio _ The fans who attend Sunday's American Motorcyclist Association Pro National race at Kenworthy's Motocross Park may be sweltering if the heat wave continues. So will rider Mike Brown. But he'll be grinning, too. ``If it's hot, that could be an advantage for the guys from the East,'' he said. ``The guys from California aren't used to the type of humidity we have back here. We are.'' (s)  Business  ROODOO _ ALPHARETTA, Ga. _ Debbie and Roger Nelson, owners of Twin Oaks Farm in Alpharetta, have come up with an exotic sideline to boost their wildlife preservation efforts. On Saturday, they begin selling a new product they hope will scoop the fertilizer market _ ``Roo Doo.'' It's composted kangaroo manure, and it's not from Australia. (f)  INVEST-LUXURY-HOMES _ ATLANTA _ In a series of unusual transactions over the past 16 months, secretive investor Mohammad Sharif has purchased several luxury residences in northwest Atlanta _ including the lavish Lionheart estate _ and he's shopping for more. (f)  Commentary  MINTER-COLUMN _ INMAN, Ga. _ Those of us who grew up in the rural South like to think we are different from other people. I guess we are, although rural probably means the same in Iowa and Indiana as it does in Atlanta and Georgia. (The writer, former editor of the newspapers in the nearby city, reveals his opinion of ``Bridges of Madison County'' and the high moral tone of its aging adulterers later  in this piece.)

It's been 50 years since the reports of a spacecraft crash and a real, live alien recovery in this city. But Roswell is just figuring out how to cash in on its notoriety as a universal travel destination. By RICHARD RUELAS. Photos available. Story will move in the ``A'' category.  COP EAT (undated) Forget the free doughnuts and scratch the cut-rate cups of coffee. If police pay as they go, what are their choices for sometimes-short and often-interrupted food breaks?

Story will move in the ``E'' category.  OFF RAMP (Undated) Dear Co-Highness: Sorry about the vague greeting, but we pesky American reporters are not allowed to know your name or anything about you. We understand you're one of two wives of wealthy King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. We heard that you came to Phoenix about a year ago for surgery and that you've been living in Paradise Valley. We've been told it's a cultural taboo in Saudi Arabia to ask about you. Still, money blabs when it's showered on Americans unaccustomed to generous tips. Here's some econdhand stories we've heard. By BETTY BEARD. Story will move in the ``L'' category.  LOWE (undated) When my in-laws, John and Sophie Dimon, came to Arizona for a visit four years ago, I learned that John likes to hang out at flea markets, so I hauled him down to Park 'n' Swap. ``It's pretty big,'' I warned him, ``so we may not get everything looked at.'' (This is incorrect English, I realize, but it's common terminology among flea marketists because it lends credibility to such important flea-market phrases as ``Wudja look at that!'') By SAM LOWE.

But something changed. Somewhere along the line, shopping became something more than a necessity. Somehow, it became _ dare I say it _ an (ital) addiction. By BILL GODDYKOONTZ. Story will move in the ``L'' category.  AIRPORT (Phoenix) Football fans who touch down at Phoenix-Sky Harbor International Airport in January will dream of an entirely different kind of touchdown: the kind where a referee raises both arms in the air and half the stadium screams for joy. ``Touchdown at Sky Harbor,'' a multimedia exhibit of art mostly by Arizona artists, will fill exhibit cases throughout the airport. Some displays have been installed, others begin appearing in mid-October. By LYNN PYNE. Story will move in the ``L'' category. (For use by N.Y.

"43243"	"we"	"realize"	" Despite the moment's shocking barrenness, we realize, of course, that it's Nixon who's through, about to be buried politically in the grave he dug for himself with his lies about Watergate. Allen is a wonderful Pat Nixon, encased in her '50s model of dutiful wifeliness. She's tougher than he is, more of a survivor, with none of his self-pity. In their private life, he's afraid of her. After she threatens divorce, and he promises to give up politics, only to reverse himself, she looks him in the eye and asks him if he's sure this is really what he wants. ``Uh, yeah,'' he says, brightening, persuading himself as he says the words, jaw firming as the wish is voiced. A lot of Nixon's bluster comes out sounding as if he's trying to persuade himself that if he sounds tough, he'll be tough, that the image will become the reality. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"

Noriega wrote in At Random, his publisher's newsletter, that watching TV has given him ``a window on American popular culture.''  ``I know about the U.S. political elections and about Colin Powell and Lady Di,'' said Noriega, ``and those all-important staples of U.S. culture, the Wild Horse Saloon and line dancing on TNN, the Country Music Network.'' (Personals, being not as hip as Noriega, is at a loss to identify the Wild Horse Saloon.)  He said he had learned by watching favorable reports on Colin Powell that American TV ``is a recitation of hollow moral truths that are little followed in practice at home.''  Noriega said he wasn't going to ``play favorites'' by naming his favorite movie, but did want to mention that his daughter, Sandra, had worked as an assistant on Oliver Stone's ``Nixon.''  He said he'd lately read ``The House of the Spirits'' by Isabel Allende; ``The Looking Glass War'' by John le Carre; ``Destination Unknown'' by Agatha Christie; ``The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success'' by Deepak Chopra; ``The Chancellor Manuscript'' by Robert Ludlum; ``The Trojan Horse'' by J.J. Benitez; ``Mathematics and the Physical World'' by Morris Kleaver;and ``Playing With the Infinite'' by Rosa Petol.  ``All these books notwithstanding,'' he wrote, ``the Bible is always at my side. God is my great companion and teacher.''  PRINCE IS LABELED A KILLER  Reports in Britain last week that Prince William, 14, had shot his first stag on a hunt with his dad in the Scottish Highlands enraged animal rights advocates.  ``It is absolutely disgusting that any father should take his young son to shoot and kill an animal,'' said Les Ward, director of Advocates for Animals, which is based in Edinburgh. Ward said that William's hands ``are awash with blood. It goes against public opinion and shows a total disrespect for animal life.''  Tiggy Legge-Bourke, the aide Prince Charles has entrusted with the care of Prince William and Prince Harry in the absence of their mother, is said to have helped them practice their shooting skills by killing rabbits and crows. Charles loves to hunt.  HOW THEY DO IT  Asking a waiter about the ingredients in a dish on the menu is, you realize, terribly uncool.  A ``hostess at a prominent local restaurant'' told Focus magazine's Aimee Grove that the rich and famous, Demi Moore, for one, have aides ``call ahead to make sure no matter what they order at the table, their food will not be cooked with any oil or cream.''  PRODUCT PLACEMENT IS EVERYTHING  Think O.J. Simpson, think commercial possibilities. A list of products mentioned in the latest Simpson court proceedings has been provided by the New York Times:  Bruno Magli shoes, which left an imprint at the murder scene; Aris Isotoner gloves, one of which was found outside Simpson's house; Callaway golf clubs, used by Simpson the night of the murder; McDonald's, the dining establishment visited by Simpson and Kato Kaelin; the Bentley automobile, as driven by Simpson; the Ford Bronco, as driven by Simpson; a Rolex watch owned by Simpson.  ``We feel certain that it has raised awareness,'' said Istoner's Nancy Young of the product being mentioned in court. ``Whether or not that will translate into increased sales, we're going to have to wait and see.''  BUST OF BARDOT IS REMOVED FROM PUBLIC DISPLAY  The mayor of Quimper, a French city known for beautiful pottery and socialist politics, has removed four busts of Marianne, symbol of the French republic, from public display, because they were modeled on the face of Brigitte Bardot.  Bardot, who is married to a close adviser to National Front party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, recently expressed her support for Jean- Marie Chevallier, mayor of Toulon. Chevallier recently refused to honor a Jewish writer at an annual book fair in Toulon.  ``Brigitte Bardot once incarnated the liberated woman: carefree, young and beautiful,'' said Jean- Jacques Orvoas of the office of the mayor in Quimper. ``Today, she has come to symbolize rejection, exclusion.''  Bardot's busts became officially obsolete years ago, when her image as Marianne was replaced by that of Catherine Deneuve. Orvoas said the busts will be stored in an empty office.

He said he'd lately read ``The House of the Spirits'' by Isabel Allende; ``The Looking Glass War'' by John le Carre; ``Destination Unknown'' by Agatha Christie; ``The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success'' by Deepak Chopra; ``The Chancellor Manuscript'' by Robert Ludlum; ``The Trojan Horse'' by J.J. Benitez; ``Mathematics and the Physical World'' by Morris Kleaver;and ``Playing With the Infinite'' by Rosa Petol.  ``All these books notwithstanding,'' he wrote, ``the Bible is always at my side. God is my great companion and teacher.''  PRINCE IS LABELED A KILLER  Reports in Britain last week that Prince William, 14, had shot his first stag on a hunt with his dad in the Scottish Highlands enraged animal rights advocates.  ``It is absolutely disgusting that any father should take his young son to shoot and kill an animal,'' said Les Ward, director of Advocates for Animals, which is based in Edinburgh. Ward said that William's hands ``are awash with blood. It goes against public opinion and shows a total disrespect for animal life.''  Tiggy Legge-Bourke, the aide Prince Charles has entrusted with the care of Prince William and Prince Harry in the absence of their mother, is said to have helped them practice their shooting skills by killing rabbits and crows. Charles loves to hunt.  HOW THEY DO IT  Asking a waiter about the ingredients in a dish on the menu is, you realize, terribly uncool.  A ``hostess at a prominent local restaurant'' told Focus magazine's Aimee Grove that the rich and famous, Demi Moore, for one, have aides ``call ahead to make sure no matter what they order at the table, their food will not be cooked with any oil or cream.''  PRODUCT PLACEMENT IS EVERYTHING  Think O.J. Simpson, think commercial possibilities. A list of products mentioned in the latest Simpson court proceedings has been provided by the New York Times:  Bruno Magli shoes, which left an imprint at the murder scene; Aris Isotoner gloves, one of which was found outside Simpson's house; Callaway golf clubs, used by Simpson the night of the murder; McDonald's, the dining establishment visited by Simpson and Kato Kaelin; the Bentley automobile, as driven by Simpson; the Ford Bronco, as driven by Simpson; a Rolex watch owned by Simpson.  ``We feel certain that it has raised awareness,'' said Istoner's Nancy Young of the product being mentioned in court. ``Whether or not that will translate into increased sales, we're going to have to wait and see.''  BUST OF BARDOT IS REMOVED FROM PUBLIC DISPLAY  The mayor of Quimper, a French city known for beautiful pottery and socialist politics, has removed four busts of Marianne, symbol of the French republic, from public display, because they were modeled on the face of Brigitte Bardot.  Bardot, who is married to a close adviser to National Front party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, recently expressed her support for Jean- Marie Chevallier, mayor of Toulon. Chevallier recently refused to honor a Jewish writer at an annual book fair in Toulon.  ``Brigitte Bardot once incarnated the liberated woman: carefree, young and beautiful,'' said Jean- Jacques Orvoas of the office of the mayor in Quimper. ``Today, she has come to symbolize rejection, exclusion.''  Bardot's busts became officially obsolete years ago, when her image as Marianne was replaced by that of Catherine Deneuve. Orvoas said the busts will be stored in an empty office.

TRACKING HOLIDAY BUSINESS  2. FROM HEARST: ``CRYING FOR JUSTICE'' SERIES  3. ONE MOTHER'S SONOGRAM ORDEAL  4. EXCLUSIVELY FROM THE TIMES  5. HAPPY THANKSGIVING!  1. TRACKING HOLIDAY BUSINESS  As the holiday shopping season kicks off Friday, Bloomberg Business News will be watching for signs of how retailers are faring. For many stores, this period accounts for about half their annual sales and profit, so these signals are critical.  On Monday, Bloomberg launched a twice-weekly column, HOLIDAY-SALES-WATCH-BLOOM, that will monitor sales trends, retail performance, and company and analyst comments. We'll list this feature on the holiday advisory that we move on Tuesdays so that you'll be sure to catch it. For a repeat of Monday's story, call 212-556-1927.  2. FROM HEARST: ``CRYING FOR JUSTICE'' SERIES  Tony Freemantle of the Houston Chronicle has written a powerful four-part series on human rights abuses in Rwanda, South Africa, El Salvador and Guatemala. The accompanying photographs, which were sent to NYT photo clients, are equally compelling. For retransmission of the articles, call 212-556-1927. To make individual purchase of a photo, call 212-556-4204.  The series includes the following articles:  _ Part 1: CRYJUSTICE-OVERVIEW-HNS (Gikongoro, Rwanda) _ Emanuel Murangiyra stares at the corpses laid out row after row on the floor of Kibeho College, his eyes crying for justice for victims of the genocide that gripped Rwanda 2 and a half years ago. In the last 50 years, millions of innocent people have been traumatized by crimes against humanity. Now, calls for a permanent international criminal court are growing. W/CRYJUSTICE-TRUTH-HNS and CRYJUSTICE-COURT-HNS.W/five color photos.  _ Part 2: CRYJUSTICE-SAFRICA-HNS (Soweto, South Africa) _ South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission is hearing a chorus of thousands of voices tell about the country's murky past. It started as a trickle, but recently the trickle became a flood, exposing the darkest corners of the apartheid system to the light of scrutiny. W/CRYJUSTICE-SAFRICA-TRUTH-HNS, CRYJUSTICE-SAFRICA-SCHOON-HNS and CRYJUSTICE-SAFRICA-BIKO-HNS. W/two color photos.  _ PART 3: CRYJUSTICE-EL-SALVADOR-HNS (Chalatenango, El Salvador) _ The signs of war, the roadblocks, the guns are gone from El Salvador. But many here believe that a real peace does not yet exist, especially after the government declared a blanket amnesty letting human rights abuses escape unpunished. W/one color photo.  _ PART 4: CRYJUSTICE-FUTURE-HNS (Las Canoas, Guatemala) _ Fourteen years ago, Guatemalan soldiers rousted the inhabitants of this hamlet, randomly selected 14 men, and executed them. Peace is now imminent in Guatemala. But the questions arise: Why should people believe that this time peace will last? W/one color photo.  3. ONE MOTHER'S SONOGRAM ORDEAL  Natalie Angier, The Times' science reporter who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1991 for beat reporting, describes her heart-wrenching experience with a routine sonogram in a story that moved on Monday, Nov. 25.  Although her amniocentesis revealed no genetic abnormalities, her sonogram a few weeks later appeared to show that her baby had a deformed foot. Two repeat sonograms confirmed the diagnosis. As it turned out, her baby had no deformity at all. But the ordeal caused her to explore the value of these routine tests: ``While genetic testing in particular has generated a squall of debate over its ethical, legal and psychic implications, many of the same questions are raised by more widespread technologies like ultrasound. Among them: How do you interpret equivocal or confusing results, and how does a patient react to a test's inherent uncertainty? What do you do _ what can you do _ with bad news once you have received it? Most important is the taint of eugenics surrounding many of these screens: How perfect must a person be to deserve health insurance, a job, a parent's love, or life itself?''  Angier reports that at least 70 percent of all pregnant woman have at least one sonogram, although experts are widely divided about the value of the test as a routine screen. Angier's provocative story is slugged SONOGRAM-SCI-NYT. For a repeat, call 212-556-1927.  4. EXCLUSIVELY FROM THE TIMES  As usual, The Times had several outstanding scoops this week, including:  _ Robert Pear's report that President Clinton wants Congress to soften welfare cuts, which moved Tuesday.  _ Philip Shenon's in-depth article on two new government studies that show for the first time that veterans of the 1991 Persian Gulf war are more likely to suffer from serious health problems than troops who did not serve in the war. The story moved Monday.  _ Nicholas Wade's news feature about an acclaimed medical reference book that may have used concentration camp victims for the models for the book's finely detailed anatomical drawings. The story moved Monday.  _ The Times' staff's coverage of the demise of New Jersey's fugitive prosecutor, Nicholas Bissell, starting with a profile that moved Sunday and news coverage of his suicide, which moved Tuesday. ``I can't do 10 years,'' he said as he pulled the trigger. Bissell's final words appeared exclusively in The Times.  5. HAPPY THANKSGIVING!

TRACKING HOLIDAY BUSINESS  2. FROM HEARST: ``CRYING FOR JUSTICE'' SERIES  3. ONE MOTHER'S SONOGRAM ORDEAL  4. EXCLUSIVELY FROM THE TIMES  5. HAPPY THANKSGIVING!  1. TRACKING HOLIDAY BUSINESS  As the holiday shopping season kicks off Friday, Bloomberg Business News will be watching for signs of how retailers are faring. For many stores, this period accounts for about half their annual sales and profit, so these signals are critical.  On Monday, Bloomberg launched a twice-weekly column, HOLIDAY-SALES-WATCH-BLOOM, that will monitor sales trends, retail performance, and company and analyst comments. We'll list this feature on the holiday advisory that we move on Tuesdays so that you'll be sure to catch it. For a repeat of Monday's story, call 212-556-1927.  2. FROM HEARST: ``CRYING FOR JUSTICE'' SERIES  Tony Freemantle of the Houston Chronicle has written a powerful four-part series on human rights abuses in Rwanda, South Africa, El Salvador and Guatemala. The accompanying photographs, which were sent to NYT photo clients, are equally compelling. For retransmission of the articles, call 212-556-1927. To make individual purchase of a photo, call 212-556-4204.  The series includes the following articles:  _ Part 1: CRYJUSTICE-OVERVIEW-HNS (Gikongoro, Rwanda) _ Emanuel Murangiyra stares at the corpses laid out row after row on the floor of Kibeho College, his eyes crying for justice for victims of the genocide that gripped Rwanda 2 and a half years ago. In the last 50 years, millions of innocent people have been traumatized by crimes against humanity. Now, calls for a permanent international criminal court are growing. W/CRYJUSTICE-TRUTH-HNS and CRYJUSTICE-COURT-HNS.W/five color photos.  _ Part 2: CRYJUSTICE-SAFRICA-HNS (Soweto, South Africa) _ South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission is hearing a chorus of thousands of voices tell about the country's murky past. It started as a trickle, but recently the trickle became a flood, exposing the darkest corners of the apartheid system to the light of scrutiny. W/CRYJUSTICE-SAFRICA-TRUTH-HNS, CRYJUSTICE-SAFRICA-SCHOON-HNS and CRYJUSTICE-SAFRICA-BIKO-HNS. W/two color photos.  _ PART 3: CRYJUSTICE-EL-SALVADOR-HNS (Chalatenango, El Salvador) _ The signs of war, the roadblocks, the guns are gone from El Salvador. But many here believe that a real peace does not yet exist, especially after the government declared a blanket amnesty letting human rights abuses escape unpunished. W/one color photo.  _ PART 4: CRYJUSTICE-FUTURE-HNS (Las Canoas, Guatemala) _ Fourteen years ago, Guatemalan soldiers rousted the inhabitants of this hamlet, randomly selected 14 men, and executed them. Peace is now imminent in Guatemala. But the questions arise: Why should people believe that this time peace will last? W/one color photo.  3. ONE MOTHER'S SONOGRAM ORDEAL  Natalie Angier, The Times' science reporter who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1991 for beat reporting, describes her heart-wrenching experience with a routine sonogram in a story that moved on Monday, Nov. 25.  Although her amniocentesis revealed no genetic abnormalities, her sonogram a few weeks later appeared to show that her baby had a deformed foot. Two repeat sonograms confirmed the diagnosis. As it turned out, her baby had no deformity at all. But the ordeal caused her to explore the value of these routine tests: ``While genetic testing in particular has generated a squall of debate over its ethical, legal and psychic implications, many of the same questions are raised by more widespread technologies like ultrasound. Among them: How do you interpret equivocal or confusing results, and how does a patient react to a test's inherent uncertainty? What do you do _ what can you do _ with bad news once you have received it? Most important is the taint of eugenics surrounding many of these screens: How perfect must a person be to deserve health insurance, a job, a parent's love, or life itself?''  Angier reports that at least 70 percent of all pregnant woman have at least one sonogram, although experts are widely divided about the value of the test as a routine screen. Angier's provocative story is slugged SONOGRAM-SCI-NYT. For a repeat, call 212-556-1927.  4. EXCLUSIVELY FROM THE TIMES  As usual, The Times had several outstanding scoops this week, including:  _ Robert Pear's report that President Clinton wants Congress to soften welfare cuts, which moved Tuesday.  _ Philip Shenon's in-depth article on two new government studies that show for the first time that veterans of the 1991 Persian Gulf war are more likely to suffer from serious health problems than troops who did not serve in the war. The story moved Monday.  _ Nicholas Wade's news feature about an acclaimed medical reference book that may have used concentration camp victims for the models for the book's finely detailed anatomical drawings. The story moved Monday.  _ The Times' staff's coverage of the demise of New Jersey's fugitive prosecutor, Nicholas Bissell, starting with a profile that moved Sunday and news coverage of his suicide, which moved Tuesday. ``I can't do 10 years,'' he said as he pulled the trigger. Bissell's final words appeared exclusively in The Times.  5. HAPPY THANKSGIVING!  Because of early holiday deadlines this week, advisories for travel, personal finance, children and family life, celebrities and health packages moved on Wednesday. We'll repeat the advisories again on Friday, just in case you missed them. Or call us at 212-556-1927 and we'll send you what you need.

"83670"	"you"	"realize"	" In no time, she finds herself in the middle of a crossfire. Bailed out by Christian antiabortionists, she's latched onto by Mary Kay Place's bunny-sweatshirted baby-saver and her amusingly creepy husband, played by Kurtwood Smith, and taken into their home. Although drenched in prayer, the home is filled with tightness and hate, scarcely disguised by Place's rigor mortis-like grin of false happiness. But just when you think director Alexander Payne is out to do a number on the antiabortionists, Ruth is spirited off by a pair of lesbian pro-choice activists, Kelly Preston, and Swoosie Kurtz's Frieda Kahlo-shirted militant. The film isn't lampooning abortion, you realize, but the fanaticism on both sides of the issue. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"83671"	"you"	"realize"	" This, you realize, may just save her in this comedy that has the brass to declare that redeeming qualities are not necessarily the stuff of which longevity is made, especially when she's about to become a football in a game between attitude-meisters who don't care a bit about her except insofar as she can serve their ends. Indeed, the film's funniest scene comes when she sneaks out and gets high with the baby-savers' pent-up teen-aged daughter. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"88357"	"we"	"realize"	" Pacino's Lefty Ruggiero, in fact, is more complex and more appealing than his Michael Corleone, partly because he's so powerless. A veteran of 30 years of taking orders and executant of 26 hits, Lefty not only is broke, but he can't help noticing he's always passed over for promotions. Although faithful to his nervous wife, his home life is at best flavorless and at worst painful when he learns his grown son is a drug addict. From his fellow wiseguys he has acceptance, but not respect because they know he's going nowhere in the mob hierarchy. His life is pitifully circumscribed, consisting of hanging out inside the bar the guys call headquarters or outside on its curb. The black and white freeze frames of the guys on the curb over the opening credits, we realize, are being taken by surveillance cameras. Which means the walls of Lefty's world are about to close in even more. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"91329"	"you"	"realize"	" All these foods and flowers, which we're accustomed to regarding as merely the objects of our desire, are also, you realize, acting on us, getting us to do things for them they can't do for themselves. So who's really domesticating whom? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"

"96447"	"you"	"realize"	" ``Now, after all these years, you realize, it did mean something. This putting the pictures up, for everyone to see in the future, dadgumit, it does mean something. And it always will.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"
"96603"	"you"	"realize"	" ``Looking at those guys after the game, you realize, `Hey, these kids could be in a war,' '' said BC junior running back William Green, who rushed 33 times for 178 yards and scored a pair of touchdowns. The first came on a 58-yard run in the first play of the second quarter, the second on a 13-yard pass from St. Pierre just before halftime, the latter score breaking open a tight game by making it 28-14. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"
"99510"	"you"	"realize"	" As a team, they go to pieces with balletic exactitude, acting out the professional and personal disintegration of a scrappy English troupe touring in a mediocre sex farce. For theatergoers in New York, the brave and beleaguered world capital of control freaks on the verge, this disciplined rendering of chaos starts to feel like an exorcism. There was a reason, you realize, that the meticulously frantic ``I Love Lucy'' was so beloved in the atomic age. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"106680"	"they"	"realize"	" Kilbourne, a 5-foot-6, 175-pound forward, said people do double takes when she tells them her sport. ``They go, `Whoa, you're not like this huge burly man,''' Kilbourne said. ``They think we're going to look like wrestlers, like 6-foot-7 and `Grrrrrr.' Then when they hear what we like to do in our off time, they realize, `These are girls. These are ladies. These are not boys stuck in girls' bodies.''' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"

"108536"	"you"	"realize"	" ``They're great musicians, and they're really well-rounded people, which is hard to find in this industry, nearly impossible,'' Kelis said. ``They're not just making beats to sell records. They have a very particular sound, but they're even more particular with me. And when you get to really know them, you realize, they're hilarious, they're weird, they're quirky and crazy and bizarre _ and me too, so it works out.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"120202"	"we"	"realize"	" There is a violent and exuberant climax that enmeshes the castle with the ghetto. There are heroic deaths and a variety of ingeniously encouraging individual endings. The main ending is stunning: as Yossel tragically blossoms, we realize, Rudolph has been receding all the while into golemlike mud. Rochel grows old and wise. She writes books. Her face, by Sherwood's description, resembles her own jacket photograph. Why shouldn't an author have her personal golem, particularly when she uses it so well? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"
"120231"	"you"	"realize"	" A walk through the exhibits seems exotic, until the exotic reminds you of the familiar. The festival, you realize, is framed by an Egyptian obelisk at one end _ the Washington Monument _ and domes at the Natural History Museum and the Capitol that evoke the mosques and minarets now on the Mall. In a world of international tensions, it is comforting to be reminded that the Silk Route enabled Delft porcelain from the Netherlands to borrow patterns brought from China, to see that the ``tree of life'' is a symbol of both the Muslim and Hindu cultures and to observe Muslim refugees from Afghanistan, now living in Pakistan, at work creating miniature Buddhist sculptures in the shadow of a large re-creation of the Bamiyan Buddhas that were destroyed by the Taliban a few years ago. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"

"127173"	"I"	"realize"	" Said Hurtgen, ``The parties realize, I realize, everybody realizes the pressure on the economy because of the shutdown of the ports. ... We will leave no stone unturned in an effort to get an agreement here.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"129384"	"they"	"realize"	" CNN-ABC-MEDIA (Undated) _ Within the next few weeks, executives of ABC News and CNN expect to renew discussions about forming a joint news operation, executives with knowledge of the talks said Friday. Between CNN's vast, international reach and ABC's broadcast network and big-name stars, they realize, the result would be a news organization of unrivaled size. All this would make CBS News the last of the old-line, grand network news divisions without a cable partner. By Jim Rutenberg. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"129389"	"they"	"realize"	" Although both sides said the odds that an agreement will be reached are no higher than 50-50, executives from the two organizations said their desire to merge has only grown since news of the talks broke last month. Given CNN's vast, international reach and ABC's broadcast network and big-name stars, they realize, the end result would be a news organization of unrivaled size. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"135370"	"I"	"realize"	" ``At that point, I realize, `Boy, I'm really, really mad at these guys.' It's going to take a while to restore the confidence of that investor.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"135611"	"they"	"realize"	" A few hours later I viewed another artistic treatment of 9/11, playing in another reconstructed ruin of the city, 42nd Street. Neil LaBute's ``The Mercy Seat'' is a play about a World Trade Center office worker (Liev Schreiber) who had fatefully delayed his arrival at work on Sept. 11 to have sex with his boss (Sigourney Weaver) a few blocks away. Now it's the morning after. The couple faithfully characterize the attack as ``horrific ... a complete and utter tragedy ... beyond belief ... biblical.'' But it might also, they realize, be an opportunity, ``a meal ticket'' _ a chance for the guy to ditch his wife and two daughters to take up for keeps with his mistress. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"138232"	"I"	"realize"	" Back in 1972 when I picked up my diploma, tossed that square cap in the air and closed the door of my metal locker for the last time, I thought I was finished with high school for good. All of a sudden, I realize, I'm doing it all over again. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200308.gz"
"138233"	"I"	"realize"	" And, I realize, it isn't any better the second time around. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200308.gz"
"138981"	"they"	"realize"	" Swell. Knowing they've behaved badly, Holmgren's players acknowledge the new urgency. What should have been a team with a lock on the playoffs, they realize, is now a team locked in high anxiety, looking over its shoulder at teams that were eating dust a few weeks ago. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200312.gz"
"150772"	"I"	"realize"	" I'm purposely ambiguous, I realize, Brown said, but the moment I explain something fully, the level of amazement disappears. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"153174"	"I"	"realize"	" With summer fast approaching, I could procrastinate no longer. I excused myself early from work several days running, lugged home armloads of books, and ensconced myself poolside, perusing book after book. My research techniques are exacting, I realize, but how am I to recommend what's beachworthy if I don't read the books in the right setting, I ask you? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"156203"	"I"	"realize"	" But while working on Lunar Park, he reread the earlier book and saw it in a new light. When I got to the violence sequences, I was incredibly upset and shocked, he said, in a surprising public retreat. I can't believe that I wrote that. Looking back, I realize, 'God, you really sort of stepped over a line there.' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"162013"	"you"	"realize"	" You get to college and you're in a program like that where they teach you all about the little things that make you a good player. After you learn about offense and defense, you realize, 'Hey, I didn't know anything. I was just running around with the ball on offense, and I was just tackling the guy with the ball on defense.' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"170410"	"I"	"realize"	" All of a sudden, I realize, there are people looking over my shoulder, Jainschigg said. But although I do paint some fun stuff like little pretty landscapes, the occasional stuffed animal or a bug, I like to paint what I'm trying to learn. I was doing study after study of skeletons for a while when I was trying to master anatomy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"172076"	"you"	"realize"	" Much more effective is the sequence, late in the film, in which the writer tells the same horrific anecdote about Smith to a succession of his wealthy friends and coolly checks off the variation that gets the best response. That's broad but it's brutal, and it effectively shows Capote editing emotion right out of his life.

The title of his book, you realize, applies to him. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172820"	"I"	"realize"	" The Greek side gives me my hedonism, my penchant for the ocean, my love of food and overly strenuous circle dancing. It is 50 percent of my brain and heart and blood and bones, and in this situation, I realize, it could be my salvation. This, it occurs to me, is one of the great virtues of intermarriage: call it hybrid vigor. I sit, banging my heels softly against the base of the examining table, willing my Greek side to kick in. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"173404"	"I"	"realize"	" For just a second there I thought maybe I was the only one who wasn't getting it, but the rest of the class, I realize, is no more enlightened than I. One of the older women is sorting out what she's heard and asks if it ever occurred to him to call a lady and ask for a date. Josh says yeah but he doesn't do that because he's too shy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
