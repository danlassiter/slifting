Kidnap ransoms and guard duty for drug traffickers make guerrillas less ideological and more profit-oriented.By James Brooke.  HTK HONG Gargan 45, pix, graphic NRNS As Hong Kong awaits the takeover by China from Britain in two years, some feel that it will hardly alter people's lives, but others think that it will change their lives forever. The assessment depends entirely on who is doing the talking. By   HTK GAY Specter 37, pix NRNS  Gay life in Russia today is a study in contradictions. While there are some liberties that until recently could not even have been imagined, the fears and strains of living in the society are still great.

CAMPING Olympic Nat Park Egan 30'' The camper was unhappy with the condition of Yellowstone Park. The roads, he complained, were so bumpy that he had to hold onto the VCR to keep the tape tracking.

The canvas tents of once quiet campgrounds have given way to seas of fiberglass, flickering televisions, and ringing telephones.  $PHILLY Philadelphia Uchitelle 2,700 wds The ``Philadelphia Plan,'' American labor's longest-running experiment in affirmative action is faltering. More than a quarter-century after the Federal Government set about trying to break the white monopoly in this city's construction industry, a weak economy and white resistance are eroding the program's initial gains. The backsliding has become another symptom of the national decline of affirmative action, once viewed by blacks and other minorities as a Federal commitment to their economic progress but now seen increasingly as a lost cause. pix.  x CARE undated H.Noble 1,800 Exclusive: At a quietly convened meeting at a mountain house in the Grand Tetons of Wyoming, a group representing major employers and consumers in America have agreed on what they say will be a fundamental shift in emphasis in the goals of the nation's managed health-care systems: from cost cutting to quality health care.

RAINBOW Ria Arriba, NM G.Johnson 30'' The Rainbow people are about to arrive here for their annual Forth of July outing, and tensions are high. On one side are the local Hispanos, on the other an unwilling alliance between the Rainbow people and the United States Forest Service. On the sidelines are the conflicted environmentalists, who aren't happy about the specter of 15,000 people trampling through the remote forests but who empathize with the 60's ambiance of it all. pix. map.  $TICKETS Washington Janofsky 23'' The city of Washington may be in financial chaos, but the streets are paved with gold.

LAMAYOR-PROGRESS (Los Angeles) _ When you see Mayor Richard Riordan these days wearing a high school letter jacket and hanging out with teen-agers, flipping burgers for a barbecue or suggesting snappy slogans for L.A., he bears all the trappings of a political innocent.

"37726"	"he"	"complained"	" The debt debate continued to build this week. Tuesday, Gingrich charged that Rubin was manipulating the date when the United States would run out of borrowing authority.

"96258"	"he"	"complained"	" Similar experiences took place in Gander, also in Newfoundland. It was so Canadian. In these gloomy days, thousands have used the Internet to transmit copies of a radio broadcast, ``The Americans,'' made by Canadian Gordon Sinclair in 1973. It came at a time when Americans were having difficult financial times. In it, Sinclair (who died in 1984) told of protracted American generosity, how Americans were there to help when Europe needed rebuilding after World War II, when there were earthquakes in Central America, when there was calamity anywhere.

In it, he complained, among other things, that the American intelligence assessments on Cuba had been unbalanced and might have been tainted by the role played by a Defense Intelligence Agency analyst, Ana Montes, who had been arrested the previous year as a Cuban spy.
