Being the sort of person who is never prepared for anything, it is of great comfort to me to know that my Swing-A-Way can opener has been quietly guarding me from untold disaster for decades.  I gave up my electric can opener nearly 20 years ago when the real estate boom of the 80s gained us a home with kitchen the size of a walk-in closet.  It had about three square feet of counter space and one electrical outlet, so when I spied a manual can opener on one of those store displays aimed at pushing slow-selling items to impulse shoppers, I bought it.  It took up no counter space whatsoever, required no messy electrical cord, and no electrical outlet.  Even better, it never, ever built up that really gross gunky stuff that we'd prefer not to tIink about, but that we all know hides on electric can openers.  All I had to do to clean my Swing-A-Way was stick it under the hot water when I finished opening a can. Imagine, all this for the low, low price of $3.98!  I had no idea that such progress had been made in the world of manual can opening.  My previous experience wyt((can openers was not a pleasant one. My grandmother possessed three, each one of them crude and difficult to use.  Can Opener from Hell No. 1 was basically a handle with a hooked blade at the top. Opening a can with this device required positioning it near the edge of the can, then pounding it into the can with one swift blow.  If you managed to do this without A. bruising your hand B. hitting the handle just a little off-center so that the can of mushroom soup somersaulted off the counter onto your foot or C. impaling your hand on the convenient corkscrew that always managed to dislodge itself from the handle, then you were ready for the next test of courage.  Working the handle up and down around the edge of the can resulted in a number of uneven raggedy cuts, but eventually, after much work, slipping of the blade and an occasional puncture wound from the cursed corkscrew, it was possible to remove enough metal to free the contents from the can.  Can Opener From Hell No. 2 had no sharp blades or corkscrews. Its specialty was psychological torture.  It had nothing but a handle and these two blunt pieces of metal, which in theory, was supposed to scissor together, causing the blade to clamp down on the edge of the can.  Of course, it never stayed clamped down on the can. That is, if you ever got it on the first time. Its particular evil was to create anxiety, frustration and enough desperation to drive you to use Can Opener from Hell No. 1, resulting in both mental and physical abuse.  What a pair, those two.  And then there was Can Opener From Hell No. 3.  The can opener wasn't outrightly evil like the other two. It was easy to attach to the can, had no sharp poking things, but it was dull and lazy and never around when you needed it.  It would attach to the can all r+ght, but the handle would slip _ a lot. You could turn and turn the handle and it would juster and over again, until a series of perforations were created. Then it was necessary to jam a knife into the can and pry the lid off. Sometimes the lid would flip off _ a jagged-edged projectile flinging food juice all over the place.  The thought of being trapped in a bomb shelter with one of those demonic devices and the million cans of pork and beans Mother had stocked up to tide us over until the radioactivity wore off made being vaporized seem the better alternative.  Considering the trials and tribulations associated with these primitive can openers, it isn't surprising that the public flocked to electric can openers.  I sincerely hope that the Swing-A-Way can opener is a relatively recent invention. If I were to find out that such a can opener was available for purchase in the 1960s, and that I could have had a happier childhood for the price of a couple of candy bars and an Archie comic book, I'll be very disappointed in myself.  But I'll be happy to swing away at terrorism.  Seven Can Casserole  2 cans tuna fish  1 no. 2 can Chinese noodles  1 can chop suey or Chinese vegetables  1 can cream of mushroom soup  1 can cream of chicken soup  1 soup can milk  1 can water chestnuts, drained and sliced  1/2 - 1 cup slivered almonds  Potato chips, crushed  Mix all ingredients except potato chips. Bake uncovered at 350 for 35 minutes. Top with chips. Yield 6-8 servings  Linda Gohl of California provided this recipe after seeing Cousin Emma's Seven Can Recipe in the San Francisco Chronicle.

, he said,	 Salonen has also put much thought into finding fresh ways to conduct the standard repertory. The problem, he said, is that with each passing day we get further away from the great legacy of classical works. How do you keep a vital connection to the tradition? How do you conduct Beethoven in a way that conveys the radicalism of the music without resorting to some attention-grabbing interpretive approach? </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, he said,	 Consider, he said, the issue of volume. When Beethoven's Eroica Symphony was first performed, other than for standing next to a firing cannon or in the belfry of a cathedral, the music was surely the loudest thing anyone had ever heard. How can we recreate that visceral sensation, given all the noise and amplification we live with today? </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, he said,	 Though Salonen's current contract runs through 2008, he envisions staying longer. Since 1997, he has kept his entire conducting schedule to no more than 25 weeks, which allows him time to go to his country home in Finland to compose.

Despite some loud grumbling (including some from Emir Kusturica, president of the competition jury, who complained afterward about the poor quality of the selections), Cannes was full of movies that were challenging, interesting and in various ways satisfying. It was therefore troubling to read, at the end of the festival, an article in The Hollywood Reporter in which several executives complained about how few of the films were worth buying for American distribution. Part of the fault, it seemed, lay with audiences who shy away from anything they think will be difficult or disturbing.

Last year, Bruce Baker of Stanford University discovered that the mating circuit controlled by the gene involved 60 nerve cells and that if any of these were damaged or destroyed by the scientists, the animal couldn't mate properly. Both male and female flies have the same genetic material as well as the neural circuitry required for the mating ritual, but different parts of the genes are turned on in the two sexes. But no one dreamed that simply activating the normally dormant male portion of the gene in a female fly could cause a genetic female to display the whole elaborate panoply of male fruit fly foreplay. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20050602.0182 type=advis > <HEADLINE> TEXBUDGET-TEX </HEADLINE> <TEXT> The Fort Worth Star-Telegram plans to move the following stories for clients of the NYTimes News Service for AMs of Friday, June 03, 2005.

Your goal should never be to just return a verdict, but to return a just verdict. Some outside legal experts said Friday that the judge could have given a lesser instruction to the jurors to keep trying. That she went immediately for her strongest tool, they said, suggests that she viewed the disagreement within the jury as a serious schism.

Hazel Smith, the veteran Nashville journalist who has long been a friend of Brooks, recalled a conversation when, she said, Garth told me that he would never be on another record label except Capitol, because that's where his mother, Colleen, was. Colleen Carroll Brooks, the singer's mother, recorded with little chart success for Capitol in 1954. Brooks has been living in Oklahoma for the last few years but made news recently with some performances at benefits, and with his engagement to his fellow country star Trisha Yearwood.

Boal commissioned other dances from her and Perron for a 2003 program of solos he performed at the Joyce Theater. He bravely chose to perform dances by two neophyte choreographers, the fellow City Ballet dancers Albert Evans and Edwaard Liang, for that solo program and for a Joyce engagement by his own chamber ballet group in March. At that engagement, Perron created a solo for him that eloquently summarized my sense of Boal as a restless seeker as he grows older, rather like the one he portrayed in Opus 19. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
