"500"	"he"	"claimed"	" On Sunday Yeltsin accused the Estonians of ``very crude violations of human rights'' against the country's large ethnic Russian population, a holdover from the time Estonia was part of the Soviet Union.

"965"	"he"	"claimed"	" Valenzuela is 1-2 with a 2.84 ERA after four starts. It was his first National League victory since pitching a 10-4, complete-game win for Los Angeles at Cincinnati on Sept. 14, 1990. But getting it against his former team, he claimed, was not especially meaningful. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199407.gz"
"3430"	"he"	"claimed"	" The affair with Beaton gradually eroded. When Beaton published a slightly cleansed version of his diary of their affair in 1971 -- stimulated partly, he claimed, by the intolerable way she had treated de Acosta in her impoverished later years -- all communication ceased, except for a brief, typically chilly visit shortly before Beaton died. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199408.gz"

"6452"	"he"	"claimed"	" Bob is an author himself, a former bookstore owner, a television reviewer and a past president of the American Booksellers Association. He recently suffered a painful but brief heart attack -- on the first night in their 40-year marriage, he claimed, that his wife slept so soundly he couldn't awaken her and get her to the rescue. He went to the hospital the next day and the delay did him no harm. Mrs. Hale, who runs their farm in Pembroke, Mass., liked Georgia when she accompanied him last spring and is planning a return in December. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199410.gz"
"6591"	"he"	"claimed"	" But cataclysmic events were about to shatter his life. That same morning, a fellow detective in the squad made a startling confession.

The accuser, Detective John Young, said he wanted to return his share, nearly $17,000. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199410.gz"
"6658"	"it"	"claimed"	" One of the sect's documents sent to newspapers last week suggested the group's leaders chose to die because they were targets of persecution in Quebec where, it claimed, they were being accused of assorted crimes, including terrorism.

"9875"	"she"	"claimed"	" Mrs. Roden said she moved out of her house a few years ago because, she claimed, people were trying to sneak into it and poison her food.

"10067"	"he"	"claimed"	" In Newark, N.J., a man filed suit against a restaurant, claiming that it served him a double espresso instead of the decaffeinated coffee he ordered. It caused him, he claimed, to go to a hospital with a rapid heart beat. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"
"10169"	"he"	"claimed"	" He then called on the judge to consider a motion to set aside all the charges against him because, he claimed, the prosecution had prolonged and delayed the proceedings. The judge denied the motion. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"
"11032"	"he"	"claimed"	" At the end of the Gorazde crisis last April, Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose took to berating the Sarajevo press for inflating Muslim casualties and so, he claimed, almost precipitating World War III. Why, then, I asked him, would he not put a handful of reporters into one of the U.N. helicopters then going to the town? Oh, no, he replied, that would irritate the Serbs and cut off U.N. access to Gorazde. When I suggested he was kowtowing to the Serbs, he got angry. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"

"20404"	"it"	"claimed"	" Williams entered a contract on May 9, 1989, to sell the house, and agreed to a closing date of July 3. App. 8. One week before the closing, the Government gave actual notice to Williams and the purchaser of over $41,000 in tax liens which, it claimed, were valid against the property or proceeds of the sale. The purchaser threatened to sue Williams if the sale did not go through on schedule.

"23395"	"he"	"claimed"	" Inevitably, critics question why the Feds could not have nipped the plot beforehand.

"26898"	"he"	"claimed"	" For Green, it was no accident. He saw this coming, he claimed, as he spoke of a new attitude in recent games. And this was the second straight comeback victory for his club. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"26972"	"she"	"claimed"	" Times change. When the history standards were released last October, they were greeted with a hail of criticism from ... Lynne Cheney. Her movement, she claimed, had been hijacked. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"

"30438"	"he"	"claimed"	" When Fordice, a man with overarching conservative views, snapped back at hecklers who, he claimed, ``want the return of world communism,'' it was just like old times, when political dialogue at the Neshoba County Fair was characterized by insult and insinuation. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"31641"	"he"	"claimed"	" The House minority leader from Missouri charged that the Republicans were raiding Medicare to pay for proposed tax cuts.

"32107"	"I"	"claimed"	" More important, a break from work, I claimed, allowed me to recharge my creative batteries. Having a good reason assuaged my guilt over abandoning the 9-to-5 workday, just as did telling my parents I cut class for a humanitarian reason: to care for a sick friend who insisted that only I could make her feel better. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"

"32390"	"he"	"claimed"	" He charged that, unlike their American counterparts, British government officials have little inclination to question the fundamental assumptions of social welfare which, he claimed, spends nine billion pounds annually ($14.5 billion) to support single mothers and their children. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"33755"	"he"	"claimed"	" Eszterhas, who has children ages 18 and 20 from his first marriage and is expecting the birth of another child today, insisted that the film doesn't show or say anything that high-school-aged kids aren't exposed to already. He has waited until now to attack the rating, he claimed, because too much focus is being placed on the film's sensational elements, at the expense of its message. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"33990"	"he"	"claimed"	" Her lawyer, Liman, told the court that Mrs. Helmsley had tried to carry out the tasks ``in good faith.'' But, he claimed, because she had been ``vilified'' in the media, members of the hospital staff ``gawked at her'' and were ``less than charitable.'' As a result, the hospital could no longer ``accommodate'' her presence. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"35194"	"he"	"claimed"	" Two weeks ago Sylvester surprised the court when he pleaded guilty to shooting Ms. Spatafora and killing Steven Chaifetz on July 22, 1994. He said he began the attacks to cover up a murder he intended to commit as a favor for a friend, a topless dancer who, he claimed, wanted to eliminate a rival in a love triangle. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"

"43210"	"he"	"claimed"	" In his billfold, Atkins carried a list of 45 names _ his sexual conquests, he claimed, some men, some boys. Florence is 39, tall, big-boned, 5 pounds heavier than she would like to be. Her blond hair is cut short in the no-nonsense style of a woman busy mothering four young children _ which she is. Tony was the first, but, blessedly, not the last. She lives with her family in Royal Palm Beach. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"

"46273"	"he"	"claimed"	" In doing so, Shaughnessy rode roughshod over a host of Texas ideals, including the Cowboys cheerleaders (''28 Farrah Fawcett look-alikes,'' he wrote, as if that was some kind of indictment). He basically derided Texans as being without breeding or any morally redeeming qualities. Cheering for the Cowboys, he claimed, is what Texans do instead of attending the symphony and the ballet or visiting art museums. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"
"46641"	"he"	"claimed"	" He was banking on at least $675 million in savings initiated by New York state to help.
