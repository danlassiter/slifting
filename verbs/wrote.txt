Now a research team from the National Institute on Aging and the University of Iowa has found in a three-year study of more than 8,200 people 68 and older that regular moderate activity like walking or gardening can reduce the risk of severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage.   The research team, headed by Dr. Marco Pahor, who has since gone back to Rome, reported that those who took frequent walks were half as likely to develop this often-fatal condition as were inactive people of the same age.   They suggested that exercise prevented hemorrhage by improving the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the gastrointestinal tract. This, in turn, can reduce the risk of bleeding caused by insufficient oxygen under a variety of circumstances, including the body's usual reaction to stress.   Furthermore, by stimulating bowel function, exercise may reduce a person's chances of developing several intestinal disorders, including ulcers and diverticulosis, all of which increase the risk of hemorrhage.   Although only a small percentage of participants in the study regularly took part in vigorous activity, the researchers found no special benefit in preventing bleeding associated with activities more strenuous than walking. The study findings were published in Wednesday's issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association.   Smoking not only can kill but also detracts from the quality of life. A survey of more than 3,500 adults in Wisconsin found that people who smoked were more likely than nonsmokers to suffer from a variety of sleep disturbances, including difficulty falling asleep, difficulty waking up, daytime sleepiness and nightmares.   The researchers, David W. Wetter and Dr. Terry B. Young of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, suggested that smoking's effects on sleep could trap smokers in a vicious cycle, with the symptoms of sleep disturbance -- depression, fatigue and impaired ability to think, which resemble the effects of nicotine withdrawal -- possibly motivating the desire to smoke. Their findings were published last spring in the journal Preventive Medicine.   Both men and women who smoked were more likely than nonsmokers to have trouble falling asleep and waking up. Women who smoked more often found themselves plagued by daytime sleepiness, and men who smoked were more likely to have disturbing dreams, including nightmares.   The researchers suggested that various effects of smoking, including the stimulant effects of nicotine, nightly nicotine withdrawal and breathing difficulties associated with smoking, might increase the risk of sleep disturbances among smokers.   It is also possible, they wrote, that frequent sleep disturbances may increase a person's desire to smoke, since those trying to cope with the problems of nonrestorative sleep, difficulty waking up and daytime sleepiness findings, may turn to smoking as a ``remedy.''  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19940823.0206 type=story > <HEADLINE> BONILLA GOING BACK TO WORK, BUT NOT THE KIND THAT PAYS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-BBO-BONILLA-600&AMP;add-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199408.gz"

Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13.95.   Married in 1929, the Trillings were at the center of New York's intellectual life in an era when the city fancied itself the center of the world. Covering the years until 1950, this is an ``extraordinary'' memoir, Ann Hulbert said here in 1993. She said Mrs. Trilling ``has miraculously discovered a morally dignified yet also ruthlessly honest style of self-exposure.''   A FROLIC OF HIS OWN   By William Gaddis. Scribner/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $12.   ``Justice? -- You get justice in the next world, in this world you have the law.'' So begins the author's sendup of a legal system in which suit piles on countersuit, deposition on decree. The novel won the 1994 National Book Award for fiction and was chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of the year. Our reviewer, Robert Towers, said here last year that ``the novel's mockery of the legal profession, its minions, and its dupes, is extended to include a wide spectrum of contemporary American culture -- presented here, with corrosive Swiftian glee, as an unholy mess compounded of greed, ignorance, illiteracy, corruption and childish folly.''   HOW WE DIE: Reflections on Life's Final Chapter   By Sherwin B. Nuland. Vintage, $13.   The author, a surgeon and teacher, tells in plain language what actually happens to the body when a human being dies. This book, winner of the 1994 National Book Award for non-fiction, devotes chapters to each of the primary killers, including heart failure, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. Our reviewer, William F. Buckley Jr., last year called Nuland ``a remarkable portraitist'' who ``quietly and informatively instructs and advises us.'' Vintage has also reissued Nuland's DOCTORS: The Biography of Medicine ($15), an account of healing from Hippocrates to organ transplants. Regina Morantz-Sanchez, writing here in 1988, said that rarely has ``the general reader been offered such a captivating narrative of biomedical matters.''   BRAZIL   By John Updike. Fawcett Crest, $6.99.   Unlikely lovers -- Tristao, a poor, black teen-ager from the slums of Rio de Janeiro, and Isabel, a rich, pampered, white girl -- flee to the wilds of western Brazil in the author's 16th novel. ``It is hard to resist the depth of his mind and the seduction of his prose,'' our reviewer, Barbara Kingsolver, said here last year.   IGNATIUS OF LOYOLA: The Psychology of a Saint   By W.W. Meissner. Yale University, $18.   The soldier who founded the Jesuit order is portrayed by a biographer who is a Jesuit priest and a psychoanalytically trained psychiatrist. This work is ``a touching, poignant, and straightforward biography, written with clarity and an erudition that rarely deteriorates into the pedantic,'' Robert Coles said here in 1992.   SAVING ST. GERM   By Carol Muske Dukes. Penguin, $10.95.   This novel looks inside the head of a biochemist lost in her work, who mentally builds the chemical structure of nicotine when she craves a cigarette, but is not cut out for the demands of academic and family life. In 1993, our reviewer, Tom De Haven, called this ``a truly original work of fiction,'' which explores ``a subculture that's baffling, often intimidating, to most of us.''   LOSING GROUND: American Social Policy, 1950-1980   By Charles Murray. Basic Books, $16.   As welfare reform moves to the front burner, the author -- who won some fame, or infamy, as co-author of ``The Bell Curve'' -- has added a new introduction to the 10th-anniversary edition of this book. It holds that many of the Great Society programs actually made the poor worse off. ``The argument is not new, but it is well made,'' Lawrence M. Mead said here in 1984.   THE GREEN KNIGHT   By Iris Murdoch. Penguin, $12.95.   The author evokes the story of Cain and Abel, and medieval romance, in the confrontation of two brothers in modern-day London. She ``interweaves allusions to a rich mine of sources: Freud, Sartre, Simone Weil, and Shakespeare,'' Linda Simon said here last year.   WITNESS AGAINST THE BEAST: William Blake and the Moral Law   By E.P. Thompson. New Press, $17.   In a study published just after his death in 1993, this eminent British historian reinterpreted Blake's poetry and found evidence of the religious outlook that shaped it. ``The union of knowledge with imagination and conviction is the mark of this book,'' Aileen Ward said here last year. ``It is a splendid conclusion to a life of great scholarship.'' In celebration of that life, The New Press has published Thompson's Making History: Writings on History and Culture ($17). It includes essays on such figures as William Morris and Mary Wollstonecraft.   PRONTO   By Elmore Leonard. Dell, $5.99.   For his 31st novel, the author has chosen a setting on the Italian Riviera, where a South Miami Beach bookie tries to escape his vengeful Mafia boss. The reader's payoff, our reviewer, Teresa Carpenter, said in 1993, ``is the glee with which Mr. Leonard sends up the mob.''   COMPLETE POEMS   By Marianne Moore. Penguin, $12.95.   Late in her life, Moore was anointed a cultural celebrity who posed for Life magazine at the zoo and won fame for her interest in baseball. This image, Hilton Kramer said here in 1981, ``was often grotesquely at odds with the very stringent and unyielding vision of her best writing.'' This collection, he wrote, is ``an important book, and one that every reader will want to have.''  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950115.0016 type=story > <HEADLINE> MANSON JURORS SYMPATHIZE WITH SIMPSON PANELISTS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  (BC-SIMPSON-JURORS-3Takes-LADN) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"

"12510"	"he"	"wrote"	" Over the years, stories have added to the Slippery Rock legend, including one invented by a radio announcer about a fictional player who supposedly scored an astronomical number of touchdowns. It wasn't true, but it made the rounds. Another publicity boost came in 1936 when a sportwriter wrote a satirical piece pointing out that neither Minnesota's nor the University of Pittsburgh's football teams deserved the coveted No. 1 ranking they had received. The honor, he wrote, belonged to Slippery Rock. He went on to detail how Slippery Rock's Rockets had beaten various opponents who had gone on to beat either Pitt or Minnesota, arguing therefore that the Rockets should be the No. 1 team. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"

And he ordered the jurors to disregard whatever Cochran had already told them about Ms. Gerchas and five others, including a maid who claims that Mrs. Simpson once slapped her. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"

After the Dudley House performance, I wrote, ``Shure's performance of the closing tragic variations left the intentional and accidental roughness of his approach to the keyboard behind and his playing became nobly simple and direct, free of point-making and rich in emotion, and one thought of Milton's famous line about `calm of mind, all passion spent.''' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"
"15953"	"he"	"wrote"	" O'Connor agreed that there were ``some fine ideas'' in the contract, but said that the welfare proposal ``isn't one of them.''

The achievement of the World War II generation was that it was able to imprint itself on much more than that, on the whole country.

"19686"	"he"	"wrote"	" The Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset theorized about generations and destiny, speaking of a ``vital sensitivity'' shared by people who grew up together and experienced the same events, thoughts, sentiments, triumphs and disappointments. Each generation, he wrote, is ``a complete way of life that imprints itself indelibly on the individual.'' The achievement of the World War II generation was that it was able to imprint itself on much more than that, on the whole country. Their imprint has lasted more than a half century, and might even reach into the election that will choose the leader who will be president in the first years of the 21st century.

(HLW) By LAUREL GRAEBER c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  ROALD DAHL: A Biography  By Jeremy Treglown. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13.  This study shows that the man who became famous for his books for children had not only the playful imagination associated with childhood, but also its propensity for tantrums and tactlessness. The biography ``does not at all suffer from being unauthorized,'' Ann Hulbert said here last year. She added: ``In fact, it is the perfect antidote to Dahl's own triumph at image making.''  HOUSE OF SPLENDID ISOLATION  By Edna O'Brien. Plume, $10.95.  Josie O'Meara is alone in her bitterness and widowhood when fate and circumstance bring a visitor to her door: McGreevy, an Irish Republican Army terrorist who occupies her home and takes her hostage. Both have been betrayed _ he by one of his confederates, she by a former servant who still lingers at the edges of her life. In 1994 our reviewer, John L'Heureux, called their story ``a fascinating and disturbing novel.'' As the characters struggle, he wrote, ``we feel that for the moment we are looking deep into the conflicted mind and heart of contemporary Ireland.'' The misery of the country is also reflected in MAY THE LORD IN HIS MERCY BE KIND TO BELFAST, by Tony Parker (Owl/Holt, $13.95), an account in the voices of real men and women, some Roman Catholic, some Protestant, some soldiers, some civilians. The author is ``an extraordinary reporter,'' Margo Jefferson said in The New York Times last year. His work, she noted, ``is exceptional.''  FROM THE TEETH OF ANGELS  By Jonathan Carroll. Main Street/Doubleday, $12.  Death is a character here, and he's quite an unsavory fellow. He enjoys playing games with his prey, which includes a former television host with cancer and an HIV-positive photojournalist. The result is ``a fine and harrowing and beautiful work of fiction,'' Tom De Haven wrote in the Book Review in 1994.  THE BEAK OF THE FINCH: A Story of Evolution in Our Time  By Jonathan Weiner. Vintage, $13.  This Pulitzer Prize-winning study allows the reader to visualize what the author actually saw when he reported on the work of Peter and Rosemary Grant. They are biologists who have documented that the thickness of the beaks of certain finches varies according to the type of seeds the climate makes available. Weiner's ``triumph is to reveal how evolution and science as a whole work,'' Douglas H. Chadwick said in these pages last year. People, too, are subject to natural selection, explains THE RED QUEEN: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature, by Matt Ridley (Penguin, $12.95). But mating behavior, not weather, seems to direct our species' survival. Ridley ``makes a convincing case that sex itself originated in an arms race between parasites and their hosts,'' Derek Bickerton wrote here in 1994.  SINGING SONGS  By Meg Tilly. Plume, $9.95.  This actress's first fiction is narrated by a young girl, Anna, who begins the story in 1965, when she is 4{. The subject is childhood, which in this novel is conquered and defiled by a cruel and abusive stepfather. Last year, our reviewer, Donna Rifkind, praised ``the remarkable coherence and clarity of Anna's voice.''  CERTAIN TRUMPETS: The Call of Leaders  By Garry Wills. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $14.  The author explores the quality of leadership, defining as successful those who share a common goal with their followers. He presents profiles of 16 such people, ranging from King David to Martha Graham, along with personal sketches of their opposing types, like Solomon and Madonna. The book offers ``plenty of lively narrative and argument,'' Frank Kermode said here in 1994.  JULIP  By Jim Harrison. Washington Square/Pocket Books, $12.  The masculine myths celebrated by Hemingway are dissected _ and deflated _ in these three novellas. The men are no match for women like the title character, a latter-day Artemis with her own hunting dogs. Writing in these pages last year, Jonis Agee said the author ``has established himself as a genuinely comic writer.''  REMEMBERING SATAN  By Lawrence Wright. Vintage, $12.  This book examines the case of Paul R. Ingram, a former deputy sheriff who is in prison for raping his daughters even though there was no evidence of the crimes and a psychologist hired by the prosecution concluded that the charges _ and Ingram's confession _ were the products of highly susceptible imaginations. Last year, our reviewer, Walter Reich, found the book ``stunning.'' It is the author's ``cautionary tale about the dangers of so-called recovered memories,'' he said. Vintage has also reissued Wright's SAINTS AND SINNERS ($12), portraits of six men and women, from Jimmy Swaggart to Madalyn Murray O'Hair, for whom religion is the defining issue of their lives. In 1993, one critic called it ``a serenely passionate chronicle of the cobbled byways of the human spirit.''  MALLORY'S ORACLE  By Carol O'Connell. Jove, $5.99.  Sgt. Kathleen Mallory is a former child thief who has become the computer whiz of the NYPD. She draws on all her talents to track down a serial killer whose victims include her adoptive father. This is ``a powerful novel'' whose readers will be ``well rewarded,'' Andrew Vachss wrote in the Book Review in 1994.  THE SIXTEEN PLEASURES  By Robert Hellenga. Delta, $11.95.  The title refers to the erotica in a 16th-century volume entrusted to the narrator, a book conservator in the flooded Florence of 1966. This is ``a lively first novel that communicates the heady peril'' of the time, Mark Mitchell said here last year. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950618.0031 type=story > <HEADLINE> BINDING UP OLD WOUNDS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-VIETNAM-NEWSWEEK-NYTSF) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

Times News Service  (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all. This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the non-fiction list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in criticism from publishing houses.)  Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending June 11, 1995.  The listings are based on computer-processed sales figures from 3,050 bookstores and from representative wholesalers with more than 38,000 retail outlets, including newsstands, variety stores, supermarkets, and bookstores. These figures are statistically adjusted to represent sales in all such outlets across the United States. The number of titles within the two subdivisions of non-fiction can change from week to week, reflecting changes in book buying.  An `x' following a book's ranking indicates that its sales, weighted to reflect the book-selling industry nationally, are barely distinguishable from those of the book above.

Writing in these pages last year, Jonis Agee said the author ``has established himself as a genuinely comic writer.''  REMEMBERING SATAN  By Lawrence Wright. Vintage, $12.  This book examines the case of Paul R. Ingram, a former deputy sheriff who is in prison for raping his daughters even though there was no evidence of the crimes and a psychologist hired by the prosecution concluded that the charges _ and Ingram's confession _ were the products of highly susceptible imaginations. Last year, our reviewer, Walter Reich, found the book ``stunning.'' It is the author's ``cautionary tale about the dangers of so-called recovered memories,'' he said. Vintage has also reissued Wright's SAINTS AND SINNERS ($12), portraits of six men and women, from Jimmy Swaggart to Madalyn Murray O'Hair, for whom religion is the defining issue of their lives. In 1993, one critic called it ``a serenely passionate chronicle of the cobbled byways of the human spirit.''  MALLORY'S ORACLE  By Carol O'Connell. Jove, $5.99.  Sgt. Kathleen Mallory is a former child thief who has become the computer whiz of the NYPD. She draws on all her talents to track down a serial killer whose victims include her adoptive father. This is ``a powerful novel'' whose readers will be ``well rewarded,'' Andrew Vachss wrote in the Book Review in 1994.  THE SIXTEEN PLEASURES  By Robert Hellenga. Delta, $11.95.  The title refers to the erotica in a 16th-century volume entrusted to the narrator, a book conservator in the flooded Florence of 1966. This is ``a lively first novel that communicates the heady peril'' of the time, Mark Mitchell said here last year. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950619.0081 type=story > <HEADLINE> ACTING LIKE MEN, GETTING IN TROUBLE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-WOMEN-POLICE-REVIEW-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"25608"	"he"	"wrote"	" Justice Nolan dissented. In his view, the Council ``does not need a narrow or distinct theme or message in its parade for it to be protected under the First Amendment.'' Id., at 256, 636 N. E. 2d, at 1303. First, he wrote, even if the parade had no message at all, GLIB's particular message could not be forced upon it. Id., at 257, 636 N. E. 2d, at 1303, citing Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705, 717 (1977) (state requirement to display ``Live Free or Die'' on license plates violates First Amendment). Second, according to Justice Nolan, the trial judge clearly erred in finding the parade devoid of expressive purpose. Ibid. He would have held that the Council, like any expressive association, cannot be barred from excluding applicants who do not share the views the Council wishes to advance. Id., at 257-259, 636 N. E. 2d, at 1303-1304, citing Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609 (1984). Under either a pure speech or associational theory, the State's purpose of eliminating discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, according to the dissent, could be achieved by more narrowly drawn means, such as ordering admission of individuals regardless of sexual preference, without taking the further step of prohibiting the Council from editing the views expressed in their parade. Id., at 256, 258, 636 N. E. 2d, at 1302, 1304. In Justice Nolan's opinion, because GLIB's message was separable from the status of its members, such a narrower order would accommodate the State's interest without the likelihood of infringing on the Council's First Amendment rights. Finally, he found clear error in the trial judge's equation of exclusion on the basis of GLIB's message with exclusion on the basis of its members' sexual orientation. To the dissent this appeared false in the light of ``overwhelming evidence'' that the Council objected to GLIB on account of its message and a dearth of testimony or documentation indicating that sexual orientation was the bar to admission. Id., at 260, 636 N. E. 2d, at 1304. The dissent accordingly concluded that the Council had not even violated the State's public accommodations law.We granted certiorari to determine whether the requirement to admit a parade contingent expressing a message not of the private organizers' own choosing violates the First Amendment. 513 U. S. --- (1995). We hold that it does and reverse. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

Phillips also was charmed by an evening on River Street, which he portrayed as a festival atmosphere similar to Mardi Gras.

PICASSO'S LOVER ON HIS PORTRAIT OF HER  ``Picasso and Portraiture: Representation and Transformation,'' a new exhibit of the master's work, opens at New York's Museum of Modern Art on Sunday. A number of subjects discuss their own responses to Picasso's portraits of them in Sunday's New York Times magazine.  Art critic Michael Kimmelman notes that Picasso's portraits of his longtime mistress, Francoise Gilot, haven't received the praise earned by portraits of other subjects. ``Because the ones of me are more elusive,'' says Gilot.  ``There's more of this sort of secret language in them. Also because I did not altogether expose my inner self to him. ... My portraits are not boxes in which I fit. I'm not a prisoner of them.''  Gilot is the only woman who ever left Picasso, writes Kimmelman. ``Painting women's portraits was one way Picasso thought he seduced them,'' says Gilot. ``I told him, `I love you and it has nothing to do with that. I love you as you and, as a painter, but whether you do or do not paint me doesn't matter.' ... I felt entirely free and independent of his portraits.

In fact, I will come to the next County Bar Association meeting, if I am asked, and will perform the foot-washing service.'' His letter specifies that symbolic foot-washing existed ``before it became a religious gesture, and you do not have to be a Christian to participate in it.''  In a phone conversation, Litchfield described lawyers as victims of a kind of generalized hatred. ``We all know about the crude hate words, the n-word, the k-word. How many times in your life have you heard people say the word `lawyer' with the same tone as they say hate words? Why is that acceptable in this culture? I've actually said it myself, and I am one of them.  ``Here's a new class of people,'' said Litchfield, ``that are so dehumanized, it's time to start ministering to them.''  PICASSO'S LOVER ON HIS PORTRAIT OF HER  ``Picasso and Portraiture: Representation and Transformation,'' a new exhibit of the master's work, opens at New York's Museum of Modern Art on Sunday. A number of subjects discuss their own responses to Picasso's portraits of them in Sunday's New York Times magazine.  Art critic Michael Kimmelman notes that Picasso's portraits of his longtime mistress, Francoise Gilot, haven't received the praise earned by portraits of other subjects. ``Because the ones of me are more elusive,'' says Gilot.  ``There's more of this sort of secret language in them. Also because I did not altogether expose my inner self to him. ... My portraits are not boxes in which I fit. I'm not a prisoner of them.''  Gilot is the only woman who ever left Picasso, writes Kimmelman. ``Painting women's portraits was one way Picasso thought he seduced them,'' says Gilot. ``I told him, `I love you and it has nothing to do with that. I love you as you and, as a painter, but whether you do or do not paint me doesn't matter.' ... I felt entirely free and independent of his portraits. I did not define myself by them, put myself inside them.''  LIFE AND DEATH  _ Twenty-three percent of dog owners carry pictures of their pets in their wallets, says Health magazine.  _ Californians who live in the 916 and 707 area codes can dial (900) 225-BUGS, and pay $2 for the first minute, $1 for each minute thereafter, to have their insects and spiders identified.  This new program at UC Davis makes entomology students and staff members available between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. If the phone panel is stumped, they may request that a sample be mailed in. Complicated requests will be referred to a non-toll phone line.  ``The process is a lot like medical diagnostics,'' says entomologist Lynn Kimsey, ``except we'll be diagnosing an organism rather than a disease.''  This service isn't available yet to residents in the 415, 510 and 408 area codes, but organizers hope to expand it according to demand.  _ Dade County, Fla., Metro Commissioner Natacha Millan has instituted special parking permits for parents with children under the age of two. Parking lots are required to mark designated spaces for permit-holders.  ``It's a safety issue as much as a convenience issue,'' Millan told Family Circle. ``Parents lugging kids and strollers are vulnerable.'' Violators will be fined up to $250. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960427.0258 type=story > <HEADLINE> UNDATED: for them.'' </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-SELF-PUBLISHERS-2NDTAKE-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"

WASHINGTON  SQUADRON _ WASHINGTON _ Evidence of ``lewd behavior and debauchery'' among a squadron of Air Force pilots has prompted a top-ranking general to warn that such conduct will not be tolerated _ but not to acknowledge his own alleged membership in a secret drinking organization implicated in the reported misconduct. In a memorandum signed a week ago, Gen. John G. Lorber, commander of all Pacific Air Force bases, ordered officers under his command to hold meetings to discuss codes of conduct and ethics in the Air Force. His concern was aroused, he wrote, by a ``recent event'' involving members of a squadron who ``conducted themselves as though they were in a wild fraternity, totally out of control with no mature supervision.'' One of the details not listed in the general's memorandum was the involvement of members of a secret association of several hundred Air Force officers known as ``the Command Barstool Association'' in the alleged misconduct. According to sworn testimony in a recent Alaska court-martial, Gen. Lorber is ``a stooler.'' (Nesmith and Carollo).  MEDICARE _ WASHINGTON _ If President Clinton is re-elected, his administration will seek a `quick fix'' compromise with Congress to shore up the Medicare trust fund while a bipartisan commission works out longer-term solutions, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said Wednesday. She said the ``quick fix'' could add about 10 years to the life of the federal health care program for the elderly, which is currently facing bankruptcy by 2001. It would involve cuts in payments to doctors and hospitals while avoiding increases in taxes or patients' costs, she said. (Lipman).

That same year, George Abbott produced it at the Broadhurst Theater, where it was called ``Touch and Go.''

(th) By LAWRIE MIFFLIN c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service  He is an obsessive Knicks fan and has to work late. He has no access to a television or a radio, not even a telephone to call Sportsphone. Solution: a new gadget called Sports Trax, about the size of a personal pager, on which he can punch a basketball-shaped button and get the latest score of the Knicks' game, minute by minute, basket by basket.  When this fanatic looks at the display screen on his $200 toy, is he simply checking out a news report, or is he watching a virtual performance, misappropriated from the National Basketball Association?  Monday, Sports Team Analysis and Tracking Systems Inc. (known as Stats Inc.), which gathers the data, and Motorola Inc., which makes the pager, are appealing an injunction against the dissemination of the NBA scores that was issued by Judge Loretta A. Preska in arguments before a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan.  Because of the First Amendment implications of the case, several news organizations, including The New York Times, have filed friend-of-the-court briefs supporting the defendants, contending that their devices merely transmit ``bare-bones facts'' of the game, with no sense of the plays being made, who scored a basket or how, or any of the game's drama except the changing score.  But NBC, another news organization, filed an amicus brief for the plaintiffs, the NBA and NBA Properties Inc., contending that a line must be drawn to prevent new media like on-line services from taking away the value of a live game or television broadcast of the game. NBC has a four-year, $750 million contract to broadcast NBA games through the 1997-98 season.  ``I was surprised and I was troubled that a major news organization like NBC would take a position that in my judgment is contrary to the First Amendment,'' said Robin Bierstedt, vice president and deputy general counsel of Time Inc., which has no role in this case. ``A basketball game is news, not a performance, and as such should not subject to a proprietary interest of a party.''  Richard Cotton, executive vice president and general counsel at NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., argued that Stats Inc.'s transmissions of the score, the name of the team with possession of the ball and the time remaining in the game could not be construed as news reporting deserving of First Amendment protection.  ``No news organization is in the business of continuous, real-time transmitting of information,'' he said. He contended that, whether televised, broadcast on radio or sent out as continuous updating of numerical scores, such transmissions were not news but virtual recreations of games.  ``It's a real-time presentation of what's going on, on a continuous, nonstop basis,'' he said. ``That's the essence of radio rights, of television rights, and if someone wants to do exactly that on line, he should also have to pay for those rights.''  Stats operates its up-to-the-minute data service by having people listen to radios or watch televisions in various cities and continuously enter the game scores on computers, which transmit the scores to Stats' on-line service and to a satellite service, which beams the information to anyone punching a Sports Trax pager.  The company said that it was merely relaying factual information already in the public domain, not unlike what a fan could get on all-news radio, or the Cable News Network, or Sportsphone.  Sportsphone updates scores every few minutes to callers. But Sportsphone has agreed to abide by limits the NBA has set on how frequently press representatives may issue updates (three times a quarter, with expanded information allowed at halftime and after the game), in exchange for press credentials to attend games.  ``The NBA has taken a position, basically, that unless you are one of their accredited media, or you subscribe to data from their accredited media, you have no right to the information,'' said Andrew L. Deutsch, a partner in Piper &AMP; Marbury, the law firm representing Stats. ``My client's position is it has a right to use any information that's in the public domain.''  Though Judge Preska denied the NBA's claim of copyright infringement (because copyright law protects creative expression in a copyrighted work, but not facts included in the work), she upheld the league's misappropriation claim.  ``I find without hesitation,'' she wrote in her Sept. 3 ruling, ``that these products cross the boundary from mere media coverage of NBA games into competing commercial appropriation of these games.''  She pointed out that the NBA has its own statistics-gathering service, Gamestats, and has plans for selling its data to others. That, she wrote, means Stats' America Online site and the Sports Trax pager are competitors who ``undoubtedly dilute the exclusivity, and thus the value, of the rights the NBA has to offer.''  But Deutsch and his colleagues argue that federal copyright law supersedes New York state misappropriation law. ``You can't use state law to make private property what federal law has declared belongs to the public,'' he said.  He and those who filed briefs supporting Stats' case challenged the judge's interpretation of what is commercially attractive about an NBA game, saying that it is the drama, not the data.  ``A running score is not an account of the game,'' Deutsch said. ``An account is the detailed call of a game, the effort by radio and TV announcers to give you the best seat in the stands, to give you an experience as close as possible of attending the sporting event. People don't go into the arena to raise their heads and look at the scoreboard for 48 minutes.''  George Freeman, assistant general counsel for The New York Times Co., said the NBA demeaned its own product by arguing that numbers displayed on a pager or a computer screen are ``anything like seeing slam dunks or behind-the-back passes.''  ``The notion of someone saying, `Honey, I've got to run into the den and see how the game's going on my computer' rather than on TV is ridiculous,'' Freeman said.  In his amicus brief, Freeman argued that the NBA acknowledged that scores and statistics themselves were not NBA property, in its warning before every telecast, which begins ``This program is authorized under rights granted by the National Basketball Association,'' and forbids unauthorized use of ``the pictures, descriptions or accounts'' of the game, not the numerical facts.  Still, Cotton, NBC's general counsel, said he hoped this case would help strike a new balance between commercial rights and news-reporting rights in the era of new media like on-line services.  ``The technology's only going to get better, so you'll wind up being able to add who scored, how they scored and so on,'' he said. And when that happens in real time, he said, he sees a competitive problems _ when news can be transmitted so fast that it is no longer a news report, but becomes virtual reality. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19961020.0240 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-PAGER-LEGAL-MEDIA-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> COMPANY THAT PROVIDES SCORES VIA PAGER TO APPEAL RULING (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also moving in ``f'' news file.)

As of Friday, the trio had 70 points in 25 games ... The Red Wings have not pulled their four-year, $18 million offer to Sergei Fedorov off the table. Note to Fedorov: Sit down at the table before the bankrolls go cold ... The recent trade of Mike Peluso to the Blues teamed up two of the league's toughest, Peluso and Tony Twist. In his Quebec days, Twist hammered Peluso, knocking him cold for about 45 seconds. ``I remember his quote in the paper the next day,'' said Twist. ``He said, `When I woke up, I thought I could speak French.''' And the Devils' Ken Daneyko on the loss of Peluso: ``It's probably the most emotional I've been about a trade. He cared more about anyone else in the room than about wins and losses.'' Peluso, a key member of the Devils' '95 Cup win, couldn't get along with head coach Jacques Lemaire. Now he's back with Mike Keenan,his former coach with the Blackhawks ... Those mustard-yellow seats at the Fleet might be in keeping with the Bruins' tradition, but they don't enhance the TV product.

EUROPE  LITHUANIA: EX-COMMUNIST NAMED PREMIER  Lithuania's last Communist boss and popular former president, Algirdas Brazauskas, won parliament's approval as the next prime minister after a center-right coalition collapsed in disputes over privatization and the pace of economic reforms. Brazauskas, who has two weeks to form a government, is expected to place greater emphasis on social welfare programs for people in the former Soviet republic but President Valdas Adamkus warned that he would not tolerate any government that undermined Lithuania's strategic goals for reform and entry into the European Union.  GREECE: FIRST MAD COW CASE  The government announced Greece's first case of mad cow disease. The infection in a dairy cow in the north of the country was detected in routine testing dictated by European Union regulations in response to the recent oubreak of the disease in Europe.

ITALY: BERLUSCONI MEETS WITH POPE  Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi had his first private audience with John Paul II since taking office last month. The visit gave the leaders a chance to discuss the pope's pet projects ranging from state support for Catholic schools to globalization and Third World debt relief. As they parted, the 81-year-old pope said to Berlusconi, 64, ``You are a youngster, I am not.''

Muslim Hausas and Christian Jarawas fought over the imposition of Islamic law in one northern state, causing 22,000 people to flee; another 50,000 are said to have fled another state after clashes between the Azara and Tiv ethnic groups over the kiling of a traditional ruler.  ZIMBABWE: UNIONS CALL TWO-DAY STRIKE  The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions called on workers to stay home in a two-day strike that left many businesses shuttered. The workers were protesting a recent increase in gasoline prices. The government declared the strike illegal and sent riot police on patrol, but observers reported that the streets were peaceful and the police reported only a handful of arrests. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010703.0243 type=story > <HEADLINE> PILOTS PROTEST AMERICAN'S PLAN TO FLY AT A LOWER ALTITUDE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WASHINGTON (BC-AMR-PILOT-PROTEST-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"

G. Sebald. (New Directions, $13.95.) A rich stew of history, fiction, reporting, fantasy, travel notes, autobiography, photographs and illustrations, this German-born author's first novel is a spiraling inquiry into the workings of memory, as the narrator reflects on episodes in European history and how they relate to his own origins and inner life. The result is an ``extraordinary, unclassifiable book'' by ``a thrilling, original writer,'' W. S. Di Piero wrote in The New York Times Book Review last year. ``He makes narration a state of investigative bliss.''  GOD'S NAME IN VAIN: The Wrongs and Rights of Religion in Politics, by Stephen L. Carter. (Basic Books, $15.) A Yale law professor and evangelical Episcopalian argues that a religious voice should be welcome in American politics, but warns that religion can lose its integrity and moral bearings when it strays too far into civic affairs. Last year the reviewer Brent Staples found this a provocative, if flawed, book. For one thing, he wrote, ``Carter's contention ... that the state should cede more power to religion will strike many people as a recipe for warfare in the streets.''  PROPERTIES OF LIGHT, by Rebecca Goldstein. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.) In a Gothic novel that explores the darker side of the quest for scientific truth, two physicists who share a noble dream of reconciling the principles of quantum mechanics and relativity become locked instead in a collaboration that leads to hatred, treachery and violence. Last year, Sylvia Brownrigg admired the book's ``cool grace'' and its ``luminous, incendiary imagery.''  AN OBEDIENT FATHER, by Akhil Sharma. (Harvest/Harcourt, $13.) Ram Karan, the main narrator of this ambitious first novel by a young New York investment banker, is a corrupt functionary in the Delhi school system, a vile, guilt-ridden schemer who somehow elicits more pity than disgust despite his voracious appetites. ``At its best'' the tale ``displays some of the most psychologically acute writing to have come out of modern India,'' Akash Kapur wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 2000. ``Sharma's evenhanded treatment of men like Karan ... is wise and compassionate.''  HOME ICE: Reflections on Backyard Rinks and Frozen Ponds, by Jack Falla. (McGregor, $14.95.) In a paean to small-time hockey and its enthusiasts, a sportswriter tells of his lifelong infatuation with the sport and how his homemade rink at his New England home became a gathering ground for family and friends. The result is ``literary hot chocolate that will warm your heart,'' Robert Lipsyte wrote in The New York Times last year.  HILDA AND PEARL, by Alice Mattison. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $13.) An 11-year-old girl coming of age in New York during the McCarthy era uncovers the long-held secrets of her mother and aunt, whose passionate bond endures in the face of tragic events that include a painful betrayal and a baby's death.

G. Sebald. (New Directions, $13.95.) A rich stew of history, fiction, reporting, fantasy, travel notes, autobiography, photographs and illustrations, this German-born author's first novel is a spiraling inquiry into the workings of memory, as the narrator reflects on episodes in European history and how they relate to his own origins and inner life. The result is an ``extraordinary, unclassifiable book'' by ``a thrilling, original writer,'' W. S. Di Piero wrote in The New York Times Book Review last year. ``He makes narration a state of investigative bliss.''  GOD'S NAME IN VAIN: The Wrongs and Rights of Religion in Politics, by Stephen L. Carter. (Basic Books, $15.) A Yale law professor and evangelical Episcopalian argues that a religious voice should be welcome in American politics, but warns that religion can lose its integrity and moral bearings when it strays too far into civic affairs. Last year the reviewer Brent Staples found this a provocative, if flawed, book. For one thing, he wrote, ``Carter's contention ... that the state should cede more power to religion will strike many people as a recipe for warfare in the streets.''  PROPERTIES OF LIGHT, by Rebecca Goldstein. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.) In a Gothic novel that explores the darker side of the quest for scientific truth, two physicists who share a noble dream of reconciling the principles of quantum mechanics and relativity become locked instead in a collaboration that leads to hatred, treachery and violence. Last year, Sylvia Brownrigg admired the book's ``cool grace'' and its ``luminous, incendiary imagery.''  AN OBEDIENT FATHER, by Akhil Sharma. (Harvest/Harcourt, $13.) Ram Karan, the main narrator of this ambitious first novel by a young New York investment banker, is a corrupt functionary in the Delhi school system, a vile, guilt-ridden schemer who somehow elicits more pity than disgust despite his voracious appetites. ``At its best'' the tale ``displays some of the most psychologically acute writing to have come out of modern India,'' Akash Kapur wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 2000. ``Sharma's evenhanded treatment of men like Karan ... is wise and compassionate.''  HOME ICE: Reflections on Backyard Rinks and Frozen Ponds, by Jack Falla. (McGregor, $14.95.) In a paean to small-time hockey and its enthusiasts, a sportswriter tells of his lifelong infatuation with the sport and how his homemade rink at his New England home became a gathering ground for family and friends. The result is ``literary hot chocolate that will warm your heart,'' Robert Lipsyte wrote in The New York Times last year.  HILDA AND PEARL, by Alice Mattison. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $13.) An 11-year-old girl coming of age in New York during the McCarthy era uncovers the long-held secrets of her mother and aunt, whose passionate bond endures in the face of tragic events that include a painful betrayal and a baby's death. Mattison renders her characters' working-class lives ``in spare, graceful detail,'' Joyce Reiser Kornblatt said in 1995. ``Forgiving and wise, `Hilda and Pearl' is a memorable novel about love's resilience.''

In fact, she said, she never was truly sexually satisfied before she met her husband, Mark Levinson, in 1998. ``That is two entire long awful decades of bad sex,'' she said. ``Two. Entire. Decades.''

Its giant wheels have not churned down a working rail line since 1956, when the iron horse was retired by the Southern Pacific Railroad and parked on a county fairground lot in .MDNM/Roseville, Calif. _ left alone, a motionless and often ignored symbol of a bygone era. Then, the Texans came to town. A contingent from Grapevine wants to rescue the engine .MDNM/and reunite No. 2252 with a long-lost sister _ No. 2248 on the Tarantula line that ferries tourists to the Fort Worth Stockyards. But some Californians cannot bear the idea, and keeping the neglected engine has suddenly become a priority.

By Beverly Bundy  DESIGN-EDGY  UNDATED: Way out there, on the forward edge of design, there are chandeliers made of flying saucers and winged salad plates, chaise longues so long and low they have evolved into legless slabs. Then there are the stacking chairs that look like transparent strips of colored gel suspended between spindly legs. Most new ideas in the design firmament blaze like meteors. They streak through the Salone Internazional del Mobile in Milan, (that's the Milan Furniture Fair to you and me), and either fade as quickly as a tea rose or find favor. A very few will eventually become enduring icons of their age. The trip from Milan to icon is perilous.

Through much of the 1960s, the CIA tried to assassinate him. Every U.S. president since Eisenhower has worked to destroy his island's economy. And yet Castro soldiers on, perennially clad in combat fatigues, defiant scowl and bushy whiskers. Which all seems a little surreal when you consider what a fool he is. At least that's how Castro comes across in Showtime's ``Fidel,'' a four-hour movie that airs in two parts Sunday and Monday.

, she noted,	 Some Klan women were suffragettes, Blee discovered, because they believed that the women's vote would counteract votes of African-American men. Some joined because of the temperance movement. ``They would say: `Drink is ruining the family. Who is to blame for that? Catholics,''' said Blee, who was raised in a Roman Catholic family in Fort Wayne. Catholics as well as blacks, she noted, were targets of the early Klan.

, she said,	 In 1991, Blee published ``Women of the Klan: Racism and Gender in the 1920s'' (California).

Once again she focused on women, she said, because ``I wanted to see what it's like to be inside but not a leader.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, she said,	 Generally, women in hate groups were eager to be interviewed by Blee. She made it clear that while she didn't share their beliefs, she said, she wanted ``to give a fair and accurate portrayal of racist groups, and they liked that.'' Some had read her book on the Klan: ``They would say, `I loved your book.' They felt it was fair. They are often caricatured in the media, and they liked being taken seriously.'' Besides, Blee said, ``their family and friends had given up on them.'' She continued, ``Being talked to by a professor was a big event.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz

(Moved in the `a' category)  MIDEAST-MELTDOWN-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ Peace was supposed to come to Israelis and Palestinians under a process by which Israel would gradually yield territory in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the Palestinian Authority would strive to keep Israelis safe, and the antagonists would come to understand and trust each other as they coordinated the handoffs. It was to be a self-reinforcing cycle powered by an incrementalism of ever-more-important, reciprocal concessions and tightening ties. Incrementalism turned out to be as powerful an engine as the framers of the Oslo accords envisioned in 1993. Unfortunately, it has so far proved most effective in reverse. By James Bennet. (Moved in the `i' category)  _ Also moved in the `a' category:  ENRON-LAY-INVEST-REVIEW (Undated) _ How much is enough? That was a question that came up when a lawyer for former Enron CEO Kenneth L. Lay said that Lay had been forced to repeatedly borrow millions of dollars from Enron. He needed the money, the lawyer said, because he owed money to others and had to make payments on those loans. People who can't imagine why someone with hundreds of millions of dollars would borrow money probably don't knwo how very wealthy people _ first-generation, of course _ get to that status. They don't do it by playing it safe. By Floyd Norris.  ENRON-WOMEN-REVIEW (Washington) _ A novelty about the Enron scandal is that, unlike so many other Capitol messes, it features powerful women in starring roles in a controversy that does not involve sex. Nancy Temple, Sherron Watkins, Maureen Castaneda and Martha P. Stuart all have, in one way or another, key roles in the drama. The highest-profile women in other recent scandals, Monica Lewinsky and Anita Hill, were involved with charges of sexual misconduct. A few women, such as Fawn Hall and Rose Mary Woods, figured in non-sex-related scandals like Iran-Contra and Watergate, but not in major ways. By Jill Abramson.  ALI-TYSON-REVIEW (Undated) _ Mike Tyson's style of showman-style intimidation outside the ring really began with Muhammad Ali. He turned verbal sparring into an art form that legions of admirers, from pacifists to pugilists, have tried to emulate. Part circus act, part performance art, part psych job, part street hustle, it combined to become as essential to the Ali myth as his grace in the ring. These pre-bout performances mask the sport's brutality, now personified by Tyson. While Tyson is considered by many to be boxing's nadir, the embodiment of its violence with none of its elan, Ali has continued to grow in stature. By Edward Wong.  WAR-MOVIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ War movies have always served as metaphors for America's attitude toward authority that the armed forces as institutions symbolized. Thus the respect for authority during World War II translated into respect for commanders in war movies. Later, disenchantment with authority translated into disenchantment with authority in Vietnam movies. Now, with a small group of post-Vietnam films, there is a new regard for authority but with a difference _ a difference that again reflects a changed attitude toward authority in America generally. Exhibit A is ``Black Hawk Down. The most obvious difference between this war movie and its predecessors doesn't have anything to do with authority. By Neal Gabler.  PRODUCTIVITY-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Productivity is an economic concept that makes people's eyes glaze over. But rub them and stay awake. It is about to join taxes, budget deficits and the recession as a grass-roots political issue. When Democrats and Republicans lash out at each other over stimulus packages and deficits, productivity _ the output of the economy per hour of work _ is an invisible presence in their arguments. By Louis Uchitelle.  JOKE-SURVEY-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Further proof that all humor is local: excerpts from some of the findings of the British Association for the Advancement of Science's global online survey of jokes.  THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.  _ Also moved in the `i' category:  GOMA-CONGO-REVIEW (Goma, Congo) _ This border city of 400,000 on Congo's eastern edge is undoubtedly one of the most miserable places on earth. Hundreds of thousands of residents outran a volcanic eruption here on Jan. 17. In Goma, disasters are a part of life. It is also refugee central, the way station for desperate Rwandans and desperate Congolese fleeing war on one side of the border or the other. By Marc Lacey. WITH MAP.  COLOMBIA-REBELS-REVIEW (Bogota) _ Many Colombians were relieved when the country's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC _ which is also the largest and richest guerrilla army in Latin American history _ unexpectedly conceded to government demands and agreed to start cease-fire talks. But they were also puzzled. Why now? By Juan Forero.  AFGHAN-PRISONERS-REVIEW (United Nations) _ Are the detainees from Afghanistan being held at Guantanamo prisoners of war? And if not, as the United States maintains, what are they? It is not just their treatment that depends on the answer, but the strength of a coalition in which many partners are becoming anxious about Washington's apparent lack of concern for international rules.

DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. c.2002 New York Times News Service  Woes Keep Piling Up for Condit Campaign  With less than six weeks to go until California's March 5 primaries, the news just keeps getting worse for Rep. Gary A. Condit.  Last week, three more top Democrats announced that they would not support his re-election effort in the state's 18th Congressional District in the upper Central Valley. All three _ Tony Coelho, who held the seat before Condit, and Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, the state's two U.S. senators _ said the fallout from the mysterious disappearance of Chandra Levy, the Capitol Hill intern with whom Condit reportedly had an affair, had ruined his chances of winning a seventh term.  ``Time to move on,'' Coelho said.  ``Time for a change,'' Feinstein said.  ``Time for a fresh start,'' Boxer said.  Then all three called on Democrats to nominate Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza on March 5, saying that of the dozen or so hopefuls competing in the primary, Cardoza, who was once on Condit's staff, was best positioned to keep the 18th District out of Republican hands.  Condit scoffed at this latest demand that he pull out of the race, declaring, ``Not going to walk away.''  He has insisted from the start of the investigation of Levy's disappearance _ an investigation that continues _ that he has no idea what happened to her. The police say that while he has not always been as responsive to their questions as they would have liked, he is nevertheless not a suspect. Still, his poll numbers continue to slump, he is struggling to raise campaign cash and old allies continue to abandon him.  On Death to Terrorists and Life in Senate  What to do with captured terrorists has become an issue in this year's U.S. Senate campaign in South Carolina.  The likely Republican nominee, Rep. Lindsey Graham, whose congressional district covers the northwest corner of the state, says execution would be the right penalty for some of them, especially any convicted by military tribunals. In a letter sent a few days ago to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, Graham said the Defense Department should ``allow the death penalty for convicted war criminals.''  ``Opponents of capital punishment will use every tactic at their disposal to prevent any war criminal from being sentenced to death,'' warned Graham, a former military prosecutor. ``It is my hope that the administration will not give in.''  How did that strike the likely Democratic nominee, Alex Sanders, a former legislator, judge and college president?  Deadly force can be justified in self-defense on the battlefield, Sanders told The Greenville News. But for a military tribunal to impose a death penalty, he went on, would be ``contrary to the will of God.''  South Carolina is one of the nation's most conservative and Republican states, and Sanders acknowledged in his next campaign appearance that his view of capital punishment was ``contrary to what the vast majority of South Carolina believes.'' But, he said, he has been an opponent of capital punishment all his life, even though he believes it to be constitutional.  That struck Trey Walker, Graham's campaign strategist, as a fuzzy, ``Clintonesque'' approach to the issue. The issue, he added, is sure to be ``huge'' in any Graham-Sanders contest.  From Counting Ballots to Counting Dollars  In five congressional campaigns in Florida's 13th District, just south of St. Petersburg, Rep. Dan Miller never spent more than $380,000 to win, and usually considerably less. He did not have to spend more. He is a Republican and the district is heavily Republican.  Miller will not seek a sixth term, though he could almost certainly breeze to victory again if he did. He says it is time to retire.  A number of Republicans are thinking about running for his seat. But only one is given a real shot at winning the nomination: Secretary of State Katherine Harris, she of Election 2000 ballot-counting fame, or notoriety, depending on the ideological point of view.  How much does she figure it will take to win both the primary and general elections?  Two million dollars.  Say what?  It's not easy to run as Katherine Harris, she explains, not even in a Republican-heavy district. A lot of Democrats are still angry, she says, so angry that they would like to make her ``the national punching bag.''  She figures the way to head that off is to outspend them.  Recipes for Election And Mac 'n' Cheese  Back in 2000, when James Kraft first ran for a seat in the Arizona state House of Representatives, he had a problem. Nobody knew who he was. He was new to politics.  But there was that name _ Kraft _ and he really was a bona fide member of the famous foods family.  Then it hit him.  Mac and cheese, the all-time comfort food.  He handed out 12,000 boxes of it.  He won.  Now it's election time again. Again Kraft, a Republican from Phoenix, has a problem.  Name ID.  The lines of his district have been redrawn. A lot of new people are out there who do not know who he is, and he faces at least four challengers, maybe five.  Answer: 40,000 boxes of Kraft mac and cheese. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020126.0099 type=story > <DATELINE> HOUSTON, Texas (BC-A27MUSLIM-SIDER-HNS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz

, he writes,	 The outbreak of the coup _ which involved a defecting Iraqi major general and collaborators in three army combat units, various Kurdish forces and Ahmed Chalabi and his opposition Iraqi National Congress _ was reported a few days later in the international press. The plans were known in Washington before the coup began. But when Baer reported the rebels' first successful attacks, in which they captured thousands of prisoners and some artillery, he writes, CIA officials did not believe him because they had no confirming satellite pictures. </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz

After the Pan Am 103 bombing, he discovered that ``Bonn didn't have a single Middle Eastern agent to run down leads _ neither an Arab nor an Iranian. For that matter, it didn't have a single Muslim agent in all of Germany's enormous Islamic community,'' nor a single source in ``the Frankfurt airport to say whether anything suspicious had occurred before 103's feeder flight departed,'' carrying the bomb that blew up Pam Am 103. </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz

Dozens of writers and performers will participate in ``Permanent Visitor: A Festival Celebrating Dawn Powell in New York'' through March 11. The event includes performances of five plays, a play about her, stage adaptations of her short stories and performers reading from her diaries and novels _ not the touching ones about Ohio, where she was born in 1897, but the witty ones about New York, where she lived for almost half a century. She died in 1965 with virtually all her 15 novels out of print. By Jonathan Mandell. (1,700 words)  With photo NYT33 sent on Jan. 24.  THEATER-OLDIES (New York) _ George M.

Moretti's reputation as a satirist explains the surprise that greeted his latest film, ``La Stanza del Figlio'' (``The Son's Room'') when it came out in Europe last year. The film was praised for its austere emotional power both in Italy and in France, where it won the Palme d'Or, at the Cannes International Film Festival. The movie is Italy's submission for this year's foreign film dd Oscar. ``The Son's Room,'' which opens in New York on Feb. 1, is about a close and loving family hit by an unexpected tragedy.

While the show isn't quite as glossy as ABC's ``Alias'' and hasn't revolutionized the look of television drama the way Fox's ``24'' has, ``Smallville'' peddles its own brand of American corn, which, when served with a pinch of teenage angst, a hint of paranormality and a fresh take on superman, one of the most durable icons in pop culture history, makes an immensely satisfying meal.

MUSIC-PUBLISHER-GERSON (Los Angeles) _ Unlike record producers who help make and market albums or managers who can mold an artist's image, music publishers rarely share in the credit for an artist's success. That is true, in part, because many do little beyond collecting a fee for publishing a song. But the best music publishers not only aggressively promote their artists' work but also work closely with artists' managers to nurture talent.

Their influence increased in the 1880s as they founded factories, which employed mostly female artists. By then, women with increased leisure time began painting china at home, responding to advertisements urging them to buy their own blanks, brushes, paints and kilns. By the 1890s, china painting was a do-it-yourself craze that women across America joined for pleasure or profit. Now the role of women in this movement is recognized with ``Women China Decorators in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,'' on view through April 14. By Rita Reif.

Sept. 11 has made Cuba even more inviting as cruise lines added more Caribbean itineraries. Projections show show that if the ban on travel by Americans to Cuba were lifted, 750,000 American cruise passengers a year would visit Cuba in the first few years and the numbers would grow to 1.8 million in a decade, more if ferry service could be established.

Ignacio Perez, Mexico's Paul Revere, rode out from this city in 1810 to warn the organizers of the War of Independence of a plot to kill them. The last Mexican emperor, Archduke Maximilian, was executed here in 1867 and in 1917 in the Teatro de la Republica, Mexico's Constitution was drafted. ``If you want to walk in history,'' one guide said, ``then this is a city that has worked hard to preserve it.''

FINANCIAL  (Coded `f')  COVER STORIES  ENRON-LAW (Undated) _ All of the things that went wrong at Enron raises one overriding question: Did bad people violate the law or are the laws bad laws that allow these indefensible practices _ selective disclosure, insider trading, conflicts of interest, Chinese wall and Glass-Steagal issues _ to happen? By Diana Henriques and Kurt Eichenwald.  With photo.  WORLD-ECONOMIC-FORUM (Undated) _ The move of the World Economic Forum _ an unparalleled gathering of world leaders, chief executives, academics, writers and other movers and shakers _ from the quiet ski resort of Davos, Switzerland, to the mean streets of Manhattan also mirrors the dramatic shift in the global psyche. Not only has terrorism cast doubts on the ability of globalization to cure all ills; globalization is perhaps the culprit behind the synchronized slowdown of the world economy, the first global downturn since the oil crisis of the 1970s.

Mack took the job running Credit Suisse First Boston last summer, he has been trying to settle the federal investigation into whether CSFB benefited from kickbacks when arranging initial share sales during the Internet boom. This week, with agreement to pay regulators $100 million, he puts that issue behind him. Now can Mack move the firm forward? By Patrick McGeehan. (2,500 words).

MARKET-WATCH (Undated) _ As the Enron saga shows, investors have entered a new world where accountants don't account, managers manipulate and corporate disclosures conceal. And, if an event of last week is any guide, the world has also become one in which the Securities and Exchange Commission may act to thwart enforcement of securities laws. By Gretchen Morgenson.  With graphic.  ADDITIONAL FEATURES  HOMESTORE (Undated) _ Until late summer, Homestore, a Westlake Village, Calif., company that runs the Internet site for the National Association of Realtors, was hailed as an online powerhouse in the making. But a stream of bad news, including disclosures of accounting irregularities, has poured out in recent weeks, and its rapid rise and fall place it among some of the biggest flameouts of the Internet bubble. By Miguel Helft. (2,500 words)  With graphic.  PROFILE-ADAMSON-KMART _ James B. Adamson, a corporate turnaround specialist hired by Kmart as chairman to help rescue it from bankruptcy court, is a veteran of overhauls at Revco, Burger King and Advantica. He will focus on rebuilding relationships with employees, customers and vendors. He said he plans to meet this week with Martha Stewart, doyen of KMart's best-known brand name. ``He is a healer. A calmer-downer,'' described one business school professor. An employee of Advantica, which owns Denny's recalls his first day on the job. It brought tears to her eyes when he said intensely, ``We do not discriminate. anybody who does will be fired.''  By Micheline Maynard.

Kevin McCloskey, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors, which owns more than four million Tyco shares, talked last week about prospects for the new Tycos in a Q &AMP; A interview with Kenneth L. Gilpin.  INVEST-AMC-THEATERS (Undated) _ After years of overbuilding that left many movie theater companies reeling, some analysts say it may be time to invest in the industry. With almost $1.3 billion in revenue and more than 2,800 screens, AMC Entertainment is high on many analysts' lists as the only big public theater operating company that has avoided major financial problems. By Joanne Legomsky. (800 words)  With graphic.  FEE-BASED-ACCOUNTS (Undated) _ Brokerage firms have been shifting investors to fee-based accounts. Although much of the impetus behind the trend reflects a Wall Street strategy to produce a steadier stream of revenue, some investors welcome the chance to pay fixed fees for a bundle of services, including buying and selling stocks and bonds.

HIRING-SURVEY (Undated) _ A hiring survey released last week suggests that the outlook is not so bad for those in sales and marketing. Of 200 corporate executives questioned last month by Management Recruiters International, 41 percent planned to expand sales staffs in the first half of this year. By Vivian Marino. (175 words)  ALLISON-PR (San Francisco) _ With pink-slip contagion sweeping the Bay Area, it looked as if Scott Allison's days as the No. 2 executive at a public relations agency might be coming to an end. So he did what an increasing number of senior managers are doing: He set up his own company. He and five colleagues put up the money to take over the two California offices of the old company, including furniture, and started Allison &AMP; Partners with 21 people on the payroll. ``I get to start with two offices, an experienced staff and the ability to go after a decent-sized account,'' he explained.

At the time, the agreement was hailed for being one of the largest restitutions ever for deceptive consumer practices. Millions of consumers received checks, some averaging $68, but many were for as little as a penny. By Dylan Loeb McClain. (368 words)  STYLE  (Coded `L')  DAVOS-PARTIES (New York) _ The World Economic Forum has long been known as the world's largest cocktail party for millionaires, heads of state, corporate leaders, cultural and academic figures and others who influence the world economy. Manhattan, where the forum opens next week, may lack the ski slopes of Davos, Switzerland, where the participants usually meet, but it will more than make up for it with the party scene. The parties are even drawing Bono and Peter Gabriel. ``Es Peter Gabriel un politico aleman?'' asked one foreign official. By Alex Kuczynski.

TRUNK-SHOWS (Undated) _ After the fall and spring runway shows, designers give some customers a head start by putting the collections in a trunk show months before the clothes arrive in the stores. ``For the client, it's a festival, an event,'' said Hank Greenberg, vice president of Coplon's, a chain of boutiques in the Southeast. Trunk shows are particularly important to his customers, he said, because ``it makes them feel closer to New York, Paris and Milan.'' By Elizabeth Hayt.

CATTRALL-SATISFACTION (New York) _ Kim Cattrall, the actress who plays the bed-hopping Samantha on HBO's ``Sex &AMP; The City,'' has written ``Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm.'' In the introduction she punctures the Samantha myth, relating how for much of her adult life she didn't think much of sex. In fact, she said, she never was truly sexually satisfied before she met her husband, Mark Levinson, in 1998. ``That is two entire long awful decades of bad sex,'' she said. ``Two. Entire. Decades.'' Now Cattrall and Levinson want to tell couples the secret of everlasting sexual satisfaction: Be lucky enough to find your true love, and then be absolutely honest. By Alex Kuczynski.

OLYMPIC-ENDORSEMENTS (Undated) _ Sarah Schleper, last year's U.S. slalom champion and Jean Racine, the world's No. 1 bobsled driver, possess what marketers call the Wheaties factor, a blend of sex appeal, salty wit, wholesomeness and spunk. Those are the virtues that commend them to advertisers, who as early as last fall began splashing their faces on products. As the date gets closer to the Games on Feb. 8, corporate America will be showing how they have placed their bets on a few athletes who may or may not become household names. By Ruth La Ferla.

, he said,	 Khan recovered, and two years later returned to Afghanistan to lead his troops once more against the Taliban. For the young Hekmati, the success of his plan was not all easy to bear. Two of his relatives were arrested by the Taliban after the escape and tortured, accused of aiding the escape. The fingernails of one were ripped out, he said, and the other lost an eye as the interrogators demanded to know the whereabouts of Hekmatullah. </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, we thought,	 ``My dream to have flat land for growing oranges started when I went to California 30 years ago,'' said Ryotaro Nishigaya, the president of the local growers association, as he looked at the unnaturally flat farmland taking shape, cupped by steep hills where groves had been abandoned. ``When the highway project was announced, we thought, `Here is our big chance to make our dream come true.''' </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, he added,	 ``As farmers got older, people stopped growing in steep areas, and the mountains grew barren,'' Nishigaya said, his conversation punctuated by random thuds of an automatic air gun used to scare birds from his trees. Surveying a low-level grove where white plastic sheets reflected winter sun into the trees, sweetening the fruit, he added, ``By flattening the mountain, we hope to attract younger people into orange growing.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz

, she says,	 She makes it clear: She doesn't want terrorists threatening her new country. If the Feds can show her clients are terrorists, she says, then prove it. Otherwise, she says, don't sweep up immigrants who came to the U.S. to escape secret police and late-night banging at the door. </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, he said,	 Wells chuckled when recalling this and other banter. In previous years, at reunion gatherings, the guys would rarely tease him, he said, because the effects of his injuries and the heavy dosages of medication were too obvious and troubling. While they would play hockey or golf, Wells would rest in the car or back at the hotels. </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, he explained,	 But recently, in New York, when he kept chattering, one said, ``We liked you better on morphine.'' Another told him, ``Cut your hair, you big hippie.'' Wells discussed these things while sitting, not very still, on a big, leather couch. As he spoke, he moved his head rapidly from side to side, his eyes shifting back and forth, his hand moving rapidly up and down. Teammates razz you, he explained, when they are happy for you and comfortable with you again. But when one of them joshed that ``I'm going to take you out'' with a body check, Wells turned serious and said, ``One blow and I could be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, she said,	 His risk level also brings mixed emotions to his friends back in Michigan, including Dr. Heidi von Oetinger-Reed, a teacher who has a doctorate in aerospace science. ``He still has a lot of nerve damage and scar tissue,'' she said. But she also said it might hurt Wells to be kept out of the exhibition. ``I fear it will break his spirit,'' von Oetinger-Reed said. ``When Mark sleeps, he dreams about this. It's something he needs to do.'' At his worst, she said, Wells isolated himself. </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, I says,	 ``I told the neurosurgeon, I says, `This morphine's really getting to my head,''' Wells said. ``I says, `I don't want to take it no more. You've got to do something about it.''' The neurosurgeon sent him to a pain specialist for a fourth operation that eased his suffering, at least for now. </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, he cried,	 Physically, he also felt the sweet soreness in his leg muscles he had not felt for years. Psychologically, he felt what he called a rebirth. He called people on the phone, including his father. ``My dad, he cried,'' Wells said. ``I said, `Dad, I'm tearing, too, man. Just hang with me.''' </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, he said,	 Wells said he still has a way to go for full recovery. Until recently, he said, he used 160 milligrams of morphine every day in two doses, 12 hours apart. ``I went cold turkey,'' he said of his withdrawal, enduring the cold sweats and other symptoms alone. ``It's been four months now. Relapsed a couple times. But I'm still going to fight it.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, he said,	 Wells now exudes joy and ambition. He said he is establishing a business that will include selling wood, plowing snow, clearing trees, demolishing homes and building things. He cannot do the heavy work himself, he said, so he is hiring and training workers. He said he wants to write a book about his life. He said he has never avoided a challenge, and he was surprised by how easily skating came back to him after so long. ``I always said I can skate better than I can walk,'' he said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, he said,	 Prince Nawwaf confirmed the existence of the survey but did not address the level of support. He attributed the support to what he called the feelings of the people against the United States, largely, he said, because of its unflinching support of Israel against the Palestinians. </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, he said,	 Even Saddam's overthrow would not increase regional stability, he said. ``If you succeed, you will divide Iraq into three parts,'' he said. Iraq would be splintered into a Shiite Muslim-run government in the south, a Kurdish-run government in the north and a Sunni-Muslim run government in the center, he said, adding, ``I don't think America will support that.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, he said,	 Moran said he was shocked by Baxter's death because he had had neither financial problems nor a major hand in the company's decline. But, he said, Baxter had always been concerned about the fate of workers when he was buying or selling companies. </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, she said,	 Gutmann, who has taught at Princeton for more than two decades, said that she had encouraged Appiah to leave Harvard for Princeton on several occasions in the late 1990s, but that he had insisted until recently he was ``not movable.'' The conversations intensified, she said, after she was appointed provost, the university's chief academic officer, on Sept. 1. </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, he said,	 One of the compounds, he said, housed the district government offices and the other was a school where other government workers were staying. Agha said the two groups had been involved in a dispute over food supplies. He said the school was also being used to store vehicles and weapons that had been taken from residents in the area after the Taliban fled. </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, he said,	 He said the helicopters took off about half an hour after the shooting ended, and within minutes of their departure both compounds were hit with bombs or missiles. He added that he went to the battle site later and saw what he estimated were 60 to 65 dead. An additional 27 were missing, he said, and presumed taken by the U.S. forces. </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, he said,	 Learning to live his life again, he said, will take time. </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, he says,	 Khan, a college-trained pharmacist, joined the jihad, or holy war, like thousands of other Pakistanis who crossed over into Afghanistan. He worked as a medical orderly near Kabul, shuttling to the front lines and picking up bodies and parts of bodies. Of 43 men who boarded a truck to travel with him to Afghanistan in October, he says, 41 were killed. </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, he said,	 ``There is no concept of jihad as aggressive combat,'' he said, quoting verses of the Koran that Islamic theologians have argued over for centuries. In misreading these texts, he said, bin Laden had relied on ``personal psychological needs,'' including a ``tribal urge for revenge.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, he said,	 While Democrats argue that Bush has cut taxes that largely help the rich, the GOP candidate said he is ``happy that we are cutting taxes in Florida and not raising taxes.'' The result, he said, ``is that for the first time in modern times, Floridians have more money in their pockets'' than does state government. </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, he said,	 Taking another jab at Democrats, Bush said, ``Our opponents' philosophy'' to crime is to reduce sentences and ``give them a little therapy.'' Republicans, he said, favored longer mandatory sentences, tough gun laws and swift justice. </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, he added,	 Gene Orza, associate general counsel of the players' union, said it would not waive existing rules to allow owners, at their choosing, to take players with them to their new teams. It would be a different matter, he added, if players, on a voluntary basis, were provided with the same opportunity as managers and executives. If Guerrero, for example, wanted to accompany Loria to Florida, Orza said, he should be permitted to go. </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, he added,	 Dombrowski said he would miss the pitching staff he developed in Florida out of the ashes of the demolished 1997 World Series champions. He would miss it so much, he added, that ``no disrespect to the people here, but if you had asked me whether I'd want to take the four people I brought here or the pitching staff, the pitching staff would have won out.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, he said,	 ``You have the Ken Lays of the world who will soon be giving depositions about what the meaning of `is' is, and then you have George Mitchell,'' said John E. Olson, an energy-industry analyst with Sanders Morris Harris in Houston. Mitchell, he said, is ``retiring undefeated.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, he recalls,	 But he wondered whether following in their footsteps would satisfy him. A professor had told him, he recalls, that if he worked for an oil company, ``You can drive around in a pretty good Chevrolet. But if you want to drive around in a Cadillac, you'd better go out on your own.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, he recalled,	 He built up a core of supporters in Galveston and Houston, he recalled, and those early partners were ``tough as hell'' when a well wasn't successful. He especially remembers the response of one, William Zinn, a lawyer. </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, I think,	 ``This year will be the first time anybody has ever played it this way, the changes and everything,'' Daly said. ``The course is, I think, 400 to 500 yards longer. That's an awful lot of length added to a golf course.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz

, she said,	 ``They did something incredibly stupid,'' Pralle said of her sons. ``Nonetheless, these are children. There was really no malice involved. These kids were devoted to the school.'' Instead of helping her boys, she said, Ridgefield Academy rejected them. ``It was, `We want you out of here, we don't want you on this property again, you are not part of this community, we have nothing to say to you.''' </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, he added,	 ``These kids stole the keys from the janitor,'' Stimola said. ``Teachers found meat cleavers in the prekindergarten playground in the morning. That was very, very disturbing.'' The school handbook, he added, is explicit that punishment for theft or vandalism may include expulsion, which is not grounds for a tuition refund. </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz

, he said,	 Diamond said he had understood that his group's contribution did not have to be in cash, which it has little of, but could be in sweat equity. His band of volunteers has, since 1995, logged 85,000 hours of work on the project, he said, labor that by his calculations is worth more than $3 million at a fair market rate. ( Diamond added that he charged $6,000 on his own credit card over the last several months to rent jackhammers.) </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz

, you know,	 Word around the Bruins dressing room is that forward Andrei Nazarov, who was dealt to Phoenix Friday for a fifth-round draft pick, asked management for a trade. Nazarov had been getting little ice time in a fourth-line role and spending more time fighting than playing. He indicated he wanted to go to a team that would allow him to play regularly and not have to be an enforcer. Nazarov, 27, was a high draft pick in 1992 when he was taken by San Jose at No. 10 overall. After stops with the Sharks and Tampa Bay, Nazarov had 32 points (10 goals) in his only full season in Calgary, 1999-2000. He had a career-high 12 goals in 1996-97 with San Jose. Word is he would like to put up numbers like that again instead of putting up his dukes. His departure means more pressure on Boston's newest folk hero, P.J. Stock. Although the Bruins have plenty of players who can stick up for themselves, coach Robbie Ftorek would rather Bill Guerin, Sean O'Donnell, Joe Thornton etc., stay out of the penalty box. When asked about the likelihood of his duties expanding, Stock shrugged. ``Oh well,'' he said, feigning nonchalance but clearly loving the possibilities. ``Ding, ding.'' . . . Ken Hitchcock's firing in Dallas was a long time coming. Despite consistently good results (a Stanley Cup title, five straight division crowns) over the six years he was behind the bench, his shelf life had expired. His players were no longer listening. So, how is it that Scotty Bowman has managed to stay behind the Red Wings' bench for nine years? Easy. He doesn't talk to his players . . . Think the Devils wish all their games could be in South Florida? After a 3-1 win last week, the Devils' record against the Panthers in the Sunshine State is 13-1-2 since 1998-99, including a pair of postseason victories . . . Brian Sutter's Blackhawks, who will be in town Monday night to face the Bruins, ended the Blues' franchise-record 10-game winning streak Friday night. Blues goaltender Brent Johnson had been wearing the same gray suit to every game. ``It's been dry-cleaned, you know, four times,'' said Johnson prior to the Chicago game. Guess he'll be wearing a new one now . . . Give Edmonton forward Todd Marchant full marks for facing the music after coach Craig MacTavish benched him for the second period of Wednesday's game against Colorado. MacTavish, who was traded to the Rangers from Edmonton for Marchant in March 1994, hasn't been happy all year with the way Marchant has played. ``He said I bring three things to the table: speed, grit, and heart,'' said Marchant. ``But since the beginning of the season, I hadn't brought grit and heart to the games.'' Marchant said he was upset with himself for his play on a goal by Colorado defenseman Adam Foote. After Marchant lost the draw, he said he ``flamingoed,'' lifting one foot to avoid getting hit by the shot. ``I didn't consciously do it,'' he said. ``It was embarrassing to do something like that. I let my teammates down.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz
, they say,	 Jermaine O'Neal, Duncan, Kidd, and Antonio McDyess are believed to be the best of the bunch who can be free agents in the summer of 2003. Alas, there's a problem. League executives believe that, despite the new TV deal, the salary cap will go down next season for the first time since its implementation in 1983. It's at $42.5 million this season. A lot of the teams anticipating big cap space next summer (Orlando, Miami) were hoping for a cap in the high 40s. That seems highly unlikely now. In addition, teams now feel there won't be a luxury tax for this season, but there is certain to be one for 2002-03. That doesn't bode well for the Celtics, who are determined not to pay a tax but already are perilously close to the presumed threshold without factoring in any draft picks or re-signed free agents . . . The Mavericks have done quite nicely without the valuable Michael Finley (10 of 11), and have you happened to notice who is starting in his place? It's old friend Adrian Griffin. ``He's like one of those old Celtic throwbacks,'' said Mavericks assistant coach Donnie Nelson. ``He knows how to play. He plays for the right reasons. We like him for the same reasons you guys did.'' While with Boston, Griffin was given the nickname ``Old School'' because of the way he played. His nickname in the Big D: ``Mitch'' after musician Mitch Griffin, who, they say, has great hands. ``(Griffin) has the best hands in the NBA,'' Nelson said. ``It's unbelievable how many balls he comes up with. It's an uncanny gift. You know, there's nothing that really stands out about his game. But he's always in the right place at the right time and, after a while, you realize it's not an accident.'' . . . Brad Miller's fine and suspension from the Shaquille O'Neal melee has been appealed by the Players Association. The association is not expecting much leniency, however. Unless the thing is resolved prior to the hearing (maybe reduced by half, for instance), the one who makes the final decision is the same guy who imposed the suspension: commissioner David Stern (or his designate) . . . The Bulls went to great lengths to distance themselves from the Great Lights Out controversy last weekend prior to Jordan's first game at the United Center as a Wizard. Jordan was close to tears during a 70-second standing ovation that was still going strong when the house lights went off for the introduction of the Bulls. The thinking at the time was that Jordan was being cut short by his former team. But the Bulls say the decision to turn off the lights and go on with the pregame program came from NBC, not them. They pointed out that they even switched the routine, making coach Doug Collins the first instead of the last to be introduced, so MJ could get his due. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020127.0025 type=story > <HEADLINE> IT'S TIME FOR SOME REFLECTION </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> BOSTON (BC-GLF-NOTEBOOK-BOS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200201.gz

But now, at what should be the pinnacle of his career, Mendelsohn finds himself in the middle of accusations surrounding two companies: Enron, whose collapse is the subject of intense scrutiny by Congress and regulators, and ImClone Systems, a biotechnology company that is being accused of misleading investors about the possible approval of a drug that Mendelsohn was instrumental in developing.

"121721"	"she"	"wrote"	" The idea of giving new parents more time to fulfill tenure requirements has proved controversial among the rank and file, too. Last winter, when The Chronicle of Higher Education held an online discussion about the new model policy, many respondents were ferociously against special rights for moms (one labeled them prima donnas). And some of these respondents were women. One professor who teaches philosophy at Rice University declared herself ``tired of children and breeders getting all the consideration all the time.'' An assistant dean at Ferris State University in Big Rapids, Mich., complained of ``maternity leaves, restricted scheduling and all sorts of 'emergencies''' that put childless people ``in a position of assuming tasks from those who do have children.`` Realize, she wrote, that with childbearing ``comes sacrifice and additional responsibilities.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"

MIDEAST-NIDAL (Jerusalem) _ Abu Nidal, the Palestinian whose name became a byword for international terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s, was found dead three days ago in his Baghdad apartment with multiple gunshot wounds, according to a Palestinian newspaper. So far, however, there has been no confirmation. By Serge Schmemann.  RUSSIA-HELICOPTER (Moscow) _ A Russian military helicopter, the largest kind in the world, crash-lands near an airbase in Grozny, Chechnya, with more than 110 on board. Information is filtering out slowly. About 35 soldiers are in the hospital; the remainder, about 85, are unaccounted for at present. It is possible they were killed in the crash-landing. The pilot, who survived, was interviewed by Russian media. By his account, he heard a loud noise in the right engine, got a warning light, and requested emergency permission to land. Some accounts say that he landed in a minefield _ a real possibility, given the proximity of the airbase. Chechen rebels claim they shot it down, but the Russian Defense Ministry said the problem was a fire in the engine. By Steven Lee Myers.  With a map.

NATIONAL GENERAL  (Will move in ``a'' news file.)  NC-KORAN-STUDIES (Chapel Hill, N.C.) _ After the attacks of Sept. 11, colleges across the country were rushing to teach more about Islam. But as students return to campus this year, a fight over a summer reading assignment at the University of North Carolina is proving how difficult tolerance can be. Freshmen had been assigned a book about the Koran and will meet Monday to discuss it. But the assignment has led to court battles, with a conservative Christian group charging that the assignment represents ``forced Islamic indoctrination.'' The state Senate is debating a bill that would deny aid to the university unless it gives equal time to ``all known religions.'' By Kate Zernike.  AMTRAK-ACELA (Dateline TK) _ Amtrak put nine of its Acela Express passenger trains back into duty in the Northeast Corridor on Monday, but the railway's president said it will be days before the high-speed service returns to full strength. Repair work continued on nine other Acela Express trains. All 18 were sidelined most of last week after inspectors found cracks in shock-absorbing assemblies beneath many of the locomotives.

NY-THEATER-OUTLOOK (New York) _ Doomsayers have good reason to be concerned about the health of the theater in New York City _ a precipitous decline in advance ticket sales, a host of longtime hits posting closing notices, the usual September doldrums around the corner exacerbated by this year's 9/11 anniversary. But just as producers girded themselves for the worst after Sept. 11 only to see Broadway set attendance records, the last two weeks have shown a similar resilience.

They are also threatened with extinction. A group of antitax crusaders is trying to dissolve the county's libraries in what the American Library Association says may be the first attempt to shutter an entire county library system by referendum. Over the last decade, parts of the rural West have had tax revolts against schools, now comes what may be the first tax revolt against books. The library lies inside the general store in the tiny community of Onion Creek, Wash. Even its current once-a-week hours will be eliminated if a ballot initiative succeeds. (Jeff T.

That, along with some stranger items like a basset hound, a $10,000 diamond ring, $9,999 in cash stuffed into a pair of socks and two sets of false teeth, makes the task of sorting and returning as much as possible a formidable one.

Their most charismatic national politician and party leader, Gregor Gysi, abruptly resigned late last month in a bizarre scandal over the personal use of frequent-flier miles earned on the job. The party sold the witty Gysi hard as an antidote to its old reputation as the dour, doctrinaire Communists who built the Berlin Wall. Now, the former Communists' plans to go national seem dreamlike.

The plant owner, Oleg V. Gordiiko, a stout, ruddy-faced former metals trader, gives tours with a look of pride. The plant has attracted attention recently for two reasons. It is suspected by the American music and film industries of turning out counterfeit compact discs. Its other remarkable trait is its location: A sign on the tall factory gate proclaims that the site belongs to none other than the Kremlin itself.

Vernadsky, a Soviet geochemist, reflecting on his world, made a startling observation: through technology and sheer numbers, he wrote, people were becoming a geological force, shaping the planet's future just as rivers and earthquakes had shaped its past. Aided by satellites and supercomputers, and mobilized by the evident environmental damage of the last century, humans have a real chance to begin balancing economic development with sustaining earth's ecological webs, said Dr. William C. Clark, a biologist at Harvard who heads an international effort to build a scientific foundation for such a shift. That prospect, however slim, is attracting more than 100 world leaders and thousands of other participants to the U.N. World Summit on Sustainable Development, which starts on Monday in Johannesburg. No matter what they come up with, ice ages, volcanoes and shifting tectonic plates will dwarf human activities in the long run. But communities and countries face concrete choices in the next decade that are likely to determine the quality of human life and the environment well into the 22nd century. By Andrew C.

He had aimed his digital video camera at the shuttle Columbia as it returned to Earth on Feb. 1; living near Dallas, in the path of the returning shuttle, he had caught the sight on video several times before.  When he viewed the images in light of the shuttle's loss, he thought he might have captured a crucial moment. He read about the shuttle's yawing spin before breakup and sent an e-mail message to a reporter.  ``That description matches perf%ctMy with what I caught on video that morning,'' he wrote. He had zoomed in on the shuttle as it hurtled by and captured it flying sideways, he wrote, adding, ``I believe I am the only one who has a clear close-up video of this event.''  He had given a copy of his videotape to NASA two days after the accident, and the space agency came back and bought his camera so that researchers could determine whether the digital images stored in ones and zeros on the tape showed what McNew claimed. And he waited to hear whether he had made history.  In the video nation, almost no moment goes untaped, and anyone might be the next Abraham Zapruder, whose jumpy images of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy provided invaluable evidence to a generation of investigators (and conspiracy theorists).  The nearly ubiquitous cameras grab images of mothers slapping their children in parking lots and Rodney King being beaten _ and, as it turns out, the space shuttle Columbia during its descent. Some 3,000 people contacted NASA in the days after the shuttle disaster to offer their firsthand reports, still photographs and videos of the shuttle's entry into the atmosphere. Ultimately, some 12,000 videos and images streamed in.  For weeks, researchers combed through the photographs and videos, going to great lengths to verify that each was what its donor claimed that it was. Some turned out to be hoaxes, and a few were not even pictures of the shuttle. The researchers then culled the best and stitched together a video narrative of the flight.  And it has paid off: The images have provided a trove of data that has helped investigators piece together what happened in the final minutes of the flight.  NASA and the independent board investigating the accident have spliced video images together to tell the story of the shuttle's final descent, showing when and where major pieces of debris came off the orbiter.  The imagery has helped NASA guide debris searchers, and has helped to show that the shuttle was shedding parts before the signs of serious trouble appeared on sensors that could be read by mission control on the ground.  The process of determining which videos provided the most useful information fell to a team drawn largely from NASA's Image Science and Analysis Group, at the Johnson Space Center, which has long analyzed images of spacecraft during missions.  These analysts are practiced in enhancing images to bring out details that may otherwise go unnoticed.  The wroup hqs usut0vhabout 80 seconds after liftoff, and has even aided police in criminal investigations based on photographic evidence.  The team painstakingly analyzed every still photo and video, checking to see whether they were altered in any way. In some cases the investigators even bought the cameras from peo`l%(who had particularly promising footage, like McNew, to see if they could re-create the conditions under which the video was shot, to check colors to make sure they were accurate, and to figure out how to sharpen the pictures more effectively. ``Any footage that we can obtain is important to NASA,'' said a member of the video team.  The team's leader, Paul Hil,,  missions operation director for the space shuttle, presented the video results last month to the independent board investigating the shuttle disaster. He said all but about a minute or two of the shuttle's path over the United States had been filmed. (There ms0c gap between Albuquerque, N.M., and Dallas, which Hill said was not surprising, considering the sparse population in that area.)  (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)  On the videos, flashes and bright dots of debris leaving the orbiter gave important clues to when and where pieces of the shuttle were lost on its way back to Earth, and to help identify which ``debris events'' seemed most important. A bright flash of 6 to 12 seconds and signs of an object breaking away from the shuttle led NASA to send debris recovery teams to Caliente, Nev., to search for the object, called Debris No. 6, that was tracked by radar on the way down. So far, nothing has been recovered from that snow-covered area, but searches are expected to continue.  The brightest flash occurred over Arizona, and the flash persisted for nearly 8 seconds, depending on which video is viewed. That flash, and the image of bright dots falling away, was called Debris No. 14.  The NASA video team used some ingenious techniques to fix the time of the video bits, sometimes relying on celestial clues. The video of the Debris No. 6 flash, for example, showed the shuttle flying in front of Venus. ``When our flight dynamics folks saw this, they were very excited because this allowed us to put this video within plus or minus a second,'' Hill told the independent commission investigating the incident. Because they knew the location of the person making the video, the research team was able to use astronomical data to establish the precise moment that the video was shot.  The teams are also analyzing the images in hopes of gleaning spectroscopic data from the flashes, to determine precisely what was burning in any given flash _ whether aluminum or silica or the reinforced carbon-carbon composite that makes up the leading edge of the shuttle's wings.  Hill had high praise for the volunteer videographers. ``These people are definitely our heroes,'' he said.  Not everyone was so heroic, however. Some of the early submissions were hoaxes, and researchers spend valuable time having to deb unk them. ``They have been able to sort out the hoaxes and the false images and the artifacts from the things that are real,'' said Doug White, an official at the NASA contractor United Space Alliance, who has been working with the video team.  Some were laughably inept, like the video submitted to NASA that clearly showed a bright spot moving across the screen, but turned out to be cars driving down the road past the camera with their headlights on. Then there were the widely circulated photos billed as Israeli satellite images of Columbia exploding in space. They were actually taken from the 1998 movie ``Armageddon.''  Other people with video had profit in mind. ``There have been two isolated cases out West of two individuals who strung us to collect on the Columbia gravy train,'' Hill told members of the board.  (END OPTIONAL TRIM)  In the case of McNew, NASA concluded that he had not, in fact, captured a video image of the shuttle flying sideways. Video analysis showed that the camera distorted the image, producing a visual halo that made it appear several times the size it would be if the picture had been clear.  Still, said John Ira Petty, a spokesman for NASA, ``We really are grateful to these people; we need all of the information we can get.''  McNew said he was disappointed, but happy to have helped in some way. ``It was exciting to think that I possibly had something,'' he said. ``My new motto is, `Life is unpredictable, so keep a camera nearby and catch it.'

A word-frequency count of the speeches delivered during the first three days of the conventions showed that strong and strength were used 141 times. Hope came in a distant, but strong, second, with 98 mentions. Values came in third at 89.  THE ISSUES: The same word-frequency counts showed that health care (161 mentions) and jobs (127) are the issues the Democrats think will help them win in November.  THE WINNERS: Other than Kerry and Sen. John Edwards, the big winners of the convention were Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.  Clinton may not be a candidate, but Elvis, as he is sometimes called, is clearly his party's star. Among other things in his speech on Monday night, he thanked the Republicans for pursuing tax policies that allow him to keep so much of the money he's been making since leaving the White House.  Tuesday was Obama's turn. A 42-year-old candidate for the Senate from Illinois, Obama is handsome, a graduate of Harvard and Columbia and the child of a black African father and a white American mother. And if he went to the podium a political youngster, he came back a star.  A week ago, he said later, people were calling me Alabama and 'yo mama.' But after his audacity of hope speech, those days seemed long gone.  THE ENEMY OF MY ENEMY: I'm using them. We can use each other. So said Ron Reagan, son of the late Republican President Ronald Reagan, about the Democratic leaders who gave him time to speak Tuesday in favor of embryonic stem cell research, and against those in the Bush administration who oppose such research.  NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME: An estimated 15,000 journalists showed up in Boston, dwarfing the number of delegates, but the major TV networks restricted their coverage to one hour a night, for three of the four nights. Gerald M. Rafshoon, who was Jimmy Carter's television adviser, called the networks' decision a complete disgrace, but the networks and their news anchors defended their decision by saying that the conventions were not news, but scripted campaign events. Perhaps more to the point, network viewership for these events has been in steady decline since 1992.  MAKING THE MOST OF THE MOMENT: Conventions usually serve up large quantities of red-meat oratory. This year, however, Kerry put out the word that speakers were to accentuate the positive and to avoid angry partisanship. (John Edwards, in his speech, never even mentioned Bush.) Almost everyone followed orders, but not Al Sharpton.  On Wednesday, Sharpton, who is said to have promised convention organizers that he would speak for seven minutes, went on for 20, delivering a largely improvised attack on Bush and the Republicans. I suggest to you tonight that if George Bush had selected the court in '54, Clarence Thomas would have never got to law school, Sharpton said to the cheering delegates in one of a set of high-energy digs.  SECRET STEREOTYPES: The National Journal reported that it had learned the code names that the Secret Service and others will be using for Kerry, Edwards and Teresa Heinz Kerry. Kerry, the Bostonian, is Minuteman. John Edwards, from the part of the country where NASCAR reigns, is Speedway. More perplexingly, Heinz Kerry is Mahogany.  THE BIG FINISH: At the end of John Kerry's speech, a sea of red, white and blue balloons were to cascade to the convention floor, but some failed to drop. The convention's executive producer, Don Mischer, frantically began asking, 'What's happening with the balloons, we need more balloons, we need all of them coming down, before uttering an epithet recently employed by the vice president. Sadly for Mischer, millions of CNN viewers were eavesdropping at the time. The network anchor apologized.  IF CLINTON COULD RUN AGAIN . . .  At the convention last week, former President Bill Clinton was embraced ecstatically by the Democratic faithful. That led some Democrats to wonder: What would happen if Clinton was running instead of John Kerry? Would he beat President Bush?  Not only do I think Clinton would win, but I think he would win by a substantial margin, said Larry J. Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. Given a choice between what happened under Clinton in the '90s and what has happened under Bush's tenure, there is no doubt the people would choose the Clinton conditions.  Few political strategists imagine that a Bush-Clinton contest would be a typical issue-driven race.  These two presidents stir the passions of supporters and detractors, political strategists said, and the election would ultimately become a battle over trust.  I think it would be a very competitive race, said David Axelrod, a Democratic political consultant in Chicago. Having said that, there is no doubt President Clinton engendered strong feelings in people and that hasn't probably changed, so it would be a dogfight.  A political consultant to Bush, Charles Black, said the challenge for Bush would be similar to what it is now -- to convince the American people that he is on the right track. And that, Black said, would be easier against Clinton because of his personal scandals.  Clinton's a better campaigner than Kerry, Black said. But he is a completely polarizing figure, and, by the time he left office, most of the independent voters outside the Democratic base were embarrassed about his personal escapades and were happy to see him go.  Douglas Schoen, a longtime pollster for Clinton, however, dismissed the notion of Clinton fatigue. While undeniably Mr. Clinton has some negatives, when he left office two-thirds of the people were satisfied with his job performance.  The big issue of today, the war on terror, could cut both ways, political analysts said. There are stark ideological differences, from Clinton's focus on treaties and coalitions with other countries, to Bush's more go-it-alone strategy.  I think the single fundamental difference between the two candidates would be their view of the world and America's role in the world, a former political director to Clinton, Douglas Sosnik, said. Bush appears to be one of the few people in the world who does not see the world as interconnected.  Of course, thanks to the Constitution, the Bush vs. Clinton fantasy will never be tested, allowing strategists to debate the possibilities until well past November.  A Republican political strategist, Frank Luntz, said that he went to the Democratic National Convention certain that the nation suffered Clinton fatigue and that, if faced with the choice, would surely pick the sitting president over the former president. He left with a different view.  I think it would be really too close to call, Luntz said. People really do look back on that Clinton era with a sense of fondness of how easy things were -- easy money, easy existence and easygoing president.  THE CAMPAIGN ROLLS OUT: President Bush and John Kerry, the new Democratic presidential nominee, will both be out on the campaign trail. Kerry and his running mate, John Edwards, are continuing their 15-day, 22-state, 3,500-mile Believe in America campaign trek, which they began on Friday, the day after the convention.  Bush, meanwhile, will divide his time between Washington and the campaign trail, visiting battleground states like Iowa, Minnesota and Michigan before heading to a wedding in Kennebunkport, Maine, over the weekend.  - COURTNEY C. RADSCH  STATE OF THE ECONOMY: Ever since the Federal Reserve began obsessing over the condition of the labor market last year, job growth has become one of the most important statistics in the economy.  July's employment report, due out Friday, is even more important than usual. For two reasons. First, job growth slowed dramatically in June. Then, last Friday, the government reported a sharp drop in consumer spending that put the brakes on the economic expansion in the second quarter.  So this Friday's report will either confirm what most forecasters want to believe -- that the spring slowdown was just a temporary wobble and America is back on the growth path -- or foreshadow a more deeply troubled economy.  - EDUARDO PORTER  REVIVING LIVE ACTION: When Collateral opens on Friday, DreamWorks SKG is hoping that the star appeal of Tom Cruise, who plays a contract killer, and Jamie Foxx, as the cabdriver who drives him around Los Angeles, will draw moviegoers.  DreamWorks SKG announced two weeks ago that it would spin off its animation unit in an initial public offering. This came soon after the opening of the animated Shrek 2, which has already earned $431 million and could end up the year's biggest hit.  By contrast, DreamWorks' live-action division has had middling success this year after a disappointing 2003. The Terminal, the Tom Hanks film, has brought in $75 million, less than what many in Hollywood expected, given its $60 million budget.  - LAURA M.

COMMENTARY  BBN-ROBERTS-COLUMN (Undated) -- Sports of The Times on Randy Johnson. By Selena Roberts.  BOX-REGULATION (Undated) -- Some critics call professional boxing the best example of Reaganomics in the sports business. State commissions set up their own local governing bodies, which oversee everything from safety standards to financial deals; there is no federal oversight. Unions have never gained any footing despite numerous efforts by boxers to organize themselves and by advocates to organize for them. And individual stars, whose big paydays distort boxing's overall economics, drive purses and television contracts. In short, boxing is the antithesis of the relatively socialistic economics of the National Football League. Surprisingly, it takes two pugnacious Republicans to push for the federal legislation that may help save the haggard fight game. By Gregory Jordan.

That vertiginous equation was as alarming as it was befuddling to an audience quite content with batting average, thank you. But as preposterous as it still appears on its face, the formula, and the long article Rickey wrote to explain it, actually used concepts that some modern major-league clubs are still learning to appreciate.

During the Cold War, a common threat cemented Western alliances. Now nations pursue their own interests and confront their own perception of threats. The United States is the largest military power, but it's not powerful enough to impose its will unilaterally.

If each official were empowered to decide whether or not to carry out each ministerial act based upon the official's own personal judgment of the constitutionality of an underlying statute, the enforcement of statutes would become haphazard, leading to confusion and chaos. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"

We don't rely on advertising, Sandy Beall, the chief executive, told analysts in a February conference call.

Worse, he said, is that their input at a series of town hall meetings was ignored. And he's afraid that the trend toward putting tolls on free roads will spread across Texas. </P> 	nyt_eng_200408.gz
, he said,	 Fugate, the Florida emergency manager, said that the state would try to rely on local business as soon as possible. As hotels and motels and restaurants reopen, he said, he will shut down military-style base camps and cafeteria lines, and as stores reopen, the state will shop there instead of bringing in supplies from outside. In all our plans, we never forget, if there's no jobs we didn't recover, he said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200408.gz

At the 2002 Winter Olympics in Utah, Hughes said, the Secret Service was responsible for protecting a 900-square-mile area in potentially frigid conditions, so agents had to be issued insulated yellow parkas to keep them unfrozen. </P> 	nyt_eng_200408.gz

Advertising packages, which can include ads in The Boston Globe, cost $295 and up. Charging a fee underscores the case that ISoldMyHouse.com acted as a broker, Sullivan said.

Insurance companies have a hard time predicting claims for businesses with less than 100 employees because there are fewer bodies to spread the risk, said Cesarano of the Savitz Organization.

An uneasy peace settled over Najaf on Friday as guerrillas loyal to the insurgent cleric Muqtada al-Sadr streamed out of the Imam Ali Shrine before a cordon of American troops, ceding control of the Shiite holy site to the mainstream religious leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, and appearing to end a bloody three-week standoff. By Dexter Filkins.  With photos; see the separate IRAQ-NAJAF-PHOTO-ADVISORY.  Early ledes have moved.  IRAQ-NAJAF-SCENE (Najaf, Iraq) -- The wild dogs of Najaf ate well this week. In this holy city, in lightless basements, in empty crypts, in the shadow of the golden dome of the shrine of Imam Ali, thousands of men have tried desperately and often successfully to kill one another. They have fought with knives and guns, grenades and mortars, tanks and mines and roadside bombs, and sometimes their bare hands. Now, as a cease-fire halts the three-week fight between American forces and Iraqi insurgents, the toll from the battle is only too clear. On Friday afternoon, the decomposed bodies of insurgent fighters lay in houses in and around the Old City, which surrounds the shrine. By Alex Berenson.  RUSSIA-CRASH (Moscow) -- Developments. Russia's security service announced Friday that investigators had found traces of explosives in the wreckage of one of the two passenger airliners that crashed simultaneously on Tuesday night, indicating that it crashed because of a terrorist act. Investigators also said they were looking into the backgrounds of two women passengers with Chechen names -- one on each plane -- whose relatives have not come forward. By Steven Lee Myers.  An early lede has moved.  CHINA-ASIA (Newman, Australia) -- Not long ago Australia and China regarded each other with suspicion. But through newfound diplomatic finesse and the seemingly irresistible lure of its long economic expansion, Beijing has skillfully turned around relations with Australia, America's staunchest ally in the region. The turnabout is just one sign of the broad new influence Beijing has accumulated across the Asia Pacific with American friends and foes alike. From the mines of Newman -- an outpost of 3,000 in a corner of the outback otherwise dotted by eucalyptus and kangaroos -- to the prized forests of Myanmar, the former Burma, China's rapid growth is sucking up resources and pulling the region's varied economies in its wake. The effect is unlike anything since the rise of Japanese economic power after World War II. For now, China's presence mostly translates into money, and the doors it opens. But more and more, China is leveraging its economic clout to support its political preferences. By Jane Perlez.  With graphic.  FLA-ELECT (West Palm Beach, Fla.) - Theresa LePore, brushing away tears as she sat for an interview on a hectic morning in the Palm Beach County elections office, wanted to be clear: her contact lens was bothering her, nothing more. I'm not crying, you know, she said with a faint smile. And so she was not, even though four years after her county found itself at the red-hot center of the 2000 presidential election recount, LePore is facing perhaps even more pressure than back then, when camera crews from as far away as Japan camped at her office for weeks and more than once, her pale eyes did well up in public. She designed the infamous butterfly ballot, and so in this county that bears the most scar tissue from 2000, her name figures prominently in the rallying cries this campaign season. By Abby Goodnough.  With photo and graphic.  PUBLIC-HOUSING (Undated) - In one of the most comprehensive changes in housing policy in years, the Bush administration is scrapping the nation's three-decade-old financing system for public housing in favor of a private-sector model that will redistribute billions of dollars, chiefly from big, urban areas in the Northeast and Midwest to small, rural places in the South. By David W. Chen.  PRISON-ABUSE-RUMSFELD (Washington) -- Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld continues to maintain that a small group of rogue military police officers were responsible for most of the abuse of Iraqi detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison, contrary to the findings of two major military investigations released this week. In an interview with a Phoenix radio station late Thursday, Rumsfeld said, I have not seen anything thus far that says that the people abused were abused in the process of interrogating them or for interrogation purposes. But both the independent panel, appointed by Rumsfeld and headed by James R. Schlesinger, the former defense secretary, and a separate inquiry by three Army generals concluded that military intelligence personnel committed many of the offenses, including some in interrogations.

They had an 'it' factor that, honestly, I haven't seen in any other Fort Worth band since then. Band on the run One of the hardest things Toadies bassist Lisa Umbarger ever had to do, she says, was sit in a room with Darrel Herbert while he was being fired from the band. At the time, Umbarger thought it was just a passing of the baton, not the first lap in the band's final race. </P> 	nyt_eng_200408.gz

China can provide everything the country needs from a needle to a nuclear bomb. China has in fact capsized Washington's policy with its own trade deals, which far outweigh the value of the U.S. penalties.

Jack Rosenthal, president of The New York Times Company Foundation, was a senior editor of The Times for 26 years. Daniel Okrent, the public editor, is on vacation. The public editor serves as the readers' representative. His opinions and conclusions are his own. His address is Public Editor, The New York Times, 229 W. 43rd St., New York, N.Y. 10036-3959; or e-mail: publicnytimes.com. Telephone messages: (212) 556-7652. The public editor's column appears at least twice monthly and his Web journal can be found at nytimes.com/danielokrent. In response to my two columns during Daniel Okrent's vacation this month, readers expressed strong views about what belongs on Page 1, whether news analysis articles can truly be neutral and how to keep track of news that grows old before its time.  In line with Dan's sensible standard for choosing letters, the following present views contrary to those expressed in the columns. It is nevertheless worth noting that several present and former New York Times editors endorse the idea of a formal way to track important stories otherwise lost in the swirl of all news all the time.  - JACK ROSENTHAL  WHAT BELONGS ON PAGE 1?  In What Belongs on the Front Page of The New York Times (Aug. 22), you say that Times editors have taken pains to see that analysis, or Q-head articles, do not express opinion. That is fundamentally impossible.  To analyze something, there must be a framework or worldview. The reporters' and editors' implicit worldviews give The Times its cultural and political character: elite and left-leaning.  Given that analysis is opinion, it is worrisome that The Times now encourages writers to interpolate more analysis into their primary reporting rather than ask readers to consult a separate article.  One can aspire to neutrality in the news pages (although the decisions about what is important already introduce bias), but neutrality in analysis is an oxymoron.  - DAN CULLEN  Princeton, N.J.  If The Times really believes that its Q-head articles are not opinionated, it appears to be further down the Yellow Brick Road than a careful reading of the paper normally discloses.  The Times, you wrote, now encourages writers to interpolate more analysis into their primary reporting. But analysis or interpretation is defined and colored by the writer's point of view, which is, after all, his opinion. It is on the road to Oz.  What belongs on the front page? There's no better lesson than the Aug. 22 paper. What do we find on Page 1? A three-column headline, Good Grief! That Favorite Comic Strip Is Missing, with eye-catching graphics.  In contrast, deep inside the front section is Study: Intelligence on Qaida Money Lacking. It describes a study released by the 9/11 commission just before closing down that gave details about the financing of al-Qaida and evaluated the progress (and lack of progress) by the Justice Department in tracking and curbing that financing.  Objectively, which article is worthier of front-page coverage?  You say that what readers feel ought to be on the front page often reflects their politics, geography or age. I don't think my personal bias has anything to do with thinking that news about the 9/11 terrorists and the competence of the Bush administration's anti-terrorist efforts deserves higher priority than a feature about comic strips -- especially with the presidential election less than three months away.  - GLORIA LEITNER  Arlington, Mass.  You gave an insight into the strictly technical problems editors face in producing the front page, but didn't address the substance of the issue: What values do editors use in determining the importance of a story?  You say that readers ask why, for instance, does a paper that made much of Whitewater, a real estate deal that occurred before Bill Clinton's presidency, now fail to give Page 1 prominence to the financial improprieties at Halliburton under Dick Cheney?  You pose the question, but you never answer it.  Whether a story is featured on Page 1 or buried on Page 18 makes all the difference in the world.  - KURT KELMAN  Great Neck, N.Y.  You note that readers ask why the Whitewater story was prominently on the front page and the financial improprieties at Halliburton under Dick Cheney were not.  But by posing the question without comment, and by not clarifying the distinction between the two, you allow the idea to persist that the two situations are similar and of equal importance journalistically. They are not.  Please address the larger issue: the politically slanted content of the articles themselves.  - THORNTON SANDERS  Charlottesville, Va.  You make the point that the front page now incorporates a wider variety of topics that were once only inside The Times: Women, for example, were once catered to -- patronized, one might say today -- inside The Times with the Four F's, a daily page titled food, fashion, family and furnishings. Now, topics like diet, divorce and retail rivalries regularly win front-page attention.  This attempt to defend the female readership makes me wonder if we really have moved beyond patronizing. Perhaps it would be important to recognize that women's areas of interest, like the front page, are also more diverse.  - SARA KIPPUR  Cambridge, Mass.  I liked the column, until you told us that The Times is famously scrupulous about language use. One of the faults I find in the language of The Times these days is the unnecessary use, day after day, and sometimes page after page, of famously. What does it add? The word serves no real purpose except to annoy.  At least you didn't use that other in-word beloved of so many copycat writers: arguably.  What to Do When News Grows Old Before Its Time (Aug. 8) struck a nerve with respect to the lack of good follow-up done by newspapers.  But the solutions you suggest -- following up in the editorial or Op-Ed sections, or simply asking the readers -- all lack practicality.  My suggestion would be for The Times (and other news media) to maintain a chart, or a list, of unresolved issues.  Ideally, it would be accessible from day to day on the Web, and perhaps printed periodically in the newspaper.  The chart could be ordered either chronologically or by priority as defined by the newspaper's editors. It could refer to the issue, the first article published on the topic and any subsequent follow-ups.  - JOHN HAWKINSON  Cambridge, Mass.  You suggest that newspapers ask readers what they want to know more about.  For The New York Times, whose readers are already well served, this question may suffice.  But for many Americans in markets with only one daily newspaper, the substantive issue is the newspaper's civic responsibility to serve as watchdog and deliver all of the news that affects people's lives.  For these people, the newspapers should be asking what the readers need to know.  - RALPH GROSS  Des Moines, Iowa </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20040828.0077 type=story > <HEADLINE> NYTR-CHEAP-GUNS-REFUSED </HEADLINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"

, they say,	 Real estate fund managers say that higher American property prices are not the only reason for investing overseas. Real estate priced in euros or Japanese yen, they say, may benefit from any further decline in the dollar.

The ING portfolio also differs from the other two in that about half of its assets are usually invested in the United States; the other funds generally invest most of their assets abroad. Lately, the ING fund managers have not been hedging currencies, either, because ING research indicates that the dollar has more room to decline, Burton said.

If a market is very tight, you'll see prices jump, like they have in Hong Kong last year. He has invested 12 percent of the Alpine fund in Hong Kong, making it the second-largest market in the portfolio. The Hong Kong real estate market faltered after 1997, Lieber said, because of investor uncertainty about the British handover to China and the Asian currency crisis of 1997 and 1998. That market has since recovered to roughly the level it reached by the mid-1990s; but as the gateway to China, he said, Hong Kong still has strong growth prospects. </P> 	nyt_eng_200501.gz

, he said,	 But even if the Supreme Court tightens the burden of proof for plaintiffs, lawsuits against employers are likely to proliferate, Eglit said, partly because the work force is aging. By 2010, more than half of all workers will be over 40, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has projected. Another reason, he said, is that there is often an economic incentive for companies to shed older workers. Those workers tend to earn more and have higher health costs, and their family ties can make them less flexible about work hours, business travel and relocations. Dennis E. Egan, a partner at the Popham Law Firm in Kansas City, Mo., said, Left unchecked, we know that most corporations will choose the younger of two applicants to hire, the younger to promote and the younger to keep in a reduction of force. Egan is the lead attorney for the plaintiffs suing Sprint; the company has denied discriminating against its employees and is fighting the suit in court. </P> 	nyt_eng_200501.gz
, he said,	 The economic incentive for dismissing a worker with a high salary and expensive health care can help a company defend itself against bias, lawyers and others said. It's not the blatant: 'Jones, you're too old. We're firing you,' said Tom Osborne, a senior attorney at AARP and a co-counsel for plaintiffs in the Sprint case. Instead, he said, companies might adopt new employee-valuation systems that happen to reverse the career-long high performance rankings of older employees. </P> 	nyt_eng_200501.gz

Julia Roberts attended the ceremonies in a vintage Valentino dress, while Renee Zellweger arrived in a canary yellow chiffon number, circa 1960, by Jean Desses. A stylist had bought the Desses dress at a Doyle auction for a bid in the four figures, although Webre said that vintage couture can cost you well into the five figures. </P> 	nyt_eng_200501.gz

Certainly I feel an empathy for the character of the oldest boy, Akira, he says. The Tokyo he sees is something I felt I also knew, the indifference and coldness people in the city have towards their neighbors, and towards strangers. When he was Akira's age, he says, I was a latchkey child. Both my parents worked, and we lived in a housing project; I would go home and let myself in and spend a lot of time alone. Not a terrifically unique childhood -- many people of my generation grew up that way. </P> 	nyt_eng_200501.gz

Although his goal was always to make feature films, he found his first work in television documentaries. As I made more and more of them, he says, I realized that this was an incredibly stimulating way to be involved with the world. So I still make them. In fact, he has been using film festival appearances and promotional jaunts for Nobody Knows as an opportunity to gather footage for what he calls a personal documentary essay about Article 9 of the Japanese constitution: the so-called peace clause by which Japan, after World War II, renounced war forever. I could go on and on about this, he says. And true to his word, he does, musing out loud about the passive anti-war feeling of his generation, about the culture's inward-turning escape into hermetic worlds of fantasy, about the national preoccupation with wealth and personal possessions and about Japan's tendency to be incredibly vague and obfuscatory about war responsibility.

The man who says this is a mass murderer, and his eerie eloquence catches you off guard. If you've seen the film Hotel Rwanda, think of this as the other side of the story. Hatzfeld interviewed 10 men who helped slaughter 800,000 of their fellow Rwandans in a mere three months in 1994. They were in prison when Hatzfeld saw them. Most are now free. They describe their actions with such lyrical nonchalance that they inspire in a reader not horror at the violence, but something worse: a clear feeling that the potential for such behavior is not an aberration, but a willingness that is far more common among human beings. In her preface, the late Susan Sontag says that everyone should read this book in order to understand what happened in Rwanda. The killers, like others before them, followed orders. Afterward, they went home to their families. They held their children.

By Alan Cowell.  KURDS-MISCREANTS (Erbil, Iraq) -- Each night at 10 p.m., all eyes in Kurdistan have been on a sadistic gay sheik and a band of miscreants that he says he led through a series of crimes so grotesque that people speak of them with their voices lowered. By James Glanz.  MEXICO-NEWSPAPER (Oaxaca, Mexico) -- For 28 days, a couple of dozen editors, reporters and other employees of a newspaper here have been besieged in their newsroom as the result of a labor dispute with a union that has close ties to the government and claims to represent the newspaper's workers. By James C. McKinley Jr.  CHINA-OIL-STRUGGLE (Jingbian, China) -- A report on what has been called one of the most important legal battles ever fought in China, as small- and medium-size oil investors have banded together in a class-action effort to push the Communist government as never before to respect its own rules. By Howard W. French.  NATIONAL  (Coded a)  TEXAS-CHURCH (Houston) -- A visit to Lakewood Church, which boasts the largest congregation in the United States and a pastor who has become a global star among televangelists. With the governor on hand and thousands in the pews, Lakewood opened a new sanctuary this weekend: an arena that was once the home for the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association. The church, which was established in 1959 in an abandoned feed store, recently became the first in the United States to average more than 30,000 worshippers weekly. By John Leland.  IRAQ-BOY (Washington) -- Ayad Al-Sirowiy came to America this week hoping doctors here could remove the war embedded in his face. Thirteen years old, small and skinny, Ayad was severely burned and blinded in one eye when a cluster bomb blew up in his face at the beginning of the Iraq war. By Jeffrey Gettleman.  WASHINGTON  (Coded w)  CIA-LEAK-LAW (Undated) -- A look at the law that is at the bottom of the Rove controversy. By Adam Liptak.  WHITEHOUSE-LETTER (Washington) --When Laura Bush said in a television interview last week that she hoped her husband would name a woman to replace the retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court, a lot of people saw it as a top item on the first lady's honey-do list. But Republicans close to the White House said that people had it reversed. Mrs. Bush, they said, was not so much nudging her husband as reflecting his thinking. By Elisabeth Bumiller.  TERROR-FBI (Washington) -- On an FBI terrorist surveillance program that rights advocates say threatens to clamp down on their rights to protest Bush administration policies. By Eric Lichtblau.  FINANCIAL  (Coded f)  ONLINE-MAPS (San Francisco) -- In the last few weeks, both Google and Yahoo published documentation making it significantly easier for programmers to link virtually any kind of Internet data to Web-based maps and, in Google's case, satellite imagery. Later this summer, Microsoft plans to introduce a competing service, Virtual Earth, with software that programmers will be able to use in similarly creative ways. So far the uses have been noncommercial. But Yahoo, Google and Microsoft are creating the services with the expectation that they will become a focal point in one of the next significant growth areas in Internet advertising: contextual advertisements tied to specific locations. By John Markoff.  HOLLYWOOD-CHRISTIANS (Los Angeles) -- Mainstream Hollywood, after decades of ignoring the pious, or occasionally defying them, is adjusting to what it perceives to be a rising religiosity in American culture. Producers, directors, studio executives and marketing specialists have been looking to either mollify or entice an audience that made its power felt with last year's Passion of the Christ. That film, along with the empowerment of a Christian conservative bloc after the last presidential election, helped change attitudes and practices in an industry usually known for its secularism. By Sharon Waxman.  MARTHA-COMEBACK (Undated) -- By attempting a corporate comeback while still serving out her felony sentence, Martha Stewart is in uncharted territory. And so, it appears, is her company's stock. While many media executives are lamenting investors' lack of enthusiasm for their companies' shares, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia has been on a tear. Its stock price has nearly tripled in the last year, a period during which the Standard &amp; Poor's media index has gone sideways. By Richard Siklos.  CARR-COLUMN (Undated) -- Two strivers came together in a room in July of 2003. One was a former body builder turned actor who wanted to be king, at least of California, and the other was a former CPA who has refashioned himself into a media mogul. Each had something the other wanted, although it could be argued that David Pecker, the chief executive of American Media Inc. needed Arnold Schwarzenegger more. The weekly media column, by David Carr.  E-COMMERCE-COLUMN (Undated) -- After giving its Internet competitors a huge head start, Clear Channel is ready to play catch-up. The radio industry's dominant company, with more than 1,200 stations, has begun introducing its first meaningful online strategy. By Bob Tedeschi.  TERROR-FICTION (Undated) -- The author of Incendiary, a novel about a fictitious London bombing that was released July 7, goes online to ask what he should do with his book now. By Tom Zeller Jr.  POTTER-PUBLISHER (Paris) -- This is the magical summer season when Hogwarts students loll on vacation and Bloomsbury Publishing's chief executive, Nigel Newton, hunkers down in his 18th-century Soho Square offices in London to monitor sales of the sixth installment of the Harry Potter epic. By the end of this year, analysts expect that Bloomsbury will have amassed sizable resources to allow the publishing house to press onward with its global expansion and to search for new writers. By Doreen Carvajal.  DATA-AD-COLUMN (Undated) -- Over the last few years, financial services and technology companies have been quietly tweaking their advertising to incorporate themes about the safety of customers' data. But in the wake of recent crises, that message has shifted from the background to center stage. By Eric Dash.  GLF-WIE-MARKETING (Undated) -- Michelle Wie came in 23rd at the U.S. Women's Open last month, behind other personable young golfers. Wie failed to survive elimination in the PGA Tour's John Deere Classic this month and fell short in her attempt to qualify for the Masters tournament next year. Yet Wie, 15, is the golfer that sports marketers have their eyes on. By Louise Story.  CYC-VECSEY-COLUMN (St. Lary-Soulan, France) -- Sports of The Times column off the Tour de France, Stage 15, Lezat-sur-Leze to St.-Lary-Soulan. By George Vecsey.  GLF-ANDERSON-COLUMN (St. Andrews, Scotland) -- Sports of The Times column on the British Open. By Dave Anderson.  BOX-HOPKINS-TAYLOR (Las Vegas) -- Follow-up on Saturday's Hopkins-Taylor fight. By Richard Sandomir.  BBO-WOOD-BATS (Marietta, Ga.) -- When professional scouts watch young players at the plate, the kind of being bat being used can make all the difference in how they make their evaluations. By Ray Glier.  CHINA-ARTS (Washington) -- As it races toward a more market-driven economy, China is building new theaters, concert halls and museums nearly as fast as it is erecting Western-style shopping malls, hotels and business complexes. But after a half century of the arts being supported exclusively by the government, many arts organizations are on their own to develop financing, programming and audiences. A cadre of nascent Chinese arts executives spent the past two weeks at the Kennedy Center, getting an intense immersion in how the nonprofit arts operate. By Lynette Clemetson.  SMITHS-MUSICAL-REVIEW (London) -- The Smiths -- a band from Manchester, England, whose singer and lyricist, Morrissey, taught a generation-wide cult how to mope with melodramatic self-consciousness -- are getting a West End treatment in Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others, a music-theater piece based on Smiths songs. The Smiths' lyrics were proudly defenseless and unguarded, yet the staging doesn't wrap them in obvious scenarios. The show is an allusive, surreal, ever-mutating fantasia on love and sex, family and control, violence and death. By Jon Pareles.  MCCARTHY-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) -- No Country for Old Men, by Cormac McCarthy. Reviewed by Michiko Kakutani.  SOMERS-THEATER-REVIEW (New York) -- The Blonde in the Thunderbird, a solo show starring Suzanne Somers. Reviewed by Charles Isherwood.  CD-REVIEWS (Undated) -- New hip-hop CDs from Slim Thug, Webbie and the Diplomats. Reviewed by Kelefa Sanneh.  FRANCE-OPERA-FEST (Aix-en-Provence, France) -- Before this month's Aix-en-Provence Festival, the buzz centered on Patrice Chereau's Cosi Fan Tutte, his first venture into opera in 11 years. Mozart's works have been the focus of this festival since it was founded in the late 1940s, and usually two of his operas are presented each season in the open-air courtyard of the former Archbishop's Palace here. This year, the other is La Clemenza di Tito, directed by Lukas Hemleb, with Paul Daniel conducting the Mahler Chamber Orchestra. By Alan Riding.

"155465"	"she"	"wrote"	" I didn't know what to expect from the Blue Lagoon Geothermal Spa, the ethereal hot-spring lake. People either love it or hate it. Not long before I arrived, a Times of London writer caused an international squabble by calling Iceland's most beloved tourist attraction horrible from start to finish. The changing room, she wrote, had all the charm of a municipal gym, the lake's bottom felt like uncooked liver and she didn't have the place all to herself, like the blond model in the ads. Oh, and she was obsessed by the hygiene, or lack thereof, of German males. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"155508"	"he"	"wrote"	" In the case in which a California resort sued the Interior Department over a regulation governing arroyo toads, he wrote that the full court should reconsider the resort's claim because the toads had no effect on interstate commerce, the rationale for federal intervention. The toad, he wrote, for reasons of its own, lives its entire life in California. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"

"155791"	"he"	"wrote"	" This was an example, he wrote, of the court's misguided tendency to find fundamental rights, like the right to travel between states, for which there was no explicit basis in the Constitution.

"155900"	"she"	"wrote"	" In a strongly worded minority dissent to Kelo, O'Connor by contrast demonstrated the common sense she first displayed as an Arizona legislator. Under the majority's theory, she wrote, The specter of condemnation hangs over all property. Nothing is to prevent the state from replacing any Motel 6 with a Ritz-Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a factory. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"155945"	"he"	"wrote"	" Nevertheless, he wrote, Our call remains that Delta will manage to pull some liquidity strings, make one last and perhaps final run at avoiding Chapter 11, and successfully limp into 2006 while hoping for lower oil prices and improved revenue trends. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"156035"	"he"	"wrote"	" Some of the memorandums contain faint flashes of the sarcastic humor that Roberts would employ in internal communications in later years as a government lawyer. One of the more modest claims in a petition from the Christian-Bull Moose-Fighting Tiger Party, he wrote, is that all the election laws of all the states are unconstitutional. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"

"156224"	"he"	"wrote"	" Life-changing experiences occur like clockwork. Recalling the thrills of a night of artillery shelling toward the end of World War I, he wrote, I have never been the same since. In 1921, after his first visit to France's premier museum: I left the Louvre a different man. Rembrandt, encountered in the Louvre in 1924, was a shock from which I have never recovered, a shock to end all shocks. In 1926 the first glimpse of the works of Miro shook me to the core, while a few months later, his first Mondrians, seen in Barcelona, Spain, left me reeling. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"156363"	"she"	"wrote"	" Once that happens, she wrote, It will take only two to three years from the onset of coverage for cost-conscious consumers and aggressive providers to pounce on newly subsidized services -- and purchase the devices that enable them. That should expand the market quickly. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"156938"	"he"	"wrote"	" After five months and many earnest overtures from Berkemer, European Union delegates and diplomats throughout the region, a letter arrived. Azerbaijan's minister of culture, Polad Bulbuloglu, who had been a Soviet-era pop star, wrote that Azerbaijani musicians would not participate. It would be inconceivable to place them alongside Armenian musicians, he wrote, as long as Armenian forces occupied the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"157615"	"she"	"wrote"	" Hamdi's US citizenship, she wrote, was irrelevant, as long as he had a fair chance to challenge whether he meets the criteria for being an enemy combatant. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
"158395"	"they"	"wrote"	" In their report, the authors acknowledged that reaching a consensus on foreign policy would be hard while the war in Iraq remained a bitter source of division. But, they wrote, it will not be any more severe than the fight Bill Clinton sparked when he confronted his coalition with proposals for reforming welfare. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
"158467"	"they"	"wrote"	" The price impact of these moves can be so large, the professors say, that it can lead to even more forced purchases or fire sales in future months. The cycle occurs because the performance of these funds will be either helped or hurt by the price changes caused by their initial quick buying or selling. That, in turn, will help them continue at the top or bottom of the rankings. The professors suspect that such a self-reinforcing process was in large part responsible for the Internet stock run-up in the late 1990s. Focused sector funds holding concentrated positions in technology stocks initially outperformed the broader indexes, they wrote, and consequently received large inflows, which they piled into their existing holdings. They added: This, in turn, boosted their performance and led to additional inflows. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"

"158715"	"they"	"wrote"	" The warnings fell on deaf ears, Hoagland said. Last spring's prom was replete with all the extravagances of previous years, so he and the school president, the Rev. Philip K. Eichner, announced in September that they had no choice but to throw up their hands and cancel the prom for next spring. The prom, they wrote, is so much beyond our control that it is mere tokenism to put our name on it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
"158992"	"he"	"wrote"	" And, he wrote, had he known of her entanglement with I. Lewis Libby Jr., chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, he might have been more willing to explore compromises with the prosecutor investigating the case. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
"158993"	"he"	"wrote"	" Keller also said he had missed what should have been significant alarm bells about Miller's involvement in the CIA leak case. One, he wrote, was that he did not know Judy had been one of the reporters on the receiving end of the anti-Wilson whisper campaign. Joseph C. Wilson IV, a former ambassador who criticized the Iraq war, is married to Plame. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
"159267"	"they"	"wrote"	" Crumbling public health systems in poor countries, they wrote, also threaten the health of Americans in the face of potential outbreaks of avian flu and SARS. Protecting Americans requires viral detection and interdiction at points of origin, they wrote. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
"159380"	"she"	"wrote"	" Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, the reviewer Jenny McCartney decreed that MacFadyen brings the necessary charisma and a new sense of hidden vulnerability to the role. His Darcy, she wrote, at first seems simply arrogant. Upon their second meeting, however, Lizzy circles the room with Bingley's sister -- throwing verbal challenges towards Darcy like firecrackers -- and it becomes clear from his expression (which only the audience can see) that he is both acutely interested and endearingly unsettled. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"159632"	"I"	"wrote"	" Seven years ago, I wrote, On paper, Dayton was a good agreement; it ended the war and established a single multi-ethnic country.

"159773"	"you"	"wrote"	" And your current book isn't helping. For example, you wrote, Art is imitating life, turning women who seek equality into selfish narcissists and objects of rejection rather than of affection. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"159848"	"he"	"wrote"	" In the majority opinion, Judge Theodore Alexander McKee, a Clinton appointee, wrote that the court could not ignore the sad reality that some executives never view minority applicants as the best candidates. Alito, he wrote, would effectively immunize employers. The anti-discrimination law, McKee wrote, would be eviscerated if our analysis were to halt where the dissent suggests. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"159849"	"he"	"wrote"	" Alito said it was the majority that was twisting the law out of shape.

"159890"	"she"	"wrote"	" Heidi agrees, but this is all beyond her dream. I feel like I've won the lottery, says Heidi, whose family was chosen for the show after Heidi's sister, Erica Stahler, wrote a letter to the producers describing the family's situation. Not only did William have a life-threatening illness, she wrote, but his diagnosis came only months after Heidi was diagnosed with a second more serious site of melanoma, and days after Heidi's mother underwent brain cancer surgery. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"

"160566"	"they"	"wrote"	" The researchers questioned the practice, common in many studies, of lumping all sexual abuse together.

"161055"	"he"	"wrote"	" For example, he wrote, With the benefit of hindsight, we know that these records contain useful information about Rompilla's childhood home environment, his mental problems and his problems with alcohol. But, he said, if trial counsel had grounds for believing that if there was any mitigating evidence of this sort to be found, at least a hint of its availability would be disclosed in the interviews with Rompilla and his family members or in the testing and evaluations performed by the three mental health experts whom they retained. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"161110"	"he"	"wrote"	" Cloutier wrote that there was minimal violence in the area around Camp Normandy during the recent elections, quite a change from election time in 2004, when the previous Army unit there engaged in an eight-hour firefight.

"161402"	"he"	"wrote"	" The New York article, written by Stephen Beachy, portrayed Albert, 40, and Geoffrey Knoop, 39, as unfulfilled rock musicians who concocted the character of JT Leroy to gain access first to literary circles and, later, to celebrities. The scheme began, Beachy wrote, with faxes, e-mail messages and phone calls by Albert, speaking in a West Virginia accent as JT Leroy. The article also described an acquaintance of Albert's who said she had asked him to type and fax manuscripts that bore striking thematic similarities to work later published by JT Leroy. When that name became famous, Beachy theorized, an actor was needed to play JT Leroy in person; he did not know, he wrote, who that actor was. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"

, we ask,	 Can a Penguin be transformed into a Whale? Perhaps only Charles Darwin or Gregor Mendel could answer that one. Meanwhile, in Hartford, real estate baron Lawrence R. Gottesdiener might tinker with the genetics. In December, Gottesdiener said he hoped to build a $250 million downtown arena, as a means of wooing an NHL franchise back to the city. But last week, Gottesdiener changed his approach, telling the Hartford Courant that he first hoped to buy an NHL club, perhaps the Penguins, and then get to building the arena. I don't believe the political will is there to make that happen, said Gottesdiener, explaining why he abandoned his build-it-and-they-will-come approach. He added, You can't bring a professional sports team to a secondary market in this day and age without a brand new, beautiful arena. For now, Pittsburgh holds on to its flightless birds, even though Mario Lemieux put them up for sale months ago. Absent a commitment to build a new arena in downtown Pittsburgh, claims Lemieux, it's highly doubtful a new owner will keep the club in Steeltown. Meanwhile, a casino-based building initiative (see: www.slotsformario.com) might be the only way for Pittsburgh to remain an NHL destination. And if he can't woo an NHL club back to Whalerland, said Gottesdiener, his next target will be an NBA franchise. So, we ask, can a leprechaun be transformed into a Whale? </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz

, he said,	 WAL-MART RESISTS PRESSURE IN 'BROKEBACK' DVD SALES The culture war surrounding Brokeback Mountain may be nearing an end, but as the film was released on DVD last week, it found an unusual ally: Wal-Mart Stores. On Tuesday, the retailer began selling Brokeback Mountain on DVD, over the objection of the American Family Association, a conservative religious organization based in Tupelo, Miss. Wal-Mart had previously agreed not to stock CDs bearing parental warning stickers and to cover up magazines like Cosmopolitan and Glamour with blinders. Randy Sharp, the director of special projects for the American Family Association, is leading the charge against Brokeback Mountain with an e-mail petition urging Wal-Mart customers to shun the store in protest. The association says it is not opposed to Wal-Mart offering Brokeback Mountain for sale. What it does mind is that Wal-Mart has promoted the movie by placing posters of its stars, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, in the front of the store where children can see them, Sharp said. If Brokeback were a blockbuster, he said, promoting it would 1,800 responses.

, he said,	 It's a discoordinated process, Edgerton said in an interview on Friday. In the last few days, he said, Verizon had been told to disconnect more than a dozen lines in Florida and then, in total panic mode, they sent us reconnect orders. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz

, he wrote,	 The consequence of the military's quiescence in the current environment, he wrote, was that a fundamentally flawed plan was executed for an invented war, while pursuing the real enemy, al-Qaida, became a secondary effort. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, he said,	 Humala has distanced himself from his family. In an interview in late March, he said, My family is not part of the nationalist project. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, he said,	 Indeed, he said, he was actually obligated to have sex. His accuser was aroused, he said, and in the Zulu culture, you cannot just leave a woman if she is ready. To deny her sex, he said, would have been tantamount to rape. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, they said,	 Instead, they said, Miami-Dade should consider more costly alternative sources. That could include desalination, skimming water from rivers and creeks and increased use of treated wastewater. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, she said,	 In Florida, federal studies show per-person water use has climbed from less than 140 gallons a day in 1955 to 174 gallons a day now, she said. And Orange County's per-capita usage, she said, is even higher: 224 gallons a day. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz

, he added,	 On Sunday, he walked twice, struck out and scored a run. After the game, he complained about the attention and the disruption of his routine. All I want to do is come here and get into my routine, he said. Referring to the home runs, he added, Everybody wants to talk about it, everyone wants to ask me about it. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, he said,	 Then defense lawyers -- more than a dozen hired to represent the players -- began telling reporters that DNA tests would exonerate their clients. Nifong responded that perhaps the attackers had used condoms or that perhaps someone not on the team was involved. He remained confident, he said, that the woman was raped. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, he added,	 Martin Dunn, The Daily News' editor in chief, denied that the paper was trying to exploit the Burkle story to hit back at its rival. He said the scandal -- which The News first called Page Sick, then later amended to Page Fix -- would have merited coverage regardless of whether it concerned a chief rival. The dumping story, he added, was legitimate newspaper industry news. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, she alleged,	 The alleged rape occurred inside a university-owned house just off campus, rented to three lacrosse players. The players had hired the student from North Carolina Central and another woman as exotic dancers at a party. But around 2 a.m., she alleged, three players shoved her into the bathroom and raped her, shouting racial epithets. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, he said,	 Mike Panetta, who operates one of the sites, said he launched it in 2000 as a gateway to register voters and provide information about the campaign. But this year, he said, the site has taken on a more interactive quality, with contributors posting remarks. The site now commands 700 to 1,000 hits a week, he said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, he said,	 In Santa Rosa, a man named J.W. Brown heard a great noise and saw the treetops waving. He looked to the west and actually saw the earthquake coming, the ground moving like waves on the ocean. There were waves, he said, about 2 feet high and 15 feet long. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz

, he said,	 After allowing one run on two hits in one inning in his first appearance this season, a non-save situation on Opening Day in Texas, Foulke looked much more like himself, circa 2004. He is still, he said, struggling to replicate the mechanics that will allow him to be effective. But, with yesterday's performance (and a one-inning, no-run outing in the first game of the Baltimore series), the possibility of returning to at least a version of his old self seems significantly more realistic than it did a week ago. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, you know,	 I'm disappointed and I'm tired, said Couples, whose creaky back somehow held up for 31 holes, even if his putting stroke hadn't, a three-putt bogey at the 11th also causing him heartache. But, you know, I watched a great player win his second Masters. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz

, it seems,	 At least that's the indication from the results of a study on the use of profanity in public. More and more people, it seems, simply don't care about those around them and are swearing anywhere they please. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, I hope,	 I'm just a race car driver -- not the female driver, just a driver, she emphasized. Gender should not enter into it. It's the 21st century now. Someday, I hope, I won't be such a novelty. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, she adds,	 And, she adds, People running publishing companies today are coming up through the sales ranks. Sales people tend to be conservative. They're looking for the last bestseller. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, she adds,	 As a result, agents spend more time editing manuscripts. (Good ones do a lot of it anyway.) This office is often silent for an entire day because we're all reading, she notes. There can be three rounds of editing before I send a book to a publisher. At times you need to say, 'You really do need to rewrite this. Five houses said no because they're right.' On the other hand, she adds, overediting can be lethal. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"165471"	"he"	"wrote"	" Shpigelman seemed aware that information about deals was secret, according to an e-mail message cited in the SEC complaint. In response to a question about whether the deal he had mentioned was public, he wrote, Yes, the offer is public. I would not be telling you, especially via email, unless I wanted to chill with Martha in Connecticut for a little while, referring to Martha Stewart, who was convicted of obstruction of justice in an insider trading investigation. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"165644"	"he"	"wrote"	" The service, he wrote, allows Arpanet users to send messages to people on the MetaNet without having to run and find a terminal with a modem on it or go through the human dispatcher, i.e., so you can now do fun things like be driving down the road and have a message appear that says: You have new mail. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"165677"	"he"	"wrote"	" Whyte described the bland conformism that prevailed in these bureaucracies. The young men, he wrote, don't see the system as something to be bucked, but as something to be cooperated with. The Organization Men, he said, are technicians, not innovators; conformists, not rebels. They are obtrusive in no particular, excessive in no zeal. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"165687"	"she"	"wrote"	" After a few months, she sought medical help and stopped taking the amphetamines, but remained weak and ill. It was at this troubled time in Spark's life that Graham Greene stepped in, and for a while she was sustained by the money he sent, along with bottles of red wine, which, she wrote, took the edge off cold charity. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"165688"	"she"	"wrote"	" Spark's autobiography, like her fiction, left a great deal unsaid. Although it dwells on the minutiae of her earliest memories, and settles some old scores with former friends, it stops abruptly at the age of 39. The rest of the story, she wrote, would be left to another volume, one that she never wrote. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060415.0105 type=advis > <HEADLINE> GRAPHICS-FILES-NYT </HEADLINE> <TEXT> Here is a listing of the New York Times News Service Macintosh graphics files that moved Saturday, April 15, 2006.

"166087"	"they"	"wrote"	" Walter L. Friedrich, a geologist at the University of Aarhus in Denmark, and colleagues said this was the first detailed examination of an object buried alive in the eruption.

"166119"	"he"	"wrote"	" As part of the spending boost, he wrote, Microsoft has accelerated its hiring. In its quarterly regulatory filing last week, Microsoft reported a 15 percent increase in headcount across the company over the past 12 months -- including a 35 percent increase in the MSN division. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"166278"	"he"	"wrote"	" The telecom industry, he wrote, just wants the Net to be governed by economics, not government regulation. Anyone want to have a rational conversation about that or do you want to rant and rave and provide a lot of May Day rhetoric that is not based in any fact? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"166304"	"he"	"wrote"	" As for the ability of the Iraqi security forces to provide indigenous combat support or service support, he wrote, Their logistics capability is only now beginning to appear. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"166554"	"he"	"wrote"	" By the early 1950s, Viereck had begun to criticize conservatism's course. Reviewing Buckley's first book, God and Man at Yale in The New York Times Book Review in 1951, he wrote, The author irresponsibly treats not only mild social democracy but even most social reform as almost crypto-Communism. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"166568"	"he"	"wrote"	" In the legislation (crafted in 1777 but not adopted until 1786), Jefferson wrote that coerced religious conformity only produces habits of hypocrisy and meanness leading to a corruption of true religion -- an act of offense to its Holy author. Magistrates the world over, he wrote, had promoted false religion throughout history by compulsory taxation in support of churches. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"166570"	"he"	"wrote"	" Jefferson's federal government was the example. He resisted instituting federal religious holidays, such as a day of thanksgiving or fast days, for this reason. Religious proclamations and worship on whatever day the people wished was a right, he wrote, that could never be safer than in the hands of the people where the Constitution has deposited it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"166635"	"I"	"wrote"	" At almost every turn in his 10 years at Dior, beginning with the Matrix show, which included clothes that had been taken apart and put together backward or upside down, Galliano has demonstrated a greater ability to change than his audience. I know: in a review of the Matrix show, I wrote, Even if there was something believably modern here, the sort of world Galliano was envisioning hardly needs haute couture. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"166790"	"he"	"wrote"	" At one zikr ceremony he observed, the men were dancing, he wrote, until a Russian bomber screamed low overhead, buzzing the village. Smith watched their reaction. No one even looks up, he wrote. The whooping grows louder. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"167250"	"he"	"wrote"	" If Fainaru-Wada and Williams were compelled to disclose information about their confidential sources, he wrote, it would do irreparable harm to investigative reporting across the nation. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"167407"	"he"	"wrote"	" By contrast, he wrote, in soccer, you can get bored, but blinking perhaps means missing the best move of the whole game. It can happen in the first or in the last minute.  </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"167589"	"he"	"wrote"	" Hazan did not accuse Cyberonics of back-dating the options to a day when prices were particularly low -- a practice that has recently been reported among more than 30 companies and has become the subject of a Justice Department investigation. But, he wrote, The effect was exactly the same. Hazan, who said he was surveying all the companies he follows for potential back-dating issues, focused on Cyberonics options that were granted at a special board meeting on the evening of June 15, 2004. That was only hours after a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended that the agency approve Cyberonics' request to market its implantable nerve stimulator as a treatment for severe, chronic depression. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"167638"	"he"	"wrote"	" Trying to disarm his men, he wrote, would be cowardly, and impossible to enforce. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"168268"	"he"	"wrote"	" I was at the center of the technology of the 1950s 3-D craze, he recalled of his years at Polaroid. In theaters, he wrote, it turned out that the audience loved the feeling of being right in the room with the action, if the movie was pleasant. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"168414"	"he"	"wrote"	" Prosecutors have said that they created indexes for the documents and tried to make them searchable, but Anderson said in a declaration filed earlier this month that many of the electronic documents were not easily searchable. Some of the paper documents, he wrote, providing photographs, had been soiled by rodents or damaged by cigarette butts. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"168525"	"she"	"wrote"	" The expensive therapy the injuries required tumbled the Geisman family out of genteel poverty into desperation. In her 1982 autobiography, June Allyson, Allyson said she and her mother were forced to move countless times. The best months were when her mother had a job in a restaurant, she wrote, because sometimes she could bring home food. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"
"168526"	"they"	"wrote"	" But the SJC justices ruled that the word reversal has been interpreted by the SJC in other cases to mean the overturning of a specific case. The amendment, they wrote, seeks not to reverse the decision per se but merely to enact a new law prohibiting gay marriage. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"
"168543"	"he"	"wrote"	" Anzor Maskhadov, the son of the former Chechen president, vowed in an e-mail message that the fight would go on. The perished leaders and rank-and-file fighters are being replaced, he wrote. The new president, Umarov, he wrote, is also the commander in chief, and there are many commanders who follow his orders. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060710.0258 type=story > <HEADLINE> UGGLA UNSURE IF HE ENJOYS ALL-STAR </HEADLINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"
"168756"	"they"	"wrote"	" Next, in validating the constitutional amendment to outlaw same-sex marriage, the SJC parsed the meaning of reverse as finely as Bill Clinton tried to parse the meaning of is. The decision in this case turned on a provision in the state constitution prohibiting any amendment that seeks the reversal of a judicial decision. The SJC justices said that in the past, reversal was interpreted to mean the overturning of a specific case. The proposed amendment, they wrote, would not reverse the Goodridge decision; it would merely enact a new law prohibiting same-sex marriage. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"
"168761"	"she"	"wrote"	" Hundreds from Washington - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, former Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee - came to say goodbye to Buchwald. Three thousand more sent letters bidding him farewell, including Marines with whom he served, and cohorts who had also lived at the Hebrew Orphan Asylum. One actress thanked Buchwald for giving her a positive review as an understudy decades ago; the praise, she wrote, launched her career. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"
"169071"	"she"	"wrote"	" Schwarzkopf's American operatic debut came in 1955 with the San Francisco Opera as the Marschallin. Mildred Norton, a critic for The Saturday Review, reported that a capacity audience had saluted a memorable new Princess Werdenberg. Schwarzkopf, she wrote, was a poised and vibrant new personality with a vocal radiance and a personal grace. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169102"	"he"	"wrote"	" Dooley said Friday's decision did not break new ground. Courts in California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Washington and Wisconsin, he wrote, have recognized parental rights in a same-gender partner of a person who adopts a child or conceives through artificial insemination. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060804.0184 type=story > <HEADLINE> ISRAEL BOMBS CHRISTIAN AREA OF LEBANON, KILLING OVER 30 </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> HALAT, Lebanon </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169103"	"he"	"wrote"	" Last Monday, Walter Dellinger, a Duke University law professor who headed Clinton's Office of Legal Counsel, wrote in The New York Times that the ABA report misdiagnoses the problem. The problem is not signing statements, he wrote, but the fundamentally wrong constitutional theories Bush has advanced in his signing statements. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169123"	"he"	"wrote"	" PBS and Sprout would not say how many complaints they had received. Getler wrote that he had received about 250 e-mail messages, with just one supporting Sprout's decision. PBS Viewer Services, he wrote, received some 1,700 e-mail messages, about six in favor of the Sprout decision, while some 5,000 people have signed the petitions against it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169269"	"she"	"wrote"	" Such attitudes, she wrote, don't bother her most times. But once in a while, she admitted, I just want to say child care workers are important, do important work and should be given respect. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169365"	"he"	"wrote"	" But last week Keller e-mailed me a description of how that picture had changed by December 2005, and it cast some new light on the pre-election situation for me. It implied that the paper's pre-election sources hadn't been sufficiently well-placed and credible to convince him that questions about the program's legality and oversight were serious enough to make it responsible to publish. But by December, he wrote, We now had some new people who could in no way be characterized as disgruntled bureaucrats or war-on-terror doves saying we should publish. That was a big deal. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169635"	"she"	"wrote"	" Taylor rejected the government's threshold argument that she should not hear the case at all because it concerned state secrets. Dismissal on those grounds was not required, she wrote, because the central facts in the case -- the existence of the program, the lack of warrants, the focus on communications in which one party is in the United States -- have been acknowledged by the government. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169670"	"he"	"wrote"	" Of a nanny job in Germany, he wrote, I helped the 8-year-old girl with her homework each day. I took the children outside for play. At day's end, I made sure the children had their evening bath, then put them to bed and read to them before they went to sleep. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169714"	"they"	"wrote"	" The authors, led by analyst David Zion, cautioned they made some large simplifying assumptions about the bill, many of whose key provisions don't kick in until 2008. Also, many companies might borrow to fund their plans, increasing corporate debt issuances, they wrote, and a few companies will actually see spending decrease. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169966"	"he"	"wrote"	" Ron Ekers, president of the International Astronomical Union, e-mailed Glazner. His organization, he wrote, intended to find a replacement for plutons. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"170074"	"she"	"wrote"	" Blackwater had a substantial hurdle to leap in its appeal, she wrote, because Congress has severely limited federal appeals courts' authority to review decisions to send cases from federal court back to state court. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"170076"	"he"	"wrote"	" That educational imperative is a big part of the Canon Rock phenomenon. When guitarists upload their renditions, they often ask that viewers be blunt: What are they doing wrong? How can they improve? When I asked Lim the reason he didn't show his face on his video, he wrote, Main purpose of my recording is to hear the other's suggestions about my playing. He added, I think play is more significant than appearance. Therefore I want the others to focus on my fingering and sound. Furthermore I know I'm not that handsome. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"170206"	"he"	"wrote"	" In an Aug. 22 report, Hagar asserted that significant reform efforts in 2004-2005 have been stymied since the hiring of Susan Kennedy as Schwarzenegger's chief of staff. In January, he wrote, she began meeting regularly with the prison guards union, the California Correctional Peace Officers Association, without informing the corrections secretary. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"

"170596"	"I"	"wrote"	" So the following day, when he e-mailed his attraction, I tried to be both honest and kind. No spark, I wrote, but he was great, good company. If he was looking for the one, I was probably not going to be her. But if he simply sought intelligent dinner companionship some Friday evening, I'd be more than game. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"170602"	"he"	"wrote"	" Others agree. Steven D. Levitt, an economics professor at the University of Chicago, found that commissions did not align the interests of agents with those of their customers, a conclusion he recounted in his book Freakonomics. The agent has little incentive to get a few thousand dollars more for a homeowner, he wrote, because it will not much improve the commission. It is far more important for an agent working on commission to get the deal done and move on, he added. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"

"171243"	"he"	"wrote"	" BC-CANADA-SHOOT (Montreal) Hayder Kadhim, 18, has two bullets still lodged in his neck and skull. A third passed through his calf as he ran from the gunman who sprayed bullets into a crowd of students at Montreal's Dawson College. The shooting, which left one dead and 19 wounded, has riven Canada in a way that similar shootings in the United States have perhaps ceased to stun Americans. Kadhim, an Iraqi immigrant with a taste for rap music, didn't know the shooter, but he traces the origins of his violent rampage to the United States. He has written Prime Minister Brian Harper, urging him not to press forward with plans to repeal the gun registry, a policy that was enacted after another infamous shooting. Relaxing that law, he wrote, would risk turning Montreal and Canada into just another violent American city. By VANESSA GEZARI. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"

"171388"	"he"	"wrote"	" Baskins, he wrote, was led to believe in the legality of an investigation aimed at tracing news leaks from the company's board, which included the use of private detectives to use ruses to gain phone records -- a method called pretexting. Those assurances came from a senior Hewlett-Packard counsel, Kevin T. Hunsaker, who directly oversaw this year's phase of the investigation. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171428"	"she"	"wrote"	" She was busy defending criminal clients in that period, she wrote, and I became spread too thinly, and failed to give sufficient attention to the possible repercussions or the gravity of my actions in how I represented the sheik. She calculated that the worst that could happen would be a ban on visits to her client. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171721"	"I"	"wrote"	" In the interval between huts and home cooking, there were, of course, the hikes. In an early entry in my camping journal, I wrote, How to describe these hikes? Awesome.
