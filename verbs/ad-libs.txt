DAVID LETTERMAN TOP TEN  Rejected Names for Ross Perot's Political Party  10. The Rosstafarians.  9. United We're Nuts.  8. The Dork-O-Crats.  7. Wacky Ass Billionaires.  6. The ``You Might Be a Redneck If You Join This'' Party.  5. The Adorable Miniature Candidate and His Friends.  4. Yankee Doodle Psychos.  3. El Party de Nutjobs.  2. Shorty and the Blowfish.  1. The Hair Club for Geeks.  BILL'S WORLD  Ross Perot's new party will be called the Independence Party or Reform Party. Why not The Perotagonists?  Please explain this. Perot says people hate politicians, distrust elections and are fed up with campaigns. So the answer is another political party.  Perot says his new party will be ``for the independent voters.'' Judging by the talk shows, we bet a bigger party could be created for co-dependent voters.  If he's successful establishing another party, says Perot, either the Democrats or Republicans would disappear. Probably not vanish but, rather, get their own talk shows.  It looks as if peace is closer in both Bosnia and the Middle East. You can still make a career out of being a war correspondent, but you do have to move around some.  Mr. Clinton says he's lost some weight, but has ``10 more pounds to go.'' Proof that he favors cutting the fat out of government.  The White House and Congress are working on a stopgap measure to keep the government from shutting down Oct. 1. Maybe this would be unnecessary with fewer opengap measures.  Mr. Clinton says he wishes he hadn't used the word ``funk'' recently to describe the public's mood. But probably it was better than ``off their meds.''  The president says he's not ``advocating a politics of national funk.'' Darn. We just thought of the campaign song: ``The Red, White and Blues.''  Mr. Clinton has ``basically a decent working relationship'' with Newt Gingrich, he says. What's that mean? They know each other's fax number?  GOOD DAY, WIRE WANDERERS!!!!!
