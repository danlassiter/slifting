"52529"	"she"	"taught"	" Johanna's problems with her social studies teacher had begun in the fall. In her course on ``Ancient Traditions,'' Atwood pressed the theme that women could thrive without men. In prehistoric societies, she taught, females lived apart _ Cavewoman was self-sufficient and independent, and let Caveman near her only when she wanted babies. Many in the class adopted Atwood's view; on one occasion, they shouted in derision when Johanna insisted that it is good for men and women to form families and live together. Atwood let the abuse continue for a while before saying, with clear emphasis, ``Let's let HER tell US what her opinion is.'' From then on, Johanna kept her opinions to herself. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"
"174381"	"he"	"taught"	" Strange, the USF professor, had more to say about the historical Jesus. He came from nowhere important, namely Nazareth. He was single, which was kind of surprising for a nice Jewish boy. He had followers. He taught. Everywhere he went, he taught, even in the temple. He finally got crossways with the religious authorities, Strange said. Finally the Romans killed him as a rebel. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
