"3177"	"we"	"cannot"	" Byrd: ``The (original) Clinton bill would reduce health costs in the year 2004 by $150 billion. By contrast, the pending measure would increase health costs in the year 2004 by at least $25 billion and by over $250 billion for the period 1994-2004. Under the guise of reform, we cannot, we must not, try to address every issue that can be lumped under the loose category of health care. We simply cannot do it.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199408.gz"

While Jewish women are able to obtain a divorce in a civil court, they cannot, under Jewish religious law, remarry or even go out on a date until they have obtained a release, or a get, from their former husbands. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199410.gz"

"44754"	"we"	"cannot"	" Title 28 U. S. C. s2106 provides that ``(t)he Supreme Court or any other court of appellate jurisdiction may affirm, modify, vacate, set aside or reverse any judgment, decree, or order of a court lawfully brought before it for review, and may remand the cause and direct the entry of such appropriate judgment, decree, or order, or require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.'' This facially unlimited statutory text is subject to the implicit limitations imposed by traditional practice and by the nature of the appellate system created by the Constitution and laws of the United States. The inferior federal courts (to say nothing of state courts) are not the creatures and agents of this body as are Masters, whose work we may reject and send back for redoing at our own pleasure. Inferior courts are separately authorized in the Constitution, see Art. I, s8; Art. III, s1, created by Acts of Congress, see, e.g., Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73; Evarts Act, Act of Mar. 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 826, and staffed by judges whose manner of appointment and tenure of office are the same as our own, see U. S. Const., Art. II, s2; Art. III, s1; 28 U. S. C. ss44, 133, 134. Despite the unqualified language of s2106, we cannot, for example, ``reverse'' a judgment of one of these courts ``and direct the entry'' of a different judgment whenever we disagree with what has been done, but only when we can identify a controlling error of law.

NEW YORK _  Dear Diary:  I was on the subway on the way to my Midtown office at the height of the rush hour. The train was packed, but I was deep in my newspaper and managed to tune out my surroundings.  When the doors opened, I was roused by a swarm of about 10 noisy and ready-for-anything 6-or-so-year-old campers, along with three somewhat harried counselors. Most passengers, already squeezed like sardines, were not thrilled by the onslaught or the sudden increase in the decibel level.  As the train picked up speed, there was a loud ``Whoa!'' from the kids. ``This is just like a roller coaster,'' one called out. The train took another rapid turn. ``Whoa!'' came the cry from the kids. Smiles began to pass even among the most resistant faces. Another turn, another loud yell from the group.  The counselors called out to the kids to grab the nearest floor pole. With that I felt, but couldn't see, two tiny hands wrap themselves around my leg. That turned out to be the most valuable _ and certainly the most supportive _ role I filled all day.  _ LEE DAVIES  Dear Diary:  The residents of my Upper West Side apartment building recently played host to someone we believe to be the oldest newspaper delivery person in the world. It was a summer stoop soiree, and we were gathered to thank Margaret Haber for delivering our newspapers to our front doors. We do not have a doorman, and the newspapers are dropped off in the lobby. Haber recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.  _ NANCY FUNKE  Dear Diary:  I live in a very small town about 50 miles north of Melbourne, Australia, and am in New York visiting my son. While strolling through Central Park recently, I met two friends from Melbourne. A million to one chance?  I have a longtime friend from New York who moved recently, and I didn't have his address. A few days later, I was walking along East 96th Street and there was my friend coming in the opposite direction. He lives on the West Side.  I'm going to buy a lottery ticket. What a town!  _ PHILIP SEMMENS  METROPOLITAN MUSIC  Walking, like a cello, slowly,  A solemn dark hum toning through me  as the sidewalk shivers on waves of heat to greet me:  no mercy in the silent stone.  Impatient horns, playing wildly  With no score to take their fury,  while a pitiless sun scorches limp,  lovingly planted border flowers  where dogs and beetles leave their mark.  And the steady beat of my heart  echoes upward in my brain,  drumming for rain ...  thinking of night ...  conjuring cool pines  and moonsilver on meadows.  _ VERA HALDY-REGIER  THE NUMBERS RACKET  I can't cope with the phone _ it makes me deranged;  It just tells me the menu has been rearranged.  New menu, they say _ I didn't want a meal.  Whatever I say, there is no appeal.  Press one if you wish to hear this again  And simply return to the menu, main.  If you want to move on, simply press two;  Haydn's complete works without further ado.  Care with your finger, for if you press three,  You'll get all the seasons. You know, Vivaldi.  Still hanging on? Great heavens alive!  If you're still breathing, press five.  Nothing there, sadly, try seven or six:  Mozart and Bach, a magnificent mix.  Cannot remember about eight and nine  Oh, did you did press them and we cut the line.  To speak to a person, you need to press 10;  Oh dear, you cannot, so we'll start once again.  I stab at the buttons _ mad random choice  And gasp with amazement _ a human voice!  A vacuous youngster; she knows not a jot;  She asks what I want. My God, I've forgot!  _ TONY HOMER  William Primavera was in a delicatessen when he heard the counterman complain about the weird day he was having. It had started, the counterman said, with a fellow who came in and asked the price of a turkey sandwich.  Told it was $4, the man said, ``Then just sell me 2 ounces of turkey and throw in two slices of bread.''  At this point, another customer, who identified himself as an airport limo driver, joined in. ``My day hasn't been much better,'' he said. ``This morning, I picked up a woman who was going to Kennedy and on the way, the radio dispatcher told me that her flight had been delayed. When I told her, she said, `But what about first class?'''  Dear Diary:  Our notoriously slow office elevator was about to close when I reached in a hand to stop it and got on. I mumbled an apology to the lone occupant, a quiet-looking gentleman, who replied, ``No problem, it's the rhythm of life.''  ``Rhythm of life,'' I repeated, pleased by his instant and patient philosophy. ``Good way to look at it.''  ``Yes,'' he went on, not missing a beat, ``the rhythm of life, it's inescapable, it's undeniable, it's irrefutable.''  And with that, he stepped off, leaving behind his impressed audience of one.  _ DAN BARRON  Dear Diary:  I was standing at a bus stop on the Upper West Side, and in the shelter was an advertisement for a movie produced by a Bernie Williams. Next to me, a boy of about 7 enthusiastically remarked to his baby sitter, ``Look, Bernie Williams is in that movie.''  At that point, a woman standing nearby said to the boy, ``I don't think that's the Yankees' Bernie Williams, it's another man with the same name.'' The boy looked at her suspiciously and sidled closer to his baby sitter.  Then, as if she had not shocked the boy enough with the news that Bernie Williams had a doppelganger, the woman said, ``And you know, Paul O'Neill is also the name of the secretary of the Treasury.'' At this the boy glanced at her with redoubled suspicion and trepidation, and nervously clutched the baby sitter's shirt. Perhaps he thought the woman was diabolically cloning the Yankees in her spare time.  _ NICK ROBINSON </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020728.0212 type=story > <HEADLINE> AFGHAN PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO ACCEPT U.S. SECURITY GETS MIXED </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> KABUL, Afghanistan  (BC-AFGHAN-SECURITY-1STLD) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"
