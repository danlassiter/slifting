"50017"	"I"	"presume"	" His wife, Patrice, is very clever, very neurotic and very obstreperous when aroused. Judith Ivey walks the line _ a necessary line, I presume, but a tricky one _ between making her compelling and making her unbearable. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"
"59471"	"we"	"presume"	" (He did not start the first game and his team lost in five) ... Patrick Ewing went to bat for coach-without-portfolio Jeff Van Gundy before heading into the titleless sunset for the 11th straight season. Ewing has one more year left on his Knicks contract, a deal that will see him take a $15 million pay cut next season to a meager $3.3 million. (Can David Falk allow that to blight his resume?) Ewing may have to do what Bill Walton did in 1985 to get a ring and go elsewhere, for New York doesn't look to be a serious contender, despite its cash flow, in the next few years ... Chris Ford will be in Dallas Tuesday and Milwaukee Wednesday, but heading into the weekend, he had not heard a word from the 76ers or Nets. (That is not all bad.) And with George Karl out of the Charlotte picture (the Sonics picked up his option for next season), GM Bob Bass may decide soon between Ford and the other presumed contender, Dave Cowens ... We all love Gary Payton's defense, but what in the world was he doing double-teaming Hakeem Olajuwon in the closing seconds of Game 4, instead of sticking with Sam Cassell on the perimeter? The Sonics had a 3-point lead at the time, a 3-0 lead in the series, and, of course, Cassell made the shot and forced overtime. Seattle went on to win in OT and Payton apologized for his gaffe, which could have been substantial had the Rockets pulled it out. But the move also illustrates the obsession NBA coaches have with double-teams. Payton's move was instinctive because that is what he's supposed to do the other 47 minutes and 47 seconds of the game. It's silly, but predictable. It just turned to stupid in that one sequence ... The apocalypse has indeed arrived. Thirty people in Hooterville entered a contest to see who could best imitate the Magic's bellowing public address announcer, Paul Porter. (Next up, we presume, is the Contrived Thought Contest.) One of the cochampions was 5-year-old Brittany Koziara,who said her long-range goal is to marry Penny Hardaway. They just don't get it there, do they? But they are not alone. Adidas has signed high schooler Kobe Bryant to a contract and will introduce him at a news conference in New York Tuesday. Never mind that no one knows whether he can even play in the NBA. Why does that matter? Also, the conglomerate that owns the Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche has formed a new group to oversee management of the two teams. The person who will oversee this company is the general manager of Pepsi-Cola in Denver. They insist that business and basketball will be separate. And finally there's Rodman, not to be confused with Saul Bellow. His book is on The New York Times bestseller list ... Magic Johnson says the winner of the Seattle-Utah series will be the team to make it out of the Western Conference ... By losing to Orlando, the Hawks continued their streak of seven-game-series futilty. The Hawks have not won a best-of-seven affair since the 1969-70 season, their second year in Atlanta. Since then, they have had 11 best-of-seven affairs and in only two of them, the last being the 1987-88 epic against the Celtics, did they even manage to stretch the series to the maximum seven games ... Last week, we reported that there were 19 early-entry candidates. That was the number of known candidates. The NBA last week released the full list and it contains a staggering 42 names, including three high school players and some collegians even Ted Sarandis has probably never heard of (Idris Lee of Mount Senario and Dut Mayar Madut of Franklin Phillips, for instance). One has to assume that many of them will survey the landscape and withdraw their names, as John Wallace did last year. One of the names to watch is Zydrunas Ilgauskas,a massive Lithuanian who has been hailed as the next Arvydas Sabonis (although he's not as big). He had some scouts drooling last year when he committed to the draft, but didn't do well in Chicago and withdrew. Another interesting name is Ukrainian Vitaly Potapenko,a 6-foot-10-inch bruiser from Wright State who was a terror in the Midwestern Collegiate Conference ... Speaking of foreign leviathans, Stojko Vrankovic should again be the object of NBA interest this summer, and it will be interesting to see whether he can generate interest based on his play in the Olympics. He had his moments in Barcelona, and, as Stephen Sondheim once wrote, ``Any moment big or small is a moment after all.'' The Cavaliers are interested with Brad Daugherty gonzo and the Bucks have been on Vrankovic's trail the last several years. ``He's playing better now than he did when he was with Boston,'' Bucks GM Mike Dunleavy noted. ``But age is something now that you have to consider. (Vrankovic turns 33 in January). It will be up to the new coach to see how far it goes.'' We can just imagine Ford's reaction to that one when Dunleavy brings it up ... We hear that Xavier McDaniel is back in the United States after playing a year in Greece and hopes to get an NBA job next season ... After the Magic eliminated Atlanta, Hardaway and Anderson were brought out to the media room for interviews. After a number of questions were fired at Hardaway, Anderson got up, said, ``I feel like Little Penny,'' and left. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"

"99213"	"I"	"presume"	" Lawrence Block writes terrific books. He is a Grand Master of the  Mystery Writers of America, one of the rare mystery writers whose new  books I will buy in cloth rather than wait for paperback. His Matthew  Scudder series is his best work; an alcoholic who has been on the wagon  now for many years, and who attends AA meetings pretty regularly,  comfortably married to a former hooker who sells antiques, Scudder has  given up his private-eye license, but he still tries to help people who  have a case on which the police have gone cold. In ``Hope to Die''  (Morrow, $25) Byrne and Susan Hollander, well-to-do and well known, are  murdered in a home invasion. Soon after, the killers are found dead in a  locked room in Brooklyn, apparently a murder and suicide, and the case  is closed. But then Scudder is drawn into looking again, and he spots  first one anomaly, then another. Block makes the strategic decision to  let the reader know quite early that a serial killer is at work, and the  killer grows more obsessive as we watch. The dialogue is as good as  ever, and the wry observations about chance, hope, life, and New York  flow brilliantly from Block, but the killer is one-dimensional and  unconvincing, and the final third of the book is flat. Even a last  chapter that is, I presume, meant to come as a surprise is easily  anticipated. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
