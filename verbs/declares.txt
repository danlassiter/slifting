"6593"	"he"	"declares"	" ``Can't I just play baseball?'' Joe, portrayed by Jason Workman, asks plaintively -- implying perhaps that he has sold his soul a second time. The only endorsement that excites him is Wheaties because, he declares, ``I eat Wheaties!'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199410.gz"
"7529"	"he"	"declares"	" That's why author Dan Jenkins, whose writings on golf are well known, says the sport will never again be a private domain of the rich. No longer, he declares, is it a question of class and hierarchy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199410.gz"
"26689"	"he"	"declares"	" After some hesitation, he declares, ``I know if I were in his (Loving's) situation, I would have wanted it to end a long time ago. If I were in his shoes, I would have done the same thing.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

"33330"	"he"	"declares"	" But Phillips is undaunted. One way or another, he declares, he will press on. His lawyer, J. Blair Richardson, even suggests that the best way to put an end to the confrontation would be for Donnelley to hire Phillips to overhaul Metromail. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"36484"	"she"	"declares"	" The film uses a 1989 taped interview with Miss Ling (who later refused to be reinterviewed), weeping copiously as she describes her belief that bloodshed will be the inevitable upshot of confrontation. It is the only way, she declares, that the people will learn the oppressive nature of their government. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"38770"	"he"	"declares"	" To opponents of the communist government whom he is now trying to woo, he declares, ``There were many mistakes, absurdities, wrongdoings and even crimes.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"
"43054"	"he"	"declares"	" At another, he declares, ``Look at this! They just don't get it!'' Ostrofsky has taken one of those why-didn't-someone-do-this-before ideas and run with it. The Houston native has created a trade show aimed at home computer buyers and taken it on the road. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"

"53669"	"she"	"declares"	" Before embarking on their journey, Mel, Nancy and Tina visit his adoptive parents (Mary Tyler Moore and George Segal, exhibiting a finely sifted neuroticism worthy of ``Seinfeld''). Moore is especially upset by her son's search for his roots. Eyeing the ever-earnest Tina suspiciously, she declares, ``This woman strikes me as very dangerous.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"
"55900"	"he"	"declares"	" PANEL FOUR: Before Speed can gasp in wonder, Typo tosses a spent flashbulb onto a strategic spot in the carpet pattern, unleashing a deadly but misdirected assortment of flying knives, flames, arrows and venomous spiders. Observing a single telltale bleached hair lodged in the doorjamb, he declares, ``Split ends! Just as I thought, Boss! This is Features Editor Hyperba Lee's handiwork!

"56629"	"he"	"declares"	" Extracurricular life these days revolves round Nicki, his fourth wife, and Emma, their 3-year-old daughter and his sixth child. In the autobiography he published in 1993, Sir Peter spoke of bouts of near-suicidal depression that had hit him when he was working too hard or, sometimes, not working hard enough. But the marriage he made in 1990 is, he declares, keeping them at bay. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"

"59926"	"he"	"declares"	" In the interim, Wright has written a couple of scholarly papers but has drawn the line there. They're a lot of work, he declares, and ``they don't pay. Peers don't read them.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"
"81515"	"he"	"declares"	" The similarities break down along the way. Nye, for instance, clearly doesn't have curly blond hair or look much like Paul Newman. Nor, he declares, has he succumbed to extramarital temptation or family indifference as has his ``Peter Cutler.'' The real Nye, in fact, seems to have carefully chosen the natural life whenever a choice had to be made. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"
"84977"	"he"	"declares"	" About three of the 90 minutes of ``Shattering the Silences'' are given to John Searle, a professor of English at Berkeley, who opposes ethnic studies, which he defines as a device for advancing political causes in the classroom. Affirmative action, he declares, comes down to this: ``If the choice in faculty hiring is between a superior white male and a not-so-qualified minority, you are supposed to choose the less qualified person.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"85979"	"she"	"declares"	" But she also knows that some people miss their meetings because they just don't feel like going. Part of it, she declares, ``is they are sick and tired of welfare. But they're not willing to do anything else either.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"97712"	"she"	"declares"	" But at other points Marton's thesis seems to be slightly out of step with her narrative, like a movie in which the sound and picture are a split second out of sync. Jacqueline Kennedy's wildly successful trip to Paris in 1961 transformed her into a full partner, she declares, bringing the couple a new intimacy. But there is scant evidence that President John F. Kennedy sought her counsel during major crises or that she influenced his thinking. Nor did he make any attempt to curtail his sexual escapades. Later Marton says the Nixons' arrival in Washington in 1946 marked the end of their existence as a ``political couple.'' Yet it isn't clear they ever were one. And when did the elder George Bush become a ``universally loved figure''? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"98865"	"he"	"declares"	" And, then, when he stops writing he might read the Washington Post and  ``criticize it a little bit.'' Or do a little work in the garden out  back with his wife, Mimi. Or complain to someone that ``they should have  seen what it was like in the old days.'' Or wander down to the  laundromat and ``worry about whether the quality of the Korean laundry  has declined.''  He will not, he declares, write another book. It is too  big an undertaking. He has nothing, nothing to say. And yet, there he  was at a cocktail party this summer listening to ``stories of greed on  Nantucket,'' of huge sums of money spent on worthless property, of women  in black capri pants talking loudly on their cellphones. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"118926"	"she"	"declares"	" I ask the airport shuttle driver if business is still affected by 9/11. People don't like to worry about it anymore, she says. It was a terrible thing, but no one's going to stop traveling, she declares, almost perky. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"128456"	"he"	"declares"	" Lately, Carter has been harshly denouncing the current president's policy toward Iraq. America is in no danger from Baghdad, he declares, and war talk from the administration's ``belligerent and divisive voices'' must be resisted. Naturally he has no intention of muffling his own belligerent and divisive voice. But then, why would he? It has just won him a Nobel Prize _ which he fully intends to keep. Jeff Jacoby's e-mail address is jacoby(at)globe.com. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20021017.0131 type=story > <HEADLINE> EXPERTS SAY 401(K) IS A GOOD DEAL, EVEN IN TOUGH TIMES </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 10-17-02 14:06:00EDT (BC-RETIREMENT-FUNDS-HNS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"128936"	"he"	"declares"	" But far too much of the material Mason relies on here is retirable. Some is simply worn out, like the ridicule of Clinton's sexual escapades, or the long exegesis of how impossible it is to sort out the confusion involved in healthy eating. (Diet advice is often contradictory! Can you imagine?) Some is lazy, like his reworking of the irritations of airport security or his imitation of President Bush, which recalls him not at all. Some, like his comparison of Mayors Rudolph W. Giuliani and Michael R. Bloomberg, is empty; both men are popular, he declares, but Giuliani always seemed busy and Bloomberg doesn't. Some is simply virulent and graceless, like his gratuitous reference to Enron executives as ``Nazi bastards.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"129016"	"he"	"declares"	" ``God created man because he loves stories,'' says this storyteller, whose lifelong discussion with God has not always been temperate. ``I never divorced God,'' he says. ``I couldn't. I'm too Jewish.'' But, he declares, ``I have the right to protest his ways.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"142875"	"he"	"declares"	" In an analysis titled Inexcusable Failure, Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies details how the United States failed to treat the Iraqis as partners in the counterinsurgency effort. U.S. officials, he declares, are guilty of a gross military, administrative and moral failure. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"144778"	"he"	"declares"	" Nevertheless, he declares, It was the most incredible period of my life. I wouldn't wish it on anybody. You're glad you were there, but you never want to go through it again. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"160838"	"he"	"declares"	" After a strong but underappreciated 2003 CD, Life (TVT), this Memphis rapper returns with a revelatory new greatest-hits mixtape. The disc, compiled by DJ Infamous and Sir Swift, gathers songs and freestyles that show off his ruthless sensibility and squelchy voice. Sucking on the words as if they were Jolly Ranchers, he declares, My peeps gotta eat, I ain't got time to wait/ You got peanuts on your menu, I'm digesting steak. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"168760"	"he"	"declares"	" Mabuse constantly changes his appearance, as if to suggest he is everyone and no one - or as Lang once put it, everywhere present but nowhere recognizable - evil incarnate but unidentifiable. (In a nice visual flourish, we see him at one point dealing a deck of cards, each of which shows Mabuse in a different disguise.) More than just a criminal mastermind, Mabuse is, he declares, a state within a state with which I have always been at war. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"
"171095"	"he"	"declares"	" Perhaps, he declares, it had something to do with sex acts in the woods. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171229"	"he"	"declares"	" And Zaillian does not seem quite sure what to make of the character. At its root, Willie's story has the simplicity of a parable, in which a crusader on behalf of the poor and marginal becomes a monster, blighting the machinery of government with graft and vanity and turning public works into self-aggrandizing monuments. In the film (one of whose executive producers is James Carville), Willie, originally modeled on the Louisiana governor and U.S. senator Huey P. Long, shows a passing resemblance to more recent political figures, from Bill Clinton to Lyndon B. Johnson to Hugo Chavez. He is a creature of high political intelligence, unbridled appetite and a vengeful eagerness to humiliate his state's traditional rulers. Louisiana's oil and gas, he declares, belong to the people, on whose behalf he builds highways, bridges, schools and hospitals. With him the era of big government is just beginning. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171233"	"she"	"declares"	" This being a Sorkin script, another boss offers an even more stirring diatribe on the virtues of free speech. If a tiny rural TV market doesn't want to take the risk of offending a few humorless nuts and run the network's show, says Jordan (Peet), just wait until it becomes a hit. Then, she declares, the network will charge a penalty fee to any affiliate that didn't carry it from the beginning. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
