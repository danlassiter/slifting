, he said,	 His trainer, Michael Matz, seems unconcerned about the surface and the wait. Barbaro, he said, always has trained extremely well on the dirt. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, he said,	 As for the wait, he said experience has taught him the importance of having a fresh horse. A former Olympian who has a silver medal to prove it, Matz explained that in 1976 he was fighting for a spot on the equestrian Olympic team. The struggle was so intense, he said, that by the time he arrived in Montreal for the Olympics, his horse was spent. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, he added,	 But, he added, cost cutting is key, especially at a company as bloated as HP was after its mega-merger with Compaq. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, he noted,	 Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., argued that Democrats have already succeeded at molding U.S. policy. Last fall's Senate vote signaling congressional impatience and naming 2006 as the year of decision for Iraq, he noted, was inspired by Democrats. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, he said,	 Federal reinsurance would be a win-win for homeowners, insurance companies and taxpayers, he said, because such funds would help control the cost of homeowners insurance, while pre-funding disaster relief. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz

, he said,	 Over the last five years, hotel supply has increased by 5 percent and is estimated to grow 1.1 percent more this year, according to Bjorn Hanson, head of PricewaterhouseCoopers' hospitality division, with a disproportionate amount in second-tier markets. Hotel supply in second-tier markets grew about 7 percent in the last five years, he said, and is expected to climb 1.5 to 2 percent in 2006. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz

, she said,	 In fact, she said, Right Management provides its clients with a list of questions they can use to try to suss out a company's culture. One is: Describe your best employee and why they are so good. Another: Describe a significant change in your business division in the past year, and how it was brought about. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, she said,	 That kind of fit is the opposite of a core value because it must change, she said, and core values are considered set. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, he added,	 They're rolling the dice, more than they would be in court, he said. But, he added, If they're going to arbitration, they're going to resolve it. They want to resolve it. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, he said,	 The outcome, he said, is almost the opposite of what was intended. In many cities, the JOA has been dismantled in favor of one-paper monopolies after all, and it can be argued that the JOA has actually promoted the move to one-paper monopolies. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, he said,	 JOAs may have let two papers live longer than they would have otherwise, he said, but on the other hand, you can argue that the JOA weakened the weaker paper and killed it. To the extent that the act was expected to keep two papers alive, it has failed to do that in at least 10 or so cities. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060331.0018 type=story > <HEADLINE> BBO-STEROIDS-1STLD-WRITETHRU-975&amp;ADD-NYT </HEADLINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, he added,	 Selig said he was trying to send a message that a nagging steroid situation would be addressed. But, he added, he was also hoping that it would shift the game's focus back to the field. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, I will,	 Sheffield agreed to be interviewed by Mitchell. If I have to, I will, he said Thursday in Tampa, Fla. I'm going to do whatever the law states for me to do. But other than that, it's a waste of my time. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz

, he said,	 Mussina started against the Devil Rays, working four innings. Based on his spring, he said, he would not expect to have further problems with his elbow, which caused him to miss three weeks last September. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, they note,	 London adopted congestion pricing to reduce gridlock on its busiest streets and encourage the use of public transit. By those measures, it's been a success, and something that similarly afflicted cities in the United States, starting with New York, should want to consider. The fee, about $14, is supposed to support mass transportation. The British make a good case that the charge is not a tax, but a toll for the use of selected streets. Their diplomats, they note, regularly pay tolls on American roads and bridges. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, you know,	 Carroll, apparently knowing she would be released, denounced what she described as the lies told by the American government and predicted that the insurgents would defeat the Americans in Iraq. I feel guilty. I also feel that it just shows that the mujahedeen are good people fighting an honorable fight, a good fight. While the Americans are here, the occupying forces, you know, treating the people in a very, very bad way. So I can't be happy totally for my freedom because there are people still suffering in prisons, in very difficult situations. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, he said,	 It's a form of brainwashing in a deprived state where victims emotionally bond with the captors in order to survive, Manevitz said. He stressed that he did not know Carroll and could speak about the syndrome only in general terms. People can feel helpless and hopeless, and any small act of kindness -- not killing her, giving her food, letting her have a shower -- can lead to bonding with the captor. The captor, he said, becomes both tormentor and savior. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, she said,	 But, she said, Being able to perform every night in a different city makes you feel like you get better and better. You learn so much every night. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, you see,	 I had a big nose and lips, you see, so bench jockeys would ride me endlessly. I even challenged the New York Giants clubhouse to a fight one year during the World Series because of the race-baiting. I was big in Harlem, though, and that was nice. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, he added,	 As an example, he pointed to the intellectual resources that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. called upon to write his classic Letter From a Birmingham Jail. King's seminary training was vital in helping him reshape America, Franklin says. Some problems, he added, cannot be addressed by ministers who only know how to preach a rousing sermon or talk about divine revelations. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, he says,	 If you want to be governor, he says, you should release your income tax returns. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, he said,	 Such a prosecution, he said, would not only achieve a measure of justice for the victims at Srebenica, but it would also improve the chances that local Muslims would cooperate with federal officials in counterterrorism investigations. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, they noted,	 After Sept. 11, 2001, they noted, the administration wrote a secret legal memo outlining ways to prevent overseas US interrogators from facing torture charges under the law. The memo was leaked in 2004 during the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal, sparking outrage. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, he suggested,	 And, he suggested, charges could still be added. The United States will vigorously enforce federal criminal law, including the antitorture statute, he said. The alleged charges in this case did not meet the elements of the statute at the time, but the investigation continues as more evidence is sought. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, he said,	 Max Stern, Boskic's attorney, said the Justice Department had made the right call. There is no evidence, he said, that Boskic had wanted to participate in the massacre, let alone that he had wanted to cause suffering. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, I say,	 2. Anyone can win. When people ask me why I do what I do, I say, Villanova 66, Georgetown 64. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, I mean,	 At times, Coach (John) Brady would get on me, I mean, on me on me, and it wouldn't affect me at all because I was used to it from high school, Mitchell said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, they say,	 On the one hand, some people may ignore a teaser ad because, they say, their level of interest depends largely on the location of the project. On the other hand, information that is parceled out bit by bit about the appearance or amenities may overcome resistance about the location once it's finally announced. Someone who wasn't considering moving to New Tampa, for example, might be sufficiently intrigued by the blind information about the project to at least drive out and take a look once the project opens. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, you know,	 We have three losses to great teams. I think people are looking at our record thinking, you know, we are on a down slide, she said after the Maryland loss. So I'm not worried. I think every time we've lost, I think we've learned. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, he said,	 Wheldon doesn't see his as a risky decision. If anything, he said, it stokes his title chances further. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, I guess,	 What we work on day in and day out is something that cannot go out of fashion, because as human beings, we cannot go out of fashion, said Jennifer Landon, a newcomer (and Michael Landon's daughter) playing Gwen Norbeck since last year. It's completely about the challenges and, I guess, breakthroughs of every individual. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz
, we go,	 It's very gnarly history, executive producer Chris Goutman said. Whenever we try to get two people together (as a couple), we go, Well, they can't because they're related.' Then, we make the other one adopted. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
