"12517"	"we"	"discover"	" With this advance warning that not all mysteries will be solved, we enter the verbal maze of s2543. The entrance, we discover, is actually an exit, since the provision begins by excepting certain activities from its operation: ``Except to the extent that such action may constitute an infringement under subsections (3) and (4) of section 2541 of this title, it shall not infringe any right hereunder for a person to save seed produced by him . . . and use such saved seed in the production of a crop for use on his farm, or for sale as provided in this section . . . .''

"47239"	"they"	"discover"	" The rally with which the first scene opens, they discover, has been organized by members of the Communist Workers' Party, which is trying to unionize the Cannon, Cone and Burlington mills. It has drawn about 100 people. Only half of them are black. Most don't live in the black neighborhood where they have gathered. Some, it develops, are liberal young Jewish doctors from the Duke University medical school. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"
"56542"	"we"	"discover"	" Blood Sport James B. Stewart (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25) Bill and Hillary Clinton promised to cooperate with Stewart (his ``Wall Street Journal'' reports on insider trading and the stock market crash won a Pulitzer) by talking about the Whitewater affair, but they reneged and here are the consequences. The book is damning, not legally but personally. It reveals pathetic details about the Clintons' marriage, their personalities and their judgment. They were reckless in handling their Whitewater investment, and their subsequent evasiveness has only hurt them. They are, says Stewart, ``no different than their predecessors, deeply enmeshed in a Washington culture so inured to partisan distortion and spin that truth is the most frightening prospect of all.'' Getting Over Getting Older Letty Cottin Pogrebin (Little, Brown, $23.95) If you are facing 50, come sit here by Letty. Pogrebin, one of the founding editors of ``Ms.,'' wrote about children and family in her books ``Among Friends'' and ``Growing Up Free.'' Now she writes about the signs that she is not so young anymore, from her preoccupation with impending mortality to those puffy spots under her eyes to her forgetfulness (she quotes Gloria Steinem, who said, ``At this age, being able to remember something is as good as an orgasm.''). This is not just a smarmy pep talk but an unflinching discussion of real angst and a real adjustment process. God Has Ninety-Nine Names Judith Miller (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $30) In January 1986, Miller, Middle East correspondent for the ``New York Times,'' had just checked into a Libyan hotel _ she was wearing a raincoat, skirt and high heels _ when she was hastily summoned to a bus, driven into the desert and deposited in a barley field. A tractor approached and the driver said, ``Hop in.'' It was Moammar Gadhafi, who steered the tractor erratically around the field, mangling crops, while he and Miller discussed Libya's future. This is a wonderfully readable report on the Islamic fervor that has driven Middle East politics since 1979 and on Miller's adventures during 25 years of reporting from the region. This Damn House! Margo Kaufman (Villard, $21) The first architect Kaufman interviewed when she and her husband decided to renovate their beach bungalow admitted after an hour of interrogation that he had never remodeled a house before. ``But I'm working on a hospital entrance,'' he said. It was an omen, but Margo and Duke plunged in. She describes the experience from demolition to doorknobs, from loan applications to light fixtures, from grout to gigantic checks (she wrote them every Friday). Margo and Duke survived with their marriage intact. Margo wrote this book because she learned that remodeling in retrospect is funny _ and she needs the cash. I Was Amelia Earhart Jane Mendelsohn (Knopf, $18) In this sensuous first novel, we discover, through shifting third- and first-person narrations, what happened to Amelia Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan (he is addicted to drink, cigarettes and women, and he knows how to read the stars), after their plane went down in 1937. Interspersed with descriptions of their life on the island to which they have fallen are Amelia's memories of her youth, her husband (the opportunistic G.P. Putnam) and her beloved plane, now stranded on a reef flat. The story is dreamy, mesmerizing and so brief you can read it in a sitting. Mother Edited by Claudia O'Keefe (Pocket, $12) It's that time of year again. This original paperback includes stories, essays and poems that celebrate motherhood. Contributors include Nora Ephron (an excerpt from ``Heartburn''), Barbara Kingsolver (the story ``Quality Time'' from her collection ``Homeland''), Joyce Carol Oates, Maya Angelou, Lorrie Moore, Andrew Greeley, Amy Tan, Faye Kellerman, Julia Alvarez, Ann Hood and others. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960423.0690 type=story > <HEADLINE> ARTHUR ANDERSEN TO PAY $10 MLN IN FAILED REALTY CASE (UPDATE1) </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> New York, April 23 (Bloomberg) (BC-ARTHUR-ANDERSON-UPDATE1-BLOOM) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"

"97309"	"we"	"discover"	" Instead of high drama, ``La Cienaga'' presents a relentless accumulation of small, grinding incidents that portray Argentina's provincial middle class adrift in a self-pitying limbo. We learn about the characters by eavesdropping on their telephone conversations and their desultory bickerings. Mecha's mother, we discover, died after taking to her bed for 10 years, and it seems quite possible that Mecha will follow in her footsteps. She takes out her frustrations on her Indian servants, whom she viciously accuses of theft and laziness. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"

"162712"	"we"	"discover"	" On the festival's website, the folks behind the best-of collection said that whittling down what was likely several hundred videos to an essential 20 proved contentious. And you might object to what's not there. Nothing starring Missy Elliott or directed by Chris Cunningham or Hype Williams made the cut, for example. But what did is uniformly excellent. Spike Jonze's video for Wax's garage-pop lament California, an early piece from 1996, is one long take of a man on fire running in slow motion down a Los Angles sidewalk. The burning man, we discover, is running for the bus, and what seems like a proto-Jackass stupid human trick is really a terrifying worst-case scenario for a car-less life in L.A. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
