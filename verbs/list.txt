What we tend to do as people is, we tend to write lists. Over and over, we list, we list, we list. And then after we list, in our minds, we play back the list. Number one is this. Number two is that. Number three ... Doing exercise breaks that mode. It gives you something totally different to do, and it clears your mind. Exercise will also help you sleep, and when it helps you sleep, you're going to be able to focus more the next day. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

John Pepper, a Boloco cofounder with Adam Liebman, says they started the business at a time when wraps might be associated with ultra healthy but not necessarily good tasting. Grilling unusual combinations - such as teriyaki burrito or a Cajun version - and no microwaving has proved a winning combination, says Pepper.

(And now I know why my angel wings and eyelash begonias -- carted up and down the East Coast, dropped down three flights of stairs, started anew with cuttings -- have survived so many years of neglect.)

What happened: When two pieces of plywood were butted together, they weren't even; one was a bit higher than the other; a difference of just 1/8 or even 1/16 inch can cause a problem. When the tiles were laid (with thin-set mortar or adhesive) each overlapped the joint by about half. Then, when the tiles were stepped on, they rocked, like a teeter-totter over the apex (the plywood joint), eventually causing the crack. At least that's what I think happened. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, I say,	 Apparently, you have an air-conditioning unit in the apartment, and that dripping water is condensate dripping into a collection pan, from which it is then pumped outdoors. If you have no water leaking onto the floor or elsewhere, I say, forget it; the unit is working as it should, and the water you hear is being dripped into a collection pan and the unit pumps the water outdoors. If you see water on the floor or anywhere else, then call the specialist. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

, you know,	 Here's how it would work. The visually-impaired hunter would be required to hunt with a fully-sighted hunting buddy. The visually-impaired hunter would point the gun and the laser light toward the game. When the colored light landed on the deer or whatever, the hunter with the good eyes would say something clever, like, you know, Shoot, Eat lead, fuzz face, or, Here's one for mother. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

U.S.-MILITARY-MUSLIMS (Lackland Air Force Base, Texas) -- Stomping her boots and swinging her bony arms, Fadwa Hamdan led a column of troops through this bleak Texas base. Only six months earlier, she wore the headscarf of a pious Muslim woman and dropped her eyes in the presence of men. Now she was marching them to dinner. The U.S. military has long prided itself on molding raw recruits into hardened soldiers. Perhaps none has undergone a transformation like that of Hamdan. Part of the Faith and War series. By Andrea Elliott.  With photo.  NJ-GAY-MARRIAGE (Dateline TK) -- The New Jersey Legislature on Thursday passed a Democratic proposal to allow same-sex civil unions, a measure gay people have said fails to grant them rights equal to married heterosexual couples. The legislation arose from an October ruling by the New Jersey Supreme Court that gays and lesbians must be afforded the same rights as married heterosexual couples. Gov. Jon Corzine, a Democrat who has declared his support for civil unions, has 45 days to sign the legislation. (Summary from wires.) By Laura Mansnerus.  SD-SENATOR-ILLNESS (Washington) -- Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., was in critical condition on Thursday after surgery to stop bleeding in his brain. The Capitol physician, John Eisold, who examined Johnson before he was sent to the hospital on Wednesday, said that he was found to have bleeding in his brain caused by a congenital arteriovenous malformation, a rare tangling of the blood vessels that physicians say most often goes undetected. Meanwhile, Democrats rushed to declare that Johnson's condition would not imperil the narrow majority they will carry into the new Senate next month. By Kate Zernike.

As a result, he added, especially from the Eastern states and the Midwest, I think we can expect to see reasonable air fares for the next few years into the Caribbean. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz
, they say,	 The answer, for now, they say, is no. But resort employees and skiers in the Northeast tend to be optimists. They say the region's season does not begin in earnest until Christmas, and long-range forecasts are calling for a winter that will be a little cooler and wetter than normal -- good news for skiers, if not shovelers. </P> 	nyt_eng_200612.gz

FEATURES  HKN-GRETZKY-SHADOW (Fairbault, Minn.) -- At 15, Ty Gretzky is far from the budding hockey superstar that his father, Wayne, was at the same age. In only his second season of competitive hockey, he has recorded four goals and six assists in 28 games as a center for the lowest level of the four upper-school boys teams at the Shattuck-St. Mary's School here. Often, he said, he hears taunts from opponents who expect more from a player with a famous last name. I get smack-talked all the time on the ice from other players, Ty, a 10th-grader, said. Just like, 'I thought you were going to be a lot better,' stuff like that. He says he ignores it, but the attention seems unlikely to fade any time soon. By Pat Borzi.  FBN-GIANTS (East Rutherford, N.J.) -- The New York Giants prepare for Sunday's game against the Philadelphia Eagles.

FBN-VIKINGS (Minneapolis) -- The Minnesota Vikings are 6-7, which may not sound like much but considering their difficult 2005 season on and off the field, the fact that they still have an outside shot at the playoffs is an achievement.

NJ-GAY-MARRIAGE (Trenton, N.J.) -- The New Jersey Legislature voted Thursday evening to allow civil unions between same-sex couples, quickly settling an emotionally fraught issue but frustrating advocates on both sides. Gov. Jon S. Corzine said he would give the measure careful review, but added, I think we're doing the right thing. New Jersey would be the third state, after Vermont and Connecticut, to establish civil unions for gay and lesbian couples. Same-sex marriages are allowed only in Massachusetts, which has a residency requirement, though many gays and lesbians have married in Canada. By Laura Mansnerus.
