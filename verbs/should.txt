"92325"	"you"	"should"	" Several tornadoes in southern Michigan caused damage to homes on Tuesday. Contrary to popular belief, there is no scientific basis that opening windows will prevent a house from damage as a tornado passes. As a twister nears, air pressure does decrease as winds increase. But since houses are not airtight, the pressure inside the house quickly adjusts to the outside drop as air escapes through cracks, keeping the house from exploding. Moreover, a person opening windows does nothing more than expose himself to glass shards propelled at speeds as high as 300 mph. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010522.0270 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-TEXBUDGET-TEX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> The Fort Worth Star-Telegram plans to move the following stories for clients of the NYTimes News Service for AMs and PMs of Wednesday, May 23, and thereafter.

During his lifetime, which spanned three centuries, Steiner watched the first automobiles kick up dust on the unpaved roads of Texas and saw the Wright brothers land their airplane on an Austin field.

The jumping-off point for that discussion, which began in the mid-1990s, was whether the museum, founded in 1929, should continue collecting contemporary art into the next century. The consensus, solicited from staff members, trustees and academics, was yes, it should, at least for the foreseeable future. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"119322"	"he"	"should"	" Second, whether the United States strikes first or retaliates, Congressional leaders of both parties should be consulted and listened to before military action is taken. Ideally, the president should ask for a vote of support from Congress. But if time is very short, he should, at a minimum, consult the Senate majority and minority leaders and the speaker and the minority leader of the House of Representatives.
