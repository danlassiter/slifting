Times News Service  TELECOM TRADE TALKS MISS A KEY DEADLINE  Efforts by 53 nations to open their telecommunications markets to international competition nearly collapsed over last-minute American objections.

But broader measures hit records. The prices of Treasury securities fell, dragged down by strong economic data that heightened fears that inflation could accelerate.  MESA SHAREHOLDERS PROTEST  Dissident shareholders of Mesa Inc. have accused the company's board of inflicting what amounts to a nearly $150 million penalty on stockholders in order to sell control to Richard Rainwater.  ROCKWELL TO SELL GOSS UNIT  Rockwell agreed to sell its printing-press business to a group led by Stonington Partners for $600 million, to concentrate on electronics, aerospace and auto parts.  CHINA CUTS INTEREST RATES  China's central bank said it would cut interest rates for the first time since 1993, signaling its substantial success in bringing inflation under control while maintaining robust economic growth.
