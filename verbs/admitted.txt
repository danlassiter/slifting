"3089"	"she"	"admitted"	" But even that job can get a little crazy, she admitted, because the executives and engineers keep seeking newer and more exotic blends.

"13394"	"he"	"admitted"	" Of course, Sanders was back the next day for more. The presence of 2,846 members of the news media has turned on the motor in his mouth and in his car. The day he arrived, he delivered a present to himself -- a Lamborghini -- and he sped by some cameras right away for posterity's sake. That same day, he said he was simply test-driving it, but, by week's end, he admitted, ``It's definitely mine.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"

"20425"	"she"	"admitted"	" For the Dades, who live in Amherst, Mass., having a private chef is a luxury without drawbacks. But, she admitted, ``when it's time to choose menus and I say to myself, `OK, you can have anything in the world you want to eat, so what is it?' -- sometimes it's hard to say.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"21206"	"she"	"admitted"	" Beach often denied that she had ever faced sex-driven prejudice. But when asked, in 1917, to explain the dearth of important female composers, she admitted, ``Music is a superlative expression of life experience, and woman, by the nature of her position, is denied many of the experiences that color the life of man.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"21267"	"he"	"admitted"	" Mandella, you soon realize, is masterful at mixing candor with tongue-in-cheek jest. When his audience had left Wednesday, he admitted, ``Mr. Bacharach knows exactly what's going on here. He calls a lot. He worries every day. He knows how fragile these animals are. Knows they can spoil overnight _ like strawberries.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"21679"	"she"	"admitted"	" Pelchat said that people need a set of instructions for changing their eating habits, not just labeling information. But change is difficult, she admitted, because people often find it easy to ignore what they know. ``People tend to play down the risk, in part because the harmful effects take a while,'' she said. ``If every time you ate a french fry a hairy wart popped up on your face, well, then you'd make the connection.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"

"23289"	"he"	"admitted"	" Notes:The margin of victory was the widest against a Yankees team in Angels history. ... The Angels' projected everyday third baseman, Eduardo Perez, continued to rest his ailing bat and glove (.180, team-high six errors) against right-handed pitching, giving way to Spike Owen, but manager Marcel Lachemann refused to concede that the position has been reduced to platoon status. ``It's a case of going with who I think is best for the ballgame,'' Lachemann said, adding that he likes Owen's clutch-hitting ability. Perez, he admitted, ``has a battle on his hands.'' ... Pitcher Shawn Boskie, who played with three teams last year and caught on with the Angels only by signing a minor-league deal in early March, has been a pleasant surprise. The team is 4-1 in his starts, and he's pitched into the eighth inning three times. ``I've been determined to throw low in the zone this year,'' Boskie said of his success. ``Before, I didn't, but I just got away with it. The problem is, when you don't have good stuff (and you're up in the zone), you're going to get hit hard. Home-run derby.'' ... </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"24542"	"he"	"admitted"	" Mickey Mantle was an alcoholic, he admitted, and he was saying so because he hoped that others would learn from his mistakes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"27914"	"he"	"admitted"	" My father, when he visited, tactfully mentioned disintegrating plaster, stairs so steep they had to be climbed on hands and knees, nasty splintery bulging floors, a foundation apparently dug out with a spoon and a toilet constructed in the old Vermont manner directly opposite the main entrance, and a pervasive odor of decay. My father can fix anything. My house, he admitted, frightened him. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"28024"	"he"	"admitted"	" Any Republican has a soft feeling toward elephants, he admitted, beginning on a light note. ``But as a person I have a particular affection for rhinos,'' he continued, noting he had helped the Atlanta zoo obtain two of the creatures and looked forward to helping them survive well into the future. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"30063"	"he"	"admitted"	" Friedman said that Warners' decision to launch the picture in mid-May was sound; only ``Casper'' was scheduled to compete directly for the family audience until ``Pocahontas'' opened a month later. Still, he admitted, a period piece starring a bunch of little girls in a school is a tough sell any time of year. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"31267"	"she"	"admitted"	" ``I get recognized by kids all the time,'' Ms. Davis said with a bit of a shudder. It was an important credit to have, she admitted, and it was the impetus for her move to New York, ``But I don't want to go to my grave as Hope (`Home Alone') Davis.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"32477"	"he"	"admitted"	" But nothing in Moore's experience, he admitted, has matched the turbulent problems of this part of the New Jersey shoreline, which has been eroded up to its seawalls for a good part of this century. Unlike most of the rest of the state's 120 miles of oceanfront, the underwater slope of beach at this northern end drops suddenly, reaching a 30-foot depth just 1,200 feet from shore. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"

"36245"	"he"	"admitted"	" ``If you want to play it safe, you could have a white garden,'' Lloyd had told us on Oct. 2, showing a few slides of the quintessential one at Sissinghurst. When Rosa Mulliganii bloomed all over the famous pergola in July, he admitted, it was quite a sight _ for three weeks. ``Then you have 49 weeks when it's rather boring,'' he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"36938"	"he"	"admitted"	" But, he admitted, when faced with a concrete proposal from the nation's largest media market, ``it would be very difficult to say no.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"37100"	"he"	"admitted"	" That will mean ``difficult'' budget cuts, he admitted, ``but in the interest of coming generations we cannot afford to abuse the solidarity surcharge as an escape for financial policy.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"39166"	"he"	"admitted"	" Resisting an enormous popular drumbeat for his candidacy, Colin Powell declined Wednesday to compete in the 1996 presidential election because, he admitted, he lacked ``a passion and commitment that, despite my every effort, I do not have for political life.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"
"39902"	"he"	"admitted"	" Yes, Jordan said, but many people, he admitted, do grow weary and give up. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"
"43997"	"she"	"admitted"	" Mrs. Yazykova explained that she and her guests feel nostalgia for the sounds, sights and smells of their youth, not the politics. But the election results in December, she admitted, were troubling. ``I think it is impossible to be a little bit Communist,'' she said uneasily. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
"45101"	"it"	"admitted"	" In 1989, under mounting pressure, the FBI shut down the probe because, it admitted, it lacked the ``intelligence indicating that GUPS, per se, is involved in terrorist acts.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"
"45102"	"it"	"admitted"	" In 1989, under mounting pressure, the FBI shut down the probe because, it admitted, it lacked the ``intelligence indicating that GUPS, per se, is involved in terrorist acts.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"
"45554"	"he"	"admitted"	" Before this stretch, he admitted, ``some guys had dropped their heads a bit.'' As for himself? ``I'm an optimist, you have to understand.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"
"48609"	"he"	"admitted"	" The pensions cut for under-age retirees represents a retreat by unions, he admitted, though he rejected accusations that he had buckled under pressure from employers and the government. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"
"48953"	"he"	"admitted"	" Ridgway, who said he recently rode his bike to El Segundo, where he spent an afternoon watching planes take off from the airport, said he still finds inspiration in L.A., even though, he admitted, ``I hate it sometimes, like everyone else does.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"
"52076"	"she"	"admitted"	" Still, she admitted, the attitude of the police has moderated somewhat over the years. ``Five years ago,'' she said, ``we would have had much more trouble.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"
"54528"	"he"	"admitted"	" If he is fidgety on the mound, he is also fidgety off it. And trying to rehabilitate the injury, he admitted, won't be easy. Still, he feels he has the right attitude. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"
"55154"	"she"	"admitted"	" She probably won't get an answer to that, she admitted, softly. And, she says she's going to have to learn to deal with it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"

"57568"	"he"	"admitted"	" But the movie world, he admitted, is even more of a lottery. ``The most unlikely films take off,'' he said. ``Who would have thought `The Postman' would end up with an Oscar nomination? `Someone Else's America' is an art-house picture, but you never know.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"
"57574"	"he"	"admitted"	" But the movie world, he admitted, is even more of a lottery. ``The most unlikely films take off,'' he said. ``Who would have thought `The Postman' would end up with an Oscar nomination? `Someone Else's America' is an art-house picture, but you never know.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"

"62195"	"he"	"admitted"	" Yes, he admitted, it was a deeply emotional time for all involved. ``In a month,'' Butler said, ``my life's just been turned upside down.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199606.gz"
"62197"	"he"	"admitted"	" Yes, he admitted, it was a deeply emotional time for all involved. ``In a month,'' Butler said, ``my life's just been turned upside down.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199606.gz"
"66658"	"he"	"admitted"	" Ultimately, he admitted, the women will probably force him out, not the other way around. Not by dint of their hands, though. By the children on their backs and at their breasts. As each generation grows up and marries, the compound creeps closer to his quarry _ which uses dynamite to blast its rock loose. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199608.gz"
"66944"	"she"	"admitted"	" There were times, she admitted, when she second-guessed herself on the whole deal. She was reluctant to make the commitment to the national team, to play for $50,000 when $350,000 was awaiting her abroad. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199608.gz"

"67925"	"he"	"admitted"	" Mr. Kerrigan was one of the most prominent page-turners in perhaps the most divisive chapter in Boston's history, and by any standard _ including his own _ a political rogue whose antics were often designed, he admitted, to inflame his opponents. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199608.gz"

"69487"	"he"	"admitted"	" Q. I'm seeking help for a friend, who admits that he painted the fir flooring of his deck with a solid stain. A big mistake, he admitted, then compounded the mistake by pressure-washing the deck and applying a semitransparent stain. It looks terrible, with a lot of blotches and variations in the finish. Now what can he do? </P> "	"nyt_eng_199608.gz"
"72325"	"he"	"admitted"	" Although Bennett predicted Ohio Republicans would eventually rally behind Dole, he admitted, ``We're down right now, about eight points in our own polls.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"

"72428"	"she"	"admitted"	" Alexandra, a new student at BB&AMP;N, had arrived at Bivouac declaring that she'd rather spend her nights in a motel. Even now, she admitted, she wouldn't use the word ``fun'' to describe her experience. ``But I've learned to get to know a person before making judgments,'' she said, pulling on a dry pair of Nikes and socks. ``At school you see certain girls with lots of makeup, with their hair done up, with expensive clothes. Here you see them in their grandfather's work shirt and boots that don't fit. And when you live with them, you find out they're just like you except for the clothes and the makeup. Everyone here looks the same, so you make judgments on personality rather than looks.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"
"73254"	"he"	"admitted"	" ``I was here for the '77 Series when Reggie hit three home runs,'' Brainard said, and with his weathered Yankee cap and faraway looking eyes, he had the nostalgic air of a true fan. ``I grew up on Long Island, in the days of Mantle and Maris and Ford, so I've been a Yankee fan from way back,'' he said, though he does get tired, he admitted, of baseball fans coming up to the band and asking, ``So do you play music?'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"

"76266"	"he"	"admitted"	" This city has a special beauty, he admitted, which is more than he could say about the Meadowlands, which was once considered a real possibility as the site of a new Yankee Stadium. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"
"85285"	"he"	"admitted"	" This must have rankled him, because he always insisted he wrote his three novels merely to pay the rent, an absurd claim to anyone who knows his fiction. But this is only one of many inconsistencies that crease through Dickey's life. He came from a family that had, he admitted, ``no interest in the arts, and none had as little interest as I.'' He never quite got over his youthful anti-intellectualism. Even when he discovered the joys of poetry as an adult (while writing erotic letters to a girlfriend during the war, he claimed), he could never talk about his writing without wearing the camouflage of hard-drinking outdoorsman. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19970127.0199 type=story > <HEADLINE> FOR RELEASE: TUES., JAN. 28 </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-NEWSWEEK-CYBERSCOPE ADV28) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

"89094"	"he"	"admitted"	" ``To ignore the reality of the lifestyle I led for a time _ a long time _ would be a disservice,'' said Sheen.
