But as he pursues the object of his affection, who refuses to speak to him or even to make eye contact, his ardent appeals become badgering. In the film's spectacular final scene, the camera follows him in a long shot as he trails behind his beloved on a course that takes them up and down a mountain slope and across a field until the two of them of almost disappear. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199409.gz"

Bradford holds forth in front of a table full of English linens; handblown glasses; pewter cups, plates and chargers; and pottery bowls. The servants and children bring the food _ fowl from the Pilgrims and deer from the natives _ and curtsy or bow to the head of the table first. As the platters go around, to both costumed Pilgrims and contemporary guests, Mistress Brewster (Lisa Walbridge) pulls off a piece of rabbit with her hand.

All other points, please call your New York Times Syndicate sales representative (see below).  By KITTY KELLEY  The ``voice of the century'' and the undisputed king of American popular song, Frank Sinatra mirrored the moods of a generation and captured the imagination of the generations that followed.  The New York Times Syndicate is proud to offer a five-part excerpt from ``His Way: The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra'' (Bantam), the No. 1 best-seller by Kitty Kelley.  William Safire called ``His Way'' ``the most eye-opening celebrity biography of our time.''  The excerpts offer an uncompromising look at Sinatra's extraordinary life and career _ his music, his mystique, his mob connections, his women, his indefatigable drive to be No. 1 and his uncanny ability to articulate in song the hopes and longings of millions of international fans of all ages.  One or more parts of the series may be purchased _ the cost is not prohibitive. See below for details.  PART ONE: FROM HOBOKEN `BUM' TO BUDDING HEARTTHROB  When amateur teen-age crooner Frank Sinatra pins a photo of Bing Crosby to his Hoboken, N.J., bedroom wall, his strong-willed mother, Dolly, throws a shoe at her son and calls him a bum. But once she sees her son is serious about singing, Dolly pulls political strings to help his career. Sinatra sings in blackface in a series of minstrel-show films with a band called The Three Flashes. Rechristened The Hoboken Four, the group takes to the road, and Sinatra suffers nightly beatings from two of his bandmates, who become jealous when female fans besiege him for autographs. By Kitty Kelley. Excerpted from ``His Way'' (Bantam, 1986). 1,600 words. (slugged: BC-SINATRA-FROM-HOBOKEN-`BUM'-TO-HEARTTHROB-(BOOK EXCERPT/PART 1)-NYTSF)  PART TWO: FRANKIE FEVER SWEEPS THE NATION  ``I knew he was destined to be a great vocalist,'' said trumpeter Harry James about the night he heard singer/waiter Frank Sinatra perform at a New Jersey roadhouse. Sinatra is invited to join James' band. In 1939, his voice is still untrained, but critics begin to notice his distinctive phrasing. Sinatra soon leaves James for the better-known Tommy Dorsey band, then strikes out on his own. Noticing Sinatra's effect on women, press agent George Evans hires a dozen young bobby-soxers and pays them to swoon at Sinatra's shows at New York City's Paramount Theater. Soon, however, the women are swooning for no charge, and Frankie Fever sweeps the nation. By Kitty Kelley. Excerpted from ``His Way'' (Bantam, 1986). 1,700 words. (slugged: BC-SINATRA-FRANKIE-FEVER-(BOOK EXCERPT/PART 2)-NYTSF)  PART THREE: AVA TEACHES FRANK TO SING THE BLUES  In 1946, Frank Sinatra arrives at MGM movie studios already a star in his own right. He immediately tacks a list of the actresses he most desires onto his dressing-room door, but when he sees the sensuous Ava Gardner, he announces, ``I'm going to marry that girl.'' After conducting a clandestine affair, the two wed, and their headline-making brawls become the stuff of Hollywood legend _ especially the night the police are called to referee an imbroglio involving Sinatra, Gardner and Lana Turner. After they divorce, Sinatra pours his soul into a series of unforgettable ``saloon songs.'' ``Ava was the greatest love of his life, and he lost her,'' said composer Nelson Riddle. By Kitty Kelley. Excerpted from ``His Way'' (Bantam, 1986). 1,700 words. (slugged: BC-SINATRA-FRANK'S-TORCH-FOR-AVA-(BOOK EXCERPT/PART 3)-NYTSF)  PART FOUR: FROM RAT PACK TO `JACK PACK'  During the late '50s and early '60s, Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack _ Dean Martin, Peter Lawford, Joey Bishop, Sammy Davis Jr. and ``mascot'' Shirley MacLaine _ are the epitome of cool. They dominate the Las Vegas nightlife scene, and their antics catch the eye of Lawford's brother-in-law, Sen. John F. Kennedy, who joins the revelry. Even after he's elected president, Kennedy's interest in the Rat Pack (now dubbed the ``Jack Pack'') _ and their women _ flourishes. Sinatra introduces Kennedy to Judith Campbell, who conducts simultaneous affairs with Chicago mob boss Sam Giancana and the president of the United States. Because Kennedy's wife, Jackie, does not approve of Sinatra, the singer must visit the White House via the back door. By Kitty Kelley. Excerpted from ``His Way'' (Bantam, 1986). 1,700 words. (slugged: BC-SINATRA-FROM-RAT-PACK-TO-`JACK-PACK'-(BOOK EXCERPT/PART 4)-NYTSF)  PART FIVE: MARRIAGE TO MIA; THE COMEBACK KING  When Frank Sinatra meets slender young TV star Mia Farrow, he is almost 50; she is 19. When they marry, his ex-wife Ava Gardner snipes, ``I always knew Frank would end up in bed with a little boy!'' Over time the couple's lifestyles clash _ he drinks Jack Daniels; she smokes marijuana. He gives her diamonds; she wears wooden love beads. When Sinatra orders Farrow home from the set of ``Rosemary's Baby,'' she refuses, and he files for divorce. In 1971, after a year of dwindling record sales and miserable movie reviews, Sinatra announces his retirement and gives a farewell performance in Los Angeles. ``He'll be back with a whole series of comebacks,'' predicts Sinatra pal Sammy Davis Jr. Davis is right; The Voice continues to tour and record. In 1994, his ``Duets'' lp is a platinum-seller. Ol' Blue Eyes is more popular than ever. By Kitty Kelley. Excerpted from ``His Way'' (Bantam, 1986). 1,700 words.
