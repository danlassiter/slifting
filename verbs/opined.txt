"55990"	"he"	"opined"	" Two days later comes Bert Roughton's column exhorting us all that ``Lowering Expectations Might Be a Good Thing.'' Roughton, a veteran of the Olympic sport of sniping, warned Atlanta's ``sometimes goofy cadre of boosters'' (take that, Atlanta Chamber of Commerce!) of the possibility that we won't live up to the hype and that ``maintaining low expectations'' could be brilliant. In fact, he opined, let the world come to Atlanta expecting the worst and then no one will be disappointed. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"

"109780"	"he"	"opined"	" That denial of an observed connection between Osama bin Laden's suicide bomber and Saddam's spymaster was preceded by a David Ignatius column in The Washington Post last week deriding such reports by me and by James Woolsey, former CIA chief, in The Wall Street Journal. Pooh-poohing the notion of a meeting that ``supposedly took place,'' Ignatius asserted ``there is no solid evidence'' of such a link. On the contrary, he opined, ``hard intelligence to support the Baghdad-bin Laden connection is somewhere between `slim' and `none.''' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
