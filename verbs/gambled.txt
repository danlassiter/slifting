White, the football legend who became one of the longest serving members of the Supreme Court, died Monday in Denver. He was 84. The cause was complications from pneumonia. A national sports hero, Rhodes Scholar, successful lawyer, triumphant political organizer and director of Robert F. Kennedy's Justice Department _ Byron R. White had been all of these before his friend, John F. Kennedy, named him to the Supreme Court in 1962 when he was 44 years old. When he retired in 1993, after 31 years, he was the last veteran of the liberal era of Chief Justice Earl Warren. But despite his status as the court's sole remaining Democrat, he was in many ways more at home in the conservative era of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. By Linda Greenhouse.

It appears to show a legendary figure called the Scorpion King vanquishing enemies about 3,250 B.C.

By John Noble Wilford.  SCI-PRIVATE-NURSES (Undated) _ With understaffing so prevalent in hospitals more and more people in need are turning to private duty nurses to fill a gap in their care.

SCI-STATUE-OF-LIBERTY (New York) _ There are an uncountable number of photographs of the Statue of Liberty, but no drawings that record the depth of each fold in her gown, the width of her eyes, the curve of each finger clasping her tablet.To document the precise shape of the statue's exterior copper skin, the National Park Service has enlisted researchers at Texas Tech University and a high-tech laser instrument.

SCI-SCREECH-OWLS (New York) _ For the first time in more than 50 years, Eastern screech owls have successfully bred in Central Park. By John B. Forbes.  SCI-OBESITY (Undated) _ Underlying the nationwide cries of alarm about obesity are some assumptions about obesity and health that have yet to be supported by facts, some leading researchers say. No one is claiming that it is good to be obese or that fatness does not matter to health. The problem, they say, is that when it comes to obesity, nothing is as straightforward as it might appear.  SCI-BRODY-COLUMN (Undated) _ Personal Health: The nation's children _ indeed, the world's _ are fatter than ever with no end in sight to their increasing girth, and unless something is done now to reverse this trend, the health costs, already very high, will be astronomical in the not-too-distant future. By Jane E. Brody.  SCI-GROWTH-CHARTS (Undated) _ Pediatricians have long complained about inaccuracies of standardized growth charts. Until recently, those most widely used were developed in the 1970s and based on not much more than 10,000 infants and children in Ohio between 1929 and 1975. Because almost all of the children studied were white, middle-class, and formula fed, the charts fail to reflect several differences in growth patterns. For example, healthy breast-fed babies tend to gain weight more slowly than their formula-fed counterparts. Asian children are often smaller than Caucasian children. As a result, a pediatrician might mistakenly conclude that a particular child is not growing or gaining weight adequately when, in fact, he or she is. By Howard Markel.  SCI-SUGAR-ADDICT (Undated) _ Confessions of a sugar addict, who has conquered his addictions and moved on to marathons. By Hubert B. Herring.

By John O'Neil:  _ Men with low sperm counts increased them significantly by taking combinations of zinc and folic acid, a new study conducted in the Netherlands has found.  _ The widespread contamination of well water with arsenic in China and India has been linked to cancer and blackfoot disease, which brings on gangrene in the feet and legs. Now a new study from Taiwan points to another worry: drinking such water for two decades triples the risk of developing obstructions in the arteries. 250 words.  _ The sale of fake or diluted drugs has reached disturbing proportions in the developing world, according to an article in The British Medical Journal.  _ A group that analyzed the paths taken around the race track for the two favorites who came in second in 1998 Olympics found that they had covered more ground than the winners, who stayed closer to the inside of the track on curves.
