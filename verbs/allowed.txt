"12685"	"he"	"allowed"	" Stamphill decided he had the perfect line of defense: He put Alcatraz on trial. Citing the horrifying inhumanity with which Henri had been treated, he put it to the jury that the prison system and its wardens were co-conspirators in the murder. His client was the weapon, he allowed, but Alcatraz and the men who ran it were the true killers. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"

Eating avocados helps neutralize highly destructive fats in foods, while lowering and improving blood cholesterol. They're also rich in blood-vessel protective potassium. Avocado is high-fat, she allowed, ``but much of it is good fat _ monounsaturated, a type that resists oxidation.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"

New power forward: Richard Simmons.  BILL'S WORLD  By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star  This is how real-life royal fairy tales sometimes end: Some day your prince will come _ carrying divorce papers.  Most Americans are ``very much out of shape,'' says Secretary Shalala. It's because, unlike politicians, we aren't always running.  ``This is not a time,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``to nickel and dime our working families.'' Right. The time for that is April 15.  ``The United States is opposed to terrorism as practiced by anybody,'' Mr. Clinton says. But we're naturally more tolerant of errorism.  ``I love campaigning,'' says Hillary Rodham Clinton. Why? It's not billable hours.  Experts now expect Mr. Clinton to win between 300 and 400 of the 538 Electoral College votes in November. Guess that sews it up and means GOP now stands for Get Out of Politics.  ``We know it's not easy to preserve democracy,'' the president says. Heck, says Aunt Ilse from Oelwein, it's hard enough to preserve strawberries.  ``We have to give the future back to all of our children,'' says Mr. Clinton. Unlike us, maybe they can afford it.  Robin Williams may give a speech at the Democratic National Convention. Organizers must want at least one speaker to be their Mr. Surefire.  Before Congress can adjourn, it must enact 13 appropriations bills for 1997. That must be one for each month, plus an adjustment for inflation.  An elderly gentleman we know says nature has a way of compensating. When you're old and spill food, you can't see the spots on your tie as well.  QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S `LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN'  ``Over the weekend Tom Cruise rescued a boy who was being crushed by a crowd going to see `Mission Impossible.' Apparently, he saved the boy by telling the crowd that `Independence Day' was playing next door.''  ``A new study claims that it's the mother's IQ that's passed on to the child, not the father's. Which is really good news for the kids of Maria Shriver and Arnold Schwarzenegger.''  ``Today is O.J. Simpson's birthday. Apparently, at his surprise party everyone hid behind the furniture and wouldn't come out.''  ``Mike Tyson canceled next week's fight against Bruce Seldon because he's not feeling well. As a result, Bruce Seldon says that HE is suddenly feeling much better.''  ``Yesterday, the Senate approved a 90 cent an hour increase in the minimum wage, which is bad news for republicans and really bad news for Kathy Lee Gifford.''  ``McDonald's announced they're coming out with three new adult burgers in an effort to appeal to older customers. Not only that but in their new ads, Ronald McDonald will be getting his prostate checked.''  ``David Hasselhoff said he's changing his new show `Baywatch Nights' into a sci-fi thriller. Apparently, each week viewers will try to figure out which breast the aliens will land on.''  ``A new curfew is being proposed for New York teenagers that would require them to be home by 10 p.m. Apparently, if they're caught out after that they'll lose their guns for a week.''  ``Earlier this week Dr. Kevorkian filed for a permit to carry a concealed weapon. Which is basically just the keys to his van.''  ``Producers of the `Jackson Family Honors' show are suing Michael Jackson because he failed to show up. They're also suing Tito Jackson because he did show up.''  ``Yesterday, Bob Dole said he didn't speak at the NAACP convention last week because he'd rather appear before audiences `he can relate to.' So next week he'll appear at the Museum of Natural History's dinosaur exhibit.''  ``Yesterday, Ross Perot said he hears the American people telling him to run. Apparently, what he doesn't hear is the part where they tell him to hide.''  ``Yesterday, the manufacturers of Kathie Lee's clothing line finally paid back wages to sweatshop workers. Unfortunately, most of the workers blew the money on bubble gum and baseball cards already.''

"69152"	"he"	"allowed"	" But the informality of Otsego County's style of legal practice, he allowed, can be a problem. In the judge's last jury trial, jurors were exasperated: not only were they tired of being repeatedly called for jury duty (the jury pool in a village of 2,300 is rather limited), but this trial, a driving-while-intoxicated case, was stretching into its fourth night. As the prosecutor and the lawyer began to lock horns over an exception to the hearsay law, the judge herded them outside. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199608.gz"

"92662"	"he"	"allowed"	" Taylor in turn praised Brooklyn College. He said it was there that he had learned the importance of engaging in the moral struggles of one's era, although, he allowed, it was a lesson that the college administration of the time had not intended. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
