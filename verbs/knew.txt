"70045"	"she"	"knew"	" A slight, ebullient woman, she tended her beloved garden at dusk and left her father's house only rarely after the age of 29. She fiddled with geometry in her head, loved Milton for his flowers rather than his piety and revered the Bible as much for its literary merit as its holiness. The intelligence was fierce, the sensibility filled with light, and yet for all her genius and innocence, Emily Dickinson could not protect herself from pain, which on the bad days, she knew, ``has no future but itself.'' She courted Death with an adoration as wide as it was mystical, seeing in that pale rider a union only hinted at in the signatures of life. Rejecting the Calvinist frenzy that claimed so many of her classmates, she would not stand as a soldier for Christ, preferring, instead, to be his coy mistress _ a description she would have probably found more allusive than heretical. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"

But I spend the summer in the Hamptons together with all my girls, Hannant said. That phrase, he knew, had a familiar ring, invoking Blass, who famously called his clients gals, and to whom Hannant is sometimes compared. He is definitely filling a territory that Bill Blass had, said Patty Raynes, a daughter of the Hollywood mogul and billionaire Marvin Davis.

IRAQ (Baghdad, Iraq) -- Insurgents determined to destabilize Iraq's new government executed a devastating series of coordinated attacks on Iraqi forces on Friday, detonating 10 car bombs across greater Baghdad that killed at least 30 people, mostly members of the Iraqi security forces, and wounding 99 others. The attacks, a challenge to the Shiite-dominated government that was formed on Thursday, were directed against Iraqi police officers and national guardsmen at their bases and traveling in convoys in northern and southern Baghdad and in Madaen, 15 miles southeast of the capital. The strikes came after a momentous and tumultuous day for the new government. After three months of delays that American officials said gave new strength to the insurgency, the dominant Shiite alliance won approval for a new Cabinet -- but not before angering Sunni political leaders, who said they were shortchanged. By Richard A. Oppel Jr. and Robert F. Worth.  With photos, NYT1-7.  CHINA-TAIWAN (Beijing) -- China's top leader, President Hu Jintao, and the leader of Taiwan's opposition Nationalist Party, Lien Chan, formally ended decades of hostility with a nationally televised handshake on Friday and pledged to work together to undermine Taiwan's independence movement. Hu also offered to lower import duties, open a military dialogue and grant broader diplomatic space to Taiwan, but those measures would take effect only if Taiwan's president, Chen Shui-bian, accepts the terms of their agreement, or if the Nationalists return to power in future elections. During an elaborate ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, televised live in both China and Taiwan, Hu hailed the visit to the mainland by Lien as a historic reconciliation between the Nationalists and the Communists. The two parties fought a civil war that forced the Nationalists to flee to Taiwan in 1949, where they ruled until 2000. They still control its legislature. By Joseph Kahn.  BUSH-ASSESS (Washington) -- In proposing on Thursday night to cut Social Security benefits for future generations of retirees, President Bush made two big bets, one political, one on the substance of his policy, and if he is to succeed in remaking the retirement system, both of them will probably have to break his way. By Richard W. Stevenson.  NASA-SHUTTLE (Washington) -- In what employees and outside experts described as an encouraging sign of its new administrator's insistence on safety, NASA on Friday delayed the first space shuttle flight since the Columbia disaster for the second time, until mid-July, saying it needed more time to ensure that the external fuel tank did not shed dangerous pieces of ice at liftoff. Administrator Michael Griffin, who took over at the space agency last month, announced the delay at a news conference, saying it was a result of intensive reviews of the hazards posed by launching debris. It was chunks of foam from the tank that struck the Columbia during liftoff that doomed the shuttle and its crew of seven on re-entry into earth's atmosphere on Feb. 1, 2003. By John Schwartz and Warren E. Leary.  With a graphic.  KIDNAPPED-BRIDES (Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan) -- When Ainur Tairova realized she was on her way to her wedding, she started choking the driver. Her marriage was intended to be to a man she had met only the day before, and briefly at that. Several of his friends had duped her into getting into a car; they picked up the would-be groom and then headed for his home. Once there, she knew, her chances of leaving before nightfall would be slim, and by daybreak, according to local custom, she would have to submit to be his wife or leave as a tainted woman. I told him I didn't want to date anyone, Tairova, 28, recalled earlier this month. So he decided to kidnap me the next day. Such abductions are common here. More than half of Kyrgyzstan's married women were snatched from the street by their husbands in a custom known as ala kachuu, which translates roughly as grab and run. In its most benign form, it's a kind of elopement, in which a man whisks away a willing girlfriend. But often it is something more violent. By Craig S. Smith.  With a photo.  POLIO-WARM-SPRINGS (Warm Springs, Ga.) -- Like a whale-bone corset or a crank-start Model T, Jeanne Carlock's leg brace is a contraption from another time. Fashioned from steel and hand-cut leather straps, it is nothing like today's lightweight, high-tech orthotic aids. But Carlock, a polio survivor, has worn it for 20 years, and she is not about to trade it in. Instead, she has brought it to the place where it was made, the brace shop at the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation, for a tune-up. Each year, about 100 people come from as far away as Israel and Switzerland to the institute, which began as the country's only refuge for a group who were feared and rejected more than lepers: people with polio. They are the ones for whom Jonas Salk's vaccine came too late. And so they come to Warm Springs, a lush, landscaped campus of historic cottages and buildings in the piney woods 70 miles southwest of Atlanta to the institute founded in 1927 by polio's most famous victim, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
