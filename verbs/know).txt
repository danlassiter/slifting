"3717"	"you"	"know)"	" What the salespeople somehow forget to tell you is that it expires every January -- just about the time the Christmas bills are rolling in -- and it'll cost a cool hundred-and-a-quarter to renew it (inflation, you know), and, just in case you're thinking of canceling out, the Moscowitz people thoughtfully send you a brochure explaining that labor problems at their whipplesprang bolt factory in Piscataway, N.J, have caused the price to escalate at a rate than can only be described as phenomenal. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199408.gz"
"53529"	"you"	"know)"	" And, heaven forbid, if a dog somehow finds himself dead or dying of some unnatural cause (that is, other than eating till he explodes, running into traffic or chewing up your best pair of shoes and, well, you know), he can console himself in his last moments safe in the knowledge that he will be the subject of an outpouring of public grief not seen since Old Yeller bought the farm, figuratively speaking. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"
"77340"	"you"	"know)"	" _ Rush Limbaugh who, considering the source, managed to make a pot-smoking, womanizing, draft-dodging, flip-flopping, big-spending, big-taxing, hog-calling, chicken-plucking, burger-gorging, lying, cheating, stinking (body odor when jogging, you know), hillbilly hick liberal anti-Christ from Arkansas into a sympathetic figure. Quite an accomplishment. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"
"104177"	"we"	"know)"	" ``Wolf'' either rejuvenates the creaky monster movie through annexation or fashions something new from its own stylish audacity. A major hit in France (bad sign, we know), ``Wolf's'' genre-jumbling gusto will split audiences stateside. If you like urbane costume dramas (``Dangerous Liaisons'' to ``Ridicule'') and the violent comic-book hijinks of John Woo and Tsui Hark, ask yourself, ``Do I want to see them fused together?'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"115108"	"I"	"know)"	" A successful basketball team needs balance, a concept that transcends scoring. It is a very easy journalistic hook to craft a story around a team's star player or players (Believe me, I know), and there is no denying that stars who can make crucial plays are very coveted assets. But to do so on a continual basis is a highly simplistic approach to the topic. In the long run, no team succeeds solely on the efforts of a chosen player or two. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"156997"	"I"	"know)"	" Before I get off this icebox (bad pun, I know), I think it's also important to keep the big picture in mind. While teaching kids to be less wasteful when it comes to food certainly needs addressing, I can think of far more serious parenting issues that many of us will deal with at some point -- dating, dieting, drugs and alcohol, etc. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"170649"	"I"	"know)"	" I hope that at 7:30 a.m. I was prepared to put on a reassuring face while at the same time standing up for my wife if she needed me ... but I never had to find out. Things went well, and there are so many people to thank that I can't possibly do it here. I won't bring up names here, either, partially because I didn't catch them all (disgraceful, I know), but more because I didn't actually tell any of them I might write about them later. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
