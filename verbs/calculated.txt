Times News Service  NEW YORK _ Several months ago, John C. Whitehead, a former deputy secretary of state who was named this week to be chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, began thinking how to shrink the United States' debt to the United Nations.  If every American shared equally in the $1.1 billion owed in back dues, he calculated, it would come to $4.40 per person. He promptly sent off a check for $44 to Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali with a note explaining that that was what he and his wife and eight children owed.  ``As an American citizen, I have become more and more embarrassed that my country refuses to pay its dues to the United Nations,'' wrote Whitehead, who is chairman of the United Nations Association of the USA. The staff of the organization included the letter in its monthly bulletin. ``Now every day I hear of a few more people who have done what I did,'' Whitehead said Thursday.  Susan R. Mills, the director of the financial management office at the United Nations, said that because contributions were being sent to various offices, it was impossible to estimate the total collected so far, but that about 35 checks had been received.  In his letter to Whitehead, Peter C. Goldmark Jr., the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, wrote, ``I'm a three-child man myself, so my check to the U.N. is a little lower than yours _ $22 to be exact. But I've sent it off today upon learning of what you did.''  Whitehead knows that these contributions are but a drop in a vast ocean of debt. ``In the end,'' he said, ``it certainly won't amount to $1 billion, but we don't have the right not to pay our dues.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960104.0660 type=story > <HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T TO END ITS ON-LINE SERVICE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-AT&AMP;T-INTERNET-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"
