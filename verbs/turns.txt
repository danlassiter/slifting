"30037"	"he"	"turns"	" And, what about the movie-star-to-budding-rock-star trip, the one River Phoenix once embarked upon with Aleka's Attic and the one Johnny Depp may still be on? Reeves laughs and slaps his right thigh a few times. Then, he turns, fixes you with a gaze, and says, ``I'm giving you the Zen answer on that.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"145560"	"she"	"turns"	" All the mania seems a rather desperate attempt to disguise the fact that Edge of Reason is a little light on plot. Basically, Bridget can't leave well enough alone, messes up her relationship with Darcy, thus paving the way (thankfully) for the brief return of Grant's raffish cad. It's a retread right down to the repetition of specific scenes and comic set pieces. And when Kidron can't recycle, she turns, heavy-handedly, to pop songs, foisting the likes of Let's Get It On upon us for the umpteenth time. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"169720"	"it"	"turns"	" Rees, who is Williamstown's artistic director, and Elice, who more recently co-wrote this year's Tony winner Jersey Boys, concocted Double Double in the fine but neglected tradition of the comedy thriller, something that aficionados feared had died with Nick and Nora Charles. It twists, it turns, it lets you think you've figured it all out, and then it twists again - and it keeps you laughing all the while. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
