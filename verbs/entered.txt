There were some art lovers, however, who were afforded certain privileges: They came, they entered, they saw, they got cultured.  According to the Washington Post, ``courtesy passes'' were issued to visiting dignitaries from abroad, celebrities, major financial donors, corporate sponsors, members of the press, lenders of works of art, colleagues in the community of art museums, and government officials, from the top on down.  The passes enabled attendees to scoot right to the front of the line, which is exactly what Senator Alan Simpson, R-Wy., did the first time he went to see the show. ``Excuse me,'' said the senator to a man he had cut off, who responded with a tart, ``Excuse you, hell.''  This so embarrassed him, Simpson told the Post, that the next time he visited the show, he waited a few minutes and tacked himself to the end of a clump of visitors waiting to be let in at a specific one time. Standing in the average citizens' line didn't seem to be an option. ``I have surfeited and glutted myself with Vermeer,'' said the senator after his second visit, ``and I will go back again.''  CIA Director John Deutch got in early to see the show, but at least he showed some wit when the Post asked about it. ``It's a little known fact,'' he said, ``that art lovers pose a significant threat to national security.''  Neel Lattimore, spokesman for Hillary Clinton, said the Clintons had attended the show before opening time on its first day, so as not to ``cause any delays for the people that were there in line.''  Stan Bernold of Connecticut, who was there in line that day, told the Post that he and his wife had to wait an extra half-hour for the presidential party to clear out.  A spokesman for Senator Howell Heflin, D-Ala., said that getting in ahead of the line was essential for his boss. ``In many cases, a member's or staff member's time is limited, and to have the opportunity to go and see something like this is important.''  The museum record showed, however, that Heflin himself never went. His wife used his pass.  `JEOPARDY' SEARCHES FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN CONTESTANTS  A few months ago, Maya Angelou told David Frost that she wouldn't watch ``Jeopardy'' anymore because she hadn't seen a black contestant in two years.  The charge sent researchers at TV Guide to the tapes. According to a story in the latest issue, on 20 consecutive ``Jeopardy'' broadcasts, there was only one African American contestant, celebrity participant LeVar Burton.  Host Alex Trebek said that racism wasn't the cause. ``It's erroneous to assume that if you don't see blacks in a situation, that's because of discrimination. I don't see anyone accusing the NHL of being racist. Is the NBA prejudiced against whites?''  The producers of the show, however, say they're taking steps to remedy the problem. ``Jeopardy'' is recruiting with ads in minority newspapers, Ebony and the College Language Association Journal, which is circulated at black colleges.  WHO SAID WHAT  ``Nowadays everything the aristocracy does is normal by society's standards _ heroin, cocaine, theft. To find a good old-fashioned naughty boy is very difficult.

HOW TO EAT RIGHT AND WIN THE LOTTERY  The latest issue of the journal Lottoworld, which concerns itself with state lotteries coast to coast, contains an interview with the ``leading mystic'' Athena Starwoman (probably not her real name), on how to let psychic powers speak to you in choosing lottery numbers.  For one thing, you've got to watch what you eat. ``To be really psychic, adopt the attitude that less is more. When it comes to food, that means eating light, not a lot of starchy, heavy, fatty food. When I put on weight, my mind slows down. So I try to stay active and creative. I'd rather be thinking about what I'll do when I win the lottery than thinking about food.  ``Certain foods feed the higher levels of your brain. Fruit, raw vegetables, salad, they're all lucky foods. But not salt, fried food, cake, candy or alcohol.''  In California, proceeds from the lottery are supposed to go to education, which may allow scholars to further research the concept of ``lucky food.''

ATTN) `GREASE,' SCENE I: A WEDDING NEW CHIEF FOR FOUNDATIONS COUNCIL (bl) c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service  Dorothy J. Cain of Freeport, N.Y., yearned to do something special for her son, Airman 1st Class Sean Cain, 20, and his fiancee, Loretta Dixon, 19, who is from Murray, Neb.  When Ms. Cain learned in December that the couple, who live in North Pole, Alaska, would be visiting her this week, she wrote a letter to the director of Airman Cain's favorite show, ``Grease.''  As a result, they will be married on stage at the Eugene O'Neill Theater in Manhattan at Tuesday evening's performance of ``Grease.''  ``I don't know what possessed me to write that letter,'' Ms. Cain said the other day. ``It was as if a light bulb went off in my head.''  In the letter, she wrote: ``Sean has become a wonderful young man serving his country and this would be beyond his wildest dream. I feel that he deserves something very special and I can't do it alone.''  During the pre-curtain show, Joe Piscopo, who plays the disk jockey Vince Fontaine, will introduce Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who will officiate. The show's orchestra will play the wedding march as the bride walks down the aisle and Al Jarreau will sing ``Love Me Tender.''  After the ceremony, the newlyweds will return to their seats, and at the curtain call, the bride will go back on stage to toss her bouquet into the audience.  Then, the cast, crew and the couple's family and friends (including Airman Cain's high school guidance counselor) will attend a reception in 50s, the lounge and bar area adjacent to the theater.  ``We have had about 50 proposals done from the stage of `Grease,' Barry Weissler, producer of the show with his wife, Fran Weissler, said. ``But we've never done a marriage there before. That letter really touched us.''  c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service  Dorothy S. Ridings, 56, the president and publisher of The Bradenton Herald, a Knight-Ridder newspaper in Florida, has been named the president and chief executive of the Council on Foundations.  Ms. Ridings will assume the post next month, succeeding James A. Joseph, the U.S. ambassador to South Africa. The council is an association of more than 1,400 grant-making foundations and corporations.  A trustee of the Ford Foundation, Ms. Ridings is affiliated with several other foundations and was president of the League of Women Voters from 1982 to 1986. She also has had a 35-year career in newspaper and broadcast journalism.  That experience, she said, will help in her new role at the council, whose member organizations have combined assets of more than $115 billion.  ``I believe that philanthropy must become more engaged in telling its own story,'' she said. ``The public needs a greater appreciation for what the philanthropic sector does and how important it is to the democratic government we have.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960211.0068 type=story > <HEADLINE> WHY DO TEACHERS FLUNK BIOLOGY? </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-BRAIN:SCHOOLS-NEWSWEEK-NYTSF) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"
