Both can cause skin cancer and seriously damage the lens and retina of the eyes. Most people also know that you can't get a tan or a sunburn sitting behind a window. But what most people may not know is that neither windows nor shade -- nor even most sunglasses -- fully protect against the sun's harmful rays.

But now, two decades later, it appears that selenium's power may have been overstated. (Illustration by Leif Parsons/The New York Times) ..Only for use with story NYT story entitled SCI-REALLY.
