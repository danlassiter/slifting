And I want Ariel, played by the ravishing Aunjanue Ellis, to be wittier, more a creature of the air. Ariel's task is ``To fly,/To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride/On the curl'd clouds,'' and at the moment Ms. Ellis is too much the fire-breathing pop diva.

Stories are moving in category shown at end of each budget item.  Lifestyle, Entertainment  JOHN-RAITT-2takes _ undated _ If your memory stretches back to the 1940s and 1950s, chances are you know John Raitt as the big-voiced, virile leading man of such stage musicals as ``Carousel'' and ``The Pajama Game.'' Those who are younger probably know him as singer Bonnie Raitt's father. (e)  MINI-REVIEWS-(5takes) _ undated _ These brief reviews of current movies are written, unless otherwise noted, by Cox News Service movie critic Eleanor Ringel. They move weekly to clients of the New York Times News Service. (e)  National  GANGS _ ATLANTA _ The signs are subtle, but widespread: across an overpass on I-85 near the airport, on a wooden fence in Little Five Points, around subdivisions in the north Atlanta suburbs. All over the metro area, graffiti attests to the presence of street gangs. Until a few years ago, police and politicians refused to acknowledge that gangs existed in Atlanta. Now, they admit, gangs are everywhere. (a)  HURRICANES-BOX _ undated _ This year's hurricane season was the most active since 1933. The combined total of tropical storms (winds 39-73 mph) and hurricanes (winds 74 mph or greater) fell just two short of the record. (a)  HURRICANES _ MIAMI _ As the busiest hurricane season in 62 years draws to a close at midnight Thursday, you might expect harried emergency planners and overworked weather forecasters to take long vacations. But many of them already are busy reviewing data, scheduling meetings and tinkering with procedures in hopes of better dealing with the storms that will inevitably pop up on their radar screens when hurricane season rolls around again next June 1. (a)  Business  TURNER-RIBBED _ ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Ted Turner found himself defending the sale of his company Wednesday as he was playfully challenged about it by competitors. ``I keep telling Ted, `You don't have to give up,' '' said Comcast Corp. Presid ent Brian Roberts. ``You don't have to be the biggest to make money.'' (f)  Sports  MOFFETT-COLUMN _ undated _ For Dolphins fans, yesterday's gone, and maybe tomorrow, too. (s)  BISHER-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ Today we turn the page to golf and take up a couple of territorial topics with a cudgel in one hand and a trumpet in the other. Larry Nelson will not be captain of the Ryder Cup team; Bill Roquemore and his clan have been designated national ``Golf Family of the Year.'' Thus, we proceed. (s)  OLY-TRACKHALL _ ATLANTA _ Valerie Brisco-Hooks was just another name in 1984 when the Summer Olympics came to Los Angeles. The two previous seasons, she'd been on maternity leave. By the time the Games left her hometown, Brisco-Hooks had accomplished Michael Johnson's dream for next summer _ picking up gold medals in the 200- and 400-meter dashes, an Olympic first. (s)  OLY-RIOMEET _ ATLANTA _ Swimmers have been flying down to Rio to compete at one of the most exotic sites in the world: a pool on the beach at Copacabana. The field for the second World Short Course Championships through Sunday in Rio de Janeiro, however, does not include the premier U.S. swimmers. (s)  OLY-SWIMMING _ AUBURN, Ala. _ All eyes will be on Jessica Foschi when she steps onto the blocks for the U.S. Open Swimming Championships beginning Thursday. Some people will look upon her with sympathy, others with suspicion. (s)  OLY-ADKINS _ ATLANTA _ His head still turns when he passes the sign on the Downtown Connector, the one counting down the days until the Olympics. He can't help noticing the construction as he makes his way to workouts at Georgia Tech. But Derrick Adkins has rid himself of the anxiety, the nervous pangs. (s)  OLY-PARKING _ ATLANTA _ With parking impossible near Olympic venues, Atlanta organizers have identified more than 55,000 of the 82,000 spectator parking spaces they are trying to secure throughout the metro area. (s)  Commentary  SIBLEY-COLUMN _ ALPHARETTA, Ga. _ Funny book is one reason for good cheer. (k)  For answers or resends, call the Cox News Service at 202-331-0900.

MIDEAST-TALKS (Thurmont, Md.) _ The White House painted a picture Tuesday of little sleep and unwavering intensity inside the gates of Camp David, describing scenes of President Clinton negotiating until dawn with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and then, after a catnap, meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat five hours later. Informally, officials were suggesting that Clinton's artificial deadline of 9 a.m. Wednesday, when he is scheduled to leave for Japan, could be stretched by as much as 21 hours, an element of information that added to a steadily building drama.

Bush's record in Texas, reciting a litany of unflattering statistics while all but equating the state with Outer Mongolia. Not surprisingly, Texans, a prideful lot, have taken offense. The criticism seems to be scratching at deep psychological territory, reinforcing the belief held by many Texans that outsiders still regard the state as a hothouse of violence and ignorance and pickup trucks. By Jim Yardley.  ADOPTED-MONKEY (New York) _ The saga of Cookie Flikshtein has stirred tumultuous feelings on both sides of the fight. To the Flikshtein family and an outraged army of their neighbors, Cookie is a beloved _ albeit simian _ member of the family. She may be a monkey, they admit, but she has adjusted enough to the human condition to spend most evenings eating Rocky Road ice cream and watching the nightly news. The state agrees that Cookie is no ordinary primate, but not because of her human characteristics. She is a Diana monkey, an endangered species. As such, she deserves special care, and the state, after a protracted court battle, has successfully argued that Cookie should be taken from the Flikshtein home and placed in a special animal rescue program at the Detroit Zoo.

By dawn Tuesday, readings had fallen to 69 degrees, tying the record low for the date. During the day Monday, intense heating of the very dry ground around Austin caused blobs of hot air to rise several thousand feet above the surface before warm air aloft (associated with a ridge of high pressure) halted the ascent. In compensation, drier air sank to the ground. With less water vapor near the surface, nighttime temperatures fell to lower levels. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20000718.0245 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-EARLY-FRONTPAGE-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Here are the stories New York Times editors are planning for Page 1, Wednesday, July 19.

BOTTOM  ADOPTED-MONKEY (New York) _ The saga of Cookie Flikshtein has stirred tumultuous feelings on both sides of the fight. To the Flikshtein family and an outraged army of their neighbors, Cookie is a beloved _ albeit simian _ member of the family. She may be a monkey, they admit, but she has adjusted enough to the human condition to spend most evenings eating Rocky Road ice cream and watching the nightly news. The state agrees that Cookie is no ordinary primate, but not because of her human characteristics. She is a Diana monkey, an endangered species. As such, she deserves special care, and the state, after a protracted court battle, has successfully argued that Cookie should be taken from the Flikshtein home and placed in a special animal rescue program at the Detroit Zoo.

There is nothing illegal about the practice, workplace experts say, unless the discharged employees can prove the company misled them.

TUNA-NY (Montauk, N.Y.) _ A few years ago, Japanese buyers lined the docks here and bought all the bluefin they could get: more than 90 percent of the highest-grade tuna was exported. Now, just as American demand has soared, the fish that Americans hardly ever saw is in abundance and showing up in New York area stores and restaurants. By Rick Marin tells us why.  With recipe.  PASTRY-CREAM (Undated) _ In addition to being able to tie a scarf at least 10 different ways and walk with grace in stilt-high heels along treacherous cobblestone streets, my Parisian friends can whip up a patisserie-perfect fruit tart on a moment's notice or sauce a chocolate mousse with a pouring custard so smooth it could make you weep. I can't fathom the hows of their scarf or heel tricks, but their dessert secrets are easy: Ready-made crusts from the supermarche (often the source for mousse, too) and pastry cream and creme anglaise whipped up in minutes a la maison. By Dorie Greenspan.  With recipes.  SIMPLE-COOKING (Undated) _ The column: Seaweed salad. By Mark Bittman.  With recipe.  VERGE-RESTAURANT (New York) _ His luxuriant white hair has thinned a bit, and his step has slowed. But at 71, Roger Verge, the chef and owner of Le Moulin de Mougins near Cannes, still has his matinee idol charm. And now the man who for two decades reigned as one of France's top chefs is in New York to embark on a new chapter in his career. He has postponed retirement for so long that he finally has a role in a Manhattan restaurant. Next week, Medi, a 300-seat restaurant in Rockefeller Plaza owned by Roberto Ruggeri, president of the Bice chain, will open with a number of Roger Verge dishes on the menu. By Florence Fabricant.  MASTER-CHEF (Undated) _ The column: A summer minestrone that can be used many ways. By Tom Colicchio.  With recipe.  KITCHEN-WARES (Undated) _ In the United States, pepper is the only spice we are accustomed to serving freshly ground. In Europe, it is common to find whole spices, salt and spice blends sold in bottles topped with grinding mechanisms. These products, some imported, some American, are now showing up in stores here. By Denise Landis.  WINE-TALK (Undated) _ The column: About the nearest thing to new that I've come across in recent years is a grape _ and the wine made from it _ called carmenere. There are probably a dozen carmeneres available in the United States at the moment. As a stand-alone varietal, or single-grape wine, it doesn't have the richness and balance of good merlot or the power of cabernet sauvignon. But, grown in warm locations and picked when ripe, it can offer softness and lots of fruit. It can be a robust, uncomplicated wine, tailor-made for what Europeans call le gout Americain, the American palate. By Frank J. Prial.  TASTINGS (Undated) _ The column: As with so many fringe winemaking areas in France, Spain and Italy that have sensed the potential profits in improving their wines, Provence is on the upswing. Some wine lovers may be familiar with at least one Provencal appellation, Bandol, which has made full-bodied red wines for ages, but newer promising names are now appearing in the stores.

WASHINGTON NEWS (``w'' category)  ELECTION-REFORM (Washington) _ The 2.8 million member American Legion attacks a recommendation that Veterans Day and Election Day be combined to establish a national holiday for voting. The idea was one of the recommendations proposed by a bipartisan commission to overhaul federal elections in the wake of last year's balloting mess. The Legion says Veterans Day should stand apart to honor GIs. President Bush takes a lukewarm position on the commission report. By STEWART M. POWELL.  CLONING-CONGRESS (Washington) _ Faced with ethical dilemmas posed by the march of science, the House today is expected to ban human cloning. It is also expected to vote on legislation to prohibit the use of cloning techniques to make embryos for medical research. The vote puts Congress in the midst of a raging debate over a critical decision by President Bush _ whether to allow taxpayer financing for medical studies on stem cells extracted from frozen human embryos that would otherwise be discarded by fertility clinics. By JUDY HOLLAND.  HOUSE-ENERGY (Washington) _ As the House braces for a bruising floor debate on a national energy plan, Majority Leader Dick Armey predicts a victory for President Bush on opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil exploration and drilling. But Armey says he does not know how a measure to increase fuel economy standards for SUVs will fare. By LARA JAKES.  RED-LIGHT-CAMERAS (Washington) _ Lawmakers warn that efforts by localities to install cameras at intersections to catch red-light violators pose a threat to individual privacy rights. Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., says the growing practice shows ``the threat of Big Brother is becoming more and more real.'' Republican Majority Leader Dick Armey says the cameras are unconstitutional. But highway safety groups argue that the cameras have reduced traffic deaths. By ERIC ROSENBERG.  COMMENTARY (``k'' category)  MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ The last rites were read for the Reform Party at the shadowy convention held by its remnants this weekend. Once the bright hope of Ross Perot-style reformers, the party is now dead, flat broke and ideologically mangled. The history of third parties is not good, but this disaster was all the doing of conservative Patrick Buchanan, whose weird presidential campaign was a classic example of how not to seek the White House. There is a lesson here for President Bush: Don't swing too far right on the social issues.

While those expectations may have been induced by the Pentagon's own too-rosey, too-soon assessments of the war, they admit, the critics that include politicians, conservative commentator and the media are missing the larger picture.

"101275"	"I"	"admit"	" The houses of Gucci, Armani, Prada, Versace and Dolce &AMP; Gabbana have raised the style ante over the last two decades, so that today's macaronis _ myself, I admit, among them _ would scarcely trade their Gucci loafers for Bass Weejuns or their Armani shirts for ones with button-down collars. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"

"125884"	"I"	"admit"	" The quality of the work, I admit, varies among the shops and the barbers. I've had great shaves _ though none will ever compare with the first _ and I've had poor ones. Still, any occasion I'm not doing the shaving is a happy time. My only complaint is that I haven't yet figured out each shop's etiquette. Some seem to encourage barbers to have their own roster of clients. Others have a first-come-first-served approach. I often find myself torn between the two philosophies, though my impatience usually beats my demand for high-quality. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"

It is a good one, I admit, but hardly up to the quality of the priest, the rabbi and the minister together on a lifeboat. Rather, the winner was chosen by a British outfit called Laughlab, described on its Web site, www.laughlab.co.uk/ as the ``world's largest experiment into the psychology of humour.'' (I, personally, have always been amused by the way the Brits randomly insert the letter ``u'' into words, like ``favourite'' or ``neighbour.'') Laughlab collected more than 40,000 jokes that received almost 2 million ratings since the experiment began in September 2001.

Once I've got my kit down to where it fits in a carry-on bag, with room left over for souvenirs, what's the point of thinning it further? One important lesson I've learned from travel is that a few well-chosen possessions serve me far better than a truckload of haphazardly selected stuff. Once the essentials are covered, everything else is just excess weight, a burden.

The second is, I admit, rather obscure but priceless. (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED.  YOUNG-COLUMN -- WACO, Texas -- In our memories most of us think we can mark the end of innocence _ a single jarring moment that profoundly alters how we look at life. That's not really how we lose our innocence, of course. It wears off gradually, like fuzz on antlers. Still, later in life certain cues return us to moments when we realized that what glitters can break and what breaks cannot always mend.

, they decided,	 In deciding how to fight for Gary Lee Sampson's life, his lawyers took a giant risk. Sampson would take the rare step of admitting his guilt, they decided, and the trial would fast-forward to the single question of whether he deserved to die at the hands of the federal government. </P> 	nyt_eng_200312.gz

, she said,	 DeGeneres, 45, is an expert at getting to the heart of things, in a playful, good-natured way, and since the September premiere of her syndicated talk show, that has made her a hot commodity in daytime television. Many stations haven't seen t1 :46;yDonnell Show,'' which ended last year. Both ratings and market share for ``The Ellen DeGeneres Show'' continue to climb. If there has been any discord in DeGeneres' life recently, it has been the way her two cats reacted to Lucy, her mixed-breed puppy. They were ``not thrilled with having dog energy'' around the house, she said, ``especially puppy energy.'' So she had to fhn` Lucy a new home. </P> 	nyt_eng_200312.gz
, he reported,	 ``She had the skills to do this kind of show,'' Paratore said, naming intelligence and the ability to relate to people as the most important requirements. And just by the way, he reported, ``she's as happy as she's ever been.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200312.gz

, she concedes,	 She doesn't understand why anyone would bother making the bed, since you're just going to get right back in it. But, she concedes, ``if you're gonna wash the sheets, you should take them off the bed.'' Then she adds, ``I learned that the hard way.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200312.gz
, she believes,	 DeGeneres prefers not to analyze the show's success. ``I don't want to dissect it,'' she said. In the age of TiVo, VCRs and DVDs, she believes, if there is a good show on the air, people will find it. ``And there's a large group of thinking people out there who want to be challenged.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200312.gz
, he said,	 Beyond the implied warranty, the fine print on perforated cards generally outlines the terms of a limited warranty. (Full warranties are virtually unknown in the United States, Sheldon said.) Federal law makes it possible for a company to require purchasers to register their products in order to receive the benefits of the limited warranty, he said, but in practice, such demands are rare. </P> 	nyt_eng_200312.gz
, he said,	 Most manufacturers follow practices like those that PalmOne, the hand-held computer maker, observes when customers of unregistered products seek warranty help. Ken Wirt, general manager of PalmOne's hand-held business unit, said the company more or less takes users at their word about when they acquired a palmtop computer. But the serial number indicates when a product was made, he said, and thus provides customer service representatives with a discreet way to check a customer's claim. </P> 	nyt_eng_200312.gz
, he suggests,	 Wills argues that Burr has been wrongly painted as the villain of the 1800 election, working behind the scenes to manipulate the process. Instead, he suggests, Burr was more like Al Gore ``when faced with the Bush team's legal blitzkrieg'' after the 2000 election. The real crime of Burr, Wills says, was that he ``tried to endanger the slave power.'' Pickering, who was quartermaster general of the Continental Army, secretary of war, secretary of state, senator and a congressman, argued forcefully against the ``Negro president,'' and passionately opposed Jefferson's two most important projects _ the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and the Embargo Act of 1807 _ on the ground that they amounted to an extension of the economic power of slave states. More than once Pickering advocated New England's secession from the union. Pickering's crime was the same as Burr#s but his punishment was more severe: His country has forgotten him. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200312.gz"

, he said,	 Brooke, a U.S. citizen who works in Washington, said he moved quickly to seek fresh details from the INC's agents on terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. I say to everybody, and that includes everybody in my intelligence network, now is a real good time for information on those two subjects, Brooke said. He instructed them, he said, to highlight it, put it in red and send it to me right away. Because I'd like to look at all that stuff and see if any of it looks like it's useful. </P> 	nyt_eng_200407.gz
, he said,	 Among the first, and most important, defectors was Adnan Ihsan Saeed al-Haideri, a civil engineer who defected from Iraq in November 2001 and made his way to Syria. There, Zubaidi said, he had a chance encounter with one of Zubaidi's associates in a travel agency, and they struck up a conversation. Saeed had run into legal problems with Iraqi officials, he said, and was eager to move his family to Australia, where his brother lives. </P> 	nyt_eng_200407.gz

, he said,	 A NASA spokesman, Allard Beutel, said the plan was a backup plan to a backup plan to a backup plan, and very much a work in progress.

, he said,	 Critics of the current system are particularly incensed over so-called coupon settlements, in which consumers get coupons of little value while lawyers reap millions of dollars in legal fees. Carper cited a Texas class-action settlement with Blockbuster, the video and DVD rental company, over late fees on movie rentals. In that case, he said, class members received coupons on future movie rentals, while their lawyers received $9.25 million. </P> 	nyt_eng_200407.gz

, he said,	 Mars has no magnetic field of its own, so last fall's CME altered only local Martian magnetic fields on the surface -- if any at all, said Thomas Zurbuchen , a University of Michigan solar physicist. But the cumulative effects of solar storms for the past 3 billion years or more undoubtedly tore away the upper Martian atmosphere, he said, and perhaps even broke down the abundant surface water Mars once possessed and blasted its hydrogen and oxygen as ionized atoms out into space. </P> 	nyt_eng_200407.gz

, they said,	 The therapists say their general approach is similar to that of family counseling; bands' dynamics, they said, are similar to those of marriages (in that they rely on long-term, consensual bonds) and sibling relationships (in that they frequently involve rivalries). And as in family therapy, band members are encouraged to hash out problems as a group rather than submit to individual psychoanalysis. In discussions about their work, these practitioners used an amusing combination of music-industry lingo, Behind the Music type narrative, and pop-psychology terms to describe their methodologies. According to Cox, bands go through several emotional phases. There is the honeymoon period when group members are in love with each other, he said: The music is really happening, they've signed a record deal and they're going up against the world. </P> 	nyt_eng_200407.gz

But, he added, Charles Monfort, the team's chairman, suggested in March that Fox buy a piece of the Rockies. Fox Sports Net needed to keep the Rockies because baseball is crucial summer programming and because it has lost the rights to the NHL's Colorado Avalanche and the NBA's Denver Nuggets, which, like their new cable home, Altitude Sports and Entertainment, are owned by Stan Kroenke. </P> 	nyt_eng_200407.gz

On the Cover  AIRLINES-OUTLOOK (Undated) -- Bob Dylan once warned that as the present now will later be past, the order is rapidly fading. He meant the political establishment four decades ago, of course, but his words also apply to the airline industry today. In a year in which beleaguered carriers hoped they would bounce back into prosperity, as they have so many times before, they are instead confronting the likelihood that the market has changed more fundamentally than at any time since the industry was deregulated in 1978. As a result, even the biggest companies may have to remake themselves radically, quickly and permanently, or face extinction. By Micheline Maynard.  With photo and graphic.  LAW-FIRM-BREAKUP (New York) -- For nearly 40 years, the law firm of Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes &amp; Lerach, as it was known before William S. Lerach and Melvyn I. Weiss unexpectedly parted ways in May, towered like no other over the combative, controversial business of suing corporations and their advisers for fraud. Over the years, the firm's lawyers, ultimately numbering about 225, held an array of publicly traded companies in their sights, winning increasingly large court settlements as a judiciary tried to keep pace with the elusive, complex world of white-collar crime. When the rupture between the two came, it was dramatic. By Timothy L. O'Brien.  MARKET-WATCH (Undated) - Weekly Wall Street commentary: The warnings from technology companies came fast and furious last week, cuffing investors who had bought their shares on hopes of super earnings generated in a hot economy. Individual investors and hedge funds alike had piled into tech stocks and enjoyed the ride through 2003, convinced that 2004 results would justify the shares' soaring prices. But with software companies like Siebel Systems and Veritas Software, hardware companies like Unisys and computer resellers like the CDW Corporation and Ingram Micro Inc. cautioning that their businesses softened in the second quarter, the sound of air escaping a balloon is more than detectable. Inquiring investors want to know: Is this a blip, or is the second-quarter slowdown the beginning of a longer-term malaise in tech? By Gretchen Morgenson.  With graphic.  ECON-COLUMN (Undated) - The weekly Economic View column: We endow our presidents with mythical power, holding them responsible for the health of the economy. But any president's influence over the twists and turns of so complicated a mechanism is less than advertised in the current election campaign. George W. Bush is not to be blamed for the recession that overtook the country two months after his inauguration. Nor is he the author of the upturn that seemed so promising in the spring. By Louis Uchitelle.

That is the sense of wonder at seeing that a new form of technology actually works. Based on previous episodes, the mood will soon give way to jadedness. (The first time I used a digital camera, I was amazed that I could see the pictures immediately after I shot them. Within a few days, I had a list of ways the camera should be improved.) So, in this fleeting upbeat moment, here is a word of appreciation for an advance that already has me wondering how I lived without it. It is known variously as BPL, for broadband over power lines, or as HomePlug. By James Fallows.  ADELPHIA-SALE (Undated) -- The Dealbook: John J. Rigas never wanted to sell Adelphia Communications, the cable giant he built from scratch more than half a century ago. He was heartbroken when Adelphia's new board put the bankrupt company up for sale in late April. But Rigas, who has enough to worry about now that he and his son Timothy have been found guilty of conspiring to loot hundreds of millions of dollars from the company, needn't fret too much about the potential sale. It may not happen -- at least not anytime soon. Blue-chip suitors like Time Warner and Comcast seem eager for Adelphia's 5.3 million subscribers, but the company may simply be going through the motions of setting up an auction to placate creditors.

Features  DRIVE-THRU-OUTSOURCING (Undated) - Pull off I-55 near Cape Girardeau, Mo., and into the drive-through lane of a McDonald's next to the highway and you'll get fast, friendly service, even though the person taking your order is not in the restaurant -- or even in Missouri. The order taker is in a call center in Colorado Springs, more than 900 miles away, connected to the customer and to the workers preparing the food by high-speed data lines. Even some restaurant jobs, it seems, are not immune to outsourcing. By Michael Fitzgerald.  With photo.  BUYING-GAS (Undated) - Leaded or unleaded? It is a question that belongs to simpler times, when a consumer could pull up to the gas station, momentarily forget life's complexities and know the right answer. Buying gas these days, though, has become a complex and emotionally draining experience. By Matt Richtel.

GOLF-VALET (Undated) - RoboKaddy is a remote-controlled golf valet on three wheels. It weighs slightly more than 51 pounds with the battery installed and obeys its master's directional commands, given via a hand-size control pad. On the golf course, it appears as if a ghost is pushing the trolley toward the next shot -- a phantasm able to stop on a dime, thanks to electronic brakes. The RoboKaddy also has a 360-degree turning radius, to better navigate the fringes of irregularly shaped greens. By Brendan Koerner. (650 words)  MUTFUNDS-HEDGEFUNDS (Undated) - Daniel G. Calugar wasn't just the biggest market timer in Alliance Capital mutual funds. He was also the company's biggest hedge fund investor. Calugar, who traded $220 million in and out of Alliance mutual funds from 2001 until the middle of last year, had invested $60 million to Alliance hedge funds. In return, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Alliance executives gave him permission to make rapid trades - at the expense of other mutual fund shareholders. Alliance has reached a settlement with the SEC and state regulators in connection with Calugar's trading, although it did not admit wrongdoing. A lawyer for Calugar declined to comment. Now, federal and state regulators are studying whether such arrangements at mutual fund companies hurt small investors while unfairly enriching the portfolio managers. By Riva D. Atlas.  ABOUT-CARS-MINIVANS (Undated) - Who says the minivan is dying? Despite an image problem, sales of vans remain robust and competition is fierce. John M.

BURCHFIELD, EDITOR OF OXFORD DICTIONARY, DIES AT 81 </HEADLINE> <TEXT> R.W. Burchfield, an internationally renowned lexicographer who wrestled the Victorian behemoth known as the Oxford English Dictionary into the era of wimmin, sexploitation and microwave oven, died on Monday at Abingdon Community Hospital in Abingdon, England. He was 81.  Burchfield, who lived in Sutton Courtenay, in Oxfordshire, had been ill with Parkinson's disease for some time, said his wife, Elizabeth Burchfield.  Chief editor of the Oxford English Dictionaries from 1971 to 1984, Burchfield was best known for overseeing the dictionary's four-volume supplement, an undertaking of nearly 30 years.  He was also known for his unorthodox edition of the grammarian's bible, Fowler's Modern English Usage, which provoked heated, hyperarticulate debate when it appeared in 1996.  Published from 1972 to 1986, the supplement augmented the original OED by more than 60,000 words, including scientific terminology, trademarks and English vocabulary from around the globe. It also added obscenities and racial epithets, a decision that would land Burchfield in court, provoke a threat on his life and illuminate the fundamental nature of the lexicographer's art.  A balding, scholarly man who captivated the public in television and radio appearances and could drive the dictionary's staff with relentless intensity, Burchfield never meant to be a lexicographer.  Robert William Burchfield was born Jan. 27, 1923, in Wanganui, New Zealand. In 1949, after earning an undergraduate degree at Victoria University College in Wellington, he accepted a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford.  There, he read Medieval English literature with C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien. He also met C.T. Onions, who had supervised the OED after the death of its legendary editor, James Murray, in 1915.  Burchfield expected to lead a life of blissful scholarly obscurity. Onions had other plans. After a hiatus of nearly three decades, work on the OED, published between 1884 and 1928, was gearing up again. In 1957, Burchfield was hired to edit the supplement. Nothing could prepare him for the heft of the job.  Oxford University Press, the dictionary's publisher, expected the supplement to comprise a single volume of 1,275 pages and take seven years to complete. Instead, it ran to four volumes, 6,000 pages and 29 years.  I moved with the speed of an electric hare, Burchfield told The Chicago Tribune in 1986.  Nothing could prepare him, either, for the level of public passion his tweedy profession aroused.  When the OED established a telephone hot line for the lexically perplexed, calls flooded in. A sign painter left his post to ask whether accommodation had two m's. A frantic Scrabble player phoned from New Zealand to inquire into the legality of vee. (Vee, the 22nd letter of the alphabet, was in.)  Conceived in 1858, the original OED was every inch a Victorian enterprise. Though its editors had agonized over whether to include terms of scatology, sexual congress and racial opprobrium, delicacy won the day. With the exception of a very few entries late in the alphabet, when the restrictions had begun to ease (a breathtakingly vulgar synonym for kestrel can be found in the Ws), offensive terms were excluded.  It fell to Burchfield to put them in. As it happens, the two key taboo words both start with letters towards the beginning of the alphabet, John Simpson, the OED's current chief editor, explained in a telephone interview. It was a major point of interest to the first volume of the supplement that it did include a full historical coverage of the two words.  Even more troublesome were ethnic terms, like street Arab and Jew down. In the early 1970s, a Jewish businessman sued Oxford University Press, seeking an injunction against publishing the derogatory definition. The suit raised fundamental questions about the lexicographer's job: should the dictionary-maker be a warder, protecting the public from offensive words? Or should he be a watcher, recording language as it is really used?  Burchfield, despite having received a death threat during the trial, argued strenuously for the second position. The British High Court concurred.  The words stayed in, with Burchfield ensuring their pedigrees were carefully documented. Jew as a term of opprobrium, denoting a grasping or extortionate person, is traced in meticulous detail to the early 17th century.  If you look at the entry in the supplement, it's enormous, much larger than most entries, said Jesse Sheidlower, the OED's North American editor. And the reason was, he wanted to make absolutely clear that it was not something that was put in because they were anti-Semitic or because they thought it was funny, but that they had a lot of evidence for it.  After retiring from the dictionary, Burchfield turned his attention to grammar, heavily rewriting Henry Watson Fowler's 1926 classic. Some critics attacked his detached, lexicographer's stance: a grammarian, they argued, was supposed to tell people what to do. (The Guardian, however, wrote recently that Burchfield was positively thrilling on the distinction between 'shall' and 'will.')  Burchfield, whose first marriage ended in divorce, is survived by his second wife, the former Elizabeth Knight; by two daughters and a son from his first marriage; and eight grandchildren. His other books include The English Language (1985) and The Spoken Word (1981).  A lexicographer to the core, Burchfield even marked the passage of time alphabetically. In 1986, his work on the supplement at an end, he told The New York Times: I took particular delight when we arrived at such words as 'yo-yo' and 'yuck.' When we reached 'zilch' and 'zillionaire,' it was like having the finishing tape in sight in a marathon run and we were entering the stadium. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20040709.0155 type=story > <HEADLINE> SOME DEMOCRATS FORESEE AN EDWARDS-CLINTON RIVALRY </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> NEW YORK </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200407.gz

Until 10 days ago all I knew about Tony Hendra was that he had been an editor of the original National Lampoon, played the band manager in This Is Spinal Tap, wrote occasionally about wine and recently published Father Joe, a best-selling memoir of his spiritual salvation through the counsel and friendship of a Benedictine monk.  Then, on Thursday, July 1, on the front page of the Arts section of The New York Times, I learned that Hendra may have committed the most unspeakable of acts. In Daughter Says Father's Confessional Book Didn't Confess His Molestation of Her, by N.R. Kleinfield, he denied Jessica Hendra's accusation that he had sexually abused her when she was a child. But when I asked various Times readers over the next few days whether they had read the piece about Tony Hendra, they didn't say, You mean the one in which he denied that he abused his daughter? Of course: assertions linger; denials evaporate.  Many readers were shocked -- some by Jessica Hendra's accusations, more because The Times published them. Carol Paradis of Brooklyn wrote to say she was astonished that The Times would devote so much coverage, if any at all, to what is a private and obviously harrowing family dispute. A few suggested that even if the editors found the story newsworthy, running it at such great length -- more than 2,500 words -- lent it an air of conclusive judgment, despite Hendra's denials.  (Readers who objected to the subsequent appearance of the Lives column by Tony Hendra that ran in The Times Magazine on July 4 should blame production schedules -- the magazine is printed nine days in advance of the issue date -- and the lack of coordination between the paper's various editorial units. Editors at the magazine did not know that an investigation of Jessica Hendra's charges was under way, and editors involved in the story about the charges did not know that the magazine planned to run an article by Tony Hendra.)  My own objection was, well, I couldn't decide what I thought. Tony Hendra isn't a politician, a teacher, a clergyman or otherwise in a position of authority over others, a conventional standard for public examination of otherwise private matters. But he did write a semi-confessional book about his own moral progress. It had also become a national best seller. Had his success, and the book's theme, made the most intimate details of his life a fair subject for public review? Let me amend that: not just intimate details, but unprovable allegations about despicable details?  According to culture editor Jonathan Landman, when editors learned of Jessica Hendra's charges, we could have suppressed the whole thing in the name of taste or principle.  Or we could check the facts as thoroughly as possible, he said, and then make a morally complex decision based on those facts. That's what we did. The subject of Hendra's book and its success, Landman told me in an e-mail message, were central to the newsworthiness of the daughter's accusation.  From my reconstruction of how this story made its way into print, I think The Times did it pretty much by the book. The paper did not begin by sifting through Tony Hendra's life, trying to find something that might taint the aura of virtue surrounding Father Joe. Around June 20, after her father's book had already spent three weeks on the best-seller list, Jessica Hendra sent The Times' Op-Ed page an unsolicited essay containing her allegations. The page's editor, David Shipley, forwarded it to the newsroom with her permission, and soon Kleinfield was assigned the story.  This, too, was the right decision. Kleinfield is one of the paper's most capable reporters, a pro with more than three decades of experience. He spent a week on the story, and while it may appear that he called Tony Hendra for his response rather late in the process, the article was not scheduled until after their last conversation. This wasn't an ambush interview -- that deplorable tactic used by reporters who call the subject an hour before deadline and demand immediate responses to complex, often hostile questions.  Kleinfield says he first called Hendra the morning of June 29 and finally reached him late that afternoon. They spoke three times that day, the last time late that evening, and again on June 30. (I have not crosschecked this account with Hendra, with whom I have not communicated at all, but I've no reason to doubt its accuracy.)  Kleinfield also asked for the names of people Hendra would like him to speak with, presumably to support his denials. In an extensive e-mail message he sent me explaining the process of his investigation and his analysis of what he learned, Kleinfield made a crucially important statement. Based on his reporting, he wrote, I concluded that she was molested.  Journalists often erect evasive defenses to justify publishing unprovable material; they say it's plausible, or worth airing or apparently credible. Kleinfield may be wrong about Hendra, but his willingness to stand behind the story's dark implications is honest, and it's meaningful. This is not to suggest that the article was perfect. I wish it had included on-the-record testimony from people Kleinfield had not been directed to by the two Hendras. The vivid detailing of alleged sexual acts was unnecessary in some of its stomach-turning specifics. (The length, I believe, was appropriate: Anything much shorter would have turned a complex situation into base gossip.)  But those issues bear discussion in another context. I'm trying to answer a different question: If I were an editor at The Times, would I have published an article containing grave allegations, buttressed by thorough reporting by one of my top people, about a man who had become a public figure specifically because of his assertions of moral growth?  I probably would have.  But I'm not a Times editor, and I don't know if it serves the paper or its readers if I try to think like one. This column should represent the views of readers, give them a fair airing and assess the validity of their criticisms. What did the Hendra article accomplish for readers, and at what potential cost?  I talked with a dozen or so Times editors and writers not involved in the article, and not one of them found the piece inappropriate. But I think it's noteworthy that among the readers who did object were several former newspaper journalists who could examine the newsroom ethos from a distance. In 40-plus years of reading The Times I have not come across so scurrilous a piece, wrote Tom Zito, formerly of The Washington Post. What possible purpose was served by running it, other than to perhaps make its subject consider suicide?  Carey Winfrey, himself a former Times reporter, recalled a comment made to him years ago by A.M. Rosenthal, at the time the paper's top editor. The most important lesson Rosenthal had learned from one of his predecessors was Just because you have the power doesn't mean you have to use it.  This might have been one of those cases. Was the piece published because Hendra had had the good fortune of seeing a book originally issued in a printing of 15,000 copies (according to his publisher) become a national phenomenon? Because book buyers should be warned that Father Joe may be disingenuous at the least, and perhaps dishonest? Or because of the public's broad right to know?  Plausible reasons, each of them. But what if the charge is false? And even if the preponderant evidence indicates it's true, doesn't the small chance that it's false outweigh the value of giving readers access to the private miseries of the Hendra family? Either way, Tony Hendra will bear the scars of this article forever. People who did not write a book claiming spiritual salvation will suffer as well: his three young children from his second marriage, for instance. In the face of this risk, what do readers of The Times (or of Father Joe) gain by believing Hendra guilty of abuse? There's a difference between the right to know and the need to know, and in this case, the need escapes me.  I don't mean in any way to diminish the gravity of Jessica Hendra's charges; I can't imagine an accusation more serious, a transgression more detestable. If her story is true, Tony Hendra deserves punishment far greater than humiliation in the pages of The Times. As an editor, the verities of the profession might have led me to publish this article. But as a reader, I wish The Times hadn't.  - In my June 27 column, I described Nigel Hamilton's Bill Clinton: An American Journey as a full-frontal attack. This characterization came from my reliance on a review by critic Michiko Kakutani. She may be right, but given that I've never read the book, it was stupid of me to characterize it with such glib surety. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20040710.0053 type=story > <HEADLINE> WEATHER </HEADLINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200407.gz
