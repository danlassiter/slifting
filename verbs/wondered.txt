First, cancer risk is linked to metabolic rate: the faster the rate at which the body burns fuel, the greater the likelihood of developing cancer. Rats, for example, have a metabolic rate eight times as fast as humans. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199407.gz"
"1371"	"she"	"wondered"	" Monday night is given to what Ron Silver, the somewhat breathless narrator, calls the golden age of the mob, from Prohibition to Las Vegas, Nev. A sometime friend of Bugsy Siegel (the hero of Warren Beatty's movie, ``Bugsy'' and lately exhumed again in John Gregory Dunne's zesty new novel, ``Playland'') says that when she first saw the Nevada desert, she wondered, ``Why would they come to a place like this?'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199407.gz"

"17783"	"he"	"wondered"	" But that was not the way his mind worked. Needham found it impossible to take up just part of an issue and stop there, and soon he found himself casting his question in a different way: How, he wondered, had the West lagged so drastically in developing Chinese scientific advances like printing, gunpowder, pest control, and the magnetic compass?

Entertainment/Lifestyle  MINI-REVIEWS _ The weekly brief reviews of current movies are written by Cox News Service movie critic Eleanor Ringel. (Five takes).  National  TEXAS-DIVORCE _ AUSTIN, Texas _ In Texas, venue for 97,571 divorces last year, the rules of disengagement change Friday. State lawmakers this year approved changes in child custody laws, including new provisions aimed at keeping both ex-spouses involved with their kids and making it easier to change custody arrangements after the divorce. And, in a move aligning Texas with the rest of the union, alimony _ albeit a limited version _ enters the divorce equation. The changes raise as many questions as they answer. Will the threat of alimony, however limited, be a new bargaining chip in property settlements? Are the custody changes cosmetic or far-reaching? (Herman).  CREMATORIUM _ DELRAY BEACH, Fla. _ Joe Damiano wants to open a crematorium here that's a little more elegant than the one he runs in nearby Lantana, somewhere families can view the incineration of their dearly departed in dignity. But the man known as South Florida's body removal czar is in purgatory as far as state environmental officials are concerned: They've sued Damiano over how he ran a similar crematorium on Florida's west coast. In a series of 1993 inspections, officials found that the incinerators in Damiano's Palmetto crematorium spewed smoke and ``objectionable odors'' because they didn't burn at a high enough temperature. (Feder).  VA-DEATHS _ GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Her husband, Ronald Franklin, a 56-year-old retired school custodian and veteran of the Korean War, had been wheeled into surgery around 10 a.m. and Florence had settled in to wait. She didn't think it would be long. She said doctors told her Ronald would be out of surgery around noon. And she wasn't too worried. Ronald's doctors had told the Franklins that the surgery to remove a cancerous section of his colon was routine and not risky. As Florence waited and occasionally paced outside with a cigarette, the noon hour passed. Florence became anxious. Another hour ticked slowly by. Florence became alarmed. She made regular trips to the nurses' station to ask how her husband was doing, where he was, and when she could see him. ``They didn't tell me anything,'' Florence said. (Lofholm, Four Takes ).  Business  CAT-COLUMN _ Tips for setting up a business on the Internet. (Komando).  TECHNOBUDDY _ ATLANTA _ Kicking your car when it won't start is intuitive. But all it does is mess up your toes. Trying to be intuitive with computers works just as poorly _ except they mess up your mind instead of your toes. I thought a mouse was intuitive until I watched a friend use one for the first time. He held it straight out from his body and pointed it at the computer. Then he clicked. Rolling it on the table never occurred to him. I tell you all this to put the ``intuitive'' ease of Windows 95 into perspective. The program is intuitive compared to Windows 3.1, which it replaces. But compared to scratching your nose, it's not intuitive at all. (Husted).  Commentary  YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Do you remember Brazil '66? Ah, yes. Sergio Mendez' cutting-edge musical combo was very hip, very cool. Then 1967 rolled around. Brazil '66 suddenly was very out-of-date. Brazil '66 was cursed by a name it had to keep changing. I thought of Brazil '66 as Windows 95 made its grand entrance into a world that barely had breath to bate, so busy had it been talking up the advent of a new software messiah. When 1996 rolls around in four swift months, Windows 95 already will be ancient _ caveman etchings, a geezer to new-breed geeks. Surely Windows 96 is headed down the pipe. Windows 95.5? Whatever, when it happens we'll all wonder what the past few days' fuss was about. (Young).  LEIBOWITZ-COLUMN _ They're a couple of desperados, these two, real Wild West types. You'll be glad to hear that Arizona authorities are hot on the case. Honestly, I can't decide which one's scarier: the 77-year-old blind well-driller with the high blood pressure, or his pal, the 76-year-old real estate agent with a bad case of the shakes. And to think that Charles ``Loft'' Hollamon and Jack Bird nearly brought the election process in Arizona and America to its knees, plus had a state appeals court judge risk entry to the Oxymoron Hall of Fame by penning the words _ I kid you not _ ``maintaining the integrity of public elections.'' (Leibowitz).  MCLEESE-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Bruce Todd's announcement that he will not seek re-election in 1997 gives prospective candidates an extended stretch to jockey for position. Predictably, speculation has centered on the usual suspects: City Council members, past and present, and (only in Austin) the contentious political analyst for a free weekly. (McLeese).  SIMPSON _ ATLANTA _ ``Will the justice system survive?'' The question from a white colleague referred to the O.J. Simpson trial. The implication was that Simpson's attorneys were using what prosecutor Marcia Clark called ``the race card'' to get Simpson off. I knew my colleague meant well. A decent person, she was appalled, as many of us are, at the ugly spectacle the Simpson trial has become. Still, her question got me to thinking. Why, I wondered, did no one ask, ``Will the justice system survive?'' after an all-white jury set free the white policemen who savagely beat Rodney King? (Conley).  SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ My morning coffee cronies are chuckling in their decaf because school starts up tomorrow and I have to go back to work and they don't. ``If you was to retire with those big bucks teachers get,'' Amos says just like he knows what he's talking about, ``then you could hang around here with us every morning.'' ``If I retired now,'' I remind him since I've been teaching only four years, ``I'd starve. You gonna' feed me?'' This fires up yet another discussion of the outrageously large amounts of money that teachers have forced on them every other Friday. ``Why, if I had your money,'' Cal observes with a wink to his captive audience, ``I'd retire and cruise the Mediterranean.''

I was taught to view total self-sufficiency as a position of strength, although sometimes, when I saw people rallying to help a friend in trouble, I wondered, with a certain wistfulness, whether anyone would ever come to my aid if I needed assistance. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"

"100545"	"he"	"wondered"	" His study ultimately left him with a gnawing feeling of isolation as an Israeli. A leader in the effort to integrate Ethiopian Jews into Israeli society, Odenheimer is a proud leftist who lectures about the connection of Judaism to social justice. That is why the most painful realization for him has been a growing sense that many fellow leftists outside Israel also harbored anti-Semitism. Why else, he wondered, would they focus so obsessively on Israeli injustices, rather than injustice elsewhere, like the oppression of women and minorities in Arab nations? Why were they so sensitive to the imbalance of power between Israel and Palestinians, and so cavalier about the danger from Israel's neighbors? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"

"104531"	"I"	"wondered"	" Was it an aberration, I wondered, or a sign that even the farthest reaches of the dining universe are feeling the effects of a chef-driven culture? It's one thing to see airports with Wolfgang Puck and Todd English cafes, and baseball stadiums contracting with chefs like Dean Fearing of the Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas to sell more than just hot dogs.

SCI-FLA-MANATEES (St. Petersburg, Fla.) _ Manatee deaths in Florida are higher than ever before. Some say too many boats; others argue too many manatees. But the debate is about more than the manatee, the slow-moving weed-munching underwater mammal that has long been a Florida icon. Manatees have become a flash point in the battle over balancing the needs of the state's subtropical wildlife and the rights of its legions of boaters and shorefront property owners. By Andrew C.

And the facets of fitness are independent, so those who inherit an ability to gain muscle strength may not be able to grow large muscles and those who can easily increase their ability to do aerobic exercise may be thwarted on the weight room floor. By Gina Kolata. (1625 words)  SCI-SPORTS-INJURY (Undated) _ Injured athletes have dozens of options when it comes to treatment. But the bottom line is there's little solid evidence of what works and what doesn't. ``Any time you have multiple different treatment strategies, it tells you that any kind of scientific evidence is really lacking,'' said Dr. Gordon O.

When the author was in medical school, she discovered to her chagrin that all medical care was based on what was normal for a 165-pound man, and that heart disease in women was ``vastly underdiagnosed and poorly treated.''

NYT News Service  INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  SAUDI-RELIGION (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia) _ In his war on terror, President Bush has called Islam a great religion and described the American people as both religious and tolerant. Speaking before Congress, he said that the ``barbarians'' who committed the heinous acts against the United States ``hate our freedoms, our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other.'' But neither Bush nor any of his security advisers have criticized the refusal of Saudi Arabia to allow Americans to worship freely. In this royal theocracy, Islam is the only official religion and all citizens must be Muslims. Non-Muslim worshipers who engage in overt religious activity that attracts official attention risk arrest and deportation. By Elaine Sciolino. 1,200 words.  RUSSIA-BOMBS (Ryazan, Russia) _ Boris A. Berezovsky, the Russian oligarch and onetime Kremlin adviser who is engaged in a bitter political struggle against Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, has said that by the end of this month he will produce a documentary film that proves that Russia's Federal Security Service was involved in bombs blasts at apartment buildings in September 1999 that killed some 300 people.

These buildings are no ordinary structures. Taken together, the 20 or so buildings that remain closed hold more than 10 million square feet of space. What has become clear to city and state officials is the central role that reopening these damaged buildings will play in the revival of downtown. But deciding the future of the buildings is not simple, for both economic and emotional reasons. By Eric Lipton and James Glanz.

Some say too many boats; others argue too many manatees. But the debate is about more than the manatee, the slow-moving weed-munching underwater mammal that has long been a Florida icon. Manatees have become a flash point in the battle over balancing the needs of the state's subtropical wildlife and the rights of its legions of boaters and shorefront property owners. By Andrew C.

But the dollar figures do not reflect the ecological, social and health costs, wildlife experts said.

And the facets of fitness are independent, so those who inherit an ability to gain muscle strength may not be able to grow large muscles and those who can easily increase their ability to do aerobic exercise may be thwarted on the weight room floor. By Gina Kolata. (1625 words)  SCI-SPORTS-INJURY (Undated) _ Injured athletes have dozens of options when it comes to treatment. But the bottom line is there's little solid evidence of what works and what doesn't. ``Any time you have multiple different treatment strategies, it tells you that any kind of scientific evidence is really lacking,'' said Dr. Gordon O.

When the author was in medical school, she discovered to her chagrin that all medical care was based on what was normal for a 165-pound man, and that heart disease in women was ``vastly underdiagnosed and poorly treated.'' In the last five years, the situation has started to change, but word about women's heart risk has not really begun to spread. Reviewed by John Langone.

"107326"	"he"	"wondered"	" Back at Harvard, Zaltman continued to think about images. Why, he wondered, did marketing experts tend to work with words and numbers when companies did most of their marketing through pictures? ``I was aware of this mismatch between the way information is delivered and the way in which people had to react to that information,'' Zaltman said. ``What if we presented data in the form that consumers actually experienced them? Words, but also visual metaphors.'' He began reading about neuroscience and synthesizing the ideas that became ZMET.

At his restaurant in the Flatiron district of Manhattan, Gramercy Tavern, a designer sconce was ripped from the wall in the men's room during the dinner service. Meyer didn't bother replacing it. Still, he wondered, ``How do you possibly add value, for the customer, to the experience of going into the bathroom?'' So, he burns $30 ginger and grapefruit candles by Jo Malone.

Is there really that much of a difference, I wondered, between a university that pours Pepsi and wears Nike and a stock car racing team that pumps Bud Lite and wears Drakkar Noir cologne? Is it April foolish to worry about the comparative graduation rates of the Indiana and Maryland basketball teams when I never asked Jeff Gordon if he was graduated from high school?

"122605"	"we"	"wondered"	" What's going on, we wondered, all old enough to remember being shocked and titillated by the 1983 movie ``Class,'' in which Jacqueline Bisset, the mother of a college boy, beds his teen-age best friend. Amusing to watch but how often does that kind of coupling occur in real life? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"

He didn't want to, of course, but there was no one else on duty. And so with abashed resignation he dug it.

There's the dimension I knew best _ a center for hiking, climbing, skiing and fishing _ and the dimension I'd come to explore: the vortex of New Age spiritual energy, the home of mystics, healers, psychics, shamans, chanters, metaphysicists, drum beaters and UFO watchers.

"128392"	"he"	"wondered"	" FINLAND-BOMB (Helsinki, Finland) _ Several days before he is said to have planted a deadly bomb in a mall crammed with early evening shoppers, the young chemistry student posted a message on a Finnish Internet website devoted to bombs and explosives. Had any of the site's other regular visitors, he wondered, ever run into trouble because of their interest in bombs? The site's moderator, who used the screen name Einstein, replied that he had never run afoul of the law. But Einstein has been arrested on charges that he committed ``aggravated sabotage'' by providing the bomber with instructions on how to build the bomb. By Sarah Lyall. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"

"136847"	"he"	"wondered"	" Could these men, he wondered, have fabricated the form? They were wearing plastic identification cards, but those cards did not look official to him. ``I could only think, `What's going on here, a scam?''' he said. ``These gentlemen could have had one too many beers and come up with the idea of preying on unwitting motorists.''

"137029"	"I"	"wondered"	" This version is more fun _ and significant _ because it confirms a lot of our notions about what it means to be male or female. At least we think it does. When some of the more macho men showed up at the first immunity challenge foolishly clutching their machetes (paging Dr. Freud!) or when food issues got the first woman ousted by her tribe (paging Oprah!), I wondered, is it nature or nurture?

"137537"	"he"	"wondered"	" Martin Hanley, an actor and runner, realized this more than 20 years ago while struggling with ``Finnegans Wake.''

As Norman Feaster saw it, the earlier, unreported fatalities in Decherd raised a crucial question, especially with CSX offering $25,000 up front to be absolved of all blame.

"142305"	"they"	"wondered"	" And then, over time, it evolved into something more abstract and philosophical, an exploration of faith and spirit with even a touch of whimsy.

Lichtman said the president, whom she did not support in 2000, had done a poor job on the environment, as Kerry had charged. But, she wondered, was Kerry proposing a form of government-controlled medicine, as the president has claimed? The war started by Bush breaks her heart, Lichtman said, but would Kerry swing too far in the other direction? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"

"147515"	"he"	"wondered"	" He was less successful when the debate over the scarith spread beyond the polite confines of Tuscany, and the finest textual scholars in Europe began picking apart Prospero's Latin. The leader of the wolf pack was Leone Allacci, a Greek librarian at the Vatican, who reveled in the bare-knuckle debating style popular in Rome. A new Augean stable, full of foul odors and outrage, he wrote, can scarcely slow my angry charge against ridiculous fables and pure trifles. Warming to his task, Allacci homed in on the Latin anachronisms in the texts and the plebeian quality of the writing. Why, he wondered, did Prospero break off his narrative by saying he had run out of paper, when many of the texts were wrapped in paper with no writing on it? Who is going to believe that paper is what runs out during a siege? he asked. He dismissed Prospero as this fogmaker from Fiesole and this Balaam's ass. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"148141"	"she"	"wondered"	" The center's Program in Course Redesign began when the Pew Charitable Trusts approached Twigg about rethinking higher education.

But the audience was largely made up of the middle-aged and the elderly. Maybe the presenters have to do better outreach to get the attention of the student set. Or maybe young people just like to complain. Whatever the case, there are four more free Sunday afternoon recitals through June 26.

After dinner, Gordon piled us back into the van, drove past the deserted airport and kept going for five or six miles on a rutted dirt track that ended at an abandoned cabin. A small round pond brimmed in the tundra's palm. The tops of two calderas -- remnants of the island's volcanic origin -- disappeared into the brightening cloud deck.

FOREIGN  With story BC-SYRIA-KURDS-NYT  As Syria endures unprecedented international and domestic pressure to change, storm clouds are gathering there once again. In the predominantly Kurdish city on Syria's border with Turkey, Qamishli, a growing movement of Kurds is demanding recognition and representation in Syria's government.  Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman to serve on the United States Supreme Court, announced Friday that she is resigning, setting off what is expected to be a tumultuous fight over confirming her successor.  Poll data on race relations since the first Howard Beach incident.  FINANCIAL  With story BC-BOA-COMPARE-NYT  Seeking to grab a bigger share of consumers' business by becoming a powerhouse in credit cards, the Bank of America Corporation announced plans Thursday to acquire the card giant MBNA for $35 billion in cash and stock.  We plan BOA--Vs Citigroup -- size to be determined  Bank of America and Citigroup - assets, stock price after one year, market share.  As real estate sales have taken off, so have the number of people looking for work in the industry. Here are some states with the biggest increases in real estate sales agents with active licenses.  In the end, the jury deciding the fate of HealthSouth's former chief executive, Richard M. Scrushy, focused on one issue: credibility. But it was not Scrushy's credibility they were concerned about - he did not testify in his own defense. Instead, they wondered, could they believe the five former company executives who testified against him?  Drug companies do a lousy job of finding new medicines. They rely too much on billion-dollar blockbuster drugs that are both overmarketed and overprescribed. And they have been too slow to disclose side effects of popular medicines.  Living standards almost never go backward, at least not in a material sense. The economy today is growing, consumer spending is plentiful and new technologies - from the Internet to laparoscopic surgery - make life better than ever, as they do in every generation.  It is hard to argue with the notion that investors often price some stocks too high and others too low. But if new research is correct, this seemingly banal truth may also explain a long-running mystery: why small-capitalization value stocks tend to beat large-cap growth stocks.  We moved INVEST--Lg and Sm cap -- 30p9 x 3 1/2  Growth of $10,000 invested in 1926 in small-cap value stocks vs. large-cap growth stocks  With story BC-INVEST-TIMING-NYT  Whether professional investors place much faith in timing the market is closely aligned with how they earn a living. Fund managers, who are paid to pick stocks, tend to put little store in timing, while market strategists and editors of advisory newsletters are more likely to adhere to it.  We moved INVEST--Worst days -- 30p6 x 3 3/4  S&amp;P returns with and without its ten worst days over 15, 10, 5, 3 and 1 years.  With story BC-PODCASTS-NYT  Who will keep our ears well filled with portable entertainment while we move about?

Eventually, a human voice comes on, using the same robotic tones of automated sorrow that I'd gotten from the machine.

FOREIGN  With story BC-MONTENEGRO-NYT  In a referendum on May 21, Montenegrins will decide whether to retain their ties with Serbia, or go their own way and declare independence. The two are the only remaining components of Yugoslavia. This city, which offers reasonably priced holidays on an increasingly expensive Adriatic coast, appears split down the middle, like much of Montenegro.  With all the talk of yet-to-be-filled promises on and around ground zero, it is sometimes easy to overlook St. Nicholas, structurally the smallest victim of 9/11, crushed by the collapse of 2 World Trade Center. But its own journey through the redevelopment wilderness has been no less protracted than better-known projects.  Low cost carriers like Southwest Airlines, JetBlue Airways and AirTran dog the steps of all the big traditional airlines, bringing down fares and profits nationwide. But AirTran, less well known outside the Southeast, has been remarkably successful in recent years eating away at Delta's dominance in its home base of Atlanta, and that could limit Delta's ability to quickly recover post-bankruptcy.  Off the charts: The cost of the metal in a penny has climbed to almost one cent. Add in the cost of transporting the pennies we estimate producing a penny now costs the government more than 1.4 cents.  Almost on a lark, Chris DeWolfe bought the Internet address MySpace.com in 2002, figuring that it might be useful someday. DeWolfe noticed the popularity of Friendster, a rapidly growing Web site that let people communicate with their friends and meet the friends of their friends.

PFIZER-PAY (Undated) -- If outsized executive pay has indeed become a source of outrage to American shareholders, then the contest next week between Pfizer Inc.'s investors and its board could prove the most compelling of the year.

ECON-COLUMN (Undated) -- The weekly Economic View column: Considering the nation's muddled campaign finance system, it's hardly a surprise that voters have taken a shine to a few wealthy entrepreneurs. There is an abiding American respect for people who build and manage big businesses, and rich politicians can also claim to avoid conflicts of interest by financing their own campaigns. But does experience back them up? The question is worth considering, said Amitai Etzioni, a professor at George Washington University, given the millions of dollars that candidates raise, even for relatively minor congressional races. By Daniel Altman.  Feature  RESUME-SPIN (Undated) -- Lying on a resume to enhance a mediocre educational or employment record is hardly new.

FOREIGN  With story BC-IRAQ-NYT  Shiite leaders selected Jawad al-Maliki, a hard-line and outspoken Shiite leader, to replace the outgoing prime minister, Ibrahim al-Jaafari.

"165857"	"he"	"wondered"	" Very quickly, however, DeWolfe's tactics for MySpace changed. He had noticed the popularity of Friendster, a rapidly growing Web site that let people communicate with their friends and meet the friends of their friends. What would happen, he wondered, if he combined this type of social networking with the sort of personal expression enabled by other sites for creating Web pages or online journals? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"167420"	"he"	"wondered"	" I like what they're trying to do here, Harris said of the BioTown idea. From a business standpoint, though, it's a little shaky. What if he paid hundreds of thousands to install the new tanks, he wondered, and there still were not enough E-85 customers to pay for it? What if those with flex fuel cars went right on buying gasoline? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"167796"	"I"	"wondered"	" How many, I wondered, had placed even bigger bets at home? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"169800"	"they"	"wondered"	" It was a hard message to hear, the families said. Why, they wondered, was a war that had been started to get the men back now ending without their return or even any information on their fate? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169802"	"they"	"wondered"	" It was a hard message to hear, the families said. Why, they wondered, was a war that had been started to get the men back now ending without their return or even any information on their fate? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"170343"	"he"	"wondered"	" Now, he wondered, if someone can figure out a way to sell the stuff from kiosks in airport baggage claim areas. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"170417"	"I"	"wondered"	" These are union men whose jobs depend on strong bodies. What, I wondered, are they packing for lunch? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"170599"	"she"	"wondered"	" Then they called Maddy Tarnofsky, pet lawyer, who quickly spotted a weakness in the landlord's case: How exactly, she wondered, could the landlord prove that Bobby, Bertha and Sparky weren't Antwerp or homing pigeons after all? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171585"	"you"	"wondered"	" Junya Watanabe, having demonstrated his energetic cutting skills many times before, decided to repeat them. What had his summer been like, you wondered, as denim coats and ruffled cotton shirts in the 18th-century masculine style came out? Had nothing else come to him? Or did it seem a time to refine his ideas? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"171663"	"he"	"wondered"	" What is it like, he wondered, to be the hero who hit the home run, so humble he acted as if he had struck out? And what is a half-century's purgatory like for a sensitive pitcher turned classic goat? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"171824"	"they"	"wondered"	" Could this be their same idol, they wondered, who had given them the game ball from his first Atlanta win back in 2004? The same Jim Mora who stayed in touch with them with such nice e-mails, asking about their fragile health and seeing if he could help them in any way? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"173040"	"I"	"wondered"	" When Brian signed him to that contract, I wondered, How long will he last? San Diego Padres general manager Kevin Towers said. Well, it turned out to be a great signing because it seems he's gotten better. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173708"	"I"	"wondered"	" After dinner, we headed to Le Bon Temps Roule, a down-to-earth bar. In the back, a piano player was jamming modern Dixieland on an upright, accompanied by a percussionist who made use of everything around him: a bucket, a stool, a cardboard Budweiser box. Better yet, an oyster shucker was slicing open shells and doling them out free of charge. Was this, I wondered, a post-Katrina deal to lure back customers? Nope, the manager Laura Vidacovich told me later, free-oyster Fridays have been a Bon Temps tradition for years. In fact, she said, the Bon Temps was operating just as it had before the storm. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173715"	"I"	"wondered"	" Later, I wondered, what if I were to die tomorrow and total strangers peeked in my attic? What would they think? The answer, to me, seemed obvious. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"174577"	"I"	"wondered"	" I was actively sick for two days and hung over for a week. Why, I wondered, would anyone ever do this more than once. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
