"12614"	"they"	"theorize"	" The mechanism, they theorize, is designed to suppress neuronal ``background activity.'' The trick may help explain a broad array of phenomena -- how patients cope with chronic pain, how we screen out distractions when we have to, how danger or sexual foreplay can command full attention. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"
"49674"	"they"	"theorize"	" If that doesn't work, the Buchanophobes in the party are saying, then a deadlocked convention is their best hope. When nobody gets the 996 votes needed for nomination on the first or second ballot, they theorize, then the great and the good will assemble in a smoke-free room, negotiate and announce that they have a compromise candidate _ Colin Powell? Dick Cheney? Jack Kemp? _ who is then nominated by acclamation. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"

"70764"	"they"	"theorize"	" The latest theory seeking to explain ball lightning, published by two Spanish physicists in the current issue of the journal Nature, suggests that after an ordinary lightning strike, the lines of magnetic force created by a huge current of electricity sometimes link with each other. The result, they theorize, is sometimes an electromagnetic knot strong enough to confine a ball of glowing plasma _ a lightning ball. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"

"92413"	"they"	"theorize"	" Instead, they theorize, patients seem to improve after taking placebos because most diseases have uneven courses in which their severity waxes and wanes. In studies in which treatments are compared not just to placebos but also to no treatment at all, they said, participants given no treatment improve at about the same rate as participants given placebos. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"
"123402"	"they"	"theorize"	" In obsessive compulsive disorder, they theorize, the subcortical filter malfunctions, allowing the unwanted thoughts to reach the cortex and then on to consciousness. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"157137"	"they"	"theorize"	" Scientists are also trying to figure out how bits of tularemia get into the air. Maybe, they theorize, it happens when lawn mowers zip across burrowing ticks infected with the germ. Or it could be wafting up from waste material deposited by wild animals. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"157730"	"they"	"theorize"	" If it weren't for the massive influence of Jupiter in the vicinity, they theorize, Ceres may have grown into a full-fledged planet. Ceres is almost perfectly round like a planet, with a diameter of about 580 miles, and 25 percent of its mass could be water ice. (That's more water than all the freshwater currently flowing on Earth.) The findings will be published in the September issue of Nature. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
