"42809"	"she"	"replies"	" Luther Vandross, ``This is Christmas,'' Epic. This is a gem. Vandross adds elegant orchestrations and a choir to ``O Come All Ye Faithful,'' but the real standouts are six new songs he co-wrote. These include the pop-funk ``Listen to the Bells'' (a duet with Darlene Love that features a Phil Spector-like sound), the hedonistic ``A Kiss for Christmas'' (``Honey, it's cold outside, pour another glass of wine, light up the fireplace'') and the frisky ``Mistletoe Jam.'' It finds Vandross getting carried away in a spoken dialogue with Brenda White-King. ``Come on over here and get under this mistletoe with me,'' he says. No, she replies, ``because you don't know how to act when you get under there.'' This album has soul and a sense of humor. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"

The trouble with ghost stories is that no matter how sophisticated the special effects, the depiction of numinous creatures is almost always pretty silly. Halfway through the pilot, Supernatural stops building suspense and turns predictable. The show reverts to a WB family drama about the bonds between two mismatched brothers and their father. Sam (Jared Padalecki of Gilmore Girls) wants to go to law school and lead a normal life. His older brother, Dean (Jensen Ackles of Smallville), is still a phantom-hunter and a ne'er-do-well scamp.
