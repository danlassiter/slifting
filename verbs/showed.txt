"461"	"he"	"showed"	" In 1931, the Austrian mathematician Kurt Goedel captured this dilemma in one of his famous incompleteness theorems. Once a logical system becomes as complex as arithmetic, he showed, it cannot prove its own consistency. Doing so requires a more complex system. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199407.gz"

"84241"	"it"	"showed"	" A study released last month by the Washington-based Education Trust looking at 24 years of national data pointed to other ways to improve urban schools. At minority and urban schools, it showed, more than half the math and science teachers haven't had a course in math or science since high school. Students in poor minority schools are less likely to take geometry and Advanced Placement courses than students in white schools. States spend more on suburban than urban schools. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

She had lots of nice furniture but no spot inviting enough to linger in. The room felt dark. Framed prints were centered unimaginatively over the sofa, knickknacks were clumped randomly on the bookshelves in a futile effort to inject character. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
