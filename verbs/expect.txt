By Richard Berke.  CALIF-PRIMARY (Los Angeles) _ While the outcome of next week's California primary is a foregone conclusion, the question among many Republicans in the state is whether Dole will make a full-court press there next fall. Clinton is well ahead in polls in the state, where he has made 23 visits since becoming President. Gov. Wilson says Dole is committed to spending the $10 million it will take to put California in play. By B. Drummond Ayres Jr.  BUCHANAN (San Diego) _ Pat Buchanan breaks for the border looking for another backdrop for his pronouncement on immigration.  CONGRESS (``w'' code)  CLINTON-DOLE (Washington) _ In their first encounter since Dole became the presumptive Republican nominee, Clinton meets with him and Gingrich on the budget.  SENATE-BUDGET (Washington) _ Senate hopes to finish work on the 1996 budget.  CONGRESS-COWBOYS (Washington) _ Grazing provisions of the farm bill are to be debated soon, and cattlemen from all over are in town to lobby about it. By John H. Cushman.

OTHER WASHINGTON (``w'' code)  SCOTUS-CENSUS (Washington) _ Ending a lengthy battle led by New York City, the Supreme Court rules unanimously that the Bush administration had no obligation to use statistical adjustment to correct for any undercount in the 1990 Census. By Linda Greenhouse.  NATIONAL GENERAL (``a'' code)  COLLEGE-ADMISSIONS (Undated) _ A federal appeals court decision that the admissions program at the University of Texas law school is unconstitutional appears to give the U.S. Supreme Court a clear shot out at finding preferential admissions programs in higher education generally unconstitutional. Universities around the nation today were examining their admissions formulas and policies to determine whether they are likely to withstand court scrutiny. By Peter Applebome.  With a related story:  COLLEGE-ADMISSIONS-TEXAS (Houston) _ With acceptances being sent out to undergraduate and graduate school candidates, the University of Texas has shut down the admissions process on all 15 of its campuses as it determines how to proceed. Talking with students, high school advisers, university officials. By Sam Howe Verhovek.  DRINKING-AGE (Beaumont, Texas) _ In a decision that many people in Louisiana view as woefully short on common sense, a 4-3 majority of the state supreme court ruled that the state's drinking age law was a form of age discrimination. It was the judicial equivalent of a keg party, making Louisiana the only state with a drinking age of 18 and thus a drinking mecca for youngsters from Beaumont and other towns in Texas, Mississippi and Arkansas.  COMMENTARY (``k'' code)  William Safire's ``Essay'' and Maureen Dowd's ``Liberties''; details to come.  INTERNATIONAL (These stories will move with an ``i'' category code)  BRITAIN-MADCOW (London) _ An unusal cluster of Kreuzfeld-Jacob disease in Britain has been officially linked to cases of beef consumption for the first time, but officials say once again that mad cow disease is under control. By John Darnton.  EUROPE-CHRISTOPHER (Prague) _ Christopher gives his ``Whither Eastern Europe'' speech in Prague, saying U.S. will continue its plans for bringing former Communist bloc countries under NATO's wing, undaunted by a Russian Parliament vote that proclaimed the breakup of the Soviet Union invalid. By Steven Erlanger.  RUSSIA-PRIMAKOV (Moscow) _ Profile of Yevgeny M. Primakov, the new Russian foreign minister. By Alessandra Stanley.  YUGO-BOSNIA (Sarajevo) _ Plan for training and arming the Bosnian Muslims to level the playing field seems to be falling apart as countries fail to participate. By Chris Hedges.  Following is a tentative sked:  INDIA-TIBETANS (Dharmsala, India) _ N.N. Nowroji has lived up here in the foothills of the Himalayas for most of his 81 years, and he thanks God, and China, for the Tibetans. It was 36 years ago this spring that the Dalai Lama and his entourage arrived to set up their new homes here, fresh from their flight from Chinese troops suppressing an uprising in Tibet.

Its stock falls as much as 15 percent, and the news pulls down the tech sector and the market over all. By Lawrence Fisher.

"62918"	"I"	"expect"	" If a state decides to create single-sex programs, the state would, I expect, consider the public's interest and demand in designing curricula. And rightfully so. But the state should avoid assuming demand based on stereotypes; it must not assume a priori, without evidence, that there would be no interest in a women's school of civil engineering, or in a men's school of nursing. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199606.gz"
"63561"	"I"	"expect"	" Until we see the light. I, for one, found a box for my old tapes and stored them in a closet _ a way station, I expect, on the road to oblivion. The kitchen drawer remains free of cassettes. That's not to say I don't use my VCR anymore: as with a good Chinese takeout menu, I wouldn't want to live completely without one. In fact, I've got a tape of a movie waiting to be watched. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"

Unless otherwise noted, they are for use at any time.  Stories are moving in category shown at end of each budget item.  Entertainment/Lifestyle  PET-CARE _ undated _ My brother has a sign in his office. It reads, ``You can have it fast, cheap or good _ select any two of the above.'' Despite the obvious wisdom of this cliche, some pet owners demand all three: good, cheap and NOW! (Wilkes). (l)  WOODWORKING _ undated _ We all have our favorite woods _ and, I expect, every woodworker has his least favorite woods. Though I still use it from time to time, I suppose I'd have to say that oak is my least favored. It's not the appearance of the stuff _ quarter-sawn oak, in particular, is most handsome _ but its fearsome hardness and tendency to chip bothers me. (Warner). (l)  ESTEFAN-REACH _ undated _ It might startle some people when pop vocalist Gloria Estefan says she has endured the physical and mental training of, say, Gwen Torrence. But considering that six years ago the 38-year-old performer had to learn to walk all over again and that tonight at Lakewood Amphitheatre she embarks on a yearlong world tour, the Olympian comparison makes sense. (Murray). (e)  JUPITER-ISLAND _ undated _ On Jupiter Island, it never has been just about money. Anybody can be rich. Some earn it. Members of the ``Lucky Sperm Club,'' islanders joke, inherit it. But not just anybody could pass muster with Permelia Pryor Reed to become a member of the exclusive Jupiter Island Club. For 63 years, Permelia, her husband, Joseph, and later, their son Nathaniel, brought their friends to this island and sold them its land. They cultivated a life far different than the glitzy world of Palm Beach. (Swartz, 3 Takes). (l)  JUPITER-COTTAGE _ undated _ Joseph Reed built an oceanfront cottage in 1940, when Arthur H. Sulzberger, a former editor of The New York Times, vacationed on the island. Reed had named the other cottages _ Allamanda, Bamboo, Hibiscus _ and what to name the new one was a hot topic of island conservation. (Swartz). (l)  JUPITER-BLACK-SWEATER _ undated _ The sweater story has been told for years: that Jupiter Island Club matriarch, the late Permelia Reed, ``blackballed'' potential members by sending them a black sweater. (Swartz). (l)  Travel  MIAMI-VIZCAYA _ MIAMI _ A South African family, two French couples and a German couple listened intently as the tour guide led them around the opulent living room of Vizcaya, Miami's most famous mansion. Europeans are usually unimpressed with American historic landmarks, hardly historic at all compared to Europe's centuries-old attractions. But the Europeans on this tour seemed quite amazed. (Blackerby). (t)  Sports  STODA-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Who guessed four years deferred adjudication, a $10,000 fine, 800 hours of community service and a judge's warning as Michael Irvin's sentence for his no-contest plea to a felony cocaine possession charge? You win a big, blue, metallic star just like the ones Irvin will wear on his Dallas Cowboys football helmet sometime this season. (Oh, you think the NFL will suspend Irvin for the whole 1996 schedule? Sorry, you have to give back that big, blue, metallic star.) And if you guessed 20 years in prison as the sentence? You go directly to the dunce chair from which you will be forced to watch every televised second of the Olympic Games. (Stoda). (s)  Commentary  YOUNG-COLUMN _ undated _ ``We are buying a one-way ticket to a recession.'' _ Phil Gramm, 1993. Who has the standing to dispute the pronouncement of an esteemed economeister? When Gramm was denouncing a package of tax hikes proposed by Bill Clinton in 1993, all that supporters of the plan could say was, ``Well, if a recession happens, at least we've done something about the deficit.'' (Young) (k)  MINTER-COLUMN _ undated _ Maybe I really do belong to another era. Almost every day I find myself wishing more and more that Bob Dole had a touch of Ronald Reagan's charisma, or Bill Clinton's slickness, or that he'd put Elizabeth on the ticket. Beside having experience and the makings of a decent president, he represents the last chance for a last hurrah for maybe the greatest generation this country has produced. (Minter). (k)  BORDERS-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The eyes of Texas are upon us. My daughter's eyes are big as saucers as we wait in line for the shuttle bus to take us to Jester Hall, the mammoth dormitory on the University of Texas campus, where she'll spend the next four days in orientation, preparing for her first year of college here. (Borders). (k)  LATHAM-COLUMN _ undated _ My father's mind was often in the clouds, or on them anyway. Truth to tell, when, as a little boy, I went fishing with him, his eyes were pointed toward the sky as much as they were at the water. He loved looking at clouds. Not being much of a fisherman, myself, cloud-watching was often the best part of fishing. (Latham). (k)  For questions and resends, contact:  Art Dalglish 202-887-8338.  Rick Christie 202-887-8316.

He might even reflect that Sam Peckinpah -- his junior by one day, and 20 years dead -- blew out his heart fighting the studios, and never got his vindication. And Robert Altman, I expect, will accept his statuette with (perhaps slightly mordant) good grace, because it'll do. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060216.0425 type=story > <HEADLINE> STEERING A LOST CAREER BACK TO THE 'HOOD </HEADLINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
