I still think of myself as an independent guy and if you don't believe that I'll squash you like a bug. Anyway, even though I have two networks named for me already, I have a new one you'd better find a place for on one of them Crosswalks channels. It's called Ted-SPAN. Everything about me, mostly coming live (or hell, taped, I couldn't care less) from my new home, Ted Turner Ballpark, the stadium I got for virtually nothing when the Olympics ended. Ted-SPAN will carry my press conferences (if you've never seen me in action, bring the Lithium), my private conversations with Jane (Fonda, you peckerwood, not Jarvis) during Braves games, and my moose-hunting trips with Fidel Castro (you really think Curt Gowdy, Bing Crosby and Phil Foster on ``The American Sportsman'' can beat that combination?). I'm serious. Don't listen to Gerald Levin. Yeah, he's my chairman. So what? </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"
