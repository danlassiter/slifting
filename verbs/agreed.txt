"6241"	"she"	"agreed"	" The conversation boldly took off. Yes, she was a fan, too, she told Margolin. Yes, she'd been to ``Star Trek'' conventions. And yes, she agreed, there might be a course in here. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199410.gz"
"9840"	"we"	"agreed"	" ``We can go only so far with cybernetics, automation and sophisticated machinery,'' he concluded, ``before we run up against the limitations of an uneducated work force.''

"13682"	"she"	"agreed"	" Neutral backgrounds are almost an Evelyn Lauder signature. The living room of the Manhattan duplex apartment that she won't discuss -- an interview was conducted there, on the condition nothing be written about it -- is beige. Could that color be mentioned? Yes, she agreed, but nothing more. Her office, too, high up in the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue at 59th Street, is a symphony of noncolor, deliberately bland. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199502.gz"
"15305"	"she"	"agreed"	" Shocked, she agreed, though the man she says raped her refused to take the test. When her test results were inconclusive, the case was dropped. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199502.gz"
"17178"	"they"	"agreed"	" And the people, they agreed, are the biggest asset. In New York, had they not been ready to load a shipment of furniture onto a truck when it arrived, the driver would have filled their ears with expletives and driven off without their cargo. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"
"18022"	"he"	"agreed"	" His uncle, Adam Atet, said he had moved here several years ago from Wisconsin, where he owned a grocery, to go into business selling Indian crafts. This is a long way from Palestine, he agreed, but the diaspora is a wide one. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"
"18331"	"he"	"agreed"	" Owners, he agreed, need assurances from the union that the players won't strike again this season if baseball resumes while negotiations toward a settlement continue. As for a potential lockout by the owners, Colangelo said, ``I have no idea about that.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"
"20741"	"they"	"agreed"	" Despite the strides made by women in the workplace, they agreed, the boys around them took it for granted that they would grow up to be workers and breadwinners, while the girls were ``just encouraged to be pretty.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"21932"	"we"	"agreed"	" It was foolishness, we agreed, to let friendships go so long neglected. Christmas cards across 2,000 miles do not suffice. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"22651"	"they"	"agreed"	" Once their cargo was unloaded at the warehouse, the drivers headed to a nearby Norwegian army compound for hot showers and cold beer. It had been, they agreed, an easy trip.

"54711"	"she"	"agreed"	" At the end of his career, his powers diminished, his will to live ebbing, Johnson again persuaded a reluctant Kearns to help him write his memoirs.

"57519"	"they"	"agreed"	" Two mothers at a New York private school recently recounted their embarrassment over a book for their 7-year-olds that compared the pleasure of an orgasm to the pleasure of jumping rope. Information about orgasms, they agreed, could wait. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"
"57628"	"he"	"agreed"	" In reply, Horner said in a telephone interview Wednesday that he had modified his interpretation of baby maiasaur bone development. That, he agreed, does not imply that maiasaur babies were immobile and helpless. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"
"60119"	"we"	"agreed"	" My friend also was unhappy with the new restaurant's service. America's quality of service, we agreed, is deteriorating at the same time that the nation is moving from a manufacturing-based economy to a service-based economy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"
"64104"	"he"	"agreed"	" Grinberg said the clock faces would not mimic the brand's famous minimalist museum watch but would bear hour and minute markings for closer time-telling.

"64111"	"he"	"agreed"	" It's a clever tactic, but one, he agreed, that will eventually leave him ``orphaned'' as push buttons become universal. ``Woe betide those people who have rotary phones,'' warned another writer, Luc Sante. ``They're sunk.'' </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960708.0704 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-NYT-GRAPHICS-HELD-ADVISORY-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> **ATTENTION EDITORS** 07/08/96  The following graphics have been killed  PETITION/Signature Collection -- Size Tk -- PETITION-GATHERERS  The use of professional signature collectors  SIBERIA/Birobidzhan Locator -- 1X2 1/4 -- SIBERIA-JEWS  Locator map.

"66864"	"they"	"agreed"	" Even at this late stage, according to Republican officials and Dole's advisers, the likely Republican nominee still hopes Colin Powell will change his mind and agree to take the second spot on the ticket. Only Powell, they agreed, combines the bold-choice and the ready-to-serve criteria. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199608.gz"
"67880"	"he"	"agreed"	" It was only when Lacroix was asked about his Paris apartment _ which he and his wife decorated with the help of Jean-Louis Riccardi _ did the designer get a trifle defensive. Of course, he agreed, certain of its elements could be found in the essay on ``Savant Desordre'' (``Wise Man's Mess''), but he insisted that the apartment's flea-market flamboyance _ walls the color of Necco wafers, kitsch bullfight paintings and lurid kitchen tiles _ is all Lacroix and nothing more. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199608.gz"
"67906"	"he"	"agreed"	" Dodd said Democrats have only visited the media skyboxes. They never set foot on the floor which, he agreed, ``crosses a line.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199608.gz"
"70357"	"they"	"agreed"	" The reason, they agreed, was that although Angel Diaz, the defendant who faced the death penalty for the murder of a Bronx police officer, was found hanged in his prison cell, the principles behind the dispute remain unresolved. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"
"71597"	"she"	"agreed"	" Lynne White, an anchor for ``Good Day New York'' on WNYW-TV, said she worked throughout her marriage but ``hadn't saved, because I was being taken care of.'' When her husband, Gil Griffin, a lawyer and executive recruiter, pushed her to use mediation to eliminate lawyers' fees, she agreed, but came out with what she said was a bad deal. ``I couldn't afford to pay a lawyer, and I jumped at a pretty low offer just to make ends meet,'' she said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"

"71795"	"he"	"agreed"	" The gallery's inaugural show, ``Moving Structures,'' will include a life-size sculpture of an elevator by Richard Artschwager and voice-activated light bulbs by Tony Oursler. The big design issue will be whether to open or close the sliding walls, to make the space feel either ``claustrophobic'' or ``free.'' Mentally, however, Koolhaas has already moved on by busily imagining other more ``extreme'' conditions that he might devise for art, like arranging a pitch-dark background for something on the order of the photographer Cindy Sherman's vomit series or creating what he calls ``an astringent, authoritarian circulation'' (obstacle course) for the amusement of jaded gallery-goers. The only sacred space, he agreed, with prompting from Maupin, will be the sales office. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"
"74121"	"they"	"agreed"	" Contributing to a pullback, they agreed, will be the absence of the 10,000 temporary jobs created in August for the collection of the government's census survey. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"
"75540"	"she"	"agreed"	" Puccio dwelled on details of the notes the doctor wrote after her examination years ago. He pointed out, for example, that the doctor kept no precise notes on the size of the young woman's injuries. Instead, she agreed, she described injuries in terms such as ``small'' or ``deep.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"
"77300"	"they"	"agreed"	" All of the men recalled, second by second, the series of fire fights on the river that day in which Kerry, they agreed, bravely led a mission that earned the entire boat a presidential citation. All were infuriated by a Globe business column published nine days before the election that raised doubts about whether Kerry's actions were heroic. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"
"86167"	"they"	"agreed"	" Encouraged but still cautious, Mrs. Gallo consulted breeders, visited pet shops and borrowed library books about specific breeds. All promoted poodles and certain other dogs as allergy-safe. The family became enchanted with a type of toy spaniel called the bichon frise, which, they agreed, looked like a poodle, only cuter. Mrs. Gallo was delighted by a book that declared, ``Bichons do not shed dander, making them more compatible to the family that has a member who is allergic.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"87832"	"he"	"agreed"	" Lobach, who was president of the county's bar association at the time, recalled Thursday that when immigration officials asked the association to represent the men in their asylum hearings, he agreed, but simply because he advocated doing a certain amount of work free of charge. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"88116"	"they"	"agreed"	" Both Salyers and Beachy said genetically engineered foods can be superior to their natural counterparts, bred to resist pests, viruses and other stresses that improve crop production and allow the use of fewer pesticides.

"88660"	"we"	"agreed"	" Denali did not disappoint. On our first afternoon, an old schoolbus took us along the 14 miles of road we were allowed to travel over, and we scored what is called a Clean Sweep, spotting the Big Four of park animals: Dall sheep, moose, caribou, and grizzly bear. True, they were some distance away and looked small even with binoculars, but we did see them. (The moose refused to turn around, preferring to moon us.) The most exciting sighting, we agreed, was a blond grizzly, rolling and stretching and scratching. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199703.gz"
"88688"	"he"	"agreed"	" It sounded, he agreed, like a bad tabloid headline: Survives Auschwitz, but Not Times Square! </P> "	"nyt_eng_199703.gz"
"90333"	"she"	"agreed"	" When Hobe Sound Presbyterian offered to bring her in for an interview in March 2000, she agreed, thinking it would be a nice vacation for her and her husband, Bob Blum. She visited the tidy, modest church grounds _ saw the sanctuary, offices, pastor's home and a courtyard with a fountain that, that day, was ``covered in green slime,'' she says. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"91241"	"he"	"agreed"	" Fredrickson acknowledged business is good right now for the computer storage company and its work force of 8,500 is expanding. Still, he agreed, companies are not doing themselves or their workers any favors when they move too quickly to layoffs before taking other steps. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"98206"	"he"	"agreed"	" Pursell described the incident at the Miami airport as a nuisance more than a serious violation, an assessment shared by many others in general aviation. But, he agreed, it raised a host of questions, most notably one that remains unanswered: Why were the two novice pilots flying into a heavily trafficked airport on such a busy day? Pursell later posted a sign inside the flight school forbidding novice pilots from flying into Miami International. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"99080"	"they"	"agreed"	" Smith said that the only two emotions are love and fear, and they nodded, agreeing that love is the answer. They gave a standing ovation when Alicia Porter, 8, of Leadville was awarded the John Denver Memorial Peace Prize for raising $24,000 for the International Fire Fighters Association 9-11 Relief Fund. Here, they agreed, was John Denver's legacy, someone stepping forward and doing something, inspired to be better, do more. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"99817"	"I"	"agreed"	" ``I've been to Kenya many times over the last 40 years and got involved with Kip and their marathoners,'' Beldotti said. ``He asked me if I would take on this project. Almost against my wishes, I agreed, but I said it was hopeless.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"106809"	"he"	"agreed"	" It was a long way from November 2000, when the day after the disputed presidential election found Hemmer and Kagan at their usual 9 a.m. positions at the CNN anchor desk. When a producer approached Hemmer during a break and asked him to go to Florida, he agreed, then turned to Kagan. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"110294"	"they"	"agreed"	" That outer-spacey look has already lured American, German and British television news crews to Hanksville and more are on the way. The six scientists now in the research station said that perhaps their most important duty was to be nice and photogenic. That is the most cost-effective way, they agreed, to create a groundswell of support for sending human beings to Mars. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"111023"	"they"	"agreed"	" The meal, they agreed, was a good compromise.

"115507"	"he"	"agreed"	" After enjoying a drink and some hammock time at Las Gatas, we caught that last boat back to town. We half-jokingly asked the panga captain to drop us off at our hotel. To our surprise, he agreed, heading up the bay, and cutting the motor 20 yards out from La Ropa. We waded to the beach, as the sunset streaked the water around us with shimmering color. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"116132"	"he"	"agreed"	" Kettyle said he reports such episodes to the dean's office, though if students describe hazing in confidence, he withholds names and details. Doctors should be more aware, he agreed, though he cautioned that if ER visits bring harsh penalties to teammates or fraternity brothers, it could keep hazing victims from seeking care. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"118968"	"they"	"agreed"	" The new piece, they agreed, while at times lyrical and sweet, is not especially funny. ``The humours as originally conceived were medical humors,'' Wolken said. ``It was serious business to try to understand how the body worked. It's likely that our humors will not be in the least bit funny, but thought-provoking.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"121839"	"I"	"agreed"	" Yes, I agreed, but it has to be a fad. People can spend less money for state-of-the-art, high-performance motorcycles. You don't want to be holding Harley stock when the bubble bursts. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"122002"	"she"	"agreed"	" Yakira Velez, 14, said the one-on-one intensity had meant some hard times, especially in math. But, she agreed, it produces results. Yakira and her tutor, Kelly Zimmerman, have made a graph of her work on multiplication tables, which has steadily improved. Now math is her favorite subject. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"

"123007"	"he"	"agreed"	" Terrific news about women, he agreed, being the proud father of a lawyer-daughter. But he sees it also as more sad proof that boys are failing, dropping out and disappearing. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"123879"	"they"	"agreed"	" First one lawyer, then another expressed the thought that there had to be a better way. They had a new collective bargaining agreement to work out, and it wasn't working. They had to find a way, they agreed, to slice through the thicket of words, begin to build a dialogue and see if they could discuss issues and make inroads into resolving them. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"126465"	"they"	"agreed"	" Truth be told, they didn't get past the fifth hole in their virtual round; they were stopped by their own laughter. At the first hole, they agreed, her club of choice would be driver. No. 2, driver. No. 3, driver. No. 4, driver. By the time they made it to imaginary hole No. 5, Suzy joked that there would be no need to consult with her caddie because only her driver would give her the necessary distance. She imagines the one-sided conversation going something like this: ``Give me the driver. We need it all. If it gets there, great. But if the wind blows, I'm screwed.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"129104"	"he"	"agreed"	" Dyke said the XM-15 typically uses a 10-round magazine of .223 bullets. He said the weapon was not favored by military snipers, who prefer rifles with longer barrels to increase accuracy and effective range. But he did say that the XM-15 was popular among target shooters and that he considered it highly accurate without a scope up to about 50 yards.

The addition of a scope and a tripod, he agreed, would expand its effective range in the hands of a skilled marksman. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"

"129297"	"he"	"agreed"	" Julian Bond, the chairman of the NAACP, notes that a friend of his says that when whites think of blacks they are always interested in what black people think of them. ``Maybe now they're equally interested in what we think of each other,'' Bond said. That, he agreed, is some measure of progress. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20021026.0058 type=story > <HEADLINE> CAN WE TALK?

"131324"	"they"	"agreed"	" She and her colleagues began by questioning other gerontologists, surveying 60 of these specialists at seven medical centers and asking them to define what, to them, were the hallmarks of frailty. What emerged was a consensus definition. Frailty, they agreed, was characterized by muscle weakness, fatigue, declines in activity, a slow or unsteady gait and weight loss. People with at least three of these symptoms were considered frail. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"135506"	"he"	"agreed"	" With all of the same liabilities, others point out. Peter Ditchfield, who runs the British Columbia Organized Crime Agency, said pot now is what alcohol was during prohibition -- readily available and largely run by organized crime. Making it legal undercut the crime bosses, he agreed, but the problems associated with abuse expanded. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136146"	"they"	"agreed"	" After all the search warrants, witness interviews and forensic tests, a team of veteran prosecutors and investigators came to an overwhelming conclusion about the death of Frank Wagner. The industrial explosion that killed him, they agreed, was the result of reckless criminal conduct by his employer, McWane Inc., the Alabama conglomerate that owns a cast-iron foundry here in upstate New York. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"

"142473"	"he"	"agreed"	" He said he had refused, because the patient was not yet 21, the age at which the federal Medicaid program reimburses for sterilization.

"142600"	"they"	"agreed"	" At the request of The New York Times, Hodges, Eliran and Ash recently met with Coyne and her partner, Matthew Serino, and Jim Russek, who led two agencies of his own before joining Serino Coyne, at the Serino offices in Times Square, where the discussion was organized around what makes their business unique. Mostly, they agreed, it involved the impossibility of the task. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"143562"	"they"	"agreed"	" Far more important, they agreed, is to listen -- to let grieving persons talk, cry and let their feelings out. At the appropriate time, a fond memory or a funny story about the deceased might be appreciated. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"144938"	"they"	"agreed"	" If it's possible to be nice to a fault, they agreed, St. Louisans are nicely flawed. They don't set cars aflame after their team wins a pennant-clinching baseball game. They like and vote for Democrats, even if rural Missourians tend not to. They may not live in New York or Los Angeles, but their shoulders are unencumbered by chips. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"145781"	"they"	"agreed"	" Wordy Polonius behind the curtain was the toughest case, they agreed, but Sack rose to Hamlet's defense. If Hamlet thought he was killing Claudius, Sack said, and Hamlet was entitled to kill Claudius, then the killing of Polonius was excusable. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"146497"	"he"	"agreed"	" When I asked my editor whether I could be reimbursed for my travel to the American Economic Association meetings this year in Philadelphia, he agreed, with a caveat. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"146865"	"he"	"agreed"	" Scorsese said he saw flying as a metaphor for the artistic process. Flight isn't just about being in a plane, he said. You can fly when you write a novel, when you paint a picture. Or, he agreed, when you make a movie. I would like to think that kind of flying may be just as dangerous, he said. If you don't get killed in a plane, you can still have your spirit killed. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"148254"	"they"	"agreed"	" Knowing where and how to find information, they agreed, was just the beginning. Interpreting, sorting, evaluating, manipulating and repackaging information in dozens of forms from thousands of sources -- as well as having a fundamental understanding of the legal and ethical uses of digital materials -- are also important components. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"151690"	"we"	"agreed"	" Somehow, we agreed, we have to preserve serious journalism of the sort being practiced at that breakfast. But the signs in the marketplace aren't encouraging. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"151819"	"he"	"agreed"	" About 10 years later, Anderson writes, Isaacs learned of the Brooklyn Historical Society, so he called the Hall of Fame and asked that be banner sent there. But the Hall, which had changed curators by then, didn't know of the previous oral agreement and wouldn't release the pennant. When the Brooklyn Historical Society asked then-Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley for permission to display it, he agreed, Anderson writes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"157146"	"they"	"agreed"	" Most of them landed in treatment under court orders. Maybe, they agreed, a little time behind bars is just the get-a-grip slap that Gooden needs. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"165132"	"he"	"agreed"	" After his efforts to buy Gemstar failed, Malone became a big shareholder in TV Guide by merging a company with his own on-screen guide business into it. Then in 1999, Murdoch proposed to Yuen that Gemstar acquire TV Guide for $9.2 billion in stock. This time, he agreed, with conditions: Murdoch would end up the biggest shareholder, but he would get an employment contract putting him firmly in charge for five years. Yuen next turned to buying companies to produce so-called electronic-book readers. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"166312"	"we"	"agreed"	" Nothing, we agreed, but we were once again reminded of the wisdom of stopping to smell the roses while we're still able to identify them. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"166905"	"he"	"agreed"	" Hatch didn't challenge the subsidies. He said ethanol is good for farmers, good for Minnesota. Asked if it were hard for politicians to speak negatively of ethanol, he agreed, saying, Ethanol is probably in a category right now where apple pie is. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"167283"	"they"	"agreed"	" Advisers to both candidates said that most New York voters do not yet have an opinion about either man and are not paying attention to the race yet. As a result, they agreed, the nomination fight would now turn on the televised debates this summer, the candidates' use of Spitzer's missteps, and their ability to raise money and mount compelling television commercials. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"

"167994"	"we"	"agreed"	" As long as we lived in the United States, we agreed, we'd fly to Malaysia a lot. Hang out with my family. Eat noodles at roadside stalls. Hit the beach. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"169080"	"I"	"agreed"	" It was a fine bike, I agreed, as I tooled around on some of the twisting trails around the festival. It was unfortunate that the rider -- me -- was not quite up to World Cup standards. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169174"	"he"	"agreed"	" A stocky man in jeans and sandals near the two watery trucks offered a more philosophical take. The planes were dangerous, he agreed, but it would not stop them. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"

"170598"	"I"	"agreed"	" So when Jerry called and asked if I would meet him for a drink, I agreed, but this time I went only to tell him. We met a bar with billiard tables. He wanted to teach me to play but I said we wouldn't have time. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171580"	"they"	"agreed"	" Coach John Tortorella and the players said so, too. It was, they agreed, the essence of the team that won the 2004 Stanley Cup. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172164"	"it"	"agreed"	" Celebrities including David Byrne of Talking Heads and Steven Van Zandt of the E Street Band and The Sopranos lined up to help mediate, but an agreement was never reached. Last December, three months after the club's 12-year lease had expired, it agreed, at the prodding of Justice Carol R. Edmead of state Supreme Court in Manhattan, to finally close. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172967"	"we"	"agreed"	" I considered for a moment going to the strip club I'd accidentally wandered into earlier, but instead I cooked dinner -- a real, not virtual, menu of seared duck breasts, mushrooms sauteed with thyme, and potatoes roasted in duck fat, garlic and rosemary. Then Jean and I opened a bottle of syrah from the Russian River Valley and commenced our feast. It was, we agreed, an especially satisfying meal -- and I knew exactly why: because, as Second Lifers understand all too well, I'd made it myself. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
