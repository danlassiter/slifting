Times News Service  NEW YORK _ Just when the art world seemed to be winding down for the summer, the International Center of Photography has come in with a quiet powerhouse of a show that by any measure is one of the standouts of the season.  ``An American Century of Photography: From Dry-Plate to Digital'' offers nothing less than an expansive, thorough recounting of the last 100 years of photography in this country, based on the great riches of a collection assembled since 1964 by Hallmark Cards.  Included in this far-ranging exhibition are examples of some of the greatest masterpieces of photography, as well as less famous but fascinating images by recognized and forgotten figures alike.  Accompanied by a beautifully produced catalogue written by Keith A. Davis, the curator of Hallmark's collection, ``An American Century'' will undoubtedly change many people's ideas about the shape of photographic history.  A single gallery about a third of the way into the exhibition gives a sense of the treasures to be found in this remarkable show.  On one wall is a glistening print of Edward Weston's great fleshy ``Pepper No. 30'' (1930), alongside a less familiar Weston of a lily under a sheet of broken glass; on another wall are two rare prints by Tina Modotti, Weston's companion, of geometric patterns formed by a stairway and by the straw hats of a crowd of Mexican peasants.  Across the room hangs one of Alfred Stieglitz's heroic portraits of Georgia O'Keeffe, from 1918, together with an example of his Equivalents, the lyrical cloud studies he began in 1922.  But the real rarity in this gallery is a large 1915 print by Paul Strand, of a woman clutching her baby as she hurries along a stained wall, which combines his early interest in formal innovation with his later concern for depicting people.  Each of these pictures is worthy of close attention in itself. But the same small gallery also features prime works by Edward Steichen, Alvin Langdon Coburn, Morton Schamberg, Imogen Cunningham and Ansel Adams, among others.  Few other sections of the show are quite as star-studded as this, but the seemingly endless stream of great images reflects the extraordinary level of work to be found throughout.  ``An American Century'' is more than just an unconnected jumble of beautiful pictures.  Davis brackets his history with two technical developments: the introduction of dry-plate photography around 1880, which freed photographers of much of the drudgery associated with earlier processes, and the dawn of digital image-making, which many people argue will again transform photography.  In the century between those two events, he suggests, the basic photographic process remained largely unchanged, freeing photographers to turn their attention elsewhere.  But what is most remarkable about Davis' approach is its inclusiveness. Both on the walls and in his lively catalogue text he takes an ecumenical view, in which the many competing styles that photographers and critics have advocated are accepted as worthy of historical consideration.  Rather than coming down on either side of the great split between Pictorialism, with its use of soft focus and expressive printing to convey emotion, and modernism, with its emphasis on crisply rendered detail and clear description, Davis endorses both as equally significant.  A notable feature of both the show and catalogue is the inclusion of work by photographers associated with the Clarence White School, the New York City institution that in the 1910s and '20s continued to train students in Pictorialist techniques after photographers like Stieglitz, Strand and Weston had shifted to modernism.  This attention to a neglected but important historical chapter is welcome, particularly in a survey exhibition; after all, photographers who studied at the school in that period included Dorothea Lange, Laura Gilpin and Paul Outerbridge Jr.  Along with his reconsideration of overlooked aspects of the history of art photography, Davis includes examples of commercial and fashion photography, to suggest the enormous impact the medium has had on everyday life.  Even the relatively few prints from these branches of the medium are of extraordinary quality. They range from Richard Avedon's elegant 1955 image of a model in a Dior gown stroking an elephant's trunk to a yellowing front page of the New York Daily News from May 1937 with spectacular photographs of the explosion of the zeppelin Hindenburg in Lakehurst, N.J.  The openness with which ``An American Century'' examines photography's past continues in its treatment of the present. The list of artists in the contemporary section reads like a who's who of contemporary art photography: included are works, most of outstanding quality, by Robert Adams, John Baldessari, Lee Friedlander, Cindy Sherman, Mike and Doug Starn, David Wojnarowicz, Carrie Mae Weems and many others.  It's remarkable that Davis would even try to bring his history up to the messy present, when artists' reputations are still in flux. But he plunges ahead fearlessly, and does a credible job of sorting out the conflicting styles and directions in the contemporary scene.  (STORY CAN END HERE.

Not that ``An American Century'' is a completely satisfying exhibition. For one thing, it is crammed into the limited space of the International Center of Photography's midtown branch; spectacular images are stacked on a wall or hung cheek by jowl, often producing the feeling of visiting a museum's storeroom.  The sequence of images is awkward, too. The contemporary work hangs in the street-level galleries and the historical portions in the underground galleries, so to follow the chronological thread, viewers must descend to the basement and work up.  Nor are all the works of equal interest; certain Pictorialist images, in particular, although historically significant, are apt to seem vapid today.  But such criticisms are quibbles beside the many exciting surprises to be found here. To say that this is a museum-quality show is a drastic understatement; any curator would jump at the chance to acquire even a few of these pictures.  With its broad scope and wealth of wonderful images, the exhibition bears comparison with ``The Waking Dream,'' the spectacular survey of early photography presented at the Metropolitan Museum of Art two summers ago.  That show, based on the collection of Gilman Paper Co., focused on photography's first century, from 1839 to 1939, and included European works; the current exhibition includes only American work from a later period but in doing so is able to address the medium's continuing evolution in the hands of contemporary artists.  ``An American Century'' samples the treasures of one of the largest and most active corporate collections of photography, and demonstrates the superb results that can be achieved by the judicious application of thought, taste and money.  This stunning show offers a thrilling and thought-provoking overview of a medium that continues to play a central role in the nation's art and culture.  __  ``An American Century of Photography: From Dry-Plate to Digital'' remains at the International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, through Sept. 10. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950608.0383 type=story > <HEADLINE> BRITAIN'S TELEWEST TO BUY SBC CABLECOMMS IN $1.1 BILLION DEAL </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> LONDON (BC-BRITAIN-TELECOM-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

THE E&AMP;P WEAR INDEX. The average age of journalists listed in Editor &AMP; Publisher's July 22 obituaries was 69.3, a plunge of 8.34 since June 27.  STYLE NOTE. Michael Crew (m.crew (at) bbcnc.org.uk) advises from Blighty: ``U.S. readers checking the British Press during our long hot dry spell please note that frequent mention of the NRA refers to the National Rivers Authority.'' Yes, Mike, thanks. And British readers checking the Yank press during our own long hot spell please note that frequent mention of the NRA refers to the National Rifle Association, that quasi-crackers leader of the oppressed-frontiersman industry that sends ringers to pose as congressional investigators.  THE GENERAL MAYHEM INDEX. Old BONG hand Doug Pizzi (doug.pizzi (at) Wizardsbbs.com) recalls: ``I saw the bit about journalists' obits (BONG 333) and couldn't help thinking about an index I had proposed when I worked in lovely Lowell, Mass., for the so called ``dog days'' of summer.  ``It was based on a number of factors, including temperature, humidity, phase of the moon, liquor store and power tool sales. It was called ``Propensity to Stab,'' with ``Stab'' serving as a generic term for general mutilation and mayhem, including, of course, gunplay.  ``Based on a scale of 1-10, for instance, on a day in the 90s, with high humidity, approaching a full moon, and high sales of booze and tools (As in: Overheard in the checkout line at Doug's Booze n'Tools, `Excuse me! I'll have this bottle of tequila and this chain saw!'), the PTS would be rougly an 8. Of course, after several days of like conditions, the PTS (No matter how hard I tried, I could not anger the PC gods by making the acronym come out PMS and still make sense.) would climb. The graphics possibilities still make me shudder.  ``Needless to say, in spite of my offer to personally gather the retail statistics, the idea never really got in the ground, so to speak. And what have we now? A useless U.V. index. I'd much rather know my chances of getting stuck like a pig than my chances of getting skin cancer 40 years from now. But hey, that's me.''  AND YET ANOTHER PEJORATIVE. From an occasionally reliable source:  ``A number of years ago, the San Jose Mercury News was widely criticized for minimal coverage of the heavily Hispanic east side of the city and for an obvious lack of Hispanics on the staff. The paper came to be known in certain circles as the `Sans Jose Mercury News.' The staff even put out a parody under that title. Things are much better now, however.''  IN BENGOUGH, SASKATCHEWAN, NEARLY EVERYBODY READS the Big Muddy Roundup.  THOSE OLD SPELLCHECKER BLUES. If you let a robot into your newsroom, you have to be ready for robotic results. So it is with spelling checkers, especially the kind that go ahead and ``fix'' your spelling if you don't tell them to cool it and get back in the box.  Edward Hunt (73774.3122 (at) compuserve.com) know. He writes: ``We at the Chinook (wash) Observer have created a new religion that would make a Luddite shudder. It has come to our attention that the Spellchecker is a much wiser judge of character than ourselves. When it doesn't recognize one of the local Finnish names, it suggests, instead a word that often describes the individual in question. For example: City councilor Fritts often has Fits. Police chief Baze is usually in a Haze. County commissioner Kaino comes out Cain (as in slew his brother Abel). Gov. Lowry comes out Lower (which he seems to ever be sinking) or Lowly (as in worm). A different spelling of Lowery used by a guy more local comes out out Flowery. OK, so I can't think of any funny examples right now.'' Funny enough, Ed. An antique Hendrix editing system at the Dayton Daily News used to insert mysterious exclamation points in copy, and they almost always made sense on a bizarre level. ``I'm not!a crook,'' and ``Vice officers found four male strippers dancing nude!in the club,'' that sort of thing. In the ninth year of its five-year warranty, the hated Hendrix went to the students of the University of Dayton, where a mysterious fire destroyed it and a couple of floors of Old Main.  CASTING CALL. Ed Hunt also ventures, ``I'm sure by now you are getting hell for your portrait gracing the pages of E&AMP;P this month. Strange you're the only one there that looks like he works at a newspaper. And I personally think Nick Nolte should play you in the BONG movie. Does he still drink?'' Flattered, we're sure. But the Chief Copyboy would not enjoy being portrayed by Nick, no matter how striking the resemblance, until he announces that yes he does drink and it was the elixirs of confusion that made him consent to star in that shamefully hollow effigy of a newspaper movie, ``I Love Trouble.''  THE SAPPER FACING THE CYBER-BUNKERS OF EMPIRE. Former Unipresser Dinty Moore -- his real name -- has a great book coming out next month about the Internet. Having trolled through on-line sex, flame wars, newsgroup agonies and therapies, global e-mail and the rest, Moore concludes that Thoreauphiles have nothing to fear from the new computer medium. As serious journalists know, content is the miracle, not the gibberish to get to it. Huzzahs with oak leaf clusters to the selfless forager Dinty.

THE GENERAL MAYHEM INDEX. Old BONG hand Doug Pizzi (doug.pizzi (at) Wizardsbbs.com) recalls: ``I saw the bit about journalists' obits (BONG 333) and couldn't help thinking about an index I had proposed when I worked in lovely Lowell, Mass., for the so called ``dog days'' of summer.  ``It was based on a number of factors, including temperature, humidity, phase of the moon, liquor store and power tool sales. It was called ``Propensity to Stab,'' with ``Stab'' serving as a generic term for general mutilation and mayhem, including, of course, gunplay.  ``Based on a scale of 1-10, for instance, on a day in the 90s, with high humidity, approaching a full moon, and high sales of booze and tools (As in: Overheard in the checkout line at Doug's Booze n'Tools, `Excuse me! I'll have this bottle of tequila and this chain saw!'), the PTS would be rougly an 8. Of course, after several days of like conditions, the PTS (No matter how hard I tried, I could not anger the PC gods by making the acronym come out PMS and still make sense.) would climb. The graphics possibilities still make me shudder.  ``Needless to say, in spite of my offer to personally gather the retail statistics, the idea never really got in the ground, so to speak. And what have we now? A useless U.V. index. I'd much rather know my chances of getting stuck like a pig than my chances of getting skin cancer 40 years from now. But hey, that's me.''

Edward Hunt (73774.3122 (at) compuserve.com) know. He writes: ``We at the Chinook (wash) Observer have created a new religion that would make a Luddite shudder. It has come to our attention that the Spellchecker is a much wiser judge of character than ourselves. When it doesn't recognize one of the local Finnish names, it suggests, instead a word that often describes the individual in question. For example: City councilor Fritts often has Fits.

Teeth, scalps and shrunken heads being illegal even in Texas, those wishing to celebrate the closing of the Houston Post must settle for a festive set of 12-ounce drinking glasses ($10.76 to Houston Chronicle employees, according to an office flyer) decorated with the Post's last front page.  LETTER TO THE COPYBOY. ``I think it is quite a feat on Bruno Mosconi's part to have captured only one set of mammary protuberances in his Italy beach shot. He must have waited for hours for all those unclad bosoms to move out of his frame. Or he is a real Photoshop wiz and he painted clothes on them. The topless rate for Italy runs around at least 25 percent these days (female topless that is).'' That's the testimony of Jan Dreier (jdreier (at) primenet.com), U.S. correspondent for Focus Magazine.  Which explains not only Bruno's AP shot last week, which made it into at least one major midwestern font of knowledge, but why the guys doing the electricals on Italian auto assembly lines can't keep their minds on their work.  THE E&AMP;P WEAR INDEX. The average age of journalists listed in Editor &AMP; Publisher's July 22 obituaries was 69.3, a plunge of 8.34 since June 27.  STYLE NOTE. Michael Crew (m.crew (at) bbcnc.org.uk) advises from Blighty: ``U.S. readers checking the British Press during our long hot dry spell please note that frequent mention of the NRA refers to the National Rivers Authority.'' Yes, Mike, thanks. And British readers checking the Yank press during our own long hot spell please note that frequent mention of the NRA refers to the National Rifle Association, that quasi-crackers leader of the oppressed-frontiersman industry that sends ringers to pose as congressional investigators.  THE GENERAL MAYHEM INDEX. Old BONG hand Doug Pizzi (doug.pizzi (at) Wizardsbbs.com) recalls: ``I saw the bit about journalists' obits (BONG 333) and couldn't help thinking about an index I had proposed when I worked in lovely Lowell, Mass., for the so called ``dog days'' of summer.  ``It was based on a number of factors, including temperature, humidity, phase of the moon, liquor store and power tool sales. It was called ``Propensity to Stab,'' with ``Stab'' serving as a generic term for general mutilation and mayhem, including, of course, gunplay.  ``Based on a scale of 1-10, for instance, on a day in the 90s, with high humidity, approaching a full moon, and high sales of booze and tools (As in: Overheard in the checkout line at Doug's Booze n'Tools, `Excuse me! I'll have this bottle of tequila and this chain saw!'), the PTS would be rougly an 8. Of course, after several days of like conditions, the PTS (No matter how hard I tried, I could not anger the PC gods by making the acronym come out PMS and still make sense.) would climb. The graphics possibilities still make me shudder.  ``Needless to say, in spite of my offer to personally gather the retail statistics, the idea never really got in the ground, so to speak. And what have we now? A useless U.V. index. I'd much rather know my chances of getting stuck like a pig than my chances of getting skin cancer 40 years from now. But hey, that's me.''  AND YET ANOTHER PEJORATIVE. From an occasionally reliable source:  ``A number of years ago, the San Jose Mercury News was widely criticized for minimal coverage of the heavily Hispanic east side of the city and for an obvious lack of Hispanics on the staff. The paper came to be known in certain circles as the `Sans Jose Mercury News.' The staff even put out a parody under that title. Things are much better now, however.''  IN BENGOUGH, SASKATCHEWAN, NEARLY EVERYBODY READS the Big Muddy Roundup.  THOSE OLD SPELLCHECKER BLUES. If you let a robot into your newsroom, you have to be ready for robotic results. So it is with spelling checkers, especially the kind that go ahead and ``fix'' your spelling if you don't tell them to cool it and get back in the box.  Edward Hunt (73774.3122 (at) compuserve.com) know. He writes: ``We at the Chinook (wash) Observer have created a new religion that would make a Luddite shudder. It has come to our attention that the Spellchecker is a much wiser judge of character than ourselves. When it doesn't recognize one of the local Finnish names, it suggests, instead a word that often describes the individual in question. For example: City councilor Fritts often has Fits. Police chief Baze is usually in a Haze. County commissioner Kaino comes out Cain (as in slew his brother Abel). Gov. Lowry comes out Lower (which he seems to ever be sinking) or Lowly (as in worm). A different spelling of Lowery used by a guy more local comes out out Flowery. OK, so I can't think of any funny examples right now.'' Funny enough, Ed. An antique Hendrix editing system at the Dayton Daily News used to insert mysterious exclamation points in copy, and they almost always made sense on a bizarre level. ``I'm not!a crook,'' and ``Vice officers found four male strippers dancing nude!in the club,'' that sort of thing. In the ninth year of its five-year warranty, the hated Hendrix went to the students of the University of Dayton, where a mysterious fire destroyed it and a couple of floors of Old Main.  CASTING CALL. Ed Hunt also ventures, ``I'm sure by now you are getting hell for your portrait gracing the pages of E&AMP;P this month. Strange you're the only one there that looks like he works at a newspaper. And I personally think Nick Nolte should play you in the BONG movie. Does he still drink?'' Flattered, we're sure. But the Chief Copyboy would not enjoy being portrayed by Nick, no matter how striking the resemblance, until he announces that yes he does drink and it was the elixirs of confusion that made him consent to star in that shamefully hollow effigy of a newspaper movie, ``I Love Trouble.''  THE SAPPER FACING THE CYBER-BUNKERS OF EMPIRE. Former Unipresser Dinty Moore -- his real name -- has a great book coming out next month about the Internet. Having trolled through on-line sex, flame wars, newsgroup agonies and therapies, global e-mail and the rest, Moore concludes that Thoreauphiles have nothing to fear from the new computer medium. As serious journalists know, content is the miracle, not the gibberish to get to it. Huzzahs with oak leaf clusters to the selfless forager Dinty.

Three stories for Aug. 13, the final installments in Chuck Glover's weekly re-telling of World War II 50 years ago, also were transmitted Monday:  WW2-0813-END _ Two Mitsubishi bombers, painted white and marked with green crosses, take off from Tokyo in the early morning darkness of Aug. 19, 1945. As they approach Okinawa, U.S. P-38 fighter planes rise to challenge them.  WW2-0813-COST _ No one will ever know the exact number of deaths and broken lives caused by World War II.  WW2-0813-GLOVER _ Today's episode concludes Charles E. Glover's weekly accounts of America's involvement in World War II.  INTERNATIONAL  VJ-ASIA _ SHANGHAI, China _ Fifty years after World War II, the world teeters uneasily on the cusp of the Pacific Century, an era that promises an epochal shift in the global center of gravity, with vast wealth and influence flowing eastward from Europe to the diverse lands and explosive economies of the Pacific Rim. China is in rapid transition from an impoverished and backward land to a new economic superpower whose rising political assertiveness and military might post a growing challenge to U.S. influence in the world's most populous and dynamic region. Other challenges are mounting from Japan, Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and elsewhere across East Asia, where nations once ravaged by war have risen to become Washington's economic and strategic rivals. (Deans 850&AMP;insert-add).  VJ-JAPAN _ TOKYO _ Ever so slowly, Japan's postwar generation is beginning to grapple with the death, misery and destruction this country inflicted during World War II. Even a half century later, though, problems remain. In trying to comprehend Japan's wartime behavior, younger Japanese are up against three interrelated impediments. First, an education system that's only beginning to acknowledge Japan's wartime offenses. Second, a government that has yet to apologize for atrocities committed in the name of Emperor Hirohito. And third, a broad cultural aversion to frank discussion of unpleasant matters. (Deans-800&AMP;add).  VJ-DATA _ Population and per capita income data about Asian countries for a graphic to accompany VJ-ASIA.  EDs: Package first MOVED Thursday and Friday, Aug. 3-4. Resent on Monday, Aug. 7.  US-VIETNAM _ HANOI, Vietnam _ In the crumbling but stately elegance of Hanoi's 84-year-old Opera House, and American visitor needs little prompting from a Vietnamese friend to understand a recent ballet. It depicts wartime suffering and renewal. Without papering over its painful past, Vietnam is looking toward a bright future, and embracing Americans as partners, not foes. (Deans 600).  WASHINGTON  POLITICS (Washington) _ Making sense out of the politics behind (and in front of) welfare reform. (Shepard).  UWSA-CONFERENCE _ DALLAS, Texas _ Texas billionaire Ross Perot says he would rather have brain surgery than be involved in politics. So why is he renting a hall for nearly every major politician in American to come talk for two days to his followers? Well, that's Ross Perot, as quirky as ever. But his United We Stand Association issues conference is the political event of the summer, and it is likely to produce clues galore as to whether Perot himself will run for president again next year or whether he's auditioning for the role of emcee for the 1996 campaign. (Shepard).  EDs: Coverage by Cox Washington Bureau Political Correspondent Scott Shepard will begin on Friday, Aug. 11, and continue through Sunday, Aug. 13.  NATIONAL  AUS-BEGALA-CLINTON _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Through 47 states, Gennifer Flowers, Ross Perot's revolving-door candidacy and assorted other political storms, Paul Begala was near the tiller in 1992 as Bill Clinton steered an improbable course to the White House. But next year, as Clinton seeks the sometimes-elusive four more years, Begala will be gone. The political wunderkind who helped move Clinton to Washington is returning to Austin, his adopted home, to consult, write and teach. Most importantly, he says, he will be doing the daddy thing.``It was a terrible choice, but I don't think you can ever make a mistake when you choose family over career,'' said Begala, 34. ``I love Bill Clinton and I totally support what he stands for, but I am totally confident that any competent political consultant can guide him to re-election. Nobody else can be a daddy to my kids.'' (Herman 1040).  EDs: MOVED Wednesday. Photo, COX8, MOVED overnight Tuesday.  AUS-RICH-VISA _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Immigrants wait for years for visas to enter the United States but folks who are rich, can go to the top of the line. If you are willing to invest $1 million and hire five people, you can get an investor visa and eventually, U.S. citizenship. There has been at least one taker in Central Texas, a Lebanese who lives in Austin and bought IHOP franchises in San Antonio and New Braunfels. In Dallas, a group of Taiwanese investors are building a nursing home. Congress is now debating reducing that million to $500,000 but opponents say they are selling citizenship. (Kay).  EDs: MOVED Wednesday.  PBP-GOP-DELEGATES _ Republican presidential hopefuls are using phone banks, direct mail and personal appearances in an intense campaign to win support among delegates to the state's GOP convention _ Presidency III _ in November. Last week, state party officials are announced that more than 11,000 Republicans applied to become delegates by the July 31 deadline. Next month, each county will hold a caucus and randomly pull names from a box to whittle that number to 2,800. Another 700 ``automatic'' delegates will be comprised of state and local party leaders, elected officials and major party donors. ``Those 3,500 people are going to be the most sought after Republicans in Florida,'' said Richard Pinsky, who has been hired by Kansas Sen. Bob Dole for the convention campaign. The GOP candidates hope a win at the convention will give them the same boost that Florida's state Democratic convention gave President Clinton in 1991: Credibility and lots of national media attention. (Crowley 850).  EDs: MOVED Wednesday.  PBP-IMMIGRANT-HAVEN _ INDIANTOWN, Fla. _ More Central American immigrants are working without documents or are using fake work permits because of a federal policy reversal that denies work authorization for political asylum applicants. The change is making farmworker communities such as Indiantown less of a sanctuary for Guatemalans and other immigrants. It also could shrink the agricultural labor force if deportation sweeps are the next step. Before the policy change took effect Jan. 4, immigrants who filled out an asylum claim could qualify for a work permit. They also could rely on permit renewals year after year because their cases were among a backlog of 70,000 at the Miami Asylum Office. ``The people were using the system to get work permits,'' said Erich Cauller, director of the Miami office, which covers Florida. ``It was a very generous policy.'' Now, however, immigrants must wait until they're granted political asylum before they can be issued work permits. If they've waited five months without a ruling on their cases, they can apply for temporary work permits. (Douthat).  EDs: MOVED Wednesday. Photos, COX6-COX7, MOVED overnight Tuesday.

Times News Service  ITALIAN PARLIAMENT URGED TO AMEND RAPE LAW  ROME (NYT) _ After a summer marked by a rash of violent sexual crimes, Italy's Prime Minister Lamberto Dini this week urged Parliament to amend a 1936 law that defines rape as an offence against public morality, rather than an act of violence against individuals.  ``Painful events of the past days have revealed a serious recurrence of crimes against sexual freedom, often against minors,'' said Dini, calling for a ''rapid and efficient response'' to this latest wave of sexual violence.  Adopted during the Fascist era when as one feminist said, ''women didn't count for much,'' Italy's weak rape law has been debated in Parliament on and off for 16 years. The legalistic crossfire, which has dragged on even after 200,000 women this spring signed a petition calling for a new law, has meant that convicted rapists continue to get off easy, with minimal sentences that are often reduced during plea bargaining.  Dini's call to action _ a rare break in the silence that generally descends on Italian politics during the month of August _ echoed the alarm raised by several gruesome cases of sexual abuse, including a string of rapes committed against young women as they were leaving discotheques.  SERB REFUGEES TRAPPED, LARGELY FORGOTTEN, AND UNWANTED  KRNJAK, Croatia (NYT) _ While the world and aid agencies focused on the exodus of tens of thousands of Serbs from this region over the past few days, a few miles from here, 30,000 refugees are trapped, largely forgotten, and unwanted.  They are Bosnian Muslims, who fled into Croatia last week to escape the fighting in the Bihac enclave. The Croatian government doesn't want them to stay here, and has blocked aid agencies from helping them.  Since they are followers with a rebel Muslim warlord who was fighting against the Bosnia government, there is a question whether Bosnia will allow them to go home, or how they will be treated if they do.  EUROPEAN OFFICIALS DISCUSS DIVISION OF BOSNIA  PARIS (NYT) _ European officials said Friday that adjustments in the terms of an international proposal to settle the war in Bosnia by dividing the country between between its Muslims, Croats and Serbs were under discussion in consultations among American, European and Russian diplomats this week.  White House National Security Adviser Anthony Lake and Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff talked privately here Friday with French officials after seeing their German counterparts in Bonn and British officials in London on Thursday, and will consult with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev over the weekend at the Black Sea resort of Sochi.  They will also be going to Rome and Madrid before returning to Washington. So far, neither the American emissaries nor their European discussion partners have disclosed any details of what was under discussion.  But European officials acknowledged that their own diplomacy had taken a back seat to American and Russian attempts to redefine a common approach on new diplomatic steps to deal with the changes on the battlefield in Bosnia and Croatia during the past month.  ARAB OFFICIALS SAY IRAQ DEFECTIONS MAY NOT MEAN IMMINENT FALL OF REGIME  AMMAN (NYT) _ While seen as a potential intelligence bonanza for the West and another indication of the shrinking domestic power base of President Saddam Hussein, Arab officials here cautioned Friday the defection of Iraq's chief arm procurement planner to Jordan should not be viewed as signalling an immiment fall of the regime they have come to know well.  There was no disagreement among Jordanian and Arab officials here over the only remark made by the defector since his escape to Jordan who reportedly asserted to his hosts ''the regime in Iraq has lost its credibility internationally and in the Arab world'' and that its policies have become wobbly.  But these officials poured cold water over the other assertion of the 37-year-old Iraqi official, Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel _ who has for a decade occupied a most sensitive position in arms procurement and wed Saddam Hussein's eldest daughter _ suggesting he and other Iraqis can undertake an effort to bring ''a change in the situation in Iraq''.  Instead, the dominant feeling was that Saddam Hussein's son-in-law has been such an integral part of the regime's repressive machinery for so long a time that he could not garner support among Iraqis. Kamel, like so many other close aides of the Iraqi president, lacks an internal power base because he drew virtually all of his influence from closeness to the Iraqi president, who has now pushed him aside provoking his defection this week.  PERES, ARAFAT ANNOUNCE AGREEMENT ON SEVERAL ISSUES  JERUSALEM (NYT) _ After five days of exhaustive negotiations, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Friday announced agreements on all but the thorniest issues of a plan to transfer control over parts of the West Bank to the Arabs.  The major issue on which the negotiators remain divided is security in the West Bank town of Hebron, which is sacred to both Jews and Moslems, and where 400 Israelis maintain a stubborn presence among 100,000 Arabs. The town is also a stronghold of the militant Islamic movement Hamas, and has been the site of violent clashes.  While Israel has agreed to turn control of other major West Bank towns to the Palestinians in advance of West Bank elections, they have insisted on maintaining police to protect the Hebron settlers.  Various compromise proposals have been considered, but the agreement initialled Friday said negotiations on Hebron would resume Monday. Neither Peres nor Arafat would venture when a full agreement might be concluded. ``None of us wants to be prophets,'' an exhausted Peres told reporters.  On another major obstacle, the question of water rights in the West Bank, Peres and Afarat talked by telephone with United States Secretary of State Warren Christopher and it was decided to set up a trilateral commission to explore solutions to this and other economic questions.  The remaining questions still to be resolved are specific numbers and dates, but these would likely fall in place once the plight of Hebron was resolved.  DEBATE IN ISRAEL ON LIMITS OF LEGITIMATE DISSENT  JERUSALEM (NYT) _ A wave of demonstrations by Jewish settlers and their supporters, who have camped on West Bank hills and blocked Israeli highways to protest the planned expansion of Palestinian self-rule, has sharpened a debate on the limits of legitimate dissent.  The government calls the actions dangerous assaults on law and order, while the settlers say they are following a democratic tradition of nonviolent civil disobedience.  As Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization approach an agreement on the withdrawal of the Israeli military from areas in the West Bank and the holding of Palestinian elections, the settlers have vowed to step up their protests.  But Police Minister Moshe Shahal said the settlers were planning ``a civil rebellion'' that could end in bloodshed, and he said that swift action would be taken against lawbreakers. ``It is inconceivable that a state should stand idly by in the face of people who say they want to destroy it and create anarchy,'' he told Israel Radio.  Justice Minister David Libai said a Cabinet subcommittee on law enforcement would meet on Sunday to discuss the problem. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950811.0238 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-STATES-BUDGET THIS IS THE STATES NEWS SERVICE BUDGET FOR) </DATELINE> <TEXT> AUGUST 11, 1995.

Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., elected largely because of women's issues in 1994, explains why she wants public hearings on sexual misconduct allegations against Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore. Phinney  ALABAMA -- PACKWOOD. Alabama Sens. Howell Heflin and Richard Shelby are still divided over whether Sen. Bob Packwood's ethics violations warrant a public hearing, despite new allegations that the Oregon Republican made unwanted advances toward a 17-year-old intern in 1983. Weiner  ALASKA -- PACKWOOD. Despite new allegations of sexual misconduct by Sen. Bob Packwood -- one involving a minor -- Alaska Republican Sens. Ted Stevens and Frank Murkowski would again vote against public hearings. Stoddard  CALIFORNIA -- XXXX  COLORADO -- PACKWOOD. Both Colorado senators voted against public hearings on sexual harassment charges against Sen. Bob Packwood. Will recent charges involving a 17-year-old change their mind? Angwin  CONNECTICUT -- WEICKER. Former Gov. Lowell P. Weicker isn't going to Dallas for Ross Perot's United We Stand convention because Perot wants to ``strengthen a two-party system that I think needs to be challenged.'' Weicker and associates are heartened by a bevy of new polls suggesting more Americans than ever are looking for a centrist independent challenge in 1996. Daley  -- PACKWOOD. Sens. Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman say they'll continue to support public hearings on sexual misconduct charges against Sen. Bob Packwood, despite new allegations that the Oregon Republican made unwanted advances toward a 17-year-old intern in 1983. Chipman  -- LIEBERMAN.

Cohen is keeping mum, issuing just a three-sentence statement. Kane  MARYLAND -- Project for Baltimore. (Working). Angwin  MASSACHUSETTS -- WELD. Gov. William Weld endorses Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole's welfare reform proposal, saying it would allow Massachusetts to enact tough welfare reform. Kvaal  -- WOODS. Sen.

LETTER TO THE COPYBOY. ``I think it is quite a feat on Bruno Mosconi's part to have captured only one set of mammary protuberances in his Italy beach shot.

THE E&AMP;P WEAR INDEX. The average age of journalists listed in Editor &AMP; Publisher's July 22 obituaries was 69.3, a plunge of 8.34 since June 27.  STYLE NOTE. Michael Crew (m.crew (at) bbcnc.org.uk) advises from Blighty: ``U.S. readers checking the British Press during our long hot dry spell please note that frequent mention of the NRA refers to the National Rivers Authority.'' Yes, Mike, thanks. And British readers checking the Yank press during our own long hot spell please note that frequent mention of the NRA refers to the National Rifle Association, that quasi-crackers leader of the oppressed-frontiersman industry that sends ringers to pose as congressional investigators.  THE GENERAL MAYHEM INDEX. Old BONG hand Doug Pizzi (doug.pizzi (at) Wizardsbbs.com) recalls: ``I saw the bit about journalists' obits (BONG 333) and couldn't help thinking about an index I had proposed when I worked in lovely Lowell, Mass., for the so called ``dog days'' of summer.  ``It was based on a number of factors, including temperature, humidity, phase of the moon, liquor store and power tool sales. It was called ``Propensity to Stab,'' with ``Stab'' serving as a generic term for general mutilation and mayhem, including, of course, gunplay.  ``Based on a scale of 1-10, for instance, on a day in the 90s, with high humidity, approaching a full moon, and high sales of booze and tools (As in: Overheard in the checkout line at Doug's Booze n'Tools, `Excuse me! I'll have this bottle of tequila and this chain saw!'), the PTS would be rougly an 8. Of course, after several days of like conditions, the PTS (No matter how hard I tried, I could not anger the PC gods by making the acronym come out PMS and still make sense.) would climb. The graphics possibilities still make me shudder.  ``Needless to say, in spite of my offer to personally gather the retail statistics, the idea never really got in the ground, so to speak. And what have we now? A useless U.V. index. I'd much rather know my chances of getting stuck like a pig than my chances of getting skin cancer 40 years from now. But hey, that's me.''  AND YET ANOTHER PEJORATIVE. From an occasionally reliable source:  ``A number of years ago, the San Jose Mercury News was widely criticized for minimal coverage of the heavily Hispanic east side of the city and for an obvious lack of Hispanics on the staff. The paper came to be known in certain circles as the `Sans Jose Mercury News.' The staff even put out a parody under that title. Things are much better now, however.''  IN BENGOUGH, SASKATCHEWAN, NEARLY EVERYBODY READS the Big Muddy Roundup.  THOSE OLD SPELLCHECKER BLUES. If you let a robot into your newsroom, you have to be ready for robotic results. So it is with spelling checkers, especially the kind that go ahead and ``fix'' your spelling if you don't tell them to cool it and get back in the box.  Edward Hunt (73774.3122 (at) compuserve.com) know. He writes: ``We at the Chinook (wash) Observer have created a new religion that would make a Luddite shudder. It has come to our attention that the Spellchecker is a much wiser judge of character than ourselves. When it doesn't recognize one of the local Finnish names, it suggests, instead a word that often describes the individual in question. For example: City councilor Fritts often has Fits. Police chief Baze is usually in a Haze. County commissioner Kaino comes out Cain (as in slew his brother Abel). Gov. Lowry comes out Lower (which he seems to ever be sinking) or Lowly (as in worm). A different spelling of Lowery used by a guy more local comes out out Flowery. OK, so I can't think of any funny examples right now.'' Funny enough, Ed. An antique Hendrix editing system at the Dayton Daily News used to insert mysterious exclamation points in copy, and they almost always made sense on a bizarre level. ``I'm not!a crook,'' and ``Vice officers found four male strippers dancing nude!in the club,'' that sort of thing. In the ninth year of its five-year warranty, the hated Hendrix went to the students of the University of Dayton, where a mysterious fire destroyed it and a couple of floors of Old Main.  CASTING CALL. Ed Hunt also ventures, ``I'm sure by now you are getting hell for your portrait gracing the pages of E&AMP;P this month. Strange you're the only one there that looks like he works at a newspaper. And I personally think Nick Nolte should play you in the BONG movie. Does he still drink?'' Flattered, we're sure. But the Chief Copyboy would not enjoy being portrayed by Nick, no matter how striking the resemblance, until he announces that yes he does drink and it was the elixirs of confusion that made him consent to star in that shamefully hollow effigy of a newspaper movie, ``I Love Trouble.''  THE SAPPER FACING THE CYBER-BUNKERS OF EMPIRE. Former Unipresser Dinty Moore -- his real name -- has a great book coming out next month about the Internet. Having trolled through on-line sex, flame wars, newsgroup agonies and therapies, global e-mail and the rest, Moore concludes that Thoreauphiles have nothing to fear from the new computer medium. As serious journalists know, content is the miracle, not the gibberish to get to it. Huzzahs with oak leaf clusters to the selfless forager Dinty.

THE GENERAL MAYHEM INDEX. Old BONG hand Doug Pizzi (doug.pizzi (at) Wizardsbbs.com) recalls: ``I saw the bit about journalists' obits (BONG 333) and couldn't help thinking about an index I had proposed when I worked in lovely Lowell, Mass., for the so called ``dog days'' of summer.  ``It was based on a number of factors, including temperature, humidity, phase of the moon, liquor store and power tool sales. It was called ``Propensity to Stab,'' with ``Stab'' serving as a generic term for general mutilation and mayhem, including, of course, gunplay.  ``Based on a scale of 1-10, for instance, on a day in the 90s, with high humidity, approaching a full moon, and high sales of booze and tools (As in: Overheard in the checkout line at Doug's Booze n'Tools, `Excuse me! I'll have this bottle of tequila and this chain saw!'), the PTS would be rougly an 8. Of course, after several days of like conditions, the PTS (No matter how hard I tried, I could not anger the PC gods by making the acronym come out PMS and still make sense.) would climb. The graphics possibilities still make me shudder.  ``Needless to say, in spite of my offer to personally gather the retail statistics, the idea never really got in the ground, so to speak.

It has come to our attention that the Spellchecker is a much wiser judge of character than ourselves. When it doesn't recognize one of the local Finnish names, it suggests, instead a word that often describes the individual in question. For example: City councilor Fritts often has Fits. Police chief Baze is usually in a Haze. County commissioner Kaino comes out Cain (as in slew his brother Abel). Gov. Lowry comes out Lower (which he seems to ever be sinking) or Lowly (as in worm).

Surely, he suggests, similar cases of two plus two equaling five are possible in the union of computers and camcorders, or PCs and pagers, that Sony intends to orchestrate. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"

The closer economists get to the corridors of power, he suggests, the more they are influenced by careerism and ideology. And in straying ever further from the more objective standards of science, they have left themselves open to the public's view of them as experts for sale. ``We are self-immolating as a profession,'' he concludes. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960117.0628 type=story > <HEADLINE> ADVERTISING: TURNING UP STEAM GETS MESSAGE ACROSS IN TIMES SQUARE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> NEW YORK (BC-TIMES-SQUARE-ADS-MEDIA-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"

After all, it is hard to argue that Iraq is going to strike us in hours or days when Saddam Hussein has possessed chemical and biological weapons for years, and the British said this week that he is two to five years from having a nuclear device.

And with 13 artists of varying backgrounds and abilities assigned pages in Akbar's book, a range of individual voices was all but inevitable. And that's what we find. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"161413"	"he"	"suggests"	" Appiah also argues that cosmopolitanism is far different from the universalism of Islamic fundamentalism, which he calls a malign universalism. In fact, universalism, he suggests, has often led into dark and unsavory realms, even in the Age of Enlightenment: he cites Edmund Burke's chastisement of Rousseau, for example, whose five children were summarily tossed into orphanages: A lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred. There are dangers in universalism and dangers too in its sweeping claims, perhaps as many as there are in the kind of narrow allegiance to kith and kin that Appiah also criticizes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"161414"	"he"	"suggests"	" We are always partial to those closest to us, he notes, loyal to connections of nation, clan, family. These impulses pull inward, denying any universalism other than an expansion of our own vision. They may be supplemented, he suggests, but they cannot be ignored. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"165348"	"he"	"suggests"	" Otherwise, he suggests, they will end up in the collective cultural backwash just like the dodo. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"165652"	"he"	"suggests"	" Thus, he suggests, the new, steeper temperature difference between warm and cold air in the upper atmosphere generates turbulent up-and-down winds that repeat the hail-formation process, without a thunderstorm. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"167631"	"he"	"suggests"	" But Lutz does not really want to overturn the table on the slackers. They arise in force, he suggests, whenever there are major social changes taking place. They are also clowns and jesters, who reveal the illusions we cherish about the work we do. They are the counterforce against which workers must contend, sometimes even within themselves. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"167758"	"he"	"suggests"	" His most dismissive words are reserved for President Bush, but he doesn't really see that much difference between Bush and Bill Clinton; Clinton's imperialism, he suggests, would simply have been a kinder, gentler sort. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"168147"	"he"	"suggests"	" But, as Jones points out, high-tech equipment and the like are less than completely effective in preventing terrorism. In fact, he suggests, Some kind of terrorist attack is inevitable. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"168716"	"it"	"suggests"	" The report also suggests that the new Allston campus be made into a center for science education and reaching out into the community. Harvard's science museums could be moved there, it suggests, as well as the Graduate School of Education. And the university should increase its efforts in local public schools and in working more generally on finding ways of improving the nation's science curriculum. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"

For the latest photos and graphics from The New York Times, go to www.nytimages.com.  CULTURE AND ENTERTAINMENT (e code)  GERMANY-GRASS (Paris) -- Reaction to the disclosure by Guenter Grass, the Nobel Prize winning novelist, that he was drafted into the German SS at the end of World War II. By Alan Riding.  With photo.  AGUILERA-MUSIC (Undated) -- On Christina Aguilera, who has a new album, Back to Basics. It represents an example of the changing relationship between pop stars and fans and producers; for musical and economic and Web-related reasons, big stars seem smaller than ever. By Kelefa Sanneh.  NY-LIBRARY (New York) -- For decades, the books in the New York Public Library's Rose Main Reading Room have been shelved according to an obscure idiosyncratic classification system hard for the average patron to make sense of. With libraries in general moving toward staff reductions, the New York library is taking the leap toward standardization, reshelving the 38,000 books in the reading room according to the Library of Congress system. By Sewell Chan.  LATE-CONCERTS (New York) -- A Critic's Notebook on late-night concerts. By Anthony Tommasini.  TV-EXODUS (Undated) -- Felicia R. Lee writes about Simcha Jacobovici, director and producer of The History Channel documentary Exodus Decoded, being shown this weekend. The documentary already has aired in Israel, where it caused controversy for its various claims.  ROCKY-FILM-REVIEW (Undated) -- Nathan Lee reviews Rocky Road to Dublin, directed by Peter Lennon.  WAKE-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) -- In the Wake, by Per Petterson (Thomas Dunne Books). Reviewed by S. Kirk Walsh.  HOUSE AND HOME (l code)  HAPPINESS-BY-DESIGN (New York) -- In last decade, the social sciences have become increasingly focused on happiness and what accounts for it, and over the past several months the rest of the culture has been catching up. The best-attended course at Harvard last semester was Positive Psych, an introduction to a new field of psychology that eschews the traditional approach of focusing on pathologies in favor of studying the sources of happiness. And this fall, the best-selling British philosopher Alain de Botton will publish The Architecture of Happiness in the United States, arguing that physical environment is a crucial contributor to well being. (He will also be the host of a coming PBS documentary series based on the book.) Like it or not, he suggests, the spaces we live in shape our sense of happiness and of self, so we'd better chose them very carefully. Even before this vogue took hold in America, however, a small but influential group of East Coast decorators were exploring the same issues, and advancing a theory of their own, that a maximalist, high-contrast, color-saturated approach to interiors may be the secret to happiness. By Dan Shaw.  With photo.  RUSSIA-HOUSE (Moscow) -- A look at the fight over an internationally acclaimed constructivist masterpiece built in 1929 by Konstantin Melnikov, the Soviet architect and painter. According to Barry Bergdoll, a professor of architectural history at Columbia University and the recently appointed chief curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art, the house is one of the most important house designs of 1920's modernism. By Christopher Mason.  With photo.  CANADA-COTTAGES (Haliburton, Ontario) -- Regardless of the size or style, whether mansion or rustic cabin, Canadians call their weekend houses cottages. On Friday nights, during the rush toward cottage country in eastern Ontario, northbound Highway 400 out of Toronto can be as choked with traffic as the Long Island Expressway. Stephen Grant, a partner at a white-shoe law firm in Toronto, wanted no part of cottage culture. But when he married Sandra Forbes, also a lawyer, in 1999, he had no choice in the matter. I learned we were going to become cottagers pretty much the day after our wedding, Grant said. By Raul A. Barreneche.  GARDEN-Q&amp;A (Undated) -- Garden questions answered. By Leslie Land.  LAYERS-FASHION (Undated) -- For fall, designers are piling on the layers: oversize knits, flannels, leg warmers, long scarves, echoes of grunge. We show you how to work the look. By Cathy Horyn.  With photo.  BEAT-FASHION (Undated) -- The beat look -- turtlenecks, cigarette pants, leggings, berets -- returns. By Ruth La Ferla.  With photo.  UGLY-FASHION (Undated) -- The coolest fall accessories, especially shoes, are the ugliest and the furthest from the classic Sex in the City Manolo stilettos. Fall may be about individuality, but it is also about not dressing for men. It's very urban and a touch aggressive. By Ginia Bellafante.  With photo.  EYEBROWS (Undated) -- Toss the tweezers. Big eyebrows are back. The weekly skin feature by Natasha Singer.  With photo.  ONLINE-SHOPPING (Undated) -- The pros and cons of buying student instruments online vs. a local music store. The weekly feature by Michelle Slatalla.  For information and repeats call the News Service at (888) 346-9867 or (212) 556-1927.

"169583"	"he"	"suggests"	" And in the fall The Architecture of Happiness, by the philosopher Alain de Botton, who lives in England, will be published in the United States. In it he argues that physical environment is a crucial contributor to well-being. Like it or not, he suggests, the spaces we live in shape our sense of happiness and of self, so we had better choose them carefully. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"170840"	"she"	"suggests"	" Obviously, with the success of certain serialized shows, there is a willingness on our part to embrace it, admits CBS Entertainment president Nina Tassler. But, she suggests, I don't think audiences make a decision to commit to a show, one way or the other, based on it being serialized or not. It's purely about the quality. If they like it and the show is good, they'll continue to watch. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"172634"	"he"	"suggests"	" Some of the pieces of Babel are attached to one another by the banal lingua franca of television images, as events in North Africa, for instance, make the evening news in Tokyo. But Gonzalez Inarritu's own visual grammar tries to go deeper, to suggest a common idiom of emotion present in certain immediately recognizable gestures and expressions. We may not be able to read minds or decipher words, he suggests, but we can surely decode faces, especially when we see them at close range and in distress. Loss, fear, pain, anguish -- none of these emotions, it seems, are likely to be lost in translation. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"173882"	"she"	"suggests"	" Another possible blunder: trying to hide a less-than-firm neck with high collars and turtlenecks. Guess where all the skin collects? Wilder says. Instead, she suggests, play up your shoulders. They're one of the best features for everyone, no matter what size. An off-the-shoulder look, open to the tips of your shoulders, across the collarbone, is a great look. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"174033"	"he"	"suggests"	" But Osborne has profound doubts about his subject. His title might well have been followed by a question mark. At every point along the familiar trail of artistic achievement, scientific breakthrough and economic transformation, he stops to probe, often painfully, and to ask awkward questions. Greek philosophy, he suggests, may have planted the seeds of later disasters by equating abstraction -- teasing out the universals, the constants, the invariables from among the clamor and noise of the real world -- with clarity of thought. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
