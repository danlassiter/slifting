To do otherwise, he maintains, would be to buy into a corrupt system that holds an Irishman guilty until proven innocent, not just of terrorism but of shiftlessness and drunkenness as well. The climate in the boardinghouse grows increasingly poisonous and the threat of violence mounts. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199410.gz"

In his newly published, cheeky (without the tongue in it) book ``Eat Fat'' (Pantheon, $24), Richard Klein, a somewhat corpulent Cornell University French professor, strives to reintroduce body fat as esthetically desirable to a society that now deplores every inch that can be pinched.

A number of the massacres and atrocities reported on television with bodies on display, it maintains, were shrewdly planned illusions concocted by the Bosnian Muslims to inflame international opinion against the Serbs.

His early work on Hill and the Clintons was well-meaning, he maintains, if born of greed and ambition and hopelessly flawed because of his ignorance of journalistic standards. Though there are indications here that he dumped the right-wingers because they moved on to more novel character assassins _ such as Internet gossip Matt Drudge and FBI tattler Gary Aldrich _ Brock says his transformation was triggered by the growing ``sexual McCarthyism'' of the ``movement'' and, in an epiphanic moment like Saul's on the road to Damascus, by the private admission from his patrons in the conservative camp that Thomas may indeed have been a sexual harasser. The Arkansas state troopers who trashed the Clintons were liars, Brock now says, and if Jones had any sexual encounter with Bill Clinton, it was probably as an eager participant. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"

Both ideologies, he maintains, derived legitimacy and passion from the cult of science. Germany would triumph because, in the Darwinian struggle for supremacy, the strong are destined to crush the weak. The Soviet Union marched forward into the future supremely confident that the iron laws of history and economics were on its side.
