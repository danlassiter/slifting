And no doubt MDC vehicles are being repainted today with the logo of the state Highway Department, which is to take over the MDC's road and bridge operations. ``Massachusetts,'' says Weld, ``doesn't need two different agencies performing identical functions.''

"72203"	"we"	"assume"	" Skinny: There is a general belief around the NBA that the Mavericks have to get rid of Jimmy Jackson, so ruinous is the relationship with Jason Kidd over the girlfriend. So far, that hasn't happened and unless Dallas will take Dee Brown, it probably won't. What you have here is an intriguing mix that could be very good or could be the Bridge over the River Kwai right after Alec Guinness falls on the transformer. That's what it has come down to: two outrageously talented players who are feuding over a girl and can't put it behind them on the floor. Wonder what Red Holzman (or a vintage Red Auerbach) would say about that? Still, the questions are everywhere. Will Kidd and Jackson be able to coexist? Will Jamal Mashburn be healthy? (He missed 64 games last year.) Will Montross be comfortable and play like he did as a rookie? The addition of Harper could be huge, for he is a classy veteran who can tell the young punks a thing or two about Decorum 101. He also will be able to give Kidd some solid backup minutes and, we assume, will not object to passing to Jackson. This team's biggest problem is in the mirror. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"

By Sept. 11, they will be joined by three other cameras rigged to do the same.  They will all keep taking pictures _ 288 a day _ for at least the next seven years.  The planned result is an extraordinary historical record of the rebirth of the World Trade Center site, one that the effort's sponsors hope will be displayed continuously at a museum, perhaps even one that emerges on the site itself.  Each camera will produce roughly 790,000 images over seven years, but the resulting film presentation, which the producers would like to show in a room framed by six screens that would be in continuous use, would be about 20 minutes long, thanks to the time-lapse photography.  The project is the work of a Hollywood executive, an officer of a New York pharmaceutical company, a Wall Street money manager and several of their friends who have obtained the endorsement of the state, the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. and the owners of the buildings now bedecked with their cameras, which are each encased in steel-reinforced wooden sheds about the size of a movie theater ticket booth.  ``It would be so easy to miss this as it's happening,'' said David Solomon, the pharmaceutical executive and co-producer of the project, in a telephone interview from Los Angeles. ``This whole process of healing and rebuilding and reconstructing is something that we might discover, 10 years from now, has kind of happened without our paying attention to it. But in retrospect, it may turn out to be as important as the actual events of Sept. 11.''  Jim Whitaker, an executive vice president at Imagine Entertainment, the Hollywood production company, who is a co-producer of the film and its director, plans to shoot additional film with video cameras around the site to augment the time-lapse sequences with construction noise and other ambient sounds. He has also decided to undertake a parallel documentary in which he will interview, once each year, 10 New Yorkers whose lives were touched by the events of Sept. 11, chronicling their evolving attitudes.  But at its heart are the project's matrix of motion picture cameras, which will track the gradual rising of new shops, skyscrapers and a memorial on the cavernous site. With one frame per camera clicking away every five minutes, the finished film will look, when run through a projector at normal speed, like one of those eerie time-lapse films of a flower poking from the soil, spiraling upward and blooming.  ``I want it to feel almost like a meditation,'' Whitaker said.  The filmmakers have received support from Gov. George E. Pataki; Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corp.; and John C. Whitehead, chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp.  ``It would add immeasurably to a museum which we hope to build as part of the Memorial Park,'' Whitehead said. ``It could be shown over and over for the millions of visitors from all over the world who we expect will visit that historic place.''  Whitehead, as well as the filmmakers, stress that there is no firm commitment to include a museum in the redevelopment plans. ``We'd love to be there,'' Solomon said. ``But if that doesn't work, we will talk to other museums. And even if we can find no interest anywhere, we'll pack it up and ship it off to the Library of Congress. It'll be history, after all.''  Whitaker, 34, was sitting in a colleague's office in Beverly Hills this week running a tape of some of the early film.  ``See the stone parapets running off from this camera?'' he asked, pointing to limestone balustrades overlooking ground zero. ``I picked this location so we'll be able to see the seasons pass, to watch the snow fall and cling to these ledges and then melt away.''  As he spoke, jittery flares of rapid-motion activity could be seen in and around the near-vacant construction site below as clouds whizzed overhead, and the portentous shadows of unseen skyscrapers poked into the frame, grew, twisted and melted away at twilight.  ``I was in New York last October to go to a friend's wedding, and I went down to ground zero,'' Whitaker said. ``And I just thought that I had to find a way to convey to other people the emotion that I felt that day.''  Nick Wood, 32, managing director of equity derivatives at Salomon Smith Barney, was the friend _ and former Georgetown University roommate _ whose wedding Whitaker was attending. ``I got a call from him a few days later after he got back to Los Angeles, and he described this idea he had,'' Wood said. ``I told him, yeah, we can do this. We can make this happen.''  Wood, who previously worked as a fund-raiser for nonprofit groups, became the project's chief money chaser. The biggest contribution _ $400,000 _ came from the Aon Corp., an insurance brokerage that had offices in the World Trade Center and lost 176 workers on Sept. 11. Kodak donated the film and the processing costs.  All told, about $500,000 has been raised and, if budget projections are correct, an additional $400,000 will be needed before the film is completed in 2009. ``I'm not worried,'' Whitaker said.  (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)  The $900,000 budget assumes that the project will last seven years, although that is just an estimate. If construction on ground zero lasts longer, more money will be needed. As it is, about a quarter of the budget will go to equipment (each of the Mitchell 35-millimeter motion picture cameras run about $20,000), another quarter will be needed for post-production chores like editing and musical scoring, with further sizable chunks for shooting the ancillary film around the site and for travel and other expenses.  Solomon and Whitaker recruited a veteran camera operator, Thomas Lappin, as director of photography, and it fell to him to overcome some of the early technical hurdles.  He also helped design the sheds in which the cameras are mounted. Each is pointed toward a small window in a corner of a shed and outfitted with an intervelometer, a device that automatically adjusts the lens aperture to accommodate changing light conditions and to instruct the camera to expose the single frame every five minutes.  Also in each shed is a generator and rechargeable battery pack that will power the cameras, Lappin said, ``if there's a power outage in the building, or if somebody accidentally kicks out the plug.''  Three cameras were installed by late May, one on the roof of 30 Vesey St., 22 stories above Church Street on the northeast corner of the site; one on the roof of 111 Broadway, on the southeast corner; and one on the 47th floor of the American Express Building in the World Financial Center in Battery Park City just west of the site.  Over the next two weeks, three more will be installed: at ground level in the St. Paul's churchyard, which borders Church Street; atop the Engine 10, Ladder 10, fire station on Liberty Street; and in the ninth-floor newsroom of Barron's in the Dow Jones Building in the World Financial Center.  (END OPTIONAL TRIM)  Of course, there is always the chance that nothing very spectacular will rise over ground zero or within the project's planned seven-year span. ``If it takes 10 years or 15 years, we'll keep shooting,'' Whitaker said. ``Eventually, I assume, there will be some sort of ceremony in which the project will be declared completed. And that's when we'll be finished.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020817.0061 type=story > <HEADLINE> TROUBLED AIRLINES FACE REALITY: THOSE CHEAP FARES HAVE A PRICE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 08-17-02 13:23:00EDT (BC-AIR-TRAVEL-CHANGES-AR) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"128730"	"we"	"assume"	" One November day in 1993, Pederson gets called upon, and what transpires ends up in the Hall of Fame, because it's the record-setting 325th victory of Shula's career. That aspect, we assume, is a pretty good deal, too. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"129801"	"I"	"assume"	" Female duties here fall to Famke Janssen, who plays another agent. The script, meanwhile, is credited to four people, who, I assume, took turns finding ways to embarrass her. It's the only mission in the movie that's really accomplished. For all its dopey shootouts and inept identity tweaks, nothing in this movie amounts to anything. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"

"143624"	"I"	"assume"	" But it persisted, and so I went to the company doctor. He told me I had occasional numbness in my fingers. Then he sent me back to work and, I assume, he sent the newspaper a bill. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"148062"	"I"	"assume"	" The odd thing about New York Apartments  (Rizzoli) is that the owners of some of the apartments are identified, while others are not because, I assume, some of them were shy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"148170"	"they"	"assume"	" Since the Shiite Islamists returned to Iraq on the coattails of the coalition invasion, they have arguably showed great patience in the face of provocations. They endured the assassination of the revered founder of Sciri, al-Hakim's brother, Ayatollah Muhammad Bakr al-Hakim, in August 2003. And today, al-Sistani, al-Hakim and his followers are stoically holding back their armed supporters despite frequent murders of Shiite clerics. These, they assume, are the work of Sunni militants trying to foment sectarian war. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"148809"	"we"	"assume"	" Maybe you even breathe a sigh of relief. With Piero, we are back to the Renaissance art we know, the real one, a classical vision of balance, order, poise, symmetry, polish and art that makes up for all the lesser, stumbling, striving examples that preceded it: the Bonfiglis, Boccatis and the anonymous painters whose names are forgotten because, we assume, their art was inferior, inconsequential, forgettable. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"151635"	"I"	"assume"	" There is something quite stunning when you think about it, the Israeli political theorist Yaron Ezrahi remarked. Three Israeli prime ministers, Yitzhak Rabin, Ehud Barak and Sharon -- all of them army generals, two from Labor one from Likud -- all came to the same conclusion: that the occupation was unsustainable from the point of view of Israel's national defense. As a result, they all shifted from focusing on wars of necessity to focusing on a peace of necessity, Ezrahi added. Sharon doesn't want to explain this about-face publicly, in part, I assume, because it suggests weakness -- that Israel can't keep doing what it has been doing, and knows it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"155405"	"you"	"assume"	" You yank the bills and a week's worth of pizza coupons from your shoe-box sized apartment mailbox. Tucked behind a glossy advertisement for an online dating service is, you assume, a 28th birthday card from your grandmother -- two months late, as usual. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"157461"	"we"	"assume"	" If Reunion does manage to suck in viewers, it will be thanks to a distinctive time gimmick that plays out like an inverse of 24. While that show suspends a single day across a season, Reunion will plow through two decades between now and May, with each episode leaping ahead one year. The folks in 24 wear the same clothes all season long, but the Reunion kids will rip through 20 years of fashion. Thursday night's action is set in 1986, as the friends graduate from high school amid Cyndi Lauper songs and Madonna lingerie. Next week's hour will take place in 1987, and so on and so forth. By Thanksgiving, we assume, our sextet will have hopped on the grunge train to Seattle. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
"162483"	"I"	"assume"	" Also, be ready for potential credit card hassles. Case in (ball)point: Upon arriving in Asia I bought a $5 pen with my debit card. Next thing I knew, Key Bank canceled my card. (They assumed, I assume, it had been stolen by an Asian pen-smuggling cartel.) Just try getting that little mix-up corrected from 8,400 miles away. It took me $80 of phone calls and about an hour of my vacation. OK, it took me a bit longer because I couldn't answer the bank's standard security question -- What's your mother's birthday? Hey, we weren't that close! </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"165196"	"I"	"assume"	" What they're trying to do, is get to where, I assume, the whole field is going to hit a 4-iron or a 5-iron to the green, Nicklaus said. But how do you do that? You can't do that when there's a difference of 60, 70, 80 yards in the drives hit there. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"168758"	"I"	"assume"	" Point being, I assume, that I should have hated the whole notion of such a poll. I don't, at all: That would be tantamount to sneering at every end-of-the-year best list that self-appointed ministers of culture (myself included) have to summon each December, or dismissing the scores of qualitative judgments that call attention to books, from Oprah's Book Club to the Swedish Academy's Nobel wreath. No, I tolerate and even celebrate such artificial divisions, even though I would like to believe, as E.L. Doctorow once opined, that literature is not a horse race. The fact is that it may have become one. Thanks to huge publishing advances, the field nowadays is glutted with couldabeens, also-rans, wannabes, and a lot of miniature ponies that should have been left at home. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"
"174338"	"I"	"assume"	" A number of you asked how to obtain reprints of a column on how to speak to aging parents about funeral arrangements, to be put away, I assume, for when the time comes. (All columns can be found at www.nytimes.com) </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
