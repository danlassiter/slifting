I had lunch on the deck, read and sunned some more, wrote letters and eventually took an afternoon walk.

It lies on the tip of the very westernmost finger of the island, the Peninsula de Guanahacabibes, at least a five-hour drive from Havana, bordered by a large nature preserve that promised a welcome change from the endless farms and towns we had been driving past.

NEW YORK -  Dear Diary:  Walking up Amsterdam Avenue near 70th Street on the Upper West Side, I noticed a mysterious, mangled beige mass covered with red on the sidewalk. I winced, thinking I was seeing the remains of a hapless bird or other creature, a sad version of Manhattan roadkill.  How had it met this cruel fate, I wondered.  Two blocks later, I noticed a discarded hamburger bun covered with ketchup on the sidewalk, and then several more buns in the blocks ahead. I realized I had passed a McDonald's along the way. My Manhattan roadkill turned out to be simply the sign of a carb-conscious city, people tossing their buns away in the hope of a more shapely body or derriere.  - JULIE WOSK  Dear Diary:  A friend and I were at a downtown outdoor cafe when a middle-aged woman seemingly homeless and in need of some mental help loomed over our table and began to harangue us about something she had seen on television.  Hoping she would move on to the next diners, we remained impassive. But when the woman realized we were ignoring her, she became furious and screamed, Don't you speak English? I kept silent while my friend, in her softest native French, feigned Oscar-worthy incomprehension.  The woman then berated us in perfect French and stomped away, leaving us laughing and wondering who's really who on the streets of Manhattan.  - MARCIA BLITZ  Dear Diary:  Recently, I went to the Jefferson Market Library in the West Village and took out the classic French horror noir film Eyes Without a Face. While walking up 11th Street, to my amazement, I saw in the street a plastic eyeball, the kind one might get in a novelty store.  I picked it up at the same moment a woman walking her dog was approaching. Feeling the need to tell someone, anyone, of this incredible coincidence, I tried to show her my find. She stared at it, and then I reached into my knapsack to show her the film. Before I could get the video out, she hurriedly moved away, horrified, her little beagle now removed from the street, tucked tightly in her arms.  - LAWRENCE FISHBERG  Dear Diary:  During a recent indefinite wait in a jury room at 100 Centre Street, I chatted with the woman next to me about Philip Roth's American Pastoral, which both of our book groups had read.  My friend had an experience with Philip Roth, she told me. He looks a lot like her husband -- same age, same height, same long face, same receding hairline. As she was walking down the street one day, she realized that Roth was walking toward her. She's not the celebrity stalker type, but she couldn't resist laughing and said to him, 'You look just like my husband.'  A few years ago my wife, Yvonne, and I were taking an after-dinner stroll on the Seattle waterfront. We decided to take a taxi back to our hotel. I flagged a yellow cab. He stopped and asked if we had called for a taxi, saying that was the procedure in Seattle.  Another couple trotted up to the taxi and said they thought they were back in New York, where people steal taxi rides. I replied, I'm from New York, and thought I could steal this one.  At that point the taxi driver said, I'm a New York taxi driver, I'll take all of you. Four of us piled into the cab.  Then the expected round of inquiries: where from in New York? I said, I'm from the Bronx.  If we were any farther from Bronx Science, we would have been in Puget Sound.  - STANLEY I. COHEN  Seen by Angela Dominguez recently: a tall, distinguished, well-dressed man waiting for the E train on the northbound 34th Street subway platform, holding what apparently was the only shopping bag he could find that morning. In big yellow letters, it read, Trick or Treat.  As Elizabeth Levine was walking on West 87th Street the other day, she suddenly heard loud, inarticulate yells and shrieks close behind her. Alarmed, she turned around and saw two young men in their 30s.  A little embarrassed, one said, pointing to his friend: He's a married man. Just letting out the stress. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20040711.0168 type=story > <HEADLINE> PHOEBE BRAND, 96, ACTRESS AND GROUP THEATER CO-FOUNDER </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> NEW YORK </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200407.gz

The seepage, he said, showed why the integrity of the bathtub wall is so important, Accompanying him and Rinaldi was Pasquale DiFulco, a senior public information officer who used to pick up Port Authority cars on Level B3 when assignments took him out to the airports.

The flawed intelligence, she said, left her once more wondering what to think -- both about war and about the coming presidential election. I need to think some more, she said quietly. For some with family and friends in the military, news of the flawed intelligence hit particularly hard. Some remembered hundreds of American soldiers who have died in Iraq, and wondered how their families must feel now. Some wondered whether service people in Iraq had read about the Senate report yet, and what they must be thinking. </P> 	nyt_eng_200407.gz
, he added,	 The desire for a government to decide who the next president will be or won't be was the original sin of the old regime, Durazo wrote. Mexico, he added, may be ready for a female president, but is not ready for the president to leave the presidency to his wife.

, he says,	 If you long for the old days, when cellphones didn't exist, people were civil to each other and a Democrat was in the White House, here's the book for you. We don't know how you'll feel about it if you're a Republican. From anyone else you'd hate it, but Keillor might just sway you. In part, it's a love letter to Minnesota, where his political beliefs were born, but he also speaks up for public schools, the middle class and ordinary decency, which, he says, we are losing in George W. Bush's America. Keillor says Bush is an Etch-a-Sketch president with a voice like a dial tone. He calls Republicans nasty names (the one we'll always remember is hairy-backed swamp developers), with such fire and conviction that if your politics are anywhere left of center it will be mighty hard not to line up behind him. His eye is on November when he says that the party of Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy is not dead, merely sleeping. We Democrats are deciduous. We fade, lose heart, become torpid, languish, then the sap rises again, and we are passionate. This is a year for passion. </P> 	nyt_eng_200407.gz
, he says,	 Don't pick up this book if you're not willing to slow down and give your thoughts over to something far removed from the pace of modern life. Naturalist Steinhart strays from his usual subjects (although Alaskan bears make an amusing appearance in an early chapter) to investigate what he calls the renaissance of drawing. He explores the motives of people -- there are more than you think -- who regularly attend art classes or meet in groups to sketch from live models. We all drew as children, he says, but at some point most of us stopped. Why? And why, on the heels of an era that celebrated abstraction, are so many people returning to the pleasures of making figurative art, often late in life and with varying degrees of skill? His book is a mix of psychology, philosophy and engaging descriptions of what happens between artists and models, between students and teachers and between an artist's brain and his sketchpad. Steinhart has attended drawing groups for years. His self-portrait is on his book's dust jacket, more charming and revealing than any photo could be. </P> 	nyt_eng_200407.gz
, he says,	 I know what I believe. I will continue to articulate what I believe and what I believe. I believe what I believe is right. Let us now ponder the oratory eccentricities of President George W. Bush, whom Metcalf calls the Blunderer-in-Chief. Bush, he says, is a neologist, or an inventor of words. Among presidents, only Thomas Jefferson invented more, but his contributions (belittle, lengthily) have staying power while we'll remember Bush's words (misunderestimate, arbotreeist) more for their dottiness than anything else. Bush is one stop on Metcalf's entertaining tour of the speaking talents of 42 presidents. George Washington's speech was hampered by his false teeth, which Metcalf describes in awful detail. John Adams (the finest orator, with Lincoln close behind) once gave a speech that included a 727-word sentence. Jefferson is the White House occupant most quoted in the Oxford English Dictionary, John Adams is second, and third is Lady Bird Johnson, who appears 240 times. The OED quotes her husband twice. </P> 	nyt_eng_200407.gz

The problem, of course, was how to see it all and do it all in 11 days -- a challenge given the island's profusion of natural wonders.
