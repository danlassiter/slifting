"92633"	"it"	"rotates"	" Our description: Well, it rotates, but ``fascinating'' may be pushing it a bit. The attraction, which features an Audio-Animatronic family (father, mother, brother, sister and assorted relatives) on a journey through the past century, dates from the 1964 World's Fair _ and it has that ain't-technology-wonderful glow you'd associate with a big global expo. Some of the gimmicks are cute _ the lights that blow out, the oven that overheats _ but the family shtick starts to wear thin about halfway through the 18-minute show. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
