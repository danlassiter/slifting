"35146"	"she"	"discovers"	" When the production's effects artist, Billy (an engaging heroine played by Russian actress Marina Sudina) is accidentally locked in the place overnight, she discovers, much to her horror, that some of the Russian crew members are making a snuff film after hours. ``Snuff film'' meaning that the killing depicted on screen isn't make-believe, it's for real. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"
"39214"	"he"	"discovers"	" As Weschler begins researching the history of the museum and interviewing Wilson, the ambiguities proliferate rather than recede. He notices that Wilson's account of the museum's origins in a collection started by a gardener named Owen Thum and his son, Owen Thum the Younger, is oddly reminiscent of stories attached to the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford University. He uncovers inconsistencies in Wilson's explanations, but also verifies many of the museum's more fantastical ``facts.'' Truth is stranger than fiction, he discovers, for as Michael Faraday once observed, ``Nothing is too wonderful to be true.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"
"53878"	"he"	"discovers"	" Earl's late mother, he discovers, wasn't his mother at all. Instead, Earl learns from a posthumous letter, he was the child of his father and the family's black maid, a young woman who died bringing Earl into this world.

"145546"	"she"	"discovers"	" Ensler's epiphany finally comes over a bowl of illegal ice cream in Taliban-run Afghanistan. Fat, she discovers, is freedom! It's politically subversive. Thank goodness, the tummy can stay. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"170958"	"he"	"discovers"	" There is no single answer, he discovers, as he sits down with social workers, historians, politicians and writers, some Dutch, others immigrants or the children of immigrants. There are, however, promising avenues to explore, and this he does, economically and suggestively. He traces the evolution of the Netherlands from a sleepy, racially homogenous country to a multicultural haven for immigrants, many Muslim. He also delves into the personal histories of the victims and their assassins, trying to expose the social fault lines that led to murder. The connecting theme is immigration and its discontents, felt by guests and hosts alike. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
