Cone never acknowledged their cheers, keeping his head down as he descended the steps of the visitors' dugout.

, she explains,	 Affleck and Beckinsale do what they can with their lines, and glow with the satiny shine of real movie stars. Hartnett's anxious inwardness plays effectively against Affleck's frat-boy bravado, and a few supporting characters, notably James King, Dan Aykroyd and Tom Sizemore, are permitted a few seconds of real acting. But the script, and Bay's impatient direction, do not give anyone sufficient time or space to develop shadings of character. Instead of story the film provides data, telling you what it should show, suggest or leave implicit. Evelyn falsifies the eye exam because, she explains, her father was a pilot too.

, he said,	 The six dealers, five of them arrested on Thursday in Suffolk County, owned five coin stores in Miller Place, Middle Island, Rocky Point and Selden, but Spitzer said the stores had little or no walk-in business. Instead, he said, they provided a front for a telemarketing business in which sales people worked under false names, focused on customers over 70 years old and persuaded them to buy coins typically priced at 1,000 to $8,000 each.

, I suspect,	 This past season, which officially wrapped on Wednesday with the end of May sweeps, a number of series were seen wandering toward the shark-filled ocean, and still others were putting on their skis for a wavy ride. They were in danger of losing their dignity once and for all, if not their Nielsen ratings. ``ER,'' for instance: Despite some promising development of Maura Tierney's character, the top-rated drama fell back on a host of cheap tricks, including a tiresome guest stint by Sally Field, who resurrected her ``Sybil'' shtick, and a brain-tumor plot for Dr. Greene, created, I suspect, to give Anthony Edwards an Emmy clip.

Heretofore known for the jumbled action gibberish of ``The Rock'' and ``Armageddon'' _ he's the man who never met an establishing shot he couldn't dispense with _ Bay here reinvents himself, as a proudly populist artist of epic-scaled ambitions. ``Pearl Harbor'' is patient, eloquent and stirring _ nothing we could have expected from the director.

It was more like an indoor stock tank, really, a big concrete box with a low ceiling and hardly any light. And the once-vaunted rooftop garden and sleeping porch couldn't be re-created to suit modern tastes and fire codes. But elsewhere, underneath the layers of dust and trash accumulated during the nearly 40 years the Rogers Hotel languished as an empty, rundown hulk on the Waxahachie square, developer Anthony Cimino found the historical preservationist's idea of gold: heavy, ornate radiators dating from the hotel's 1912 construction.

Reagan switched parties when the Democrats got to be too darn liberal to accommodate the Gipper's conservative philosophy. Reagan went on to become the Republican Party's most enduring conservative icon. Do you suppose that Vermont Sen.

, he said,	 Harold Shapiro, president of Princeton University, was in town the other day to talk to an audience of presidential science advisers and their students. Some cultures are Promethean, he said, in that they seek to manipulate the world around them, and others are not. But all cultures crave meaning. To this end they have embraced a variety of narratives that explain the origins and ultimate meaning of life. Mostly these narratives are religious. Virtually all have in common two basic themes: that there is something very special about the Earth, and about the moral status of human beings with respect to all other forms of life. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz

In addition, she said, the way the company schedule now operates, with 100 or so repertory actors creating a season of plays that opens in the company's headquarters in Stratford-on-Avon and transfers to Newcastle before arriving in London, forces actors to spend months at a time away from London casting agents and job opportunities. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz

, I suppose,	 Adam Smith would have agreed. There's more to poverty than lacking the bare necessities, he argued. ``A linen shirt, for example, is, strictly speaking, not a necessary of life,'' Smith wrote in 1776. ``The Greeks and Romans lived, I suppose, very comfortably though they had no linen. But in the present times, through the greater part of Europe, a creditable day laborer would be ashamed to appear in public without a linen shirt, the want of which would be supposed to denote that disgraceful degree of poverty which, it is presumed, nobody can well fall into without extreme bad conduct.'' </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010525.0340 type=story > <HEADLINE> OLDS MAKES, AND BECOMES, HISTORY </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-ABOUT-CARS-OLDS-$ADV27-ART-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz

Barker began buying shares in September 1999 for a split-adjusted $15.47, and buys more when prices dip below $40. While the company has some marketers in the United States, most of its staff work in India. ``To maintain a big mainframe application at a big bank, you can access a great talent pool in India for about 60 percent less than it would cost in the U.S.,'' she said.

, he says,	 Moral choice, he says, requires an ability to embrace ambiguity, to search for answers amid the confusing mix of darkness and light in all human beings. Victims have good reasons not to see any trace of humanity in their torturers, he argues in ``Facing the Extreme.'' But the work of the moral philosopher, he says, is to question such assumptions and to understand, as the concentration camp survivor and writer Primo Levi did, that under the right conditions most of us have it in us to be, at the very least, silent accomplices. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, he argues,	 To say, for example, that it was something in the German character rather than the human gene pool that made the Holocaust possible, he argues, is to ignore the dark forces within us.

Please check your level of service to determine which stories you will receive.)  On the dress page:  SENATE-DEMOCRATS-REVIEW (Washington) _ When the quake set off by Sen. James Jeffords' departure from the Republican Party stopped, no one was left standing in the same place or on the same ground. In a nation and a Congress split right down the middle politically, the power of just one vote can be extraordinary, and Jeffords' decision may prove as momentous as the 5-4 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that gave George W. Bush the presidency. But the real question may be whether the Democrats can seize the moment. By Alison Mitchell. (Moved in `a' the category)  ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The psychological frontier between Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs has become a minefield. It was never an open border of trust, but in the few years before the current violence broke out, the boundary grew somewhat permeable, both physically and emotionally. But now, in the worst fighting since 1967, the Bush administration's diplomatic effort will confront the core of the clash between the two nationalisms: the competing rights of return to a land deemed holy and historic to both peoples. By David K. Shipler. (Moved in the `i' category)  _ Also moved in the `a' category:  PLACEBOS-SCIENCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Science is defensive of its rigorous, disciplined empiricism, methodically excising unproven beliefs from its discourse and brushing off pseudosciences that try to attach themselves to its validating coattails. But two researchers offered science a humbling lesson last week, saying in a paper that the placebo effect _ which is supposed to account for the fact that about a third of patients get better when given a dummy pill or a sham treatment and has been cited in textbooks and journal articles for decades _ does not exist. By Gina Kolata.  TAX-CUT-REVIEW (Washington) _ Politics, the economy and the government's fiscal outlook could change substantially over the coming 5 or 10 years, raising the possibility that the tax cut could be put on hold before it is fully phased in. Of course, voting to raise taxes carries enough electoral peril that both parties strive to avoid doing it. History nonetheless suggests that big tax cuts are often followed by periods in which taxes are increased. By Richard W. Stevenson.  PUBLIC-PRIVATE-HOMES-REVIEW (New York) _ A judge has told Rudolph Giuliani, who is involved in a bitter divorce proceeding, that the New York mayoral residence is a private home and denied his right to bring his friend, Judith Nathan, into what the mayor argued were public rooms downstairs. Yet more and more, it seems, sociologists and semiologists and architects and curators are arguing that the house, if still a home, is no longer a very private place. By Tracie Rozhon.  WAITERS-REVENGE-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The start of the summer travel season, means, among other things, that means Americans will be pulling over for a lot of road food. But not everyone in the restaurant business is thrilled with the prospect. That much can be deduced from postings this year on waiters-revenge.com, a Web site where those who serve the vittles get to vent their vitriol.  POLITICAL-COURAGE-REVIEW (Undated) _ What constitutes political courage, such as in Gerald Ford's decision to pardon Richard Nixon, is largely determined by hindsight and the eye of the beholder. By Adam Clymer.  FLAGS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Flags that don't quite fly.  THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.  _ Also moved in the `i' category:  MEXICO-BANKS-REVIEW (Mexico City) _ What does it mean that Citigroup has bought Mexico's second-largest bank, Banamex, and that all of Mexico's three biggest financial institutions and close to 70 percent of its finance system are now foreign-owned? It means that Mexico is coming, kicking and screaming, into modernity; that institutions are taking power where individuals once reigned, and that the border laid down more than 150 years ago is beginning to fade. To understand this transformation, a bit of history helps _ specifically, of the years since the debt crisis from which a U.S. bailout rescued Mexico. By Tim Weiner.  PERU-POLITICS-REVIEW (Lima) _ This country is the kind of place where reality never quite seems real. What makes Peru unique is its ability to astonish through its utter unpredictability. Changes in public opinion can be instantaneous; heroes become goats, or the other way around, within weeks or even days. This is a mark of weakness not just in institutions but in the political convictions of the people themselves. By Clifford Krauss.

, he added,	 Hague dismissed Blair's argument at a rally the same night in Manchester. ``It is a funny form of patriotism to say we can't run our own affairs in this country,'' he said. In a summons to the faithful, he added, ``We have two weeks to save the pound.'' Conservatives argue that joining monetary union would rob Britain of its power to run its own economy and deliver decision-making on interest rates and taxes to bureaucrats in Brussels. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz

The Azeris, he said, told him either to leave town or be killed.

, she said,	 ``Family follows family,'' said Katherine Woloszczak (pronounced WOL-a-check), describing the process that led to her family's establishment here over the last half century. Woloszczak, 86, said the hill and the view that inspired her husband, John, have been like an anchor holding everything and everyone together. Her husband died three years ago at age 88, but four of their grandchildren are now preparing to build homes behind hers, starting this summer, and it is their presence, she said, that keeps her alive. ``I think I would be dead, too, a long time, without family,'' she said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz

, he said,	 This year, Kramer said, environmentalists made real progress in getting the Legislature to close loopholes that allowed old factories to escape the toughest regulations of clean air laws. In 1999, he said, the removal of those ``grandfather'' loopholes failed, except for electric power plants, because Bush favored voluntary incentives. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, he said,	 Rep. Kenny Marchant, R-Carrollton, said he didn't think Bush's absence made much difference to the Legislature. He attributed much of the Legislature's willingness to take up previously bottled-up issues to legislative redistricting. When the leadership _ the lieutenant governor, the speaker and the committee chairmen _ asked for support on redistricting, he said, members could seek a trade-off, which was getting their favorite bill voted out of committee for full debate on the House or Senate floors. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, he said,	 He noticed the car, he said, because he restored cars as a hobby, and added that ``it was not the type of car you would normally see in that parking lot.'' The driver, he said, was white, with short light-colored hair, and was wearing a white or light T-shirt and dark pants. The other man was shorter and stockier, with a dark complexion and dark hair. He was also muscular than the other man, Kuper said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz

, she said,	 Helen Whall, a professor of English, met Music when he signed up for her freshman seminar, ``Shakespeare the Loyal Rebel.'' She said that course's title summed up the essence of her best student. His favorite Shakespearean character, she said, is Touchstone, the fool from ``As You Like It.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz

, he said,	 The general argues that he is not responsible for the 1970 deaths. He was defense minister at the time, but, he said, the orders to send troops and tanks into the streets were given by the prime minister directly to the local commander, leaving himself out of the loop. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, he said,	 Patriotism is what drives him, he said, to clear his name and the name of the Polish army. Only public support _ from a nation that is still deeply divided over his role in maintaining the country's Communist regime _ keeps him going. ``If it weren't for that, I would have put an end to myself,'' he said calmly. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, he allowed,	 He has obviously often mulled the events of 1970. Perhaps, he allowed, he should have spoken against sending troops into Gdansk. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, he said,	 As the violence worsened in Gdansk and other cities, he said, his calm counsel helped convince the hard-line Communist party leader Wladyslaw Gomulka to call back the troops and then step down, moves that, he said, calmed the protesters and kept the Soviets from intervening to restore order. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, he said,	 Beyond the specific events of the 1970s, the general also suggested he could hardly have helped becoming a Communist. When he was deported to Siberia in 1940 as the 16-year-old scion of an aristocratic family, he said, he wanted to join the exile army led by Gen. Wladyslaw Anders that fought alongside the British and helped invade Italy. Instead, he joined Gen. Zygmunt Berling, whose Communist Polish forces advanced with the Soviets through Poland to Berlin. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz

, they say,	 Federal prosecutors say that Tuito supplied Ecstasy to another reputed Israeli gangster, a man named Jacob Orgad. Orgad, they say, supplied the same drug to a dealer named Ilan Zarger, who in turn supplied the Gravanos' Ecstasy ring. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, I think,	 ``In the immigrants' stress to make things better for their children, they're willing to accept alot more from the outside and, I think, the inside,'' he says. ``Just because your wife ticks you off once in a while, doesn't mean you break up. It's part of doing business. Your own personal relationship is not what's at stake. It's your agreement to stay together and raise your children.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, she said,	 Hauck, a physics and atmospheric sciences major, had never been inside the Ward Center when she first heard about the controversy. ``I was vaguely aware there was a reactor on campus at the time,'' she said. She started the petition drive, she said, after hearing from people disappointed by the closing decision. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz

, it seems,	 In chemical combat, it seems, comfort is relative. The mask is hot and smells vaguely of sneaker. Especially at first, it seems as if air is hard to come by. Each labored breath sounds as if drawn and exhaled into a loudspeaker. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, he said,	 Cote said a car bomb in Belfast or Kashmir or the West Bank sends a relatively precise message that the British or the Indians or the Israelis are unwelcome. It alerts the rest of the world to a cause. But a chemical attack with potentially far larger casualties, he said, would only steel the opposition. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, we suspect,	 There's no shortage of Jackson admirers. Michael Jordan, of course, refused to play for anyone else. (Come to think of it, does that mean if he returns next season, he does so with the Lakers?) Shaquille O'Neal, we suspect, would be of the same mind. It was Jackson who took over a ready-to-win Bulls team in 1989 and, after one year, won the first of his seven rings. It was Jackson who took over a ready-to-win Lakers team in 1999 and immediately won the seventh ring. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, I swear,	 ``It was a preseason game against Washington, so the nation didn't get to see it,'' Fox said. ``He took off, I swear, from the 3-point line, and dunked over Ben Wallace.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, he said,	 Landreth Auditorium was in some ways fitting for young performers fresh from universities and conservatories, Pressler said between performances. But performing at Bass Hall, he said, gives the most successful Cliburn competitors a taste of what awaits them. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, I guess,	 So much for the rally. ``Overexuberance, I guess, trying to put us in position to have a big inning,'' Williams said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz

, I said,	 At the par-4 14th, he knocked it to kick-in range with a 6-iron from 167 yards. At 15, an 8-iron caught a tree branch, but came to rest 5 feet from the cup. At 16, a 3-wood, 7-iron set up a 20-footer. At the challenging 559-yard 17th, he laid up, then ripped an 8-iron uphill, into the wind, from 130 yards, the ball hitting just over the pin and sucking back to 3 feet. At the 427-yard 18th, he tried to attack a pin cut back right but his shot caught a slope in the middle of the green and dribbled left, some 40-45 feet from the hole. He saw two hills to negotiate and got it on line. ``As soon as it was halfway there, I said, `You know, I made this putt.' '' </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, he replied,	 Castillo was asked whether he felt he has to pitch a shutout to win these days, whether the slump the last four games by Boston batters weighs on the minds of the starters. No, he replied, ``this is a good lineup that scores runs.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, he said,	 Coach Phil Jackson won't entertain speculative discussions of an undefeated postseason, but he tossed hyperbole to the wind Saturday to describe what Bryant has become. Bryant, he said, has undergone yet another ``maturation process'' - and he's playing a more complete game than the best player Jackson ever coached. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, he said,	 Sheffield is used to playing with sore fingers, he said, because of a history of hurting his fingers while batting. However, taping the finger has not helped this time and difficulty gripping a bat has worsened. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, he said,	 Besides, he said, treatments that clean up arsenic can eliminate other harmful materials, such as lead, in the water as well. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, she said,	 ``The problem in both caucuses is the loudest voices come from the extremes,'' Feinstein said. The test for Daschle, she said, ``is if he listens to moderates in the caucus, and whether we're all able to reach out to moderate Republicans and really put together an agenda that moves forward.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, you say,	 ``Everybody has kind of fell into place in these playoffs according to the stature of how they finished the season,'' Jackson continued. ``So you're playing the best teams in the league. When you play the best teams during the regular season, you say, `Let's play the best teams 50 percent.' It's against the other teams that you make hay. That's how you get a great record in the NBA. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, he says,	 Dad is in town, though, and Elarton hopes his father will help pull him out of his rut. The 25-year-old son wishes to be turned around in the same manner he was last year, when, he says, L.D. Elarton shook him out of a downward spiral. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz

, I vote,	 ``Every time it comes time to vote, I vote,'' said Hanks, 65, who voted for Gore. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, she asked,	 The extra meetings put a strain on Amaral, now a mother of four. If she has to keep going to these meetings, she asked, who will cook for her children? She made it to the first meeting, but then asked me to take her to the local clinic because her baby had a painful respiratory infection. The clinic was crammed with crying babies and nervous mothers. The American volunteer doctor examined Amaral's child and wrote a prescription, and we raced back for another political session. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, she said,	 The only way public relations specialist Ashley Wehrly of Austin, Texas, will manage a trip to San Francisco this year, she said, is by cashing in on her frequent-flier miles and staying with a friend. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, she said,	 It's a good job, she said, but even that security feels precarious when people all over the country are getting laid off. This seems like a good time to avoid extravagances, including unnecessary travel. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, they add,	 Creating the necessary facilities will be expensive, they add, and operating them even more so, because now and for the foreseeable future the value of components and materials that can be retrieved from old equipment doesn't come close to matching the cost of extracting them. And the parties that have begun to ponder the problem _ government agencies, environmentalists and a handful of manufacturers _ are deeply divided about who should have to cover the shortfall. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, he said,	 When manufacturers have to cover the costs of recycling, he said, ``it creates a powerful incentive ... to reduce such costs by designing products that are clean, safe, durable, reusable, repairable, upgradable, and easy to disassemble and recycle.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, he said,	 ``It's inevitable,'' said Winston Wong, scion of Taiwan's most powerful business family, whose Shanghai semiconductor plant will anchor one end of the technology corridor. With China entering the World Trade Organization, he said, the mainland market is too big to ignore. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, she said,	 ``The Peppered Moth'' is, by Drabble's description, ``partly a memoir.'' Her 14th novel, it is based on the life of her mother, Kathleen Marie Bloor, Bessie Bawtry in the book. Unusual for Drabble, it has historical sweep, beginning with Bessie as a small girl in South Yorkshire in 1912, then moving back and forth across the 20th century. It is, she said, ``a mother-daughter-daughter'' novel, dealing with Bessie; her daughter, Chrissie (partly a stand-in for Drabble); and Chrissie's daughter. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, she said,	 At one point Drabble thought about writing a memoir, she said, as her husband recently did about his family. Then she remembered the exhaustive research required for her biographies of Arnold Bennett and Angus Wilson. After finishing the Wilson book, she said: ``Now I can return to the irresponsibilities of fiction. No more dates, no more indexes.'' Less hindered by fact, she re-envisioned her mother as a fictional character. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, she said,	 In the book, she said, ``I was able to see her very much in context, as somebody who wasn't just a single eccentric, bad-tempered woman, but as someone who suffered the disappointments of a whole generation.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, she said,	 Looking back, she said, ``I sometimes regret not having the life of the stage, because it was such fun. It was so companionable,'' in direct contrast to the life of a novelist. For many years she lived in the Hampstead section of London. Recently she moved to Notting Hill. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, she said,	 Discussing her creative process, she said, ``It's an accumulation of ideas. Things that have been in the back of my mind suddenly start to swim together and to stick together, and I think, `Ah, that's a novel beginning.''' In this case the skeleton awakened the author's long-standing interest in ``the idea of ancient civilizations, and those little sparks that turn into what we are now.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, she said,	 In her next novel, she follows a woman in her 60s who moves from the country to London. It is, she said, ``an innocent's view of living alone in London.'' After that she has another plot up her sleeve, one that is centuries away from her early Hampstead novels. It would be set ``in the 18th century in the Far East.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, I think,	 ``What (I) do as speaker, I think, is more characterized by making the system accessible to everybody involved _ the constituents, the members,'' Laney said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, he said,	 It used only a photograph and caption, he said, to cover the groundbreaking ceremony for the new runway at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, and focused on the bulldozers, not the mayor. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, he said,	 And, he said, the paper filed extensive freedom-of-information requests for documents from the mayor's office, but did not do the same for Cuyahoga County commissioners. ``If you are going to scrutinize one politician, you do it with all politicians,'' Rothenberg said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, it seems,	 How long ago, it seems, were those reviews calling ``Monty'' ``that rare aggressive crowd pleaser that you don't have to apologize for liking'' (Ben Brantley in The New York Times), ``one of the most entertaining and exhilarating productions you're likely to see'' (Elysa Gardner in USA Today) and ``funny, earthy and appealingly performed'' (Charles Isherwood in Variety). </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, he said,	 In February, he said, the show switched campaigns, ``to highlight that this is musical comedy, not a strip show,'' primarily to make this clear to people who did not see the movie on which the musical was based. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, he said,	 Casebere, speaking of the extensive new construction in Berlin, explained: ``In the German mind it's the future of Germany and the center of Europe and the economic community. But the underground is sort of more about the horrible German past.'' The depiction, he said, was ``kind of a psychohistory.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, he said,	 When Congress raises the income levels that can be used for calculating all kinds of retirement benefits, he said, some business owners respond by lowering the percentage of workers' pay that the employers contribute. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, he said,	 Halperin said he doubted that many new 401(k) plans would be created by small businesses. When IRA contribution limits are raised, he said, some employers may decide not to offer plans like the 401(k) because they can save enough for themselves through an IRA. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, he said,	 After he thought about it for a minute or two, he said, it seemed that the WB network, owned by AOL Time Warner and the Tribune Co., was pulling a fast one. Next fall the program is leaving WB for UPN, owned by Viacom, but many of those watching on Tuesday night had reason to believe that ``Buffy'' was over for good. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, she said,	 McKenzie said the lower return rate was a result of EddieBauer.com customers' tending to buy more ``basic, repeat items, like khakis and other items where there's a known fit.'' Eddie Bauer's network of more than 500 stores also helps, she said, because customers are often familiar with the brand's fit and quality before going to the Web site. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, he said,	 His family did not acknowledge his father's suicide for years. Only when Reid had become a senator and was holding hearings in 1996 did Reid speak publicly of his father's death. Since then, he said, he has become an expert on suicide by the elderly. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
, he said,	 Instead, he said, his problem is ``skyrocketing'' property taxes in the town of Saxtons River, where he lives, to pay for special education programs and other local school costs. For those reasons, he said, he supported James M.

Passage of the bill, they argue, would signify that Colombia's leaders are more committed to waging war than to supporting a peace process that has broad international backing. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz

New York and other Northeast states had already agreed to steep reductions in power plant emissions of nitrogen oxides _ the main contributor to smog, and a cause of acid rain _ in the summer, and Pataki said that he would make those into year-round requirements.

COMAIR STRIKE MAY CHANGE INDUSTRY  A walkout by pilots at a regional carrier based in Cincinnati that is now entering its 10th week could have a lasting impact on the industry.

It's a culturally and philosophically resonant phenomenon, and Harper's Magazine for June has an extraordinary essay about it by Joshua Wolf Shenk. The piece traverses an impressive amount of ground, as Shenk mixes his own family background with the development of both the antiques business and the celebrity-castoffs industry, which now finds us bidding high prices for, say, Allen Ginsberg's meditation mat. After deciding to take his grandfather's Hebrew typewriter to an ``Antiques Roadshow'' event, Shenk divides the thinking in his article between his late grandfather, a pioneering rabbi in Texas, and the nature of objects in time.

, he said,	 Adventurous gardeners can grow wisteria from seed, Ryniec said. Just let them ripen in those beautiful green pods, which turn brown by fall. Then either plant the seeds in a nursery bed outdoors, or store them in the refrigerator, and plant in spring. It's also easy, he said, to start plants from the shoots that a mature wisteria will send out along the ground. The process is called layering: just bury a part of the shoot that has a bud under a few inches of soil, and it will form roots and shoots of its own. Leave it alone at least one growing season. Then cut it from the mother plant, dig it up and plant it where you want it. Give it plenty of sun and good drainage. And don't put it near the lawn if you fertilize with nitrogen. Wisteria is a nitrogen-fixing legume, which means that microorganisms around the roots help convert atmospheric nitrogen into nutrients. Feeding it with nitrogen could well inhibit blooming, as it will use all that nitrogen to grow more leaves. </P> 	nyt_eng_200105.gz
