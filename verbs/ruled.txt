Simpson case. Nor, he ruled, should jurors be told that Fuhrman had already done so outside their presence.

By David Margolick.  SHUTTLE (Cape Canaveral, Fla.) _ After more than a month of delays, the space shuttle Endeavour finally got off the ground Thursday, carrying five astronauts on an 11-day mission to study the sun, experiment with vacuum-produced electronic materials and test new pressure suits on a six-hour spacewalk. By John Noble Wilford.  CHRISTIAN-COALITION (Washington) _ The typical member of the Christian Coalition, the largest organization of religious conservatives in America, is a married white woman, at least 55 years old, and more concerned about the moral decay of the nation than about any single issue, like abortion, according to the first extensive poll of its membership. By Richard L. Berke. (With graphic.)

INTERNATIONAL  (Moved in `i' category)  YUGOSLAVIA-SERBS-ASSESS (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ This week, Gen. Rakto Mladic, the commander of the Bosnian Serbs, accused NATO of attacking the Serbs in a more brutal way than Hitler. The reference to Hitler by Mladic underscores the way in which the Serbs' war-ravaged history, marked at times by stoical heroism, and their contribution to Allied victories in two world wars, has been repeatedly invoked by political and military leaders during the present conflict to reinforce a conviction that the Serbs have been misunderstood and mistreated. By Roger Cohen. (With graphic.)  YUGOSLAVIA-PALE (Pale, Bosnia-Herzegovina) _ A minute before NATO jets flashed in over the mountaintops on Thursday to attack an ammunition dump about two miles from his home, Milenko Petrovic, a factory worker, was explaining why the Bosnian Serbs refuse to withdraw their artillery from around Sarajevo: ``It is more honorable to be bombed by a great power like America than slaughtered by the Turks.'' By Mike O'Connor.

Hershey Jr.  CULTURE  (Moved in `e' category)  MET-RENOVATION (New York) _ For a year, the Metropolitan Museum of Art did a good imitation of one of its Italian counterparts with a big ``in restauro'' sign at the top of the grand staircase: the entrance to the Met's European paintings galleries was boarded up and visitors who climbed the stairs to see Old Masters had to detour around the first gallery, where large pictures by the great 18th-century Venetian painter Giovanni Battista Tiepolo were hung.

"68472"	"she"	"ruled"	" For Justice Freedman, workfare disrupts the already disordered lives of homeless people, taking children away from parents who are required to report to jobs at a time they cannot even find shelter. Until the city can find a better place for families to sleep than the tables and floors of a city office, she ruled, it cannot use that office to begin the process of putting mothers to work cleaning the city's streets and parks or performing clerical tasks. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199608.gz"
"87844"	"they"	"ruled"	" While they acknowledged that a newspaper has no special immunity from the application of laws simply because it's a member of the press, the court ruled that government may not regulate the content of a newspaper.

"148455"	"he"	"ruled"	" No viable legal theory exists by which it could issue a writ of habeas corpus under these circumstances, he wrote. Courts, he ruled, could not evaluate the lawfulness of the actions of a president who detained nonresident aliens, outside of the United States, during a time of armed conflict. He said that judges must afford great leeway to a commander in chief in time of war on such issues as whom to detain, under what conditions and for how long. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"

"152577"	"he"	"ruled"	" The city of Myrtle Beach must treat African-American motorcyclists as it does white ones, a federal judge ruled. In past years, the city changed its traffic patterns during a rally known as Black Bike Week, over Memorial Day weekend, but not during Harley Week, which attracts mostly white bikers and takes place earlier in May. The difference suggests racial bias, wrote Judge Terry L. Wooten of U.S. District Court in Florence. This year, he ruled, the city must maintain a substantially similar traffic pattern for both events. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
