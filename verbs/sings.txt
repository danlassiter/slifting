INTERNATIONAL  CLINTON (Dublin, Ireland) _ President Clinton said Friday he will warn the U.S. troops heading to Bosnia that it is not a ``risk-free mission'' when he visits them Saturday at a U.S. military base in Germany. (Salome 640). MOVED.  WASHINGTON  GINGRICH-ETHICS (Washington) _ Newly released records show that Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., chair of the House ethics committee, served as a candidate recruiter for the GOPAC political action committee when it was headed by Rep. Newt Gingrich. Now, the ethics panel is investigating GOPAC-related complaints against Gingrich. Johnson denies she ever served as a recruiter, but some Democrats are demanding she recuse herself from the investigation. (Cummings).  CBO (Washington) _ Economic predictions by the Congressional Budget Office _ a little-known agency with a reputation for stubborn independence _ may be the key to whether Republican leaders of Congress and President Clinton can compromise on a balanced budget plan. (Dart 390&AMP;add). MOVED.  WHITE-HOUSE-SECURITY (Washington) _ The Secret Service arrested a man Friday who drove a car with a .22-caliber rifle in its trunk into a restricted security area near the White House. William D. Glover, 63, an itinerant preacher from Texas, was ordered held for examination after making several religious outbursts at a bond hearing. (Malone).  SPORTS  DAVIS-CUP (Moscow) _ Pete Sampras and Jim Courier lead the U.S. team into the Davis Cup finals against Russia that open here Friday. But there's concern on the U.S. side about the conditions they will be playing under, made more acute by claims by Germany that the Russians watered down their clay courts to slow Boris Becker's serves and ground strokes in the German-Russian Davis Cup match earlier this year. (Albright 600&AMP;add). MOVED.  BUSINESS  RUSSIA-COKE (Moscow) _ Coca-Cola opens an expansion of its Moscow plant Friday. Seems routine enough, even in post-communist Russia. But there's a twist. The ultraconservative Russian Orthodox Church _ a leading critic of the growing influence of western capitalism _ will be on hand to bless the plant. The church regularly blesses things like army barracks and new downtown offices, but this may be its first benediction for a U.S. soft drink manufacturer. (Kunstel 680).

"42097"	"he"	"sings"	" Garth Brooks' first album after his recording sabbatical lives up to its title with vehicles that can carry his energetic, hyperhonky-tonk persona. For most of the record, he alternates up-tempo tunes with ballads. His influences show strongly: George Strait on ``Cowboys and Angels'' and ``It's Midnight Cinderella,'' Billy Joel on ``The Change,'' and Aerosmith on ``The Fever'' (Brooks does the country version of what rappers Run-DMC did with Aerosmith's ``Walk This Way,'' borrowing the song's energy, while turning it to his own purposes _ a rodeo tale). He opens with ``The Old Stuff,'' reminiscences about his touring life that becomes a statement of purpose. After the reported soul-searching about whether to continue his career, he sings, ``Hey, it's still one big party.'' There's nothing on the album to contradict that. (Capitol Nashville) </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
"42143"	"he"	"sings"	" Garth Brooks' first album after his recording sabbatical lives up to its title with vehicles that can carry his energetic, hyperhonky-tonk persona. For most of the record, he alternates up-tempo tunes with ballads. His influences show strongly: George Strait on ``Cowboys and Angels'' and ``It's Midnight Cinderella,'' Billy Joel on ``The Change,'' and Aerosmith on ``The Fever'' (Brooks does the country version of what rappers Run-DMC did with Aerosmith's ``Walk This Way,'' borrowing the song's energy, while turning it to his own purposes _ a rodeo tale). He opens with ``The Old Stuff,'' reminiscences about his touring life that becomes a statement of purpose.

(Capitol Nashville) </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"
"50311"	"she"	"sings"	" Her debut album, ``Mascara Falls,'' is a quirky, yet surprisingly consistent, set of observations. In ``Halfway Hotel,'' one of her earliest songwriting efforts, she sings, ``My mother's hands are made of forks and knives / Now she's headed for the promised land with all the other stainless-steel wives.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"
"50312"	"she"	"sings"	" On ``Barbs,'' which was written as the album was being recorded, she sings, ``Barbs from gossips / Barbs from the press / The sound of tearing porcelain flesh.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"
"55665"	"he"	"sings"	" Over sympathetic mandolin and fiddle, he sings, ``Can't wait for a friend when loneliness calls.'' No wonder the women are walking out on him. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"
"65348"	"she"	"sings"	" Loveless sings with convincing honesty. The tales behind her tunes ring true, even if she doesn't write them herself. In the title song of her new album (written by songwriter Gary Nicholson), she sings, ``The trouble with the truth/ Is it's just what I need to hear/ Ringing so right, deep down inside my ear.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"
"80920"	"she"	"sings"	" It's a joy to watch Houston, who gets better with each film. For a double treat, she sings, both solo and leading the church choir. Houston puts so much emotion into her voice and face that her singing must come from somewhere deep down. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"
"85363"	"she"	"sings"	" Loveless takes questions (yes, she has a daughter; yes, she sings, but acting is her first love; no, she's not a martial artist; no, ``I can't marry you. Long distance love never works!''). She tries to to get to as many people as possible. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"89242"	"he"	"sings"	" Bill Gaither, who sings of coming all the way from Chicago to see the Louis-Schmeling rematch in Yankee Stadium in June 1938, reports the results, in a song recorded the day after the fight. With just one hard right, he sings, ``Schmeling went down like the Titanic.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200102.gz"
"106929"	"he"	"sings"	" Another meditation comes in ``Venting (It's a Different World Today).'' The Ramones once packed their songs with comic-book violence and shock treatment. In this measured but subtly searing update, Ramone is appalled by all the real-life violence of kids today. Yet he can relate, sort of: The duplicity of politicians, he sings, ``makes you really wanna go and kill someone.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"107309"	"she"	"sings"	" Loeb's strength lies in her understanding of the foibles of relationships. In ``Everyday,'' co-written with Scruggs, she sings in her signature woman-child voice, ``I am slowing you down. I can feel you stop breathing when I come around.'' And in ``Underdog,'' written with Zappa, she sings, ``I am the underdog, I am the last in line. Don't be the enemy.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"143099"	"she"	"sings"	" Not that she promises any soothing illusions. In the album's opener, Sentimental Marching Song (by Jon Langford of the Mekons), she sings, All men the same, born to brutalize on every scale amid nagging creaks, plinking marimba and sputtering sampled drums. In Kevin Coyne's I'm Just a Man, a boyfriend's confused apologia, metallic percussion clanks while a slide guitar links the song to the country ballad it might have been. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"149854"	"she"	"sings"	" McColl does not have a gift for punchy lyrics, and Act I is painful. Nothing fancy/ Nothing smart/ Living, loving/ From the heart is a line from Nothing Special, Zsu Zsu's lament for the old days when her husband was alive. Later in that number, she sings, Oh, his eyes, his hair/ His gorgeous face/ All that passion/ All that grace. Other songs include Hormones and Whirligig Glands. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"
"150995"	"she"	"sings"	" On Que Creias?, from her third release, Entre a Mi Mundo, she sings, You thought you'd find me happy to take you back / But as you can see, it's not that way. / I want nothing to do with you, / So just pick up and go. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"154256"	"he"	"sings"	" He never sounds better than when he's crooning a simple, sad ballad. Good News, Bad News is a duet with Lee Ann Womack (who wrote the song with Strait), and together they turn a rather goofy concept into a gorgeous song. He's got the good news (Realized I've missed you) and she's got the bad news (I found someone new), but what's memorable is the way her huge, sobbing phrases float above his tidy, stoic ones. And he sounds almost cheerful when he sings the rueful finale, By the Light of a Burning Bridge. In the chorus, he sings, It's amazing what a man can see by the light of a burning bridge, and he sounds like a man who has nearly convinced himself that the blaze behind him is just one more Texas campfire. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"155525"	"he"	"sings"	" Tynan, 45, credits his mother and father for inspiring him to overcome his disability, a congenital deformity of the legs. In Passing Through, he sings, Her strength still burns within me/Like the day she bade me stand. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"166350"	"he"	"sings"	" In I Don't Believe, he sings, I don't believe we were born to be sheep in a flock, to pantomime prayers with the hands of a clock. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
