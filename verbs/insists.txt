"1363"	"she"	"insists"	" The best of jazz, she insists, was an example of extroverted modernism. But it was rejected as serious art by certain cultural elitists partly because of racism and partly because it was thought too popular to be worthwhile. In her argument, music's decline into perversity can be traced to this rejection. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199407.gz"

"3709"	"she"	"insists"	" Ms. Coppin said she had never calculated the cost of the Brooklyn undertaking, though she says it would probably be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. As in the citywide plan, resources had to be shifted from other subjects to devote more money, materials and time to science and math, particularly in the ninth and 10th grades. But, she insists, such an endeavor cannot be reduced to dollars and cents, because the payoff is so large. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199408.gz"
"4203"	"he"	"insists"	" Tarantino denies wanting to be what he calls Mr. Master Manipulator, placing time sequences out of whack, pulling viewers this way and that. The story and the characters, he insists, come first. Still, he enjoys creating a ride. Take the torture scene in ``Reservoir Dogs,'' in which, to the beat of ``Stuck in the Middle With You,'' a character cuts off the ear of a bound policeman. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199409.gz"
"5336"	"he"	"insists"	" Finally, he insists, we are mistaken to pretend that all people are equally endowed; to insist, for example, that a deaf girl without the ability to speak should have the right to enter an annual speech contest sponsored by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, whose topic that year was ``My Voice in America's Future.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199409.gz"

They're looking to be part of a legend in the making. Just as it is the business of music, film and physics to produce spectacular singers, directors and theorists, so it is the job of the city to produce wonderful, fabulous places: buildings we'd walk blocks out of our way to see. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"

"12309"	"he"	"insists"	" The government, he insists, could save that much over five years if it would just calculate inflation more carefully.

"12346"	"he"	"insists"	" Pierce begs to differ. He didn't mean to say all of that, he insists, but rather was vindicated. He said he made the statement because he is ``from the old school'' in which the captain of the ship takes responsibility for all that occurs under his command.

"14048"	"he"	"insists"	" Yet the graying, bespectacled 43-year-old, who announced during his latest re-election campaign that it would be his last, said public perceptions of the GOP as being hostile to gays are exaggerated.

"14557"	"she"	"insists"	" The details are sketchy, she insists, and perhaps her behavior was affected by a medication she was taking for her lungs that she heard somewhere was later taken off the market because it ``warps judgment.''

"15340"	"she"	"insists"	" Haggett insists that Rent-A-Priest doesn't violate church law since all the priests she uses were properly ordained, say Mass in private, not public -- in a nursing facility or private home as a rule -- and generally engage in a dialogue with those present rather than giving a sermon.

"17011"	"he"	"insists"	" In pointed, stylish, occasionally idiosyncratic opinions, Justice Antonin Scalia has carved a distinctive role on the Supreme Court by questioning the conventions of modern statutory and constitutional interpretation.

"20399"	"he"	"insists"	" Ivory's main theme is the tension between repression and expression, an idea that recurs over and over in his films, even the ones not adapted from E.M. Forster novels.

Squalid apartment blocks stand very near the pyramids, and mud brick houses cling to the Luxor hills where pharaohs are entombed.

Here are seven extraordinary routes in different parts of the country. Some can be done in a single day; others require more time. Set your own pace and stop where you please. -0-  _ 1. Bangor to Mount Desert Island, Maine: 40 miles As Route 1A winds east from Bangor, the scent of evergreen woods shifts to an ocean tang.  Cross the bridge over Mount Desert Narrows into a world of craggy, windswept shorelines and shady sanctuaries. The island is shaped like a lobster claw, with the eastern half home to the resort town of Bar Harbor as well as Acadia National Park.  Past the Hulls Cove Visitor Center, which marks the entrance to the park, Mount Cadillac Road climbs to a jagged summit offering panoramic views of the Atlantic. Across the island and to the south is Bass Harbor Lighthouse, which marks the eastern entrance to Penobscot Bay.  Route 3 hugs the shoreline on the way to Thunder Hole, a narrow chasm where waves explode into spray. The route then veers inland to woods that shelter gurgling brooks, idyllic ponds and a maze of carriage roads built in the early 1900s, when the island was a summer resort for high society.  At the Jordan Pond Teahouse, afternoon tea includes fresh-baked popovers with strawberry jam, homemade ice cream and lemonade that is as tart as a New Englander's tongue.  Route 3 exits the park along Somes Sound, one of America's few fjords. On the other side of the sound you'll find villages such as Southwest Harbor, Seal Cove and Bass Harbor which are home to lobstermen and comfortable inns. There, you'll be lulled to sleep by the slap of the waves and the far-off hoot of a foghorn.  For information, call Acadia National Park at (207) 288-3338.  _ 2. Rhode Island coast: 50 miles Rhode Island's coast proves that good things come in small packages.  Start at Watch Hill, on the Connecticut border, a Victorian town with grande-dame hotels. Route 1 heads east through a string of state parks and wildlife refuges, then cuts through the rolling farmland of Rhode Island's ``plantation country,'' the colonial term for the great agricultural estates that once thrived in this area.  Near Saunderstown, the Silas Casey Farm has been preserved as a living-history museum and is open to the public.  North of Narragansett soaring bridges skip across Narragansett Bay to Aquidneck Island and the town of Newport, best known for the ornate ``cottages'' _ which look like mansions to ordinary folk _ built by such robber barons as the Vanderbilts and Belmonts in the late 19th century and memorialized in the 1993 film ``The Age of Innocence.''  At journey's end, sink into an armchair on the generous veranda of the Inn at Castle Hill and watch the sailboats scudding home at sunset.  For information, call the Rhode Island Economic Development Corp., Tourism Division, at (401) 277-2601.  _ 3. Hudson River Valley, New York: 180 miles If Rip Van Winkle were alive, he wouldn't sleep for fear of missing this drive through the storybook hollows immortalized by author Washington Irving.  Route 9 begins at the foot of the George Washington Bridge, at the northern tip of New York City, and heads up the east bank of the Hudson River.  Legendary estates sprawl on grassy bluffs above the Hudson, among them Irving's Sunnyside, near Tarrytown and Kykuit, and the lavish Rockefeller house and gardens recently opened to the public.  In Hyde Park is the Franklin Delano Roosevelt historic home and the Culinary Institute of America, where four student-staffed restaurants are open to the public, but only on weekdays.  Past Rhinebeck _ an antiques-crammed town that sponsors a nationally renowned annual crafts fair _ the Rip Van Winkle Bridge crosses the Hudson.  Continue north on Route 9W, along the west bank. This is orchard and vineyard country, interspersed with farm hamlets such as Palenville and Woodstock, both of which became artists' colonies, then weekend magnets for greenery-starved city dwellers.  The result of this ``urbanization'' is summer-long arts festivals, theater, intriguing galleries, good restaurants and the only decent bagels west of the Hudson.  For information, call the Hudson River Valley Association at (800) 232-4782.  _ 4. The Arkansas Ozarks: 150 miles This drive starts an hour southwest of Little Rock _ in Hot Springs, a spa resort where 47 steaming springs bubble up among the cool lakes of the Ouachita Mountains.  From Hot Springs, Route 7 winds through the Ouachita and Ozark national forests, where mountains are reflected in countless lakes, and pine groves give the air a clean, refreshing fragrance.  At Cowell, detour to the 130-foot-long Natural Bridge, an arch of eroded limestone. Take Route 7 north into the town of Harrison, a historic hub lined with crafts shops, galleries and pretty bed-and-breakfasts.  From town, head southeast on Route 65, then cut over to Route 4, crossing the multicolored bluffs of the Buffalo River and going through villages with names such as Big Flat and Fifty Six.  At Blanchard Springs Cavern, an underground corridor glows with minerals and stalactites.  Another back road curves through forests to Mountain View, where the renowned Ozark Folk Center hosts year-round crafts shows and theatrical and musical performances.  For information, call the Arkansas Department of Parks &AMP; Tourism at (800) 828-8974.  _ 5. Yellowstone to Glacier National Park: 400 miles Oceans of grain and open rangeland stretch to the east, while jagged peaks wall off the west, as you follow this drive along the cusp of the Rocky Mountains from southern to northern Montana.  Route 89 borders the Yellowstone River where it leaves the national park for the sagebrush-covered flats and golden knolls of cattle country, passing dusty cow towns with weatherworn churches and saloons facing off from opposing corners.  As Route 89 elbows west, you'll see Glacier National Park, a wilderness of spires, ridges and gorges where streams tumble over stony staircases and free-fall thousands of feet.  Inside the park, the Going-to-the-Sun Road coils from dense forests up to the Continental Divide, where the view opens up to reveal mountains marching off to Canada.  For information, call Yellowstone National Park at (307) 344-7381 or Glacier National Park at (406) 888-5441.  _ 6. Ring Around Mount Saint Helens, Washington: 300 miles Mother Nature is slowly reclaiming Mount Saint Helens following the most violent volcanic explosion ever recorded in the lower 48 states.  Today, five years later, flowers peek through the mangled landscape and the shattered mountain, once a symmetrical peak, periodically spews vapors.  This loop from Portland, Ore., circles Mount Saint Helens National Volcanic Monument and follows spiraling back roads to within five miles of the center of the eruption.  Head north from Portland on I-5 to Morton, where forest roads climb through thick woods to Windy Ridge, overlooking a moonscape of ashen rock and felled trees.  Nearby is Spirit Lake Overlook, with views of a former looking-glass lake that became logjammed when the blast splintered trees on the hillside above.  It's a magnificent monument to nature's power to destroy _ but the emerging greenery and sounds of birds are an equally reassuring reminder of nature's urge to re-create.  For information, call the Mount Saint Helens National Volcanic Monument at (360) 750-3900.  _ 7. Oregon Coast Highway: 340 miles California's Big Sur may be awesome, but for equally scenic views minus the traffic, head north to the Oregon Coast Highway. This drive from Astoria to Brookings is glorious in summer, when it hardly ever rains.  Like an enormous roller coaster, Route 1 rises and falls from cliffs to beaches pounded by surf, and past headlands, sand dunes and evergreen forests. Elegant stone bridges connect charming coastal towns lined with antiques shops and Ma-and-Pa restaurants.  From Astoria, Route 1 rolls past Tillamook Head and Ecola State Park. Passing through Seaside, a beachfront promenade lined with stately mansions, the highway hugs the coast all the way to Cannon Beach.  Just offshore, Haystack Rock, a 235-foot monolith, rises from the sea. South, at Depoe Bay, is Spouting Horn, where seawater thunders through cracks in basalt-rock cliffs at high tide in a magnificent display of foam and spray.  Beyond the historic bay-front town of Newport, Route 1 climbs to the towering headlands of Cape Perpetua, then descends to Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, a 47-mile sweep of undulating dunes, some rising more than 250 feet high.  In the distance the legendary _ and purportedly haunted _ Heceta Head Lighthouse casts a powerful beam over the sea.  For information, call the Oregon Coast Association at (800) 858-8598. -0- SIDEBAR: BOOKS FOR THE ROAD  Want more inspiration when planning a trip?  Start with the ``2 to 22 Days In ...

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) By LINDA PETERSON c.1995 A&AMP;E Monthly magazine (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  It seems that everywhere these days we are surrounded with genteel advice about proper etiquette: in syndicated newspaper columns, books, videos, audiocassettes and seminars.  Many colleges offer courses in corporate etiquette and there are even workshops for children on how to behave while dining.  People such as Letitia Baldrige, Craig Claiborne, Judith Martin and Elizabeth L. Post graciously devote themselves to helping others learn the joys of properly led lives.  Teaching etiquette has become big business.  So why, then, is rudeness epidemic?  As Martin _ known as Miss Manners _ has observed, the ``whole field of etiquette is one nobody wants to practice, but everybody wants others to practice.''  Despite her 15 years of tireless effort, one basic concept still causes Miss Manners to wring her fine linen handkerchief in despair.  ``It's what you think would be a very simple principle _ that if you want a polite world, you have to refrain from being rude yourself, and to bring up your children that way,'' she says.  Let's do our small part to clear things up a bit. We know thousands of pages have been written on how to eat, drink, dress, converse, enter, exit, write, phone, get up, be seated and so forth, and we do not want to reinvent the wheel.  But let's review a few problem areas of behavior, old and new, that continue to confuse us _ at least, some of us. -0- ELEVATORS  In a word: getoffgetoffgetoff. This should be common sense, but as has been dryly observed, common sense isn't so common.  If you're in the front of the elevator, step off quickly at every floor to let those in the back get out without having to inflict injury on others with their elbows.  And another issue: to hold the elevator door open or not? While it would be unutterably rude to let the doors close within 6 inches of someone's nose, one does not have to keep holding the door for yet one more person who's 40 feet away.  Besides, elevators tend to travel in packs; another one will be coming soon. One risks hazard to one's own health from those already in the elevator and eager to ascend if one keeps pressing the ``door open'' button at 8:59 a.m. CHILDREN AND FIRST NAMES  Perhaps you have encouraged your little one to call you by your first name. However, not every adult will feel as palsy-walsy toward a 6-year-old who assumes such equal standing.  As a parent, you should introduce an adult by saying, ``Junior, this is Mrs. Smith.''  It is then up to Mrs. Smith, if she so pleases, to say to the child, ``Call me Mary.'' If she doesn't, said child should not assume such familiarity.  The concept of waiting-to-be-asked-to-use-first-names holds for adult introductions too. If a doctor bounds into the examining room, saying, ``Nice to meet you, Susan!'' the preferred reply is not, ``Same here, Jack!'' But you are perfectly within your rights to tell Dr. Informal, ``I prefer to be called Mrs. Jones.'' DOORS, REVOLVING AND SWINGING  On this issue people do tend to go in circles. Who holds doors open for whom? Does gender count? Age? Rank?  Lighten up. In office buildings, whoever gets to a door first should go through and hold it open for anyone immediately following.  As for revolving doors, traditionally a man goes first and pushes it for the woman behind him, but that's no longer etched in stone.  It is also common courtesy for either gender to hold doors for the elderly and anyone loaded with packages or carrying a small child.  In the pleasant event that a gentleman does hold a door for a woman unknown to him, it would be polite of her not to beat him on the head with her Filofax and admonish him for his chauvinism. A simple ``thank you'' would do nicely. CHILDREN AND THANK-YOU NOTES  First of all, it's fine for the birthday child to open his or her gifts in front of the guests during the party _ that's part of the fun.  Secondly, it's not necessary for the birthday child to send thank-you notes for gifts presented in person _ at which time the giver should have been verbally thanked by the givee.  However, a thank-you note written by the child _ or perhaps at least crayoned by a preliterate alongside the proper English added by his or her parent _ is required for gifts that were sent. RSVPs  Even if you never took French in school, you're not excused from knowing that RSVP means you must reply to an invitation. It doesn't mean waiting for the anxious host or hostess to call you and inquire whether you will be gracing him or her with your presence.  It does not matter whether the invitation is to a wedding that is setting the family back $200 a head or a little backyard barbecue featuring all the hot dogs you can eat.  There is absolutely no excuse for not telling someone who thought you worth inviting whether you will show up. TELEPHONE TRAVAILS  So many issues, so little time. This contentious area earns several subcategories:  _ CALL WAITING. This seems to be one of those divide-the-world issues: Either you think call waiting is the greatest invention since the remote control or you think it is evil incarnate.  While few would dispute that it is helpful if the school nurse can reach you rather than a busy signal to tell you about Junior's broken arm, those who dislike it suspect you have put them on hold to see if someone more interesting has called.  Whatever.  If you have call waiting, the basic etiquette is this: At the sound of the beep, excuse yourself from the first caller to answer the second call, but keep the first one on hold absolutely no more than a minute _ some say 15 seconds.  It is more desirable to stay with the first caller, but that person may understand if you need to take the second call. You might say, ``Forgive me, but I've been playing telephone tag with this person for two days and I must speak with him. May I call you back later?''  For the record, Miss Manners deeply disapproves of call waiting, which she terms ``vile'' and an example of ``last come, first served.''  She writes, ``Isn't a busy signal a quick, efficient and free way of notifying people that one's line is busy?'' Why anyone would pay extra for the privilege of offending current callers while having to make this explanation oneself, Miss Manners cannot imagine.  _ CELLULAR PHONES. Setting aside the issue of highway safety when so many people have one hand on the wheel and the other glued to their car phone, let us consider some proper manners: Calls should be kept brief _ you're in the car to drive, not close deals.  If you have a passenger in the car, you should ask first if he or she minds if you make a call. After all, you wouldn't blithely keep chatting away if you were sitting in your living room.  Similarly, it's considered poor form to whip out your cellular phone at a restaurant table. Instead, forward calls to the restaurant _ rather than your ringing jacket pocket _ and then leave the table briefly to take the call.  _ ANSWERING MACHINES. Miss Manners says this is the modern equivalent of a butler, who politely informs callers that madame is not available. That means there should be a modicum of dignity to your message. And that means your 4-year-old should not be the chirping bearer of greetings to those who reach the machine.  _ UNSOLICITED SALES CALLS. Telemarketing has been called ``reach out and bug someone.'' In my humble opinion, these callers should be shot on sight. But since they generally don't inform you about their physical location so you can go fire upon them, the next best thing is to hang up.  But you're supposed to do it politely. Something along the lines of: ``Thank you, but I'm not interested. Goodbye.''

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Antonio Banderas in a scene from ``Desperado.'' By CINDY PEARLMAN Distributed by New York Times Special Features  Before you can clearly see Antonio Banderas, you see the hair. It cascades around his face and down his back in thick black waves that even Pocahontas would envy.  The actor's majestic mane is airborne as he struts confidently into a Los Angeles hotel suite, looking as if he has stepped out of a scene from an action/adventure film.  His red open-to-there shirt seems to blow in some imaginary breeze. His very tight black jeans make him look dangerous. His soulful brown eyes narrow into pointed daggers as he states his purpose.  ``Oh, I am so thirsty. What I wouldn't do for a soft drink!'' he moans, rolling the ``r's'' in ``drink'' to make it sound incredibly exotic.  All this tension, all this buildup _ for a carbonated beverage?  It just shows that Banderas is a man who is intense. About everything.  Take this recent dilemma:  ``I was attached recently to a pair of pants. I just loved them,'' the Spanish actor frets in heavily accented English.  ``And I know that I have my closet full and that I have to throw something away. But I can't! I am tormented by this! You see, I can love even objects. I get very passionate about everything.''  Whew! Is this a Latin thing?  Banderas laughs and shakes his head. ``My brother is the practical one. He's not so intense. For me, everything is like cutting off a leg.''  He pauses, then smiles.  ``Sometimes I think I should calm down.''  Mellow out, perhaps?  ``Get mellow?'' Banderas says, indicating something has definitely been lost in the translation. ``I don't know that `mellow' word.''  Obviously.  Banderas has probably never been mellow in his life. And he is definitely not mellow in Robert Rodriguez's ``Desperado,'' a sequel to the director's 1992 film ``El Mariachi.'' Banderas plays a ``bandito'' dressed in black.  ``I go from cantina to cantina gunning down everyone in sight,'' he says with relish.  In the first 20 minutes of the film (which will open nationwide Aug. 25) he kills about 40 people.  ``I am a one-man army,'' the 35-year-old actor says of his character, who carries his weapons in a guitar case.  Banderas' mariachi is all heat and fury.  ``He's got that Latin male thing going on. Heavily,'' his co-star Salma Hayek says in a separate interview. ``Being with Antonio is like you're always salsa dancing. He can't help but take the lead.''  It's obvious that playing a ``gung ho'' kind of guy wasn't exactly a stretch for Banderas.  ``It's funny,'' he says, ``but I didn't realize that I was so passionate until I came here.''  He doesn't mean ``here'' as in a suite at the Four Seasons hotel. Banderas means ``here'' as in America, where, he insists, few people understand his ways.  ``In Spain I am more normal,'' he explains. ``In my country people are just like me. We scream a lot. We are very emotional about everything.  ``Here in America I am a contrast to most men. But I guess that's interesting to people.''  Also of interest are his Don Juan-like traits.  ``I am one of the most romantic men you will ever meet,'' Banderas says. ``This is more than just being in love with a woman.  ``I mean `romantic' in the general way I see life. I form deep attachments to people, to pants, to places.  ``Sometimes I feel like I come from the wrong century. People have no time for romance today. They are just in a hurry. ...  ``Sometimes I think, `Antonio, leave your romanticism in the closet,''' he says, laughing. ``Sometimes, it's not so cool.''  And sometimes being a man of romance is a downright pain.  Earlier today Banderas' publicist warned that the ``M'' word _ as in Melanie (Griffith) _ was strictly off-limits during this interview.  It seems that Banderas is tired of yakking about leaving his wife Ana Leza last fall after falling in love with Griffith on the set of their upcoming film ``Two Much.''  But when it comes to not talking about his personal life, no one does it as badly as Banderas.  ``I am in love!'' he says dramatically, though he doesn't mention Griffith by name.  He doesn't have to. Photographers have snapped the couple smooching in various Los Angeles spots and, most recently, aboard a private boat off the coast of Spain.  ``Yes, last week I took a special someone for a private holiday,'' Banderas says, pulling his shirt back to reveal a nasty sunburn.  Didn't that special someone bring sunscreen?  Banderas playfully shakes his head. ``You are sometimes foolish when you are in love.''  And sometimes you hurt other people. When asked about the breakup with his wife, Banderas calls it ``painful and tough.''  ``Right now I am trying to be dignified about my new relationship for all parties involved.''  The actor realizes some people don't understand his relationship with Griffith, but he recently told Movieline magazine that she makes him feel loved.  ``Right now everything is very hot, very raw,'' he said in that interview. ``We were falling in love while we were shooting. It was unavoidable.''  Now they seem to be spending all their free time together. One can't help but wonder: What is a romantic evening like for Banderas?  ``I'm not going to tell you that!'' he says.  Then, about two seconds later, he's spilling his guts.  ``A romantic night is just to get close to someone in the right way with a good rhythm,'' he says, laughing at the innuendo.  And his favorite romantic place?  ``Where it would be?'' he says. ``Wow! I don't know. I really think the most romantic place is just in your heart. And the most romantic thing to do nowadays is just to be really in love with honesty.''  That can be difficult when the tabloids are ready to print every detail about your private life.  ``In the last months I've had to read a lot of lies and fantasies about me,'' Banderas admits. ``I try to pay the price with a sense of humor. I just wait for the storm to cross over.''  While he is waiting, he's living a circuslike existence.  ``I go to Spain and I am followed by 40 journalists everywhere,'' he says.  ``I went on a sailboat and I see seven boats around my boat. I guess these guys follow me in case I do something extraordinary, which I don't know exactly what it would be. Am I going to jump from a building or something?''  Perhaps all this attention is focused on Banderas because Hollywood hasn't had a real Latin sex symbol in a long time.  ``I hope there is not some plot or a plan in Hollywood just to make me take the empty space left by Valentino 60 years ago,'' he says.  He has bigger plans.  ``I love this profession. I love actors. I love directors. I love telling stories.  ``That's what I am. A storyteller. This is why I don't let the tabloids spoil what I do. I live with the bull so I can come alive when they yell, `Action!'''  And there has been a lot of action lately.  In addition to ``Desperado,'' Banderas stars with Sylvester Stallone in the action flick ``Assassins,'' which is scheduled to be released this fall.  ``See my scar,'' Banderas says, pointing to a thin line under his eye. ``Stunt guy falls on me. My gun goes into my eye. I nearly put my eye out.''  His work on the comedy ``Two Much'' (which will open later this year) was much less dangerous. Banderas plays a man who pretends to be his own twin so he can romance two women: Griffith and Daryl Hannah.  How does he rate Griffith as an actress?  ``She is gorgeous,'' he says. ``It was gorgeous working with her as an actress. She's very natural.''  Do he and Griffith have much in common in terms of acting styles?  The eyes go steely.  ``I don't know if we have things in common. I shouldn't talk about Melanie anymore,'' Banderas says, suddenly humming to himself to block out further questions.  That's OK, because Banderas has plenty of other things to talk about _ including his cameo role in the forthcoming ``Four Rooms,'' a turn as Che Guevara in ``Evita'' (opposite Madonna) and an upcoming thriller with Rebecca De Mornay. There's also talk of a sequel to the 1994 hit ``Interview with a Vampire,'' focusing on his neck-biting character.  Banderas has come a long way from his childhood days in middle-class Malaga, Spain.  Always interested in acting, he enrolled in the town's School of Dramatic Art at 21 and later made his film debut in Pedro Almodovar's ``Labyrinth of Passion'' (1982). That turned him into a star in Spain.  ``It wasn't enough,'' he says.  So after several years of local fame he moved to America, where he landed a role in ``The Mambo Kings'' (1992) and went on to steal ``Interview'' and ``Miami Rhapsody'' (1995).  Though he now seems to be speeding up Hollywood's ladder of success, Banderas says he is in no rush to reach the top.  ``I can wait,'' he says. ``I will have my time. I have set my claim on the future.'' c.1995 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.) ------------------------------------------------- (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448; fax: 816-822-1444.)

Compiled by PAUL SMOLARCIK c.1995 A&AMP;E Monthly Distributed by New York Times Special Features  Some of the most widely watched TV programs in other counties are game shows _ and the most popular shows usually are the most outrageous ones.  Here are some examples of the far-out games our foreign cousins have been playing:  Couldn't they just get something nice from the Spiegel catalog?  Without a doubt, the wildest game show of all time was Japan's ``Trans-America Ultra Quiz.''  Losers were punished severely. Some were forced to walk up 72 flights of stairs; one woman had 25 pounds of bees set upon her; and one man was forced to go sailing in a paper boat. He sank.  Rule No. 1: Don't cook the cast.  Game-show producers in Greece had to stop using farm animals as booby prizes when contestants said they wanted to take the animals home and have them for dinner.  If the answer is ``tons,'' don't put another shrimp on the ``barbie'' for her.  On an Australian game show, male contestants were asked to estimate the size of their wives' bosoms.  ``You may answer in ounces, pounds or tons,'' the host said.  Guess they never heard of New Coke.  An American contestant on a Japanese quiz show did so well that he had to wear dark glasses to avoid adoring fans. The show was called ``Those Amazing Foreigners _ They Get It Right Every Time.''  They sang Vivaldi while they vacuumed.  A game show in the old Soviet Union called ``Let's Go, Girls!'' not only tested women contestants' knowledge of music and theater but also their ability to milk cows and handle a vacuum cleaner.  It's for turning beef patties into hockey pucks, of course.  On Russian game shows in these post-Communist days, the prizes are often donated by Western electronics firms. The only problem is, many Russians are unfamiliar with the items.  One woman who won a microwave oven broke down in tears because she didn't know what it was for.  And don't come out till you're 40!  ``Saklambac,'' a Turkish version of ``The Dating Game,'' ran afoul of cultural traditions.  Parents of a young woman who appeared on the show locked her in the house after they discovered she'd been talking to strange men.  Guess this explains the Jerry Lewis thing.  A French game show featured a raging bull that charged contestants. Viewers thought it was hilarious.  The popularity of the lowbrow show shocked French intellectuals but not the host. He said that many viewers claimed ``to be watching the Truffaut film on the other channel'' but were really watching him.  Viv_ la _rance!  Anne Pujol played the Vanna White role in the inaugural French version of ``Wheel of Fortune,'' and she took some grief for it.  At a party someone said to her, ``Have you seen how stupid you look just standing there flipping those letters?''  They must have forgotten to tell Benny Hill.  A top British quiz-show host said that audiences in England don't like to see beautiful women on game shows just for decorative purposes because it's sexist.  ``Bimbos are not loved here,'' he said.  The password is ``stupid.''  Foreign game shows aren't they only ones with bizarre happenings.  In 1988, Kerry Dee Ketchem became the biggest money winner in the history of America's ``Password'' but ended up a loser.  A viewer recognized him as a fugitive from justice and called the police.

Sarah tells of a brief lesbian encounter and Thomas is outraged at her infidelity; they are, he insists, ``going steady.'' But all this comes too late to turn the film into a character study.

(ATTN: Mont., N.D., S.D., Ohio, Pa., Mass.) EDUCATION NEWS AND NOTES (For release Sun., Aug. 4) If It Happened in Cleveland, It's Here Where Teaching Science Is Child's Play How the Bicycle Saved Civilization Even Swimming Pig Can't Save Theme Park At a Glance, Computer Comes Alive From the Salvage Heap to the Ivied Walls Grant Opens Doors for Native Americans  (JT) By DOUGLAS MARTIN  c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service  Ryda Rose, an education professor at the University of Pennsylvania, is in the business of teaching elementary school teachers how to teach science. But the first step, she insists, is to teach them to be children again.  Accordingly, she has appeared before her class dressed as the Beast in ``Beauty and the Beast.'' She has also dressed as Pocahontas, playing a recording of the song ``Colors of the Wind.'' To add panache to an experiment using floating eggs to illustrate the relative density of matter, she dressed as Humpty Dumpty. She makes college students play with sand and float ice cubes in various liquids.  ``I try to get into the culture of childhood,'' she said. ``What do kids watch? They watch MTV. If you're going to get the kids interested in science, you've got to do it in a manner they're accustomed to. I want them to learn the culture of childhood today.''  Dr. Rose, a 30-year teaching veteran, is performing this summer at Penn's Graduate School of Education, where many of her students have come to elementary school teaching from other careers, including law, engineering and academia. The more different backgrounds, the better, she said. ``An elementary-school teacher is a renaissance person.''  It is also important for incipient teachers to practice childishness. But the first step this summer, as usual, is finding children to practice on. ``You go in a bookstore and find one kid,'' Dr. Rose said. ``Then you ask if they have a friend. Ten friends? Bring them!''  Currently, she is trying to perfect a version of ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame.'' But she will also highlight some old standbys. ``You want Ms. Frizzle?'' she said of a character who teaches science in children's books. ``I do a GREAT Ms. Frizzle.''  c. 1996 N.Y. Times News Service  Cleveland is the place where the river caught fire, right? Yes, in 1969, to be exact. But it is also the birthplace of the first traffic light and the Salisbury steak. Among its civic heroes is Eliot Ness, who came to Cleveland after his work with the Untouchables in Chicago and cleaned up crime but lost in a run to become mayor.  This information comes from the second edition of the ``Encyclopedia of Cleveland History,'' being printed this year to honor the bicentennial of the settling of the mosquito-infested marshland by none other than Moses Cleaveland. Case Western Reserve University and the Western Reserve Historical Society are jointly publishing the encyclopedia, which will go to press this summer.  ``It's a community service,'' said David D. Van Tassel, a Case Western history professor and the encyclopedia's senior editor.  In addition to the encyclopedia, Case Western is also preparing a new companion volume, the Dictionary of Cleveland Biography. Those profiled range from John D. Rockefeller, who got his start with Cleveland oil refineries, to Charlie Lupica, who in 1949 set a world record for sitting atop a flagpole. He had vowed to come down only if the Indians regained first place in the American League. They never did and he was up there for 117 days.  John Grabowski, another Case Western history professor, said the project's financial backers were particularly attracted to the separate book of biographies. But that didn't mean they could get their names in. ``One of the rules is that they all must be dead,'' he said.  The first edition of the encyclopedia, published in 1987, was used as a model for later efforts in Indianapolis and New York. After a last-minute updating, this one will include the saga of how the Browns abandoned Cleveland, and the city succeeded in keeping their name.  c. 1996 N.Y. Times News Service  Professor Ross Petty of Babson College is spending a lot of time bicycling this summer, but exercise is not his only objective. He is planning additions and modifications to his favorite course, called simply, ``The Bicycle.''  It might seem an odd offering for the Wellesley, Mass., business school, but Petty begs to differ. He cites Einstein, Steve Jobs and others as admirers of bikes, and goes on to argue that the subject is a swell method to discuss such heavy topics as the evolution of technology, safety regulation and mass marketing.  The two-credit course is offered during the month of January when Babson students intensively study a single course, meeting for an hour and a half each day. In Petty's course, they are assigned 600 pages of reading and see such movies as ``The Bicycle Thief.'' His evolving ideas for next January include expanding the discussion into other areas of technology, perhaps including florescent light bulbs.  Petty, an expert on consumer protection who worked for the Federal Trade Commission, has written extensively on bike safety, but his interests are far broader. He sees the bicycle as instrumental in such developments of modern life as mass production, the airplane, mass marketing, vacations, highways and even feminism.  ``The bike boosted the cause of women's emancipation by providing an impetus for `rational dress' and the means for women to travel independently,'' he wrote in last year's syllabus.  He owns a number of bikes, including a tandem with an attached cart. The cart can carry up to six people.  c. 1996 N.Y. Times News Service  Ralph the swimming pig has been kicked off campus. In the interests of ecology and to staunch a hemorrhage of red ink, Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos has closed Aquarena Springs, a theme park it bought in 1994 for $7 million. The star attraction at the park was Ralph, who became a Texas icon by oinking exuberantly as he flung himself into a pond.

He is the grand master of subtly assertive spicing, who finds a role for melon seeds, lime leaves and smoked cashews, carom seeds (with a peppery, thymelike taste) and chervil. His cooking, he insists, represents a modernization of Indian cooking, not a cross-cultural fusion.

The woman told the police that she was dragged into a ``shack'' and raped repeatedly on a mattress.

McGreevey is afraid that granting official recognition to three tribes that are seeking it could get New Jersey tangled up in issues which it wants no part of. Chief Roy Crazy Horse of the Powhatan Renape Indians of Rancocas, N.J. Crazy Horse says he only wants his tribe's pottery to be federally recognized as genuine Indian art. The idea of putting an Indian casino here on the muddy banks of Rancocas Creek in Burlington County, he insists, is not even a consideration. Crazy Horse in Rancocas last week.

But not, he insists, among voters.

Palahniuk also wrote the novel ``Fight Club,'' a credit he reminds us of more than once in this slyly goofy, gleefully lurid nonfiction guide to his adopted hometown. Portland, he insists, is more than rain and microbrews, and once you've read his account of haunted houses, hidden tunnels, 24/7 raves and profiles of edgy (in every sense) artists, sex workers, cultural provocateurs and guttersnipes, you'll agree. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200310.gz"

Frederick Schauer, who teaches the first amendment at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, was reading about some dog lovers who claimed ``canine racism'' in response to measures to curb attacks by pit bulls in New York City. This was an extreme example of how society has become so obsessed with avoiding any stereotypes that it the fact that a fair number of generalizations, he insists, turn out to be accurate. Amid new concerns about identifying terrorists and old worries about police using race and ethnicity as grounds for suspicion, Schauer says one of his goals is to fine-tune and rescue the term ``profiling'' from being a pejorative. ``Idevend the morality of decisions by categories and by generalizations,'' he writes.

Less felicitously, he revisited a past that he had imagined he'd ditched when he left his government job for blue-chip litigation.

"146928"	"he"	"insists"	" Two women enter his life. The first, Julia, embraces his cause, becomes his soul mate, and helps him produce a book of poems. The second, Rosa (Lola Duenas), is a beleaguered single mother with two children, who visits Ramon after seeing him on television and falls in love. When she tries to convince him that his life is worth living, he caustically suggests that she is really seeking some meaning to her own life. Anyone who really loves him, he insists, will help him die. Will she or won't she? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"147088"	"he"	"insists"	" He goes to a Jewish moneylender, and despite a sleazy stereotyping suitable to Casanova's arrogance, their haggling takes on a chill but airy universality. One could experience the world only insofar as he could accept it as security, the other wanted all life on credit: happiness, beauty, youth. It was ideas, not amounts, that they were discussing. At his Bolzano inn he uses the maid, Teresa, for a sample seduction; not cynical but detached, he insists, as a work of art might be. There is genuine feeling on both sides, because such feeling is essential to the seduction artist, equivalent to using none but the finest badger-bristle brushes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"147516"	"he"	"insists"	" In the meantime, he insists, he will not be filling in his vacant hours running the Metropolitan Opera (In four years' time, perhaps, but they need someone now) or adorning his pension with crossover projects. Asked whether there was any likelihood of the Three Tenors' reuniting for a last Last Stand, he made a face before replying sweetly, Would you want them to? </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20050104.0130 type=story > <HEADLINE> NYTR-BUDGET-05-BC-CYCLE </HEADLINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"148234"	"he"	"insists"	" Bruschi is ready. He always has been. His drinking, he insists, never affected his play, only his off-field decision-making. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"148707"	"he"	"insists"	" Osborn repeatedly makes the point that you can prepare a whole bunch of veggies in little to no time without boiling or steaming the flavor out of them. It's the natural way, he insists, beaming all the while. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"148774"	"he"	"insists"	" What he is not trying to do, he insists, is boost ticket sales. On the contrary, he said, it might be not as easy to sell because we're pairing it with new pieces and American premieres, so that Beethoven is always in confrontation with 21st-century music, which, unfortunately, is too often seen here as 'the problem.' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"

"150241"	"she"	"insists"	" Birch has her own experience in trying to maintain a friendship across the gay-straight divide. A friend from her youth is a Christian evangelical, and their relationship has strains. But, she insists, I would never say to her,' you cannot talk to me about your spirituality,' Birch said. I love this woman as a friend. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"150275"	"he"	"insists"	" After his four seasons of 24, Cochran endorses the same approach: save big decisions till the end of the season. The writers and the audience, he insists, will then enjoy the benefits of a looser process. At the beginning of the season, we certainly don't know, he said. Halfway through, we certainly don't know. As we're writing episode 16 or 17, we start thinking in a very general sort of way, where we'd like to end the season. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"151007"	"he"	"insists"	" There, the Israelis agreed to return security control over five cities in the West Bank to the Palestinians by late February. The Palestinians, he insists, have not kept their promises to disarm 17 wanted fugitives in Jericho and 35 in Tulkarm, ensure that they abandon their military organizations and give up terrorism, keep them under security control and ensure that they remain within the city limits for at least six months. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"151338"	"he"	"insists"	" In his Los Angeles studio, where his students range in age from 10 to 76, Riggs pulled no punches in his take on the Idol warblers. Looks, delivery and the right song, he insists, are as crucial as vocal ability. Also, on-camera hopefuls better keep those waist sizes down. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"153524"	"he"	"insists"	" His rosy analysis, he insists, has nothing to do with his legacy, which certainly has been burnished since his experience as the president of the constitutional Convention on the Future of Europe, as he was known during the drafting. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"

"154934"	"he"	"insists"	" As the Maloofs' favorite worlds of NBA basketball and Las Vegas were joined during summer league last week, Gavin Maloof sat down on a 105-degree day in the desert to discuss the joy of seeing his visions realized in the Entertainment Capital - and the frustrations of not getting what he wants in the capital city out west. The order for a new arena that he and brother/ co-owner, Joe, want to share with all of Kings land is taking longer than expected, as discussions with city officials and business owners remain stagnant. His request for an unprecedented Las Vegas NBA All-Star Game in 2007 likely has been answered, giving him hope that maybe one day a sports team will be here all the time (no, he insists, not that team). </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"155201"	"he"	"insists"	" This afternoon Reines, 35, single and jet-lagged, wears a clean blue shirt and a haze of stubble. The senator doesn't nag him about shaving; she is, he insists, a boss who doesn't sweat the small stuff. Come to think of it, she doesn't sweat at all. That's his job. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"155352"	"he"	"insists"	" Evan Grant, the head greenkeeper at the Old Course, argues St. Andrews can never be dropped from the Open rotation. Tradition counts for too much, he insists, proudly adding his crew will not dig any more of those bunkers big enough to be an elephant's coffin, because a good curator does not mess with a museum. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"155427"	"she"	"insists"	" Such verse may be especially useful in times of crisis, Angelou says, but it serves a purpose regardless of circumstances. And the best poetry, she insists, is poetry read aloud. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"

"156526"	"he"	"insists"	" He does not wish violence on the Palestinians, he insists, and he disagrees with settlers who build on privately held Palestinian land. He supports giving Palestinians municipal voting rights and property rights but never a country. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"157089"	"he"	"insists"	" The novel - entitled ((.)) - is by Hu Wenliang, a member of the Shanxi writers' association who already has eight books under his belt. Hu says this one took him a year to write (he was working public relations when he wasn't toiling away on his wordless work). It's a love story, he insists, and there's a reward of 140,000 yuan (about $16,000) for the reader who can figure it out. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"157719"	"she"	"insists"	" The prohibition raised hackles in the Schwarzenegger administration and among local government officials. Wolk's predecessor in the Assembly and successor as a Yolo County supervisor, Helen Thomson, wrote her a letter asking that the prohibition be taken out because of the impact of this legislation on current proposals which are in advanced stages of the planning process and Wolk did so in June -- not, she insists, at Thomson's behest but to lessen Schwarzenegger's opposition. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"

"158192"	"she"	"insists"	" Jennifer Crisafulli was consumed by Jen C. Yes, that was her on the screen. No, she insists, that's not who she really is. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
"160045"	"he"	"insists"	" Wennemer, a onetime cosmetics executive, took over Continental in 2001 after a string of acquisitions left the company deeply in debt. His recipe for success, he insists, is not mysterious: create a stream of innovative new products and produce them, as much as possible, in low-cost countries. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"160674"	"she"	"insists"	" Routine, she insists, is the key: If you can do these things for three weeks, you'll have started to integrate new habits. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"161100"	"she"	"insists"	" Mobile home residents, she insists, are not trailer trash living in some slumlike hovel. They are normal people who have found an affordable way to live. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"164103"	"he"	"insists"	" The film dramatizes the tension between Jackie's deadly serious world and his what-me-worry outlook with a sardonic opening sequence. Under Louis Prima's exuberant cover of When You're Smiling, Jackie's coked-out cousin Tony ineptly tries to whack him. Although he takes four slugs, Jackie doesn't hold a grudge. Tony was high, he says. With cockeyed optimism, he insists, He loves me. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"164118"	"he"	"insists"	" Soans worried that some people would see his play as an apologia for terrorists. It isn't, he insists, and he realized the importance of including victims' voices as well as terrorists'. He says the characters based on interviews with Norman Tebbit, the former British Cabinet secretary, and his wife Margaret, who was left in a wheelchair by the Brighton bombing, were added during the writing to amplify the victim's perspective that Terry Waite provided. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"

"165245"	"it"	"insists"	" The crucial difference between this terpsichorean pop fairy tale and its dozens of screen predecessors is that Take the Lead goes out of its way to put hip-hop culture on an equal artistic footing with traditional pop music and dance. Athletic, beat-charged dancing, it insists, is as challenging as the tango, rumba, fox trot, merengue and waltz. It assumes the same equality between hip-hop music and the kind of pop-jazz embodied in the movie by Lena Horne singing I Got Rhythm. (It's directed by Liz Friedlander, who comes from the world of music video.) </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"166590"	"he"	"insists"	" People are convinced that they are unique, that everybody likes different things, Gilbert said. However, he insists, People agree about 95 percent on what brings happiness. Almost everyone likes family, friends, sex, good food, gorgeous sunsets, and laughter. Almost no one thinks nausea, war, poverty, grave illness, or an earthquake will make them happy. Human beings are remarkably similar in what they like, but they disagree at the margins, and these disagreements loom larger than they really are. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"168098"	"he"	"insists"	" Why can't Latin America do what India is doing? Rozman asked when I spoke with him in Washington last week. It can, he insists, but only if it changes -- fast. Right now I have 500 job openings I can't fill, and the problem is education. The prestige career to follow in India is engineering, and in Latin America it is ((still)) law or being a notary public. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"168590"	"she"	"insists"	" Debra Redondi of Dublin admits that she used to run herself ragged providing meals for her husband and three children, ages 10 to 14. No more, says the school district health worker, who visits the Pleasanton Dream Dinners, the oldest Northern California branch, once a month to make a dozen meals. Not only has it taken stress out of her life, she insists, but our grocery bills are actually lower now than before. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"
"168592"	"she"	"insists"	" It has been a dream summer for Brown, who will turn 18 later this month. The pace has been frenetic but, she insists, she'd have it no other way </P> "	"nyt_eng_200607.gz"
"169024"	"he"	"insists"	" There are those who, on hearing that the tintype photographer John A. Coffer lives without car, phone or plumbing, might call him a Luddite. This, he insists, is not true -- for one thing, he has a computer. He even has a computer room. The walls are bales of hay, the roof is tin, and the power source is a 75-watt solar panel outside in the pasture. Coffer, who lives on a 48-acre farm in the Finger Lakes, built his computer room in March. It's lasted nicely through heavy rains and if it falls apart, Coffer says, no matter: He's invested all of $15 in it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169688"	"he"	"insists"	" NBC's Kevin Reilly believes that networks are risking their relationship with viewers by canceling shows that require a weekly commitment. But risk, he insists, is part of his business. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"

"171162"	"he"	"insists"	" His most serious challenger is Faisal bin Shamlan, 72, a former minister and member of Parliament who has a reputation of integrity. Shamlan, backed by a coalition of the four largest opposition parties, including its Islamists, has promised to fight government corruption and to distribute authority among Yemen's regions. Government corruption, he insists, has led to growing militancy, Yemen's scourge. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171968"	"he"	"insists"	" See, Amin is a freak for Scotland. He wears a kilt at public appearances and orders his dashiki-clad underlings to sing odes to the bonnie land. He is, he insists, the last king of Scotland, and, as such, even writes a mash note to Queen Elizabeth II. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172564"	"it"	"insists"	" But so far Hungary has neither taken fresh legal action nor presented new facts to bolster the evidence rejected by New York's Appellate Court. One element in its original claim is that the hunting plate refers to Pelso, as Lake Balaton is called in Latin. There, it insists, the treasure was found by a quarry laborer, Jozsef Sumegh, in the late 1970s. De Walden said scholars had testified that the Roman Empire had several places called Pelso. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
