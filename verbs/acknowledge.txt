"101646"	"we"	"acknowledge"	" In thankfulness and humility, we acknowledge, especially now, our dependence on one greater than ourselves.

"117434"	"they"	"acknowledge"	" Granted, they acknowledge, the underclass has long been resentful that the wealth of their oil-rich nation has not trickled down to them. But Chavez has nurtured and fetishized that resentment. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"

"129439"	"they"	"acknowledge"	" Here's what lies behind the claim. In late 1999, O'Brien and Travaglini say, they began hearing ``back-channel'' rumors that the Big Dig was over-budget. This was not, they acknowledge, a stunning discovery: The last set of Big Dig budget numbers were many months old, and the project's costs were growing year after year. It was also well known on Beacon Hill that the Big Dig managers were conducting a ``top-to-bottom analysis'' of project finances that was widely expected to show a budget problem. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"141625"	"they"	"acknowledge"	" The group said it would introduce a new advertisement against Kerry on Friday. What drives the veterans, they acknowledge, is less what Kerry did during his time in Vietnam than what he said after. Their affidavits and their television commercial focus mostly on those anti-war statements. Most members of the group object to his using the word atrocities to describe what happened in Vietnam when he returned and became an anti-war activist. And they are offended, they say, by the gall of his running for president as a hero of that war. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"142917"	"they"	"acknowledge"	" Others have suggested delaying the January election, at least in Fallujah and the Sunni triangle -- a gambit that could, they acknowledge, exacerbate Iraq's religious and ethnic tensions.

"146606"	"they"	"acknowledge"	" It may not be enough, they acknowledge, to get hip with that 12-to-24 group. Thompson said his analysis of heavy radio losses to iPods and CD mixes was a big revelation to me, but tell it to any teenager and they'll say, 'Well, duh.'  </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"

Yes, they acknowledge, the result could be a war on the Korean peninsula, but they doubt it would come to that. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
