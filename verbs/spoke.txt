Includes a 300-word sidebar and a color slide of Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep in a scene from ``The Bridges of Madison County.'' By CINDY PEARLMAN Distributed by New York Times Special Features  In the opening minutes of ``The Bridges of Madison County,'' Clint Eastwood gazes deeply into the eyes of Meryl Streep, runs a hand through his shaggy gray hair and murmurs, ``I have the distinct feeling that I'm lost.''  She is immediately enraptured _ and the film's audiences will likely feel the same way.  With just a look and a brief exchange, the actors quickly make one thing clear: Eastwood plus Streep equals a chemical reaction.  This is not always the case with on-screen pairings. When it comes to movie chemistry, you either have it or you don't.  Just ask Streep.  ``Chemistry can't be faked,'' the actress says. ``It's either there or it's not.''  Eastwood, who is also the director of ``Bridges,'' apparently knew from the start that he and Streep would set off sparks as on-screen lovers.  ``Clint came to me and said, `I want you to be in this movie. You must read this script. Take a few days. I will call you. We are a screen couple. I see it,''' Streep recalls.  ``That's the thing about chemistry. You never know it until you see it. I guess Clint just saw it.''  Kathleen Kennedy, one of the producers of ``Bridges,'' says Eastwood did everything he could to make the movie's romance work.  ``There was a call to cast this film much younger, but Clint really fought not to do that. In many respects, the issues in this movie don't mean anything unless you really believe in this couple.''  And just what is it that makes a couple believeable? What is this thing called ``chemistry''?  Here's what some of the stars of this summer's romantic films have to say:  Meg Ryan (who stars with Kevin Kline in ``French Kiss''): ``What makes good movie chemistry? I haven't got a clue.''  Billy Crystal (who trades kisses with Debra Winger in ``Forget Paris''): ``It's just there.''  Sandra Bullock (who falls in love with Bill Pullman in ``While You Were Sleeping''): ``It's this thing.''  Chris O'Donnell (who starts a passionate affair with Drew Barrymore in ``Mad Love''): ``I don't know. But I want it.''  In some cases, the most unlikely twosomes are the ones with the greatest chemistry.  ``Debra Winger is not the actress who anyone would have thought would have the best chemistry with me, but she did,'' John Travolta once said, referring to his ``Urban Cowboy'' co-star.  ``It's not always the physicality that means you'll have good chemistry. It's just that certain qualities mesh.''  Often it takes an experienced director to recognize those qualities.  Lawrence Kasdan says he ``just knew in my heart'' that Ryan and Kline would not disappoint as a couple in ``French Kiss.''  And Kline trusted Kasdan's judgment.  ``A good director knows who to put with whom,'' the actor says. ``You can't make chemistry happen. I suppose you can, but it's just much easier if it's natural.''  A moment later Kline reconsiders.  ``I think good chemistry is a good script. A good script can make good chemistry even if you hate the person you're playing with. They say (Laurence) Olivier and Merle Oberon didn't speak during `Wuthering Heights' and I don't know when I've seen more of a terrific, tense love story.  ``Friction is heat. And heat is good whether it's caused from negative friction or positive friction.''  There was definitely positive friction on the set of ``French Kiss.''  ``Something just clicked with Kevin Kline and myself,'' Ryan says. ``He just cracks me up. When I look at Kevin in this movie with joy, I'm not faking it.  ``You don't have to necessarily like your fellow actor, but man, oh man, if you do, it's a blessing.''  Sandra Bullock understands this feeling. It's something she experienced while making ``Speed'' (1994).  ``Keanu Reeves and I have such great chemistry,'' she says with a sigh. ``You just know from the moment you see us that we're going to get together.''  Surprisingly, some of that chemistry wasn't apparent to Bullock until she saw a screening of the film.  ``I didn't know half of the stuff that was going on when we filmed it,'' she explains. ``I was just looking at the road most of the time. Now I hit pause on my VCR and go, `Ohhhh, look at the way Keanu's looking at me.' I tell my girlfriends, `That's the look! You see that? That's it! That's the way I want a guy to look at me in real life.'  ``It's just so nice when you have that kind of chemistry with somebody. And you don't know why. You just have this thing.''  Bullock had a similar ``thing'' with Pullman during the making of ``Sleeping,'' which was filmed in Chicago.  He says the two hit it off right away.  ``You know you have chemistry when it's 2 degrees in Chicago and you're filming at night near the lake. Winds are whipping in your face, you can't feel your legs anymore, but still you can just fall into this woman's eyes,'' the actor says.  Chris O'Donnell had doubts about whether any sparks would fly between him and Barrymore during the making of ``Mad Love.''  ``I come from this conservative Midwest upbringing where I went to Catholic school,'' he says. ``Drew is, well, Drew. She's had this crazy childhood.  ``She's thrift shop. I shop retail. She's in People magazine. I'm not. But on the set, something just happened. It was like when we were acting scenes out together, it was meant to be.  ``There was this heat. You felt it. It was like physics or something. We were drawn together.''  But even if they hadn't been, things might have worked out all right.  After all, Debra Winger did not get along with Richard Gere during the filming of ``An Officer and a Gentleman'' (1982).  ``(It was) one of the most miserable experiences of my life,'' she said, ``especially doing those love scenes.''  Yet her chemistry with Gere was explosive.  One thing is certain: Good chemistry is crucial to the success of a modern romantic movie.  ``That's why love stories are so hard to do well,'' says ``Bridges'' producer Kennedy. ``You have to tap into something _ an emotion between two people.  ``And audiences are more cynical now, so you really have to be sure of the couple. Or you're sunk.''  Kennedy says she never had a doubt about Eastwood and Streep, two huge stars.  ``I think chemistry is the difference between really good actors and movie stars,'' she explains. ``It's something that happens when you photograph them and they're up on the screen and you don't know why, but something just happens.  ``They just connect in a way that's completely natural. I know a lot of very good actors get very frustrated when they just don't have it.  ``I don't know what dictates chemistry,'' she concludes. ``I suppose if did, I'd put it in a bottle and sell it.'' -0- SIDEBAR: IS MARRIAGE THE KISS OF DEATH FOR MOVIE CHEMISTRY?  Here's a word of advice for big-screen couples: Don't marry your co-star. The minute you say ``I do'' _ or even move in together _ your screen chemistry is almost guaranteed to disappear.  Here's a look at some famous couples who went from sizzle to fizzle after making a commitment in real life:  KIM BASINGER and ALEC BALDWIN  They sizzled: during the early days of their romance, when they made ``The Marrying Man'' (1991).  They Fizzled: when they made ``The Getaway'' (1994) right before tying the knot in real life. Even the sex scenes were boring!  WARREN BEATTY and ANNETTE BENING  They sizzled: when they met and fell in love on the set of ``Bugsy'' (1991).  They fizzled: when, married with children, they made ``Love Affair'' (1994). Their big-screen romance gave everyone heartburn.  TOM CRUISE and NICOLE KIDMAN  They sizzled: when they made each other's hearts race for the first time in ``Days of Thunder'' (1990).  They fizzled: as newlyweds when they starred together in the Irish melodrama ``Far and Away'' (1992) _ which is where audiences stood.  MEG RYAN and DENNIS QUAID  They sizzled: in the screen remake of ``D.O.A.'' (1988), shot during the early days of couplehood.  They fizzled: after getting married and making ``Flesh and Bone'' (1993).  JESSICA LANGE and SAM SHEPARD  They sizzled: in ``Francis'' (1982), which they made before they started living together.  They fizzled: a few years later in the dud ``Country'' (1984),  which was shot after their romance was firmly established.  DON JOHNSON and MELANIE GRIFFITH  They sizzled: in ... well, they never really sizzled on-screen.  They fizzled: in ``Paradise'' (1991) and just about everything they've done together. Now it seems as if their off-screen romance has fizzled as well. c.1995 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.) ------------------------------------------------- (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448; fax: 816-822-1444.)
