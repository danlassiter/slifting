"106923"	"she"	"twists"	" For Wright, the timing couldn't be better. Jay-Z's ``MTV Unplugged'' dropped in late December, the show's broadcast went into incessant MTV rotation, and both served as the perfect introduction to Wright, whose solo debut, ``Denials, Delusions and Decisions,'' was released a few weeks later. A product of the same potent Philadelphia music scene that has spawned the Roots, Jill Scott, Bilal, and Musiq Soulchild, Wright has a voice that at times hints of soul stalwarts Stephanie Mills and Oleta Adams, but there's nothing derivative here. With her big, caramel-thick sound, she twists, bends, and cajoles a song in that unique way that only real singers can. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
