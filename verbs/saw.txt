"58125"	"I"	"saw"	" Tom Dalzell, a slang expert in Berkeley, Calif., pored over his extensive language library and found been and gone and done it, a popular catch phrase in Britain in the late-19th and early-20th centuries. In Eric Partridge's Dictionary of Catch Phrases, P.G. Wodehouse was cited using that older form in a 1903 pre-Jeeves novel: ``Captain Kettle had, in the expressive language of the man in the street, been and gone and done it.'' Partridge compared this with Caesar's Veni, vidi, vici,``I came, I saw, I conquered,'' but that triumphant laconic cry is far from the blase sense of been there, done that today. In the mid-1800s, seen the elephant was used to express supreme indifference, a clip of ``I've been around the world and seen something as exotic as an elephant; therefore, what you say does not impress me.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"

He returned at the end of October. In between, he crisscrossed the country, taking pictures of America a year after the nation had been turned upside down.  Winogrand took nearly 20,000 photographs along the way. He printed about 1,000 of them. From these, he showed different ones at different times; a dozen became well-known, but a vast majority he never exhibited.  Now Trudy Wilner Stack, a curator at the Center for Creative Photography in Arizona (which has Winogrand's archives), has selected about 150 pictures for ``Winogrand 1964,'' at the International Center of Photography. Who knows whether Winogrand would have chosen the same pictures, or even how much he would have cared that somebody else had chosen them for him. He wasn't always bothered about this. Some of the pictures Stack has picked certainly are not great.  But others are, and together they make a fresh, divinely eccentric portrait of America in the aftermath of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.  The resonance with 9/11, though obvious, goes unstated. The show is about when the one era ended (the 1950s), and another really began, even if the people Winogrand photographed didn't always seem to register the change. His own gifts included both an exceptional curiosity about the world and a subtle foresight about the country, notwithstanding that he was a typical New Yorker.  He traveled on a Guggenheim grant. In the application he wrote: ``I look at the pictures I have done up to now, and they make me feel that who we are and how we feel and what is to become of us just doesn't matter. Our aspirations and successes have been cheap and petty. I read the newspapers, the columnists, some books, I look at some magazines (our press). They all deal in illusions and fantasies. I can only conclude that we have lost ourselves, and that the bomb may finish the job permanently, and it just doesn't matter, we have not loved life.''  But he added: ``I cannot accept my conclusions, and so I must continue this photographic investigation further and deeper. This is my project.''  Alienation and affection. Winogrand's twin emotions, simultaneously conveyed. He went to White Sands National Monument in New Mexico and snapped visitors trudging toward a horizon of puffy white clouds, the open door of their white Chevrolet rhyming serendipitously with the curved metal roof of an open picnic shelter: a cliche of mid-century Americana _ the vastness of nature despoiled by tourists _ but deftly transformed into a surreal joke.  ``There is nothing as mysterious as a fact clearly described,'' was how Winogrand put it, which accounts for the preponderance of these visual Freudian slips, incongruities and oddball syncopations. People look out of the frames of his photographs, disconcertingly. They walk away from us. A skinny man in a 10-gallon hat, which seems to weigh about 100 pounds on his head, awkwardly steps onto a sidewalk. A wife stares at her husband, who looks not at the gleaming new Thunderbird engine on display at a Texas state fair but at something we can't see beyond the picture's edge. Gags and puzzles. From underwater we see a woman swimming with a pig.  Winogrand gravitated toward dry humor and also stock types: the beauty queen, the sailor on leave, the politician working the crowd, the little boy wearing Mickey Mouse ears, the black woman beside the white woman, each carefully missing the other's gaze. In later years (Winogrand died in 1984, at 56)these characters could become trite, or worse. But here the subjects are never stereotypes because he cast everything in such wry, oblique terms.  A poor skeptic, he clearly saw the fragility and preciousness of what binds people together. Many of the pictures seem fragile, too: they're fleeting stories sometimes so provisional as to be barely coherent. Because Winogrand didn't keep a diary, it's hard to pin down his route or know even where some of the photographs were taken, but clearly he spent much of his time in Texas and California. He also went to Ohio and Oregon, to Yellowstone and Wonder Cave, sometimes shooting from the driver's seat of his moving car. There are roadside stands, passing trains, crowded sidewalks and an oncoming truck with a small house on a trailer behind it, light bouncing off the truck's windshield like a sunburst _ a mixed-message picture, typical of Winogrand, about American mobility and the open road.  He had at least two cameras around his neck, one with black-and-white film in it, another with color. Sometimes he switched back and forth quickly. The color photographs exploit the high-key, saturated palette of the era: you find color as a dominant theme in pictures like the one from Lake Tahoe showing the yellow-and-black sign of the Tally Ho Motel, the sign sticking out from behind translucent orange-and-blue panels that surround the motel pool, beside which is a bright red Chevy Bel-Air with jutting tail fins and shiny chrome trim.  Elsewhere, you tick off more signifiers of the time, a catalog of an ethos: the cat's-eye glasses; the white gloves; the Buster Brown shoes; the Jack Purcell sneakers; the family sitting in the backyard with the sprinklers on; the beehive hairdos; the head scarves; the hatboxes; the hair curlers; the Brownie cameras; the bouffant-blond cheerleaders in white boots; the propeller planes; the passengers at the check-in counter wearing their Sunday best; and the crowds watching planes take off, including a woman (seen from the side) on whose thighs a mesh fence casts in shadow a simulation of net stockings.  Winogrand noticed the effects of these new places _ airports, malls, suburbia _ before other photographers did, and he identified the peculiar new rituals they inspired. In Portland, Ore., he found a shopping mall with a skating rink in it; he updated Norman Rockwell by shooting a towheaded boy in a striped shirt standing in the striped shadow of the awning at a Sandy's Jr. drive-up window. He celebrated the homey little sight of a man at the arrivals terminal at the Los Angeles airport holding a big sign saying ``Welcome to California Jane'' before a slender woman in white pumps with matching white handbag and a barrette.  Winogrand recognized these manifestations of a new America, with its familiar dreams of prosperity and leisure, and also all the gimcrackery that went along with it. America was a country of hustlers, he saw, but this wasn't all bad. As Stack writes in the show's catalog: ``Winogrand hated being sold, but he loved to witness the seduction.''  So at Dealey Plaza in Dallas, for example, in front of the Book Depository (a famous picture), he focused on the oglers with their postcards and cameras, a man chomping on a cigar, a woman pointing, a lone car in the background almost imperceptibly echoing the president's car _ but the picture avoiding whatever might smack of platitudes or ritual mourning. It's a dark-humored image, almost too good to be true, a cartoon _ but not cruel or without heart. Winogrand was shooting not the sight of the assassination but what had become a new tourist destination: He captured how America, once again, transformed catastrophe into commerce, an inevitable but also strangely redemptive process.  The assumption in this work from 1964 is that what's obvious need not be said and that artists shouldn't preach. People can decide for themselves what they think. A photograph, like life, is too full and inexplicable to be reduced to a single, neat message. This attitude, and the sense that Winogrand conveys of a world, shaken by events but still oblivious to how radically it is about to change, make these photographs both arresting and melancholy.  The show ends with a picture of La Guardia Airport, nearly empty, a briefcase and a clear plastic garment bag full of suits orphaned on a couch, and also with a photograph of the futuristic Unisphere at the new New York World's Fair, a prospective symbol of global harmony.  We look in these images for premonitions of our own time. What we find is that Winogrand was right. We have not loved life enough.  ``Winogrand 1964'' remains on view at the International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 860-1777, through Dec. 1. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020912.0381 type=story > <HEADLINE> TRAGEDY KINDLES DANCE OF HOPE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> NEW YORK  (BC-9-11-HARLEM-DANCE-ART) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
