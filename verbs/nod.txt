And at Neptune Oysters in the North End, owner Jeff Nace finds that customers in general are more wine savvy. Nace, who was a manager for years at Olives in Charlestown, finds that both eating and ordering wine have changed. Back in the early days, people would have a drink, and then order a bottle of wine. Menus now are more diverse, with a lot of small plates, he says, and people are more likely to share several small dishes rather than one big entree. And they want different glasses to match the food. When I first worked at Olives, white zinfandel was the only rose.

INTERNATIONAL (i code) IRAQ (Baghdad, Iraq) -- Developments, including the escape of Iraqi prisoners in the north and a folo on Tuesday suicide bombing.  RUSSIA-PUTIN (Moscow) -- President Vladimir V. Putin on Wednesday directed the Russian Parliament to adopt a 10-year program to stop Russia's sharply declining population, principally by offering financial incentives and subsidies to encourage Russian women to have more children. Putin's instructions formed the center of his annual address, and signaled a new Kremlin priority to confront a problem that demographers and scholars have warned endangers the long-term future of the Russian state. Putin also used the address to criticize the United States for what his government has routinely called double standards in American foreign policies of promoting democracy and human rights. But the Russian president also quickly shifted his tone, and seemed to veer away from the sort of language that recent commentators in the East and West have warned is leading to a chill in relations with the United States. Realizing the gravity of the problem, we should not repeat the Soviet Union's mistakes, the mistakes of the Cold War years, neither in the political sphere nor in the defense strategy, Putin said. He also addressed several other themes, including the need to improve education, revitalize old industries and incubate new economic sectors, and he spent considerable time addressing plans to upgrade the Russian military and security services. By C.J. Chivers.  BIRD-FLU-EUROPE (Rome) -- Defying dire predictions by scientists, flocks of migratory birds returning from Africa did not bring the malevolent H5N1 bird flu virus to Europe this spring. In response to the good news, agriculture officials in many European countries have this month lifted restrictions designed to protect valuable domestic poultry from infected wild birds. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.  IRAN-NUKES (Undated) -- President Bush suggested on Wednesday that the Iranian president's letter to him fell short of the most important issue in the international community by not addressing when Iran would get rid of its nuclear program. In an interview with seven Florida newspapers, Bush made his first public comments on President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's letter, which ranged from African economies to 9/11 to Middle East politics and religion. By Christine Hauser.  An early lede, IRAN, on developments at the United Nations, has moved.  ITALY-POLITICS (Rome) -- A new Italian president was finally approved on Wednesday, in an untidy parliamentary election that nonetheless cleared the way for Romano Prodi to take office next week as prime minister. The choice was Giorgio Napolitano, 80, a parliamentarian for half a century, a former lower house president and, until 1989, a top leader in the Italian Communist Party. The job is largely ceremonial, and Napolitano is widely respected across the political spectrum. But in Italy's poisonous political atmosphere, following last month's razor-close election that narrowly ejected Silvio Berlusconi as prime minister, the polling for president still turned into a full-scale battle. By Ian Fisher.  NATIONAL GENERAL (a code)  CHICAGO-CORRUPTION (Chicago) -- Although plenty of people declared Chicago's famed political machine dead years ago, four aides to Mayor Richard M. Daley will go to trial on Wednesday, accused of hiring people with political connections for city jobs even when they were utterly unqualified, didn't show up for interviews, or were overseas when the supposed interviews took place. A month after the former governor of Illinois was convicted for corruption, U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald now seems determined to prove that the political machine here is alive and well -- and illegal. The question anxious workers at City Hall and eager mayoral hopefuls want to know is how high Fitzgerald's inquiry may reach. By Monica Davey.  CALIF-POVERTY (San Francisco) -- A new study estimates that, if regional cost of living is factored in, California's poverty rates soars from 15th in the nation to 3rd. Because federal programs do not factor in regional numbers, the state is disadvantaged. (Byline TK)  CIA-GOSS (Washington) -- Developments as Congress gives a distinguished service award to their former colleague Porter J. Goss, who stepped down as director of the Central Intelligence Agency last week. By Carl Hulse.  With a photo.  SMALL-BIZ-HEALTHCARE (Washington) -- From ads featuring bright red contour bras to bombarding senators with phone calls and email messages, health organizations and big insurers have amassed an intense campaign against a Republican-sponsored bill that would allow small businesses to provide health insurance to workers. Democratic senators are nearly uniform in opposition, contending that the bill would discriminate against ailing or older workers, and are threatening to filibuster. By Kate Phillips.  CONGRESS-TAX-CUTS (Washington) -- The House takes up legislation to extend President Bush's tax cuts for investors for two more years and to temporarily block a big jump in the Alternative Minimum Tax. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.  CARS-STABILITY-CONTROLS (Washington) -- New technology in some cars called electronic stability controls, the computerized controls that sense skids and prevent them by braking a single wheel, are almost as effective as seatbelts in preventing death and injury, and eliminate many crashes, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said on Wednesday. The institute's finding was quickly endorsed by the National Transportation Safety Board. By Matthew L. Wald.  ANTHRAX (Washington) -- Problems with tests being performed on a new anthrax treatment that the Bush administration had held up as a model of its push to create an anti-terrorism drug stockpile is forcing a two-year delay in the delivery of the drug from 2006 to 2008, as well as a fight between the government and the small California-based company that in 2004 won the nearly $1 billion contract to provide the drug. By Eric Lipton.  FINANCIAL (f code)  FED-RATES (Washington) -- The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised a key interest rate to the highest level in more than five years but signaled that it may pause to assess the impact of its string of rate hikes. The Fed raised its target for the federal funds rate to 5 percent. The funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, stood at a 46-year low of 1 percent when the central bank began raising rates in June 2004 to keep inflation under control. (Summary from wires) By Edmund L. Andrews.  EUROPE-LABOR (Paris) -- European labor markets are encrusted and sclerotic, right? Tell that to Jean-Pierre Lemonnier. Lemonnier is out in front on a seismic shift in the way Europeans work that is provoking the rapid decline of the traditional full-time job. Long taboo in the mindsets of European labor unions and governments, part time work and temporary jobs are becoming by far the richest source of new employment across Europe. The shift has been a critical driver in Europe's employment statistics. Europe still has about twice the unemployment rate of the United States. Yet, in the last five years employment growth for both part- and full time jobs has been faster in the 12 nations that use the common currency, the euro, than in the United States, where the labor market stagnated and even briefly contracted in 2001 and 2002. By John Tagliabue.  TOYOTA-EARNINGS (Tokyo) -- Toyota posted a 17.2 percent jump in net profit, to a record 1.37 trillion yen ($12.1 billion) in the fiscal year ended March 31, enough to make it the world's most profitable manufacturing company. Toyota also released a vehicle sale forecast that analysts said shows it is on track to dethrone floundering General Motors as the world's largest car maker, possibly as soon as this year. By Martin Fackler and Micheline Maynard.  An early lede has moved.  RUSSIA-ENERGY (Moscow) -- With great effort and cost, a Russian drilling crew shipped a rig into an Artic swamp far north of Moscow. They drilled for weeks through rock -- only to find more rock. After drilling eight dry holes in the late 1990s, the crew gave up. Going against the oilman's motto that the only geologist one can trust is Mr. Drill, a team of real geologists returned to the problem in 2002. This time, equipped with 3-D imaging computers, they placed the rig with pinpoint accuracy over the Val Gamburtsev deposit. It is now producing volumes of oil. With innovations such as satellite Internet, Web-camera monitoring of remote fields and drill bits that can turn corners underground, Russia is gradually modernizing its energy machine. Oilfield technology is a multi-billion dollar business here. And if Western majors have it, and Russians need it, technology could become a key to unlock the shackles of nationalist restrictions on Russian oil reserves, analysts say. By Andrew Kramer.  AUSTRIA-ENERGY (Undated) -- The Austrian oil refiner OMV agreed to buy the power generator Verbund in a deal worth up to 13.1 billion euros ($16.48 billion) but which some analysts criticized as a government attempt to create a national energy champion. By Carter Dougherty.  LONDON-EXCHANGE (London) -- The French insurer AXA bought 10 percent of the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq increased its stake by 10 million shares, to almost 23 percent. By Heather Timmons.  ADOPT-A-CLASS (Undated) -- The weekly small business feature: At age 7, Jabious Williams recalls, he walked a mile to a self-serve Exxon station where he offered to pump people's gas for tips. Working after school and on weekends, he said, he typically earned $30 to $50 a day to help support his single-parent family. He and his brother, Anthony, grew up in Anacostia, a neighborhood in southeast Washington, plagued by gang violence. Homeless for a time, they lived with their mother in their aunt's two-bedroom apartment. Four years ago, the Williams brothers founded SAJA Originals, a hip-hop fashion line specializing in custom-made T-shirts. The brothers said they could not have done it on their own and they credit a program sponsored by the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship called Adopt-A-Class. By Paul Wisenthal.  GALBRAITH-ECONSCENE (Undated) -- The weekly Economic Scene column: The Nobel Prize in economics is not awarded posthumously. So John Kenneth Galbraith, who died last month at 97, will never receive one. Yet Galbraith was the most widely read economist of the 20th century and was also considered one of the most influential. There are, of course, many distinguished economists who never receive a Nobel Prize. But the list of winners also includes some whose work has had little lasting impact. So, why did the Nobel committee pass on each of its 36 opportunities to select Galbraith? By Robert H. Frank.

CONGRESS-TAXES (Washington) -- The Senate was expected to give final approval on Thursday for $70 billion in tax cuts, ensuring that virtually all of President Bush's tax cuts would be locked in place until after the next presidential election. The measure, which passed the House on Thursday, would extend Bush's tax cuts on stock dividends and capital gains until 2010 and shield about 15 million affluent families for one year from an increase in the alternative minimum tax. By Carl Hulse.  NSA-MINING (Washington) -- Republicans and Democrats alike in Congress demanded answers from the Bush administration on Thursday about a report in USA Today that the National Security Agency has collected tens of millions of domestic phone records, even as President Bush assured Americans that their privacy is fiercely protected. But Bush's remarks appeared to do little to mollify members of Congress, as several leading lawmakers said that they wanted to hear directly from the telecommunication executives and predicted that the new disclosures would complicate the pending nomination of Gen. Michael V. Hayden--formerly the head of the NSA -- to lead the Central Intelligence Agency. The report suggested that the NSA's domestic surveillance and data-mining operations have expanded further than previously acknowledged. By Eric Lichtblau.  With photos, NYT1-4,11,19.

After years of adding more and more to the regimen -- more drugs, shorter intervals between chemotherapy sessions, higher doses, longer periods of taking of harsh drugs -- they are now wondering whether many women could skip chemotherapy altogether. If the new ideas are validated by large studies, the treatment of breast cancer would markedly change. By Gina Kolata.  FRANCE-EDUC (Nanterre, France) -- There are 32,000 students at the Nanterre campus of the University of Paris, but no student center, no bookstore, no yearbook, no student-run newspaper, no sports stadium, no freshman orientation, no corporate recruiting system. The 480,000-volume central library is open only 10 hours a day, closed on Sundays and holidays. Only 30 of the library's 100 computers have Internet access. Professors often don't have office hours; many don't have offices. Some classrooms are so overcrowded that at exam time, many students have to find seats elsewhere. Sandwiched between a prison and an unemployment office just outside of Paris, the university here is neither the best nor the worst place to study in this rather wealthy country. Rather, it reflects the crisis of France's archaic state-owned university system: overcrowded, under-funded, disorganized and resistant to the changes demanded by the outside world.

Wal-Mart, eager to move further into organic foods and win upscale customers, has been pushing large food manufacturers to create organic versions of some of their well-known brands. This summer, Kellogg is to start offering Organic Rice Krispies, Organic Mini-Wheats and Organic Raisin Bran. Previously, food companies' forays into organic have been tentative and done through their smaller, lesser known natural brands like Cascadian Farms and Back to Nature. This Wal-Mart-inspired initiative, which all major packaged food companies are working on to some extent, is a departure from food companies' traditional strategies and signals the further migration of organic food into mainstream food processing.

ARMY-TRAINING-INJURY (Lawton, Okla.) -- After being injured during basic training, a group of Army recruits at the Fort Sill training center were punished with physical abuse and medical neglect, according to the soldiers and their parents. Injuries were met with derision, they said, often ignored or improperly treated. Two soldiers in the program have died since 2004, one or possibly both of accidental prescription drug overdoses. The latest death, in March, remains under investigation, the Army said. Commanders acknowledge problems and have ordered changes here at the Army's Field Artillery Center and at each of the other four training centers around the country. By Ralph Blumenthal.

And a picture reefer to  OBIT-PATTERSON (Undated) -- Floyd Patterson, a sweet-tempered boxer who rose from a troubled boyhood to become the heavyweight champion of the world, died early Thursday at his home in New Paltz, N.Y. He was 71. In the 1952 Helsinki Olympics, Patterson, with five knockouts in five bouts, won the middleweight gold medal. Then, in a 20-year professional career, he won 55 bouts, lost 8 and fought to 1 draw. His total purses reached $8 million, a record then. He won the heavyweight title twice, knocking out Archie Moore and Ingemar Johansson and becoming the first fighter to regain the title. He lost it twice, defended it successfully seven times and failed to regain it three other times. He generally weighed little more than 180 pounds, light for a heavyweight, but he made the most of mobility, fast hands and fast reflexes. By Frank Litsky.

MIDEAST (Jerusalem) -- Imprisoned members of the Fatah and Hamas factions have drafted a joint platform that calls for a Palestinian state within the 1967 boundaries alongside Israel, the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, said late on Wednesday. He supported the idea, saying: I adopt the position of those heroes. The draft platform also says that Palestinians should focus their resistance on lands occupied in 1967 -- in other words, stop attacking Israelis inside of Israel's 1967 boundaries, but continue to attack those in the West Bank. But the draft platform was rejected on Thursday by a Hamas spokesman in Gaza, Mushir al-Masri, who said the united Hamas platform is clear, and we would not recognize agreements that include recognition of Israel.

SRILANKA (Colombo, Sri Lanka) -- A fierce gunbattle at sea on Thursday left at least 17 Sri Lankan navy sailors and about 50 guerrillas dead, according to the military, in the deadliest and most serious violation of the 2002 cease-fire accord. Within minutes after the clash, the Sri Lankan military bombed what it called rebel posts in the north and east of the country, marking the second time in two weeks that the government has conducted air strikes.

INDIA-AIDS-PATENTS (New Delhi, India) -- AIDS groups this week initiated an important test of the nation's new patent law, which restricts the ability of Indian companies to produce low-cost generic drugs. Two patient rights groups sued to stop the drug tenofovir, which is available as a generic drug, from being granted a patent. If it is patented, the groups contend, making the cheaper versions will become illegal, and the drug would become too expensive for patients both here and in other developing countries. The patent law, enacted last March to bring India into line with World Trade Organization rules, was designed to regulate the country's large pharmaceutical industry, which is known for making copies of Western medicines. International organizations providing medical aid fear this could be the beginning of the end of affordable generic drugs. By Amelia Gentleman and Hari Kumar.  Story has moved.  INDIA-CHILD-RUNNER (New Delhi, India) -- When Budhia Singh, who is believed to be about 4 1/2 years old, ran 65 kilometers on May 3 -- about 40 miles -- he entered the Limca Book of Records in India and, more important, stirred a nationwide frenzy. Master Marathon! newspapers declared, or, less elegantly, Run in a million! Budhia's miserable background as a slum child who was sold by his destitute mother as a toddler for 800 rupees, or $18, was already known to those few Indians who had been following his career since last fall, when he ran a marathon. That only enhanced his popular appeal, and local politicians fell over themselves to be photographed next to the child. But others were not so enchanted by the spectacle. Soon after Budhia had been paraded on national television as a miracle infant and role model for aspiring Indian child sports stars, the country's most powerful human rights body began an investigation into whether the spectacle constituted child abuse.

ABORTION-PILL (Atlanta) -- Federal health authorities have discovered that a seventh woman has died after receiving a medical abortion, although she did not take the abortion pill RU-486. The death was revealed at a meeting of the nation's leading health agencies here to discuss the safety of RU-486, which has been linked to the deaths of six other women. The objective of the meeting was to create a research strategy that would help solve the many mysteries surrounding the women's deaths.

TOP  Lede story (1-col. hed with 1-col. of art):  NSA-MINING (Washington) -- Republicans and Democrats in Congress demanded answers from the Bush administration on Thursday about a report in USA Today that the National Security Agency had collected tens of millions of domestic phone records, even as President Bush assured Americans that their privacy was fiercely protected. Bush's remarks appeared to do little to mollify members of Congress, several of whom said they wanted to hear directly from the telecommunication executives and predicted that the new disclosures would complicate the pending nomination of Gen.

Off-lede (1-col. hed, top center):  CONGRESS-TAXES (Washington) -- The Senate completed action Thursday afternoon on a $69 billion bill that extends tax cuts for investors for two more years, sending the measure to President Bush for his signature and giving the White House a welcome victory on Capitol Hill. The 54-44 vote, a day after the 224-185 approval in the House, extends tax cuts on dividends and capital gains -- the centerpiece of Bush's 2003 tax-cutting package -- for an additional two years. It also temporarily blocks a big jump in the alternative minimum tax. Passing the bill was a high priority for Bush, though the measure fell short of the president's original goal of making permanent all of his major tax cuts from 2001 and 2003. By Carl Hulse.

, he says,	 He does not give up easily, though at various times he has been tempted. In his 40s, while living in Los Angeles and working in recording studios, he reached a protracted bottom point with alcoholism and, he says, almost died from it. Soon after, in his 50s, he nearly quit jazz altogether to become a classical composer. Born in Kansas City, Mo., in 1929, Brookmeyer had a largely unhappy youth that coincided with the killer years of Kansas City swing, when Count Basie was the North Star. He first heard Basie at the Tower Theater in 1941, at a Sunday matinee between showings of western movies, with his father. </P> 	nyt_eng_200605.gz
, he suspects,	 A year after Brookmeyer's Basie epiphany, Charlie Parker left Kansas City, about to help invent bebop, and jazz changed. When Brookmeyer was working in the city's black clubs, first as a trombonist at 15, then as a pianist at 17, Parker was making his first significant bebop records in New York. These were critical for a young musician to absorb. He listened to them repeatedly at 16 rpm, on a Navy-surplus phonograph, transcribing Parker's lines by ear. The exercises did him good. At that stage of the game, he said, bebop was such a distant language that what I learned, I owned. But he preferred to play in swing bands. They were more fun for me, he explained. Some of the beboppers played very well, but they seemed to imitate the worst parts of progress: heroin, bad attitudes, cliquishness.
