E PLURIBUS PAULSEN: THE CANDIDATE WE NEED  By BILL TAMMEUS  KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The man who should be the next president of the United States was wandering the corridor of Kansas City International Airport the other day looking a little lost.  Pat Paulsen was alone, wearing khaki pants and a navy blue jacket _ the kind you might play golf in on a cool, windy day. He seemed absorbed by something, perhaps focused on a distant baggage claim area.  ``Mr. Paulsen,'' I said, giving him the deference to which the next president is entitled, ``if I'd known soon enough that you were going to be in Kansas City now, I'd have invited you to speak at the annual convention of the National Society of Newspaper Columnists.'' (I'd been elected convention chairman by a mudslide.) ``And I'd have come, too,'' he said unflip-floppily.  What a draw Paulsen would have been. He's been running for president off and on since 1968, after being urged to do so by the Smothers Brothers, on whose TV show he became famous by dead-panning wonderful lines, none of which I can remember because, well, it was the 1960s and even those of us who didn't inhale find the time a little blurry.  Anyway, as I was about to tell him how long I'd been a fan, Paulsen showed me a document that proves he's the most qualified to be president. It's called, simply, ``Pat Paulsen's Constitution.'' and ``it took me a whole afternoon to write.'' It begins: ``I, the people of the United States. . .''  How long have we sought a leader like this? Here's a man willing to be the incarnation of a whole people. He boldly walks where no man has walked before. . .except for a few evil fascists and Rush Limbaugh.  My advocacy of Paulsen moves to insistence when we get to Article I, Section 1 of his constitution: ``All legislative powers herein shall be vested in the President of the United States of America for life.''  Now, this may seem to tend toward evil fascism, but there's a good argument to be made that the U.S. is ready for a radical new approach to governance _ one that would change our system of passing laws, which resembles an unchaperoned bus full of seventh graders. Besides, except for once (in the military) getting so drunk he was stopping traffic and climbing trees, Paulsen has never done anything to indicate he couldn't be trusted with authority.  In fact, his constitution shows us how he'd use it. Look, for instance, at a section called ``Repeal of Amendment XXVI.'' It says: ``The President recognizes the right to censure those of unbearable ignorance, shown by their insipid use of improper English grammar `ya know, ya know.' Therefore, the right to vote shall be denied to those under the age of thirty.''  It's a wonderful move, though meaningless. Statistics, after all, tell us most folks under 30 don't vote anyway. But whatever effect it had surely would be positive, forbidding suffrage to the largely insufferable.  Another part of the Paulsen constitution shows him to be the kind of mind we need: ``Knowing that no college or college person comprehends the complex issues or has any clue to life or living whatsoever, the Electoral College is hereby terminated and power returned to the President.''  Maybe you think I'm kidding about Paulsen. Harrumph. I'm willing to abide by his proposed ``Amendment to Amendment I,'' towit: ``Understanding the role of the press and its invidious and pernicious writings, and knowing its bias against most sitting Presidents, freedom of speech is hereby abolished.''  Hey, invidious and pernicious are the nicest things we've been called in a year. So I'll be sporting the button Paulsen gave me: ``Pat Paulsen for President. United We Sit.'' Is there a better way to get through 1996? Well, except for prone, I mean.  GOOD DAY, WIRE WANDERERS!!!!!  Offer not available in any store! (Or any other news service!)

Besides, except for once (in the military) getting so drunk he was stopping traffic and climbing trees, Paulsen has never done anything to indicate he couldn't be trusted with authority.  In fact, his constitution shows us how he'd use it. Look, for instance, at a section called ``Repeal of Amendment XXVI.'' It says: ``The President recognizes the right to censure those of unbearable ignorance, shown by their insipid use of improper English grammar `ya know, ya know.' Therefore, the right to vote shall be denied to those under the age of thirty.''  It's a wonderful move, though meaningless. Statistics, after all, tell us most folks under 30 don't vote anyway. But whatever effect it had surely would be positive, forbidding suffrage to the largely insufferable.  Another part of the Paulsen constitution shows him to be the kind of mind we need: ``Knowing that no college or college person comprehends the complex issues or has any clue to life or living whatsoever, the Electoral College is hereby terminated and power returned to the President.''  Maybe you think I'm kidding about Paulsen. Harrumph. I'm willing to abide by his proposed ``Amendment to Amendment I,'' towit: ``Understanding the role of the press and its invidious and pernicious writings, and knowing its bias against most sitting Presidents, freedom of speech is hereby abolished.''  Hey, invidious and pernicious are the nicest things we've been called in a year. So I'll be sporting the button Paulsen gave me: ``Pat Paulsen for President. United We Sit.''

E PLURIBUS PAULSEN: THE CANDIDATE WE NEED  By BILL TAMMEUS  KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The man who should be the next president of the United States was wandering the corridor of Kansas City International Airport the other day looking a little lost.  Pat Paulsen was alone, wearing khaki pants and a navy blue jacket _ the kind you might play golf in on a cool, windy day. He seemed absorbed by something, perhaps focused on a distant baggage claim area.  ``Mr. Paulsen,'' I said, giving him the deference to which the next president is entitled, ``if I'd known soon enough that you were going to be in Kansas City now, I'd have invited you to speak at the annual convention of the National Society of Newspaper Columnists.'' (I'd been elected convention chairman by a mudslide.) ``And I'd have come, too,'' he said unflip-floppily.  What a draw Paulsen would have been. He's been running for president off and on since 1968, after being urged to do so by the Smothers Brothers, on whose TV show he became famous by dead-panning wonderful lines, none of which I can remember because, well, it was the 1960s and even those of us who didn't inhale find the time a little blurry.  Anyway, as I was about to tell him how long I'd been a fan, Paulsen showed me a document that proves he's the most qualified to be president. It's called, simply, ``Pat Paulsen's Constitution.'' and ``it took me a whole afternoon to write.'' It begins: ``I, the people of the United States. . .''  How long have we sought a leader like this? Here's a man willing to be the incarnation of a whole people. He boldly walks where no man has walked before. . .except for a few evil fascists and Rush Limbaugh.  My advocacy of Paulsen moves to insistence when we get to Article I, Section 1 of his constitution: ``All legislative powers herein shall be vested in the President of the United States of America for life.''  Now, this may seem to tend toward evil fascism, but there's a good argument to be made that the U.S. is ready for a radical new approach to governance _ one that would change our system of passing laws, which resembles an unchaperoned bus full of seventh graders.
