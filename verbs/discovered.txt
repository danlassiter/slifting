We talked about cosmetic surgery and we asked to see the scars. We talked about lovers and we named names. We talked, and laughed, about the art of faking an orgasm. We agreed that after all our earlier confusion and concern about men, it turns out they are not nearly as complex as we thought. Nor are they as complicated as we are.

EARTH'S HEART OF IRON (800 words) By TIM APPENZELLER  This past year geophysicists made a computer-aided visit to Earth's inner core, simulating the behavior of iron at the crushing pressures that prevail there. At the heart of our planet, they discovered, inside the thick envelope of liquid iron that gives rise to the geomagnetic field, there may be a metallurgical marvel: a single, perfectly ordered crystal of iron, a thousand miles or more across.

WASHINGTON NEWS (``w'' category)  CLINTON-APPOINTMENTS (Washington) _ President Clinton and the Republican Senate are waging election-year warfare over the confirmation of 135 presidential appointees. White House officials accuse the Republicans of delaying the confirmations to hold open vacancies in hopes that a Republican is elected president in November. Republicans insist that each presidential nominee is merely getting the scrutiny needed for such senior positions. By STEWART M. POWELL.  DRUGS-COLOMBIA (Washington) _ U.S. relations with Colombia are at a record low over allegations that Colombian President Ernesto Samper is in cahoots with the notorious cocaine cartels. A major break may be in the offing March 1, the day the Clinton administration must certify whether Colombia is _ or is not _ doing all it can to fight drugs. By DAN FREEDMAN. (Filed Thursday.)  POLITICAL NEWS (``p'' category)  LAMAR-ALEXANDER (Nashua, N.H.) _ A year ago, Lamar Alexander cruised down the main street here virtually unnoticed. On Friday, in a statistical dead heat with Bob Dole and Pat Buchanan in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, Alexander's red and black plaid shirt could not be seen for the wall of television cameras and reporters surrounding him. By BENNETT ROTH.  GRAMM-MONEY (Washington) _ The fact that Sen. Phil Gramm dropped his bid for the presidency after only two weeks into the GOP primary season is proof that lots of money is no guarantee of success. Gramm raised $21 million last year, more than any candidate except front-runner Bob Dole. By ELIZABETH SCHWINN. (Also will move in ``w'' category.)  COMMENTARY (``k'' category)  FRENCH-RESISTANCE (San Francisco) _ The recent book by historian Douglas Porch questioning the effectiveness of the French resistance during World War II sparked an outcry in the San Francisco area. The reaction of David Klugman, who fought alongside the French, was typical: ``I thought, `How dare he?' There are things you cannot deny. To deny the Resistance is like denying the Holocaust. It is absurd.'' By EDVINS BEITIKS.  THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ TV commentator Pat Buchanan loves the title ``Mr. Conservative,'' But a more proper designation would be ``Mr. Yesteryear'' _ the Ghost of Politics Past. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON. (Filed Wednesday.)  SPORTS (``s'' category)  49ERS-UNIFORMS (San Francisco) _ Thirteen thousand people cared enough to interrupt their days, pick up the phone and express their opinions in The San Francisco Examiner's poll on the 49ers' new uniforms. Which blows the water out of the ``Why is this important?'' argument. Of course it isn't important, which is why so many people think that it is. By RAY RATTO.  MOON-TRIAL (Richmond, Texas) _ Felicia Moon takes the stand in the trial of her husband, NFL quarterback Warren Moon, on domestic assault charges.  NATIONAL NEWS (``a'' category)  SCHOOLS-ADMINISTRATORS (Oakland, Calif.) _ The Oakland Unified School District, which striking teachers accuse of being bloated with bosses and tightfisted toward employees, has the eighth-highest ratio of administrators to teachers in the state, a San Francisco Examiner analysis of state data shows. By VENISE WAGNER.  ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)  LETTERMAN (Undated) _ David Letterman tells journalists in a conference call that he thinks an upcoming HBO film about him and Jay Leno is ``pointless'' and says he is prepared to leg-wrestle the new ``punk'' heading CBS. By MIKE McDANIEL.  For Sunday:  POLITICAL NEWS (``p'' category)  NEW-HAMPSHIRE (Manchester, N.H.) _ Every New Hampshire presidential primary is one for the history books. Bob Dole can be excused for thinking the chapters about him have been written by the Marquis de Sade. Sixteen years ago, Dole ran seventh. Eight years ago, he was blown away by George Bush. Now, in the final weekend before the first-in-the-nation primary, he sees his lead slipping away. By CRAGG HINES.  WASHINGTON NEWS (``w'' category)  ECONOMY-POLITICS (Washington) _ Is it still the economy, stupid? You wouldn't think so surveying the Republican presidential field, which so far has given relatively short shrift to economic issues in deference to the rather insulting mantra of Bill Clinton's staff, when he ran for president four years ago. By CHRIS WOODYARD.  NATIONAL NEWS (``a'' category)  TEXAS-SHOOT (Dallas) _ A man shoots two teens for stealing wheel ornaments from his car. Two men shoot and kill their own daughters when they mistake them for burglars. A man shoots a thief with a shotgun. In only one case was the shooter indicted. Experts say that's just the way things are in Texas: If you are defending yourself or your property against harm _ or if you believe that's what you are doing _ you can shoot to kill.

"69394"	"he"	"discovered"	" When the virus is activated, Epstein said, it makes a protein that releases natural brakes on cell growth. In fact, he discovered, this viral protein does the same thing to cells that a notorious cancer gene, p53, does to cancer cells when it lets them proliferate. With their molecular brakes released, it seemed, the smooth muscle cells could grow, forming plaque and clogging the artery.

The girl's parents have private meeting with Clinton, attend the signing ceremony and are presented with the pen. By RON HUTCHESON. Story will move in ``w'' Washington category.  US-BOSNIA  WASHINGTON _ Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison is one of several GOP senators who raise objections to Pentagon plans to keep 7,500 U.S. troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina for nearly six months as a ``covering force'' to close out the NATO peace operation in that war-torn country.

There have been so many sightings of atheist leader Madalyn Murray O'Hair, from Houston to Las Vegas, that it's beginning to resemble reports of Elvis and Amelia Earhart, fumed a spokesman for the American Atheists Association. Spike Tyson said the filing of a missing person's report by O'Hair's long estranged son was a crass publicity stunt for the born-again political lobbyist. By BARRY SHLACHTER.

UTA-FEES  AUSTIN, Texas _ The University of Texas at Arlington relies too heavily on student fees to cover losses in its athletics budget when the those revenues for academic programs, according to a report released yesterday by the House Higher Education Committee. The report urges the university to wean itself of subsidies for intercollegiate athletics by increasing gate revenues and by seeking more cash contributions from private donors. It also questions the amount spent for athletics at the University of North Texas. By JOHN MORITZ. Story will move in ``n'' regional category for Texas points only.  TEEN GIRLS-ESTEEM  FORT WORTH, Texas _ Not long ago, therapist Beth Hossfeld was seated in a small circle of 13- and 14-year-old girls. She asked them to draw their perception of the phrase ``body image.'' Working silently and individually, all but one nonetheless came up with the same picture. ``Every single one of them drew a caricature of a `babe,''' Hossfeld said recently. ``Blond and skinny and with big boobs.'' The other girl drew a flat-chested, skin-and-bones waif, a la model Kate Moss. If Hossfeld was troubled by the images, so, she discovered, were the girls. Girls face particularly menacing obstacles, experts say, because of pressures to be thin, pretty and nice. The problems appear daunting, but women across the country, most of them mothers to daughters, have taken it upon themselves to see that more girls successfully negotiate the minefield of adolescence.

BLUES-MOELLER-SIZE  DENTON, Texas _ The best blues compact disc this year isn't by a superstar such as Buddy Guy or an old legend like John Lee Hooker, and it's not from Memphis or New Orleans or the mean streets of Chicago, either. Nope, the best blues CD of 1996 (so far, anyway) is by a couple of largely unknown 25-year-old Denton guitarists who currently work day jobs to pay the rent, and it's on a tiny Dallas label with only three previous releases. ``Return of the Funky Worm,'' by Johnny Moeller and Paul Size on Dallas Blues Society Records, is top notch in a genre full of bad imitations of the real deal and superstars marking time.

FILM-REVIEW-MIGHTY DUCKS  When it comes to creating uplifting movies about downtrodden, underdog sports teams, nobody does it like Disney. When it comes to landing on a successful premise, milking it dry and then wringing the carcass for every last drop, nobody does that like Disney either. It's not that ``D3: The Mighty Ducks'' is a bad movie. The problem lies in that we didn't NEED another ``Mighty Ducks'' movie. Their story has been told. For criminy's sake, let sleeping ducks lie.

"83179"	"she"	"discovered"	" One thing Dern had to get past, she discovered, was her pedigree. Daughter of two respected actors, Bruce Dern and Diane Ladd, who divorced years ago but recently made a film together, Dern is educated and describes herself as politically liberal. For a while, this presented a problem. Payne's script had no trouble lampooning what it calls the baby savers. The danger was that it would be tilted toward the liberal pro-choicers and degenerate into a mere political cartoon. The trick, Payne realized, was to become an equal-time offender and send up the liberals, too. ``When he saw one of the Operation Rescue people spouting off and saying, `You feminist lesbian liberals,' he said, `Oh, lesbians. Let's make them lesbians, too.' So we threw that stereotype into the mix.'' So while anti-abortion marcher Mary Kay Place wants Ruth to wear a bunny sweatshirt, lesbian pro-choice organizer Swoosie Kurtz favors a Frida Kahlo shirt. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

"97847"	"I"	"discovered"	" I had gone to Britain to answer a question that seems far more pertinent today than it did early last month: Why would a free and flourishing Western democracy wire itself up with so many closed-circuit television cameras that it resembles the set of ''The Real World'' or ''The Truman Show''? The answer, I discovered, was fear of terrorism. In 1993 and 1994, two terrorist bombs planted by the IRA exploded in London's financial district, a historic and densely packed square mile known as the City of London. In response to widespread public anxiety about terrorism, the government decided to install a ''ring of steel'' _ a network of closed-circuit television cameras mounted on the eight official entry gates that control access to the City. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"

It is equally evident in the first moments of peace at the only radio station in the city, which this week shed its Taliban name and recast itself as the media arm of its patron's former foe. The rebirth of the station can be seen either as a testimony to disloyalty or as an achievement of adaptability and resilience. The Kunduz broadcast tower, no longer a beacon for the Taliban.

One showed a grateful woman in traditional Tibetan dress ladling grain to a Chinese soldier. The message: ``Breathing the Same Air, Sharing the Same Fate, Hearts Joined to Hearts.'' The adjacent sign featured the heroic faces of three Chinese Communist titans -- Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin -- in front of the Potala Palace, one of Tibetan Buddhism's most sacred sites. That Chinese ideal meets the reality of Tibet today in a small plaza where the billboards hang.

This month, Khaliq is the voice of the Northern Alliance, broadcasting triumphant reports of the expulsion of Taliban soldiers from Kunduz and the glory of the mujahedeen who have taken control. In Afghanistan, allegiances are malleable. Khaliq in his office at the radio station, Thursday. (Chang W.

A. Reynolds. Reynolds, seen talking to a neighbor on Thursday, founded the garden in 1965 as part of his efforts to help his family truly integrate into the neighborhood of Inwood in Upper Manhattan.

The award completes a kind of circle for Dugan, this is the second time he has won it. His first book, ``Poems,'' won that award in 1962, then the Pulitzer Prize and the Prix de Rome of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. ``Stuff just comes out of my unconscious, and I write it down,'' he says. ``And then I revise it over and over.''

Mother Afghangol, left, says the Taliban took her 16-year-old daughter Nargis a week before they fled Kabul. Nargis was walking to a bread oven in the neighborhood with her 9-year-old sister Lida, right. Though little noticed amid the near-chaos and transition in the country, dozens of families claim that their daughters were taken by the Taliban in the years they ruled. The kidnappings accelerated in the days before the fleeing troops left Kabul, many here say.

When asleep, he has such bad nightmares his screams wake up his neighbors. When awake, he experiences flashbacks: Being tortured. People executed. The war won't end for those like Karimi once the Taliban is defeated. Aftershocks rumble through Afghan refugees' psyches long after they make it to America. Karimi has been in America for a year. Karimi has a disarming smile and light brown eyes that exude warmth. But his smile evaporates and his voice assumes a detached, robotlike tone when talk turns to war.

Using people politically is what political families do. Still, the Bushes and Kennedys occupy a particular piece of American society, a territory both rarified and cruel. They know what it is like to succeed and fail on the highest possible political levels. The current rapprochement is very calculated, and very pragmatic, but still there must be something in at least a few Bushes and Kennedys that recognizes a similar species, chooses to sniff curiously and then pass on by, peaceably. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20011130.0040 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (PM-BUDGET-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> c.2001 New York Times News Service  For FRIDAY PMs  Here are the top news stories from The New York Times News Service for PMs of Friday, Nov. 30.

McNeil Jr.  With photo NYT 34 and map  NATIONAL _ GENERAL (Moved in ``a'' category)  TERROR-RIGHTS (Undated) _ The Bush administration's aggressive expansion of the government's powers to arrest and prosecute people in fighting terrorism has stirred a legal battle that could last many years and redefine the powers of the executive branch, lawyers and leaders of civil liberties groups say. By William Glaberson.

By Riva D. Atlas.  ENRON-CALIF (Los Angeles) _ Looking at the reaction in California, where Enron has often been portrayed as the villain in that state's messy deregulation. What are the Enron's assets in the state and do power companies and utilities face any exposure from the collapse of Enron? By Laura D. Holson.  UNITED-AIRLINES-CUTS (Undated) _ United Airlines is preparing to ask all its employees for wage cuts, according to people close to the company's plans, while the rest of the country's struggling airlines wait to see what United does before seeking concessions themselves. At a meeting on Thursday in Washington called by federal mediators, United told the International Association of Machinists that it was ``Looking for sacrifices from all the employees'' as a way to stanch losses now running at $15 million a day and regain profitability, according to participants. By Laurence Zuckerman.  INVITATION-ONLY-SALES (New York) _ Suddenly, this holiday season, special, invitation-only promotions are everywhere: Gap, Banana Republic and Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, among others, have plans to use this marketing strategy. The spread of such sales, which usually include only friends, family and best customers, is a sign of just how soft sales are this season for fashion retailers and how jaded consumers have become to regular markdowns.

By George Vecsey.  FBC-MIAMI (Undated) _ Miami has one last hurdle to clear on its way to a national championship game. The hurdle is in Blacksburg, Va., where the Hurricanes will take on a formidable Virginia Tech team on Saturday. By Joe Drape.  ENTERTAINMENT (Moved in ``e'' category)  TRAVOLTA-MOVIES (Los Angeles) _ John Travolta sat quietly in a square, well-cushioned chair along the back wall of his home screening room. He had just finished watching ``Yankee Doodle Dandy,'' a bio-pic about the legendary George M. Cohan, a movie that's been dear to him since he was a little boy in New Jersey. Travolta rubbed his eyes as the screening room door swung open and his wife, Kelly Preston, arrived with their 18-month-old daughter, Ella Bleu, on her hip. ``Someone wants to say goodnight,'' Preston said, to which Travolta offered a broad, brave smile. But she was not fooled, squinting instead into her husband's red eyes. ``Have you been crying?'' she asked. Yes, he had been crying; there was no use denying it. The movie that had meant so much to him as a boy, he discovered, still had the power to reach into his heart.

"102343"	"I"	"discovered"	" Since Sept. 11, I discovered, Al Jazeera has become only more incendiary. The channel's seething dispatches from the ``streets of Kabul'' or the ``streets of Baghdad'' emphasize anti-American feeling. The channel's numerous call-in shows welcome viewers to express opinions that in the United States would be considered hate speech. And, of course, there is the matter of Al Jazeera's ``exclusive'' bin Laden videotapes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"

"102750"	"they"	"discovered"	" Residents of this pastoral hillside town awoke about 3 a.m. to a helicopter overhead and then gunfire, followed by tanks in the street. Their electricity, they discovered, had been cut. The Israeli army said it had given the local commander advance warning of the attack, so that he could order his officers to stay in their homes. But the commander, Col. Kamal Kadomi, said the call had come after Israeli forces were already in Saflit and his men were being shot. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"103259"	"she"	"discovered"	" Underlying causes of estrangement, she discovered, range from sibling rivalry and inheritance feuds to mixed marriages, divorce and in-law problems. Problems with family businesses can also become a source of estrangement. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"105902"	"I"	"discovered"	" The ribbon on the top was too tight. The mesh, I discovered, was at the level of my eyebrows rather than my eyes, so I couldn't see anything directly in front of me that wasn't level with my head or higher. Loose threads from the embroidery on the inside of the burqa tickled my nose and made me sneeze. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"106567"	"I"	"discovered"	" Curious about the status of my wintertime entertainment, I discovered, via the Internet, that those companies formerly under Foster Gallagher are busy with this year's orders and making up for disappointed customers from last year. According to the Plants By Mail FAQ, maintained by Joe Robinson, Foster and Gallagher's assets were purchased by Gardens Alive. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"107091"	"he"	"discovered"	" Petrenko found that the electrical charge on the surface of ice, including snow crystals, creates an opposite electrical charge on the surface of anything the ice contacts. Those opposite charges attract, forming an electrical bond. By varying the electrical charge, he discovered, it is possible to increase or decrease the strength of the bond. ``One theory is that ice is pulled into regions where the electrical field is strong,'' he said. ``The ice tries to fill the void.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"110604"	"they"	"discovered"	" Although no one could point to a recent study of the numbers of blacks playing leading roles in films _ whether as actors, directors or producers _ the Directors Guild of America did a study in 1999 of the amount of work that women and minorities had received in 1998. Minority film directors, they discovered, worked only 7.7 percent as much as the average union director. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"111245"	"we"	"discovered"	" The final approach is down a steep ravine, and we heard the falls well before we saw them. A robust stream vaults the lip of a towering hill, then free falls for dozens of feet before crashing into the escarpment below. There's an inviting pool at the base, but the water is chilly and it's best to plunge in while still sweaty from the hike. The gusty, wet winds generated by the falls, we discovered, quickly lead to second thoughts. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"

"113079"	"he"	"discovered"	" When 31-year-old Harold Morgan purchased the latest issue of Amazing Spider-Man, it was the first time he had plunked down cash for a comic book since he was 15. The years, he discovered, had made a difference. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"113436"	"I"	"discovered"	" The morning after we arrived, then, we motored on our guided wooden scow into the center of the market. As the small boats gently knocked against one another, something caught my ear: ting-ting-bop-ting-ting. It turned out to be a piece of wood being smacked against a metal tube by an old man hunched over several steaming pots in a small covered sampan in the middle of the river. This, I discovered, was the man who called himself Chu Nam. He was 71 and the market's legendary noodle seller. As he passed us bowls of beef noodle soup through his little window, Chu Nam said he had sold this dish, a Mekong lunch staple called hu tieu, on the river for 51 years, through three wars, three foreign occupations. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"116695"	"I"	"discovered"	" I stayed away from the comic-book kids in high school and college, though they were not always easy to avoid. There was the roommate who, I discovered, was slipping out one night a week to play Dungeons &AMP; Dragons. (Betrayal!) Or the friend of his who showed up dressed as an orc, part of his role-playing adventure. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"120159"	"we"	"discovered"	" There we spent our last night surrounded by vineyards and stayed in what used to be the vintners' imposing 19th-century manor house. Today it belongs to a transplanted Parisian, who, we discovered, had moved out of our Paris neighborhood about the same time we moved in. (Besides a new bathroom, our room had soaring ceilings, shining wood floors and an antique sleigh bed for our daughter.) </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"
"120830"	"he"	"discovered"	" The man who carried the flame of Inuit art to the outside world was James Houston, an artist and graphic designer who landed in the eastern Arctic town of Cape Dorset in 1948 looking for subjects to paint. Instead, he discovered, and promulgated, the thriving art he found among the Inuit, primarily their miniature stone, bone, and ivory carvings. Working with the Canadian Guild of Crafts, the government, and the Hudson's Bay Co., Houston taught printmaking and shared modern marketing ideas with the Inuit. The art ``went supernova,'' in the words of Houston's son, John, and thrust the Inuit headlong into the white man's 20th century. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"
"121701"	"I"	"discovered"	" I took up sewing after my daughter was born. Cutting out fabric with crummy scissors, I discovered, was just as frustrating as cutting out paper dolls with crummy scissors. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"125654"	"he"	"discovered"	" But Halley was _ and is _ nothing if not ``a political junkie,'' and his friend ``had just waved a fix in front of my face.'' Halley handled the Hillary Clinton event, a day-long swing through New York's Westchester County. ``That one short trip,'' he writes, ``proved to be enough to get me to quit my job, sell my house, and run away to join the circus.' And Hillary Clinton, he discovered, was not just ``a natural'' who could deliver a powerful political speech, but someone who enjoyed the circus as much as he did. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"127259"	"I"	"discovered"	" Not long ago, I set out to buy a new TV. Now this I could do. Buying a television is a simple proposition, a question of inches. You decide how many, then you stare at the screens in the darkened showroom, and pick the one you like. Or so I thought. The advent of digital television has complicated things enormously. In fact, I discovered, we are in a bewildering transition period, somewhere between the analog age we grew up in and a digital age when, by government edict, everything will be transmitted with absolute clarity whether we want it or not. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"129825"	"she"	"discovered"	" Phoebe Berline of San Mateo, Calif., learned this the hard way after she got laid off from her job at a Silicon Valley PR firm. Her Social Security number, she discovered, was printed on each unemployment check she received. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"130071"	"we"	"discovered"	" But when you encounter something as monumental as the falls, we discovered, there are more ways than one to approach it _ from wet to dry, low to high. Here are a few of them. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"130704"	"they"	"discovered"	" In the space of a few thousandths of a second, they discovered, the tadpoles, about a tenth of an inch long, stick their mouths out in a tubelike shape and quickly suck water into it, along with whatever prey (a brine shrimp makes a tasty morsel) happens to be there. But it's not that the tadpoles get lucky; they've first sighted their victim and gotten close enough to it to easily capture it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"132276"	"he"	"discovered"	" Once an embryo is implanted, he discovered, the uterus undergoes a change that gives it ``privilege'' from the immune system. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"132618"	"he"	"discovered"	" New light on the controversy came when Robert D. Ballard, a discoverer of the wreck of the Titanic, subsequently found the Bismarck's resting place in 1989. The sinking battleship, he discovered, had slid down an undersea mountain for nearly a mile. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"135014"	"he"	"discovered"	" But as well as acting as a ski accelerator, Petrenko has modified his device so that it can also function as a brake. The key, he discovered, is to pulse the electric field across the electrodes for less than a millisecond. This melts the surface of the snow, but allows it to refreeze almost instantly. As the ice crystals re-form, they grip the bottom of the ski and create friction. Petrenko believes that his ski brake could be hugely useful for beginners, and also for cross-country skiers who want better purchase when traveling across flat ground or climbing hills. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"

"136510"	"he"	"discovered"	" But Frum began to reconsider after spending time with Bush _ never, to any significant extent, one on one, but at least occasionally with groups of other staffers. The private Bush, he discovered, ``was tart, not sweet . . . not the easy, genial man he was in public.'' The president Frum met was completely impatient with small talk and supremely confident in his ability to surround himself with the best advisers. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"139605"	"he"	"discovered"	" But even those three look like pikers next to Brian Walker, the Rocket Guy, temporarily famous for trying to build and launch his own rocket. Human Error is not just about the rocket, though. It's also about Natasha, a Russian woman whom Walker met on the Internet, brought over and married -- who, he discovered, enjoyed porn Web sites (stuff that would make you sick) and who quickly left him. But he got over it, with his sense of humor intact: I want to do a line of toys ... designed so that if a child had an IQ below a certain level, they wouldn't survive the toy. So you weed out the gene pool at a young age. Stupid kids are not nearly as dangerous as stupid adults, so let's take them out when they're young. </P> 	nyt_eng_200407.gz
