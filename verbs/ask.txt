"26006"	"you"	"ask"	" First, you ask, what is a mule? It's the breeding result of a male donkey and female horse. A mule is gentle to ride, has stamina and is a pleasant companion, perfect as a mount to tread the steep trail to the bottom of Grand Canyon. Tourists do it every day, and the ride down and up is a kind of modern adventure. The trouble is that too many summer tourists want to ride the mules. NOW is not too late to reserve a mule Summer 1996. It's easier to go in the winter, but it's often a cold, uncomfortable ride. Sometimes you can sign up as a standby and, with luck, go the next day. More often not. There are two basic trips. Up and down in one day: $102 per person, including lunch. Down, overnight at Phantom Ranch, and up: $250.25 for accommodations and all meals. The rules: mandatory broad-brimmed hat, long pants, long-sleeved shirt, canteen and solid-toed shoes; each rider must be taller than 4 feet 7, speak fluent English, be in good physical shape and unafraid of heights; nobody rides who weighs even an ounce more than 200 pounds (fully clothed and carrying gear), and weight must be proportionate to height (''If you are significantly overweight, we cannot let you ride.'') And yes, park rangers weigh each and every rider _ ``Don't assume we'll ignore an extra pound or two and let you ride. We won't.'' The mule appreciates it.

Where, indeed, is the proof of nonracialism? Is it a scourge to be black, we ask? . . .''  Deeds: The Organization of African Unity, of which Zimbabwe is an important member, has not been noted for showing leadership on Somalia, or on any other African nation in trouble. The United Nations pulled its peacekeepers _ though not its relief and development workers _ out of Somalia last year because the faction leaders refused to work for a political settlement. Among the lessons learned in Somalia and elsewhere is that unless there is a willingness to end conflict and strong regional support for peace initiatives, intervention by outsiders is likely to be doomed.  President Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire  Words: ``As regards Africa, with its mosaic of ethnic communities, with its economic lag, with its social handicap, I affirm that both within and outside the continent, we must make solidarity, security and development our watchwords for action and the spearhead of the fight against discord and injustice in the world.''  Deeds: For more than 30 years, President Mobutu has ruled oppressively, mainly to enrich himself and his inner circle as the lot of ordinary Zaireans has deteriorated. He served notice recently that he would expel hundreds of thousands of refugees from Rwanda by the end of the year if the United Nations did not move them first. He has allowed extremists who threaten renewed civil war in Rwanda and Burundi to operate from his country. In a land where development has been in reverse for years, a presidential palace with an international airport may be his most durable legacy.  President Jacques Chirac, France   Words: ``Let no one doubt France's determination to ensure the success of the negotiations on the definitive comprehensive and verifiable ban on nuclear testing in 1996.

The nuclear detonations provoked strong comments from the leaders of Japan and New Zealand, among others, reflecting the outrage of Pacific nations. Only France and China continue nuclear test explosions, after pledging this year at an international conference to phase them out.   Gen.

Security is synonymous with the basic rights _ security, truth, political, economic, social systems _ and keeping in mind one's future and one's peace in accordance with cherished values and ideas.''  Deeds: The military leaders of Myanmar seized power in a 1988 coup, put the democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest for six years and ignored the results of an election in 1990 won by her party. They define security narrowly to protect themselves from the intrusion of human rights groups and international organizations seeking to promote democracy.

Though he talks of internationalism, the representative of Myanmar is telling the world to leave his country alone. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"

YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS STUFF UP  STOCKHOLM _ A Swedish television Christmas show's choice of Santa Claus was met with outrage when it was revealed that Father Christmas would be portrayed by a convicted child molester.  Pay channel TV 1000's Christmas gala ``A thousand and one nights'' will feature Hans Scheike, who was sentenced to six years' imprisonment in 1988 for grievous bodily harm and sexual assault involving children.  Scheike led a notorious sex sect on a Swedish farm in the late 1980s, in which young teenagers were held as sex slaves.  News of the program's choice of Santa unleashed a storm of protest from former victims and their parents, but Scheike, who was released from jail in 1991, said he could not understand what the fuss was about.  ``People can get upset about anything,'' he told evening tabloid Aftonbladet.  _REUTERS  BILL'S WORLD  By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star  Strong winter storms mean a white Christmas in New England. But with or without a budget deal, Washington's will be red.  Mr. Clinton has vetoed several spending bills recently. At least he hasn't been singing, ``NO!-el, NO!-el.''  The president says he wants to ``give the American people their government back by Christmas.'' Fine, but they'd rather have a new CD player.  The goal of Congress and the White House is to get a balanced budget plan by New Year's Day. Beware of any plan written after 10 p.m. New Year's Eve.  ``Balancing the budget,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``is more important to our children than anything else.'' Maybe, but for Christmas just try giving them nothing but your written pledge to work on balancing the budget.  A new poll shows Bill Clinton and Bob Dole in a dead heat in New Hampshire. And from what meteorologists say, that's a good description of the weather there, too.  The U.N. has turned over peacekeeping in the Balkans to NATO. It remains to be seen whether doubling the initials of the outfit in charge will help.  If people really do all the things they're putting off ``until after the holidays,'' they'll be busy every night until next Christmas.  To help with the holiday rush, the Postal Service hired 40,000 seasonal workers and leased 116 airplanes. Sounds like an outfit that could use some management advice from Santa.  What the kids on Santa's lap are saying: ``When you come to my house, could you install Windows 95 on our computer? Dad couldn't figure it out.''  India is astir over a novel written by its prime minister. Indians, like Americans, must expect their politicians to reserve their fiction for speeches.  The little boy next door would worry a lot more about the government shutdown if Santa required an official visa.  ``We are beginning to win the fight against crime,'' says Mr. Clinton. We had more of his speech to quote here, but somebody stole it.  In the New Hampshire primary, 45 candidates will be on the ballot. A few probably haven't even heard of themselves.  ``The Japanese are in the midst of a serious recession,'' Mr. Clinton says. Makes us wonder what a humorous recession would look like.  Scientists think they've demonstrated the existence of subatomic particles named glueballs. Bet it makes you glad you decided not to go into physics.  Private donations are keeping the national Christmas tree lit in a park behind the White House. Folks must be giving current-see.  ``The American people,'' says the president, ``have made it clear that they want political reform.'' For one thing, it will give their kids, when they grow up, something to reform.  NATO'S new secretary general, Javier Solana, once demonstrated against Spanish membership in the group, but changed his mind. Besides, there's no evidence that he ever inhaled.  ``I have consistently, all year, said things that made no sense for the speaker of the House,'' says Newt Gingrich. Yeah, but, as he says, at least he's been consistent.  A new poll shows voters nationally are leaning toward Democrats in the next Congressional election.

Pay channel TV 1000's Christmas gala ``A thousand and one nights'' will feature Hans Scheike, who was sentenced to six years' imprisonment in 1988 for grievous bodily harm and sexual assault involving children.

"47501"	"they"	"ask"	" For the second time in six weeks, the Federal Reserve moved to stimulate the economy by nudging down interest rates. The decision to cut by a quarter point the Federal funds rate, to 5.25 percent, and the discount rate, to 5 percent, is likely to ripple through the economy, nudging down the rates charged for corporate borrowing, home mortgages, auto loans and more. And the data showing that economic growth is slowing continue to pile up: the Commerce Department reported that consumer prices rose just 2.5 percent in 1995, the lowest rate in nearly a decade, while the Labor Department reported that nonfarm payroll jobs fell by 201,000 and the unemployment rate rose to 5.8 percent. It all provided fuel for those who criticized the Fed's decision to raise interest rates seven times in 1994-95.

Trent Lott, fighting to hang on to his job as Republican leader, on Wednesday lashed out at anonymous White House leaks calling for his ouster, and vowed that no matter what, he would not relinquish his job as majority leader. As the embattled Mississippi senator affirmed his desire to stay, Republicans on Capitol Hill and in the administration lined up for and against him. Sen. Lincoln Chaffee of Rhode Island became the first Republican senator to call for him to resign, while Secretary of State Colin Powell said he was ``disappointed'' by Lott's remarks. But Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah threw his support behind the Republican leader. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.  An early version of this story has moved.  STATES-PRISONS (Lexington, Ky.) _ After three decades of building ever more prisons and passing tougher sentencing laws, states are suddenly being forced to confront the unthinkable _ chose between keeping taxes low and being tough on crime. Keeping taxes low is winning. States are closing prisons, laying off guards, easing mandatory sentences and limiting the numbers and types of crimes they are prosecuting. Almost every state is involved. In Kentucky, officials have begun to release inmates to save the costs of their confinement. By Fox Butterfield.  SCI-BREAST-CANCER (Undated) _ Researchers have found a genetic signature in breast tumors that seems to be a powerful predictor of whether the cancer will spread and kill or whether it can easily be cured by surgery, causing no further harm. The research involved relatively few patients, all relatively young, and its conclusions remain to be confirmed by further studies. But scientists said the genetic signature _ the activity of a collection of 70 genes _ appears to predict cancer mortality better than traditional measures like tumor size or stage or whether the cancer has spread to a woman's underarm lymph nodes. By Gina Kolata.  With graphic.  WTC-REBUILD (New York) _ In a remarkable civic tutorial on architecture and contemporary urban design, seven teams of architects from around the world unveiled new designs for the World Trade Center site on Wednesday as part of a restarted process to mend the hole left in Lower Manhattan's soul by the Sept. 11 attack.

By Richard Sandomir.  With photo, NYT29.  TERROR-YEMEN (Washington) _ In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, the global campaign against terrorism forced the United States into an important but uneasy alliance with Yemen and its president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, a volatile army commander who seized power in Yemen in 1978 and who sided with Iraq during the Persian Gulf War of 1990-91. A look at the relationship as it stands today. By Patrick E. Tyler.  IRAQ-KURDS-ARMY (Kalak, Iraq) _ Kurdish soldiers call themselves peshmerga, meaning ``those who face death.'' Though they live off their lore as guerrillas who carried on the Kurdish struggle during decades when no one else could, their transition to standing army since the Kurds gained quasi-independence in 1991 has been difficult. They are hardly a modern force. Now they approach a moment of reckoning. If war comes to Iraq, will they be called to fight with American soldiers, like the Northern Alliance did in Afghanistan? Increasingly, Kurds are answering their own question. Their answer is no. By C.J. Chivers.  With map and photo.

LIFESTYLEDOLL-WARS -- ATLANTA -- Beetle-driving, dreamhouse-having, prom dress-wearing Barbie dolls beware! You're being outdone by a fresh new posse called the Bratz. Manufactured by MGA, they're hipper and attracting the lil' homegirls like mad. So Mattel has shot back with their own hip-hop-hoodlum take on its own Barbie, the Flavas crew _ a diverse collection of cool kids in fly gear. It's doll wars before a cardboard graffiti wall backdrop, and little girls age 8-12 will determine which pack of playthings ultimately rule. (Moore, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 18  WITH PHOTO.  RELIGION-GUSHEE -- WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The Bible is the most subversive book in the library. (Gushee, Palm Beach Post). 14.  ENTERTAINMENT/ARTS  BOOKS-LYING-LAIRS -- ATLANTA -- Liberal humor commentator Al Franken's new book ``Lies a.d Uhe Lying Liars Who Tell Them'' lands in court today (8/22) thanks to a lawsuit filed by Fox News Channel, and also in bookstores, as the publsher rushed it out early to capitalize on the lawsuit.

(Kloer, The Atlanta journal-Constitution). 20.  EDs: WITH PHOTO of book jacket.  BOOKS-CRACKERS -- ATLANTA -- Review of a new book on the early days in Atlanta baseball, especially Ponce de Leon Ballpark and the Crackers and Black csacke EDs: WITH PHOTO of book jacket.  TV-PROCEDURAL-DRAMAS -- AUSTIN -- Procedural dramas are everywhere: CSI, Without a Trace, Cold Case, The Handler, Law &amp; Order, Dragnet ... these are shows in which the nuts-and-bolts of crime or law or medicine is the star, not the characters. They're driven by detail and intrigue rather than emotional connection. Why are they so hot right now? We look, we ask, we conclude. (Holloway, The Austin American-Statesman).

CAMP-REVIEW -- ``Camp'' is based on the real-life Stagedoor Manor, a summer camp for kids who aspire to theater careers, in the Catskills.

DVD-CHICAGO -- WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The DVD of!tle year's Oscar-winning Best Picture Chicago is a genuine rarity _ a disc whose deleted scene actually deserved to be in the movie, instead of the usual B-grade excess. It is the John Kander-Fred Ebb musical number Class, a duet by Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifah as murderess Velma Kelly and prison matron ``Mama'' Morton, singing of the lack of refinement and manners in the Windy City '20s, with tongue-in-cheek crude lyrics.

"139858"	"they"	"ask"	" The two dancers say that the rules are archaic and that they have proved that two men can dance powerfully and still be artistic. Moreover, they ask, if questions of gay identity and inclusion are being engaged in the workplace and in the bonds of marriage, then why not in professional and amateur sport? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"141568"	"you"	"ask"	" So, you ask, what's the solution? Aging fans have to feed their need to root for someone, besides just rooting against Jeff Gordon. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"142971"	"I"	"ask"	" They give you an education, and then it's almost as if it's been taken away if this Dream Act doesn't pass and become a reality, said Rincon, 20, who is studying communication disorders at UH. There are those who say, 'Finish your degree and go back to your home country.' But then, I ask, 'Where is that? I thought I was from here.' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"143342"	"they"	"ask"	" Workers who feel out of place in party central workplaces need to know that they're not going to be blackballed because they go straight home after work. If that understanding can't be met, sometimes it's better to find a workplace that's a better fit. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20040929.0151 type=multi > <HEADLINE> EARLY-FRONT-PAGE-NYT </HEADLINE> <TEXT> Here are the stories New York Times editors are planning for Page 1, Thursday, Sept. 30.

TERROR-COLE-SENTENCES (Cairo, Egypt) -- A judge in Yemen sentenced two men to death and four others to prison terms of up to 10 years on Wednesday for the deadly attack in 2000 against the warship USS Cole. The convictions were the first stemming from the water-borne suicide bombing, which provided an early glimpse of the brazen nature of Osama bin Laden's global terror network. By Neil MacFarquhar.  An early lede has moved.  AVIAN-FLU (Bangkok, Thailand) -- Public health systems around the globe are scrambling to prepare for a possible avian influenza pandemic. The two main responses to a flu pandemic would be vaccines and anti-viral medicines. But both are in extremely short supply, because of patent issues and manufacturers' concerns about whether they can recoup investments if a pandemic does not occur. Senior World Health Organization officials have been strongly critical of vaccine manufacturers this week for having done too little to prepare the world for the possibility of a pandemic this winter. WHO leaders met with representatives of the world's main vaccine producers on Wednesday in Geneva to ask that they move faster. By Keith Bradsher.  CAMPAIGN-DEBATE (Washington) -- As a curtain-raiser on Thursday's presidential debate in Florida on foreign affairs, a look at the candidates' positions on the issues. By James Bennet.  With photo, NYT17, and graphic.  CAMPAIGN-MO (St. Louis) -- Is Missouri a swing state that has already swung? So it seems to many people here on the eve of the first presidential debate. Sen. John Kerry has not visited the state in the last two weeks and may not be back, local Democrats say, until the second debate on Oct. 8. While Missouri's 11 electoral votes are certainly a prize worth winning, the state also carries a symbolic significance as well. In every presidential election since 1900, with the single, surprising exception of 1956, Missouri has gone with the winner, usually by a margin closely approximating the national figure. Neither wholly Southern nor wholly Northern, fully Eastern nor fully Western, it is America writ small. By R.W. Apple Jr.  OBESITY-INSURE (Undated) -- Who should pay for Americans to try to lose weight? For decades the answer has almost always been the patients themselves. That may soon change. At a meeting in November, Medicare's advisers will assess one increasingly popular method of weight loss: surgery. Already, Medicare officials have signaled they are open to the idea of covering obesity treatments. In July, they rescinded a policy of refusing to pay for medical care intended only to treat obesity. And coverage for surgery may be only the first step. Already commercial diet programs as well as doctors in academia and private practice say they want coverage for their programs, too. But many obesity experts are raising questions about this movement. At a time when health care cost are soaring and expected to balloon further as the population ages, they ask, are weight-loss treatments the best use of money, or are they unnecessary medicine? By Gina Kolata.  BBO-EXPOS (Washington) -- Baseball is returning to the nation's capital for the first time in 33 years, in the form of the Montreal Expos. Expos president Tony Tavares said Major League Baseball told him Wednesday his team was moving, shortly before Washington officials planned their own announcement to celebrate the news.

"144241"	"they"	"ask"	" If there is a caveat in some reviews, it is the suggestion that Cloud Atlas is merely first-rate literary ventriloquism. Has Mitchell perhaps hidden too convincingly behind his bravura pyrotechnics, they ask, so that it is impossible to tell which voice is really his? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"146956"	"they"	"ask"	" But the demands to bring back Christmas are not simply part of an age-old culture war, with the ACLU in one corner and evangelicals in the other. There is also a more moderate force, asking whether the country has gone too far in its quest to be inclusive of all faiths. Why, they ask, must a Christmas tree become a holiday tree? And is singing We Wish You a Merry Christmas in a school performance more offensive than singing Dreidel, Dreidel, Dreidel? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200412.gz"
"148966"	"they"	"ask"	" I would say that in two-thirds of the offices I visit, they ask, 'What does the task force say?' Zwolak said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"151009"	"they"	"ask"	" Dari, a taciturn man with an air of cold authority, greets his guests in a dim office off the mosque's main hall, which is surrounded by a moat and tall minarets designed to look like Kalashnikov rifles. Then the guests get down to business. Will Dari, they ask, be willing to help bring Iraq's Sunnis into politics? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"152454"	"you"	"ask"	" If you're trying to engage a sports hero, you ask, 'How can we leverage this relationship?'  Bolling said. One person can only give you so much. . . . To use a sports analogy, (an effective relationship with a celebrity) is like a base hit. It moves us to the next base, and that's what we do every day -- base hits. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"154905"	"you"	"ask"	" No one mistakes you for a sports fan. In fact, you ask, has this year's basketball season ended yet? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"159547"	"you"	"ask"	" While the news has not been particularly good for Owens, there is a bright side. According to Fox's Jimmy Johnson: He has seen his last big payday. He has cost himself millions. But, hey, who thought Elvis Presley would earn more money after he died than while he was alive? Have you seen those figures? Elvis made $45 million last year. Now what, you ask, do they have in common? Simply this. No matter where Owens goes, whenever he leaves, everyone is all shook up. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"159747"	"you"	"ask"	" But, you ask, isn't there some kind of no net loss rule? Don't developers have to build a new marsh every time they fill one? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
"161285"	"you"	"ask"	" To B.V., Weymouth: Did the TV chefs who plate their creations steal the verb from the sports pages, you ask, or the other way around? Neither, I suspect. Baseball's use of plate to mean score is probably just a verbing of the noun; home base was called the plate as early as 1857. The cook's use, to put on a plate, is an equally obvious verbing. (Researchers were plating lab cultures as early as the 1890s.) Both new uses have been around since the '70s, so if novelty is their only defect, they're well along the road to respectability. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"163781"	"they"	"ask"	" Their lawyers have asked if the rooms where they and their clients conferred were bugged or videotaped and if their e-mail messages and telephone calls were intercepted. If so, they ask, on whose authority? But the government has refused to answer, saying the questions were outside the realm of the lawsuit. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"165619"	"they"	"ask"	" Crisis consultants applaud all the moves. But they note that clusters of Fusarium keratitis, the eye infection, began surfacing in Asia as far back as November. So why, they ask, did Bausch wait so long to tackle the issue here? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"166500"	"you"	"ask"	" But, you ask, shouldn't the movie be condemned on moral grounds? After all, hasn't it been conclusively proven that the secret parchments found in Paris' Bibliotheque Nationale in 1975 identifying Leonardo and other illuminati as guardians of the Grail -- the factual premise of the book -- was a hoax? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"166592"	"they"	"ask"	" But Shannon and other officials said Chavez's longtime friendship with President Fidel Castro of Cuba and Venezuela's growing relationship with Iran could no longer be ignored. What, they ask, would prevent Chavez from sharing terrorism-related intelligence with Castro or President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran? The United States lists both countries as state sponsors of terrorism. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"167798"	"you"	"ask"	" So, you ask, how is this possible? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"168076"	"you"	"ask"	" You're not the kind of guy who'd ever be caught dead with a prosecco, are you? What is that, you ask, some kind of girly wine? Hey, did someone turn off the air conditioning? Now what will you do? It's getting hot. It's getting sweaty. You can't take it, can you? You've got to go? Exit, stage left! </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"171964"	"I"	"ask"	" If I am given such a message, I ask, 'Why are you spreading hatred among human beings? What is your agenda?' said Abdul Rauf Farooqi, a Lahore-based member of the board of the National Religious Schools Council. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172306"	"they"	"ask"	" Away from the studio, his is an almost surprisingly normal life - your basic dad stuff, like coaching his kids' soccer and basketball teams. He jokes that when people see him in the flesh, they ask, Where's the horns? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172319"	"you"	"ask"	" What, you ask, is Coppola up to? The Simple Life Versailles? It's a tempting possibility, since the first quarter of Marie Antoinette presents, in unsparing detail, the minutia of royal etiquette and Marie's annoyance with it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172405"	"you"	"ask"	" What, you ask, is Coppola up to? The Simple Life Versailles? It's a tempting possibility, since the first quarter of Marie Antoinette presents, in unsparing detail, the minutia of royal etiquette and Marie's annoyance with it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172716"	"they"	"ask"	" Critics say the outfit has sat on its hands. Who, they ask, doesn't know that the Mormon Tabernacle Choir is in Utah? And how hard can it be to find the Olsen twins? The list has received a lot of publicity online, and the Olsens, the Mormons and many others have been paid, but not without criticism directed at SoundExchange. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"173836"	"they"	"ask"	" But fees for high-speed Internet connections at full-service hotels are the No. 1 gripe among business travelers. Why pay $9.95 a night at an Embassy Suites, they ask, when it's free at a Holiday Inn that charges a lower room rate? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
