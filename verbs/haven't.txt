"111605"	"I"	"haven't"	" A: No, I haven't, and it probably wouldn't be helpful for me to do something like that. I don't think this is about personality. And I am more than a reluctant participant in discussions with media, as I have been advertised. I actually think that the place of a commander and a soldier is to be doing the planning and be trying to think through how to get a mission done and keep people alive. And I'd rather just focus my energy on that. It is hard enough to be a personal representative of a whole lot of people wearing this uniform and walk into a baseball stadium and throw a parabolic pitch and have thousands of people stand up and clap. That is an emotional thing for a person who is not really interested in that. I don't know if you call that being an introvert. I'm not really sure. I am not comfortable doing that. I am reluctant to do it because I think it's too easy for people to pay more attention to the way they believe they are being perceived. If you pay too much attention to that kind of stuff you are probably not paying enough attention to what you really need to be doing. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"

Maybe a 40-car wreck, and that may be stretching it at that. Those guys would have to finish in the right spots for that to happen. I haven't even looked at it because there are too many good racecars and drivers in between myself and what would have to happen.
