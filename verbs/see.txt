In the latest issue of Dispatches, Farah asserts that the novel, about ``a brief, but intense adulterous affair so powerful, passionate and even mystical that it leaves its participants discontented with their former and future lives,'' has ``no redeeming values'' and that the story line ``mocks American values and standards of civility.''  Iowa housewife Francesca Johnson ``betrays her husband and family,'' writes Farah, for National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid, because ``he talks about art, music and magic.''  ``Social restraints and standards of behavior, you see,'' writes Farah, ``are for `other' people.'' You can't read the book, says the conservative, ``without being struck by the arrogant elitism of these social misfits. They eat only vegetables, while the overweight and barbaric yokels from Madison County actually slaughter their prize livestock.''  Citing a speech in which Kincaid complains that artistic passion can be wrecked by the need to make a living, Farah likens him to ``one of those malcontents who live off grants from the National Endowment for the Arts while decrying the tastes of the tax-paying rubes that make them possible.''  ``Bridges,'' he concludes, celebrates ``infidelity, lack of commitment and false notions about the meaning of true love.''

In the latest issue of Dispatches, Farah asserts that the novel, about ``a brief, but intense adulterous affair so powerful, passionate and even mystical that it leaves its participants discontented with their former and future lives,'' has ``no redeeming values'' and that the story line ``mocks American values and standards of civility.''  Iowa housewife Francesca Johnson ``betrays her husband and family,'' writes Farah, for National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid, because ``he talks about art, music and magic.''  ``Social restraints and standards of behavior, you see,'' writes Farah, ``are for `other' people.'' You can't read the book, says the conservative, ``without being struck by the arrogant elitism of these social misfits. They eat only vegetables, while the overweight and barbaric yokels from Madison County actually slaughter their prize livestock.''  Citing a speech in which Kincaid complains that artistic passion can be wrecked by the need to make a living, Farah likens him to ``one of those malcontents who live off grants from the National Endowment for the Arts while decrying the tastes of the tax-paying rubes that make them possible.''  ``Bridges,'' he concludes, celebrates ``infidelity, lack of commitment and false notions about the meaning of true love.''

These, as you know, are silkworms, which by some digestive alchemy turn mulberry leaves into $159.95 silk blouses that have to be dry-cleaned. They deserve praise, and right now, until Oct. 9, are the subject of much adulation at Montreal's famed Botanical Garden and Insectarium. Four thousand years of silk-making is explained, from beginnings in the Orient as a cloth only for gods and emperors to the ``haute couture'' fashions of France. The gardens are something of a spectacle. Thirty themed areas are maintained, from Japanese to medieval monastery, along with a marsh and bog section for those interested in skunk cabbage. The Insectarium displays 150,000 bugs, some living, most not. ``Bombyx mori'' is now a centerpiece of this great world collection, and should be. The silkworm, you see, caused women to crave silk hosiery. But when World War II came along, isolating Asia, silk hosiery was one of the first casualties. American ingenuity came up with a substitute _ nylon. Nylon became hose, and it was only a modest leap to one of the 20th century's greatest inventions: pantyhose. Thank you, ``Bombyx mori.''

ATTN) IMOGEN CUNNINGHAM: PHOTOGRAPHY IN WIDE RANGE OF STYLES (EDS: Exhibition notes at end of review) (lb) By CHARLES HAGEN c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  NEW YORK _ By the end of her long career, Imogen Cunningham had become one of the most colorful and revered figures in photography. Stooped and white-haired, with a camera around her neck, she was a familiar sight around San Francisco until her death in 1976 at age 93.  To young photographers she seemed the embodiment of the medium's rich history, and living proof of the important role women have played in it.  Despite the affection and admiration showered on her, few people knew the full range of her work. And much the same could be said today. Books and shows of her photographs have been produced in California and Europe in recent years, but her pictures have not received comparable attention in New York.  All of which makes the current retrospective of Cunningham's photographs at the Howard Greenberg Gallery in New York, organized in association with the trust she set up to oversee her estate, that much more welcome.  Part of the problem in trying to consider the scope of Cunningham's achievement is simply that she was active for so long. Over more than seven decades she worked in a wide variety of styles, producing distinguished images in most of them.  Cunningham began to photograph in Seattle in 1905, using a camera she got as part of a correspondence course. Pictorialism, with its emphasis on the use of soft focus and elaborate printing techniques to express emotions, was then in its heyday, and she quickly became a leading West Coast practitioner of the style.  One of the earliest pictures in the current show reflects the hyperventilated artiness that characterized many of Cunningham's first efforts, and pictorialism in general.  Titled ``The Wood Beyond the World,'' the photograph shows two veiled women, wrapped in shadows, standing in the dappled light of a forest; one has thrown her head back and raised her arm to her forehead in a theatrical gesture of despair.  Images of this sort, as well as outdoor nude studies of her husband, the painter Roi Partridge, established Cunningham's reputation. But she is best known for the sharp-focus modernist images she made in the 1920s and '30s, after she moved to San Francisco.  Not that she jettisoned her pictorialist instincts completely. Her most famous images, close-up studies of plants and flowers taken in the 1920s, combine modernism's emphasis on detail and abstraction with essentially romantic subject matter.  In a photograph of an agave plant from this period, for example, a delicately sinuous shoot emerges from the hoodlike frond that protects it. Photographed against a black background, the image is a striking study in abstract form, but at the same time it pulses with vitality.  Many of Cunningham's other plant studies are similarly allusive. In another photograph from the 1920s, for example, the broad leaf of a water hyacinth extends toward the camera like a shiny tongue, and in a depiction of an aloe in a pot, the plant is seen in near silhouette, with one spiky frond etched in light like a bejeweled point on a crown.  In photographs of nudes, too, Cunningham often showed less devotion to pure form than did other leading modernists.  A 1932 image of the back of a crouching woman recalls pictures by Edward Weston in its formal directness, but Cunningham took the photograph from a slight angle, producing a view of the model that is less strictly geometric but arguably more human than many of Weston's nudes.  In the 1930s Cunningham and Weston were both members of Group f.64, a loose organization of West Coast modernists that took its name from the lens opening that produces an extremely sharp image.  In the next decade, though, she shifted away from formal studies and made documentary shots of people in the street, several of which are included here. These are not among Cunningham's successes, and they are interesting mainly as evidence of the diversity of her work.  In later pictures she moved even further from her earlier photographs, using negative printing, solarization, double exposure and other unconventional processes to produce images.  A double exposure from the 1960s seems to make explicit some of the implications of Cunningham's own early plant studies. In it, ghostly hands appear on top of the image of an aloe plant, with fingers and fronds jumbled together, all outstretched and reaching.  In the last years of her life Cunningham was again onto something new, photographing for ``After Ninety,'' her collection of portraits of older people, which was published after her death. None of these pictures, though, are in the Greenberg show, which rightly emphasizes work from the 1920s and '30s, when Cunningham did her best work.  Like Ansel Adams, another Group f.64 member, Cunningham became something of a celebrity, famous as much for her longevity and perseverance as for her pictures.  In presenting a diverse sampling of her work, this show offers a welcome opportunity to reconsider her career in its entirety. Its chief frustration is that it can include only a small selection of her varied and often quietly beautiful images.

Unless otherwise noted, they are for use at any time.  Stories are moving in category shown at end of each budget item.  Entertainment/Lifestyle  PSYCHOLOGY _ Have you quit making New Year's resolutions because you are tired of failing? (LeCrone 600).  National  ASTRONAUT-SCOTT _ On Jan. 11, U.S. Navy Capt. Winston E. Scott will become the seventh black astronaut to go up in space and the second to do a space walk. He also will be the first member of my family to go on a space mission. He is my uncle, my mother's brother. ``This is definitely a pinnacle (in my career),'' he recently told me. ``It is higher than I've been before.'' ``Oh, c'mon,'' I teased him. ``I'm sure that pun was not intended.'' In between chuckles that make his Adam's apple slide up and down, he assured me that it was not. That's how he's always been _ genuine. (Nealy 1300).  DOCTOR-LAWSUIT _ Eric Straumanis is so sick with cancer that his bones break on their own. The 57-year-old retired educator can't leave his Bartow, Fla., home. He needs frequent blood transfusions, and his doctors can't do anything now but try to dull his pain until the disease kills him. Straumanis doesn't want to have to wait that long. He and a Jupiter doctor sued the state Wednesday to overturn its 127-year ban on assisted suicide, claiming it violates Florida privacy guarantees and the U.S. Constitution. (Croft 650).  Business  WEDDING-STORE _ Now the bride and groom can walk down the aisle, picking up everything they need along the way. The department store aisle, that is. We Do _ The Wedding Store expects to be the first superstore chain in the bridal industry. Plans call for 40 stores throughout the nation within five years and projected annual sales of $200 million by that time. The grand opening of the 26,000-square-foot flagship store in Dublin (near Columbus) takes place on Sunday, Jan. 7. (Moss 700).  FMC-HUMANRIGHTS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Freeport-McMoRan Copper &AMP; Gold Inc. says investigations by a Roman Catholic bishop and an Indonesian commission show conclusively that the company and its employees did not participate in human rights violations in Indonesia. But human rights and environmental organizations in Australia and Indonesia, citing the same investigations, say Freeport was not examined and therefore was not exonerated of allegations by unidentified purported eyewitnesses that its security personnel shot at and chased civilians and separatist rebels. (Haurwitz, 2Takes).  Sports  OLY-DREAMERS _ Olympic dreamers are a special breed: Visionaries who hoped Atlanta could become a modern-day Oz of graceful pedestrian bridges, towering space needles and sleek people movers zipping across the skyline. But with roughly 200 days to go before the Games, many of those dreamers are being jolted from their reverie by a painful pinch of reality and finding out that waking up is hard to do. Many of the projects they proposed were doomed from the start, usually by a lack of money or common sense. But nearly all of them were infused with an enthusiasm that was hard, but hardly impossible, to resist. (Harris 750).  OLY-BILLBOARD _ ATLANTA _ A total of 10,500 athletes, 196 countries, one city . . . And, oh yeah, 35 million billboards. And that's just inside the Perimeter. OK, so that's an exaggeration. That tends to happen here, where the billboards are so all- encompassing, it's like being trapped inside a cyclorama of commercials. The only thing more soaring than the billboard rhetoric is that pole vaulter going up and _ grunt! _ over the Holiday Inn billboard on 14th Street, or those giant 3-D steer's horns on a steakhouse billboard practically impaling motorists on once venerable Peachtree. It's Atlanta! (Vejnoska 700).  OLY-SWIMMER _ ATLANTA _ The way it was: Edward VIII ascended the throne of England, then abdicated amid a scandal over ``the woman I love,'' divorcee Wallis Simpson; Margaret Mitchell won a Pulitzer Prize for ``Gone With the Wind''; Bruno Richard Hauptmann was convicted of kidnapping and killing the Lindbergh baby. Background: Feisty and independent, Eleanor Holm was the finest backstroker of her day. The daughter of a Brooklyn, N.Y., fire captain was just 14 years old when she placed fifth in the 100-meter backstroke in the 1928 Olympics. Four years later, Holm won a gold medal in Los Angeles and an informal poll named her the most beautiful and graceful athlete of the Games. In 1933, Holm married band leader Art Jarrett and joined his act singing in nightclubs. By day, she trained wherever she could find a pool. Memorable moment: Holm never swam in Berlin in 1936. She was thrown off the U.S. team for drinking champagne aboard the ship carrying the athletes to the Games. (Rosen 600).  OLY-FEEDBACK _ Feedback comments on the 1996 Olympic Games. (480).  OLY-PREDICTION _ Today (Friday) is Atlanta's 148th birthday! The city was born on Dec. 29, 1847. In the spirit of the ancient Greeks, who consulted with the Oracle at Delphi when embarking on important undertakings, Olympic Weekly's Betty Parham asked three members of the Metro Atlanta Astrological Society, Frances Rackow, J. Lee Lehman and Dale O'Brien, what the stars hold for the city in 1996. (Parham 390).  OLY-NOTEBOOK _ A sport-by-sport update on Olympic events. (3 Takes).  OLY-CHATTANOOGA _ CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. _ When the U.S. national women's rowing training center was set up here in 1993, folks got excited about Olympic athletes moving to their community. But they were a bit confused. They'd stop an athlete on the street and gush about meeting a real volleyball player. Or they'd think the towering women were on the U.S. basketball team. Now, more than two years later, Chattanooga residents are finally getting savvy about rowing. (McCafferty 650).  OLY-ROWING _ AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Rower Brian Jamieson's drive for gold has driven up his plastic as well _ to the tune of thousands of dollars on his credit card. Teammate Tim Young is putting off medical school plans. Young's partner on the four-man scull, Brad Layton, a mechanical engineer (MIT Class of '92), recently got laid off. But the rowers laugh about their personal troubles. From now through the Olympic rowing competition in July, they focus on practices on the Savannah River and spend hours lifting weights on the cracked concrete floors of a graffiti-marked, abandoned warehouse. (McCafferty 1000).  OLY-RELAY _ LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ While athletes across the world whip themselves into shape for the Atlanta Games, Olympic Torch Relay planners Lori Stone and Sherry Jennings are falling behind in their conditioning. Or, to put it more bluntly: Their behinds are falling. ``We've got BMW butt,'' bemoans Jennings, who's riding shotgun in the 525-i touring sedan that has served as their home and office for months. ``Our butts have slowly taken on the shape of these seats!'' Though on casual observation this would appear to be an overstatement of Olympic proportion, the women have cause for feeling like they're becoming one with the Beemer buckets. One of seven regional teams plotting the 15,000-mile, 84-day relay across the U.S., Stone and Jennings are responsible for the biggest segment: 3,700 zig-zagging miles, from Ogden, Utah, to Memphis. (Pousner).  FBN-TIEBREAKER _ TEMPE, Ariz. _ It could be the most dramatic ending to one of the greatest college football games ever played, a national championship being decided on one play, or a series of plays. That's assuming, of course, Florida's Steve Spurrier and Nebraska's Tom Osborne ever figure out this tiebreaker stuff. (Dolch 890).  GEORGE-COLUMN _ TEMPE, Ariz. _ Steve Spurrier is coach of the Florida Gators. Maybe you've read or heard that a time or two before, but he has asked that members of the Fiesta Bowl media get the word out all the same. There are many here in the Phoenix area, you see, who already fancy him as coach of the Arizona Cardinals. Back in Florida, where another NFL job just came open, Spurrier has become the Fantasy League coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, much like coach Jimmy Johnson of the Miami Dolphins. (George 780).  FBN-DOLPHINS _ DAVIE, Fla. _ The expectorations have increased expectations of poor fan behavior at Saturday's AFC wild-card playoff game between the Buffalo Bills and Miami Dolphins. (McManomon 600).  Commentary  HAY-COLUMN _ GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Probably every American kid from 8 to 80 has memorized those words written by Dr. Seuss back in 1957. I was feeling a lot like the Grinch myself in early December, but my friends told me to knock it off and get with it. So I decided to research Santa Claus. In my less sentimental moments, I have always wondered about Santa's remarkable trip, but I never bothered to do the math. Now, however, we have the Internet with its endless numbers of intellectual doodlers studying such matters. We find that the Grinch's fairy tale adventures aren't nearly as amazing as those of the other, much older, Santa. (Hay 750).  KABAT-COLUMN _ The last thing you'll catch me at is being hasty in making New Year's resolutions. If we went back to the last one I actually kept, we'd be somewhere in the early '60s. But I'm going on the record now with my resolution for 1996: I will no longer hold to the theory that parents must spend _ to the cent _ the same on Christmas presents for each of their children. (Kabat 500).  HAY-COLUMN _ GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ A recent news story of major importance tells us that cats have now surpassed dogs as America's most popular pets. Last year there were 63 million pet cats as compared to 54 million dogs. These figures come from the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council, whatever that is. One does wonder who counted the animals and whether any stray kittens might have been hiding under beds and been missed. (Hay 730).  CAMPBELL-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ I walked over to the Inforum to talk with Billy Payne. His handlers had told me he was about to get very busy. The year of the Olympics starts next week, and Payne will have to focus on emergencies, cash flow, TV networks, heads of state. It seemed wise to get cracking. We sat down in his corner office overlooking the park he dreamed up. He was wearing the usual starched white shirt and tie. (Campbell 590).

TV-COLUMN (Los Angeles) _ I am sitting in a room at the Sunset Marquis Hotel in West Hollywood very calmly explaining to a man named Paul McKenna that I am, in fact, Tom Brokaw. ``Have you interviewed any members of the royal family?'' asks McKenna. ``Yes, all of them,'' I say. ``The queen, Prince Charles, Princess Di. Fergie, too.'' ``Any other interesting interviews?'' ``Well, yes, the last five presidents.'' The reason I was lying? Hypnosis. McKenna, you see, is a professional hypnotist, working with everyone from heavyweight boxer Frank Bruno to the Duchess of York in his native England to help overcome whatever stress ails them. Me? I just wanted to prove the guy was a phony. My wife and several friends had already screened a tape of ``The World's Funniest Hypnotist,'' an ABC special and potential series pilot airing at 9 p.m. Monday.

APARTMENT-GARDENS (Los Angeles) _ Green-thumbed apartment dwellers often look upon homeowners with green eyes. After all, they have property. And land, lots of land, is a prerequisite for growing successful, bountiful vegetable and flower gardens. Or is it? Landless, take heart. Even here in the urbanized concrete desert we call Southern California, you can grow almost anything _ all you need to start is sunlight. And as we all know very well, that isn't too hard to find around here. Many plants and vegetables can and do survive and thrive in small swatches of land in back, front and side yards, indoors with artificial light, and on balconies, patios and rooftops. When Peggy Zeldes moved to her townhome in Westlake Village, she found space severely limited. ``I had to be a little bit more creative.'' Peggy designed a patio and garden around her home in the small spaces in the back and along a narrow walkway on one side. The result is a sprawling, lush garden of irises and cactuses, a lemon tree and various climbing plants. ``All my friends say I should call Architectural Digest,'' she says. ``I just like to sit in the back and enjoy it.''

"61597"	"you"	"see"	" It was an astonishing result, Muster's ankle and groin problems notwithstanding. Stich, you see, is a prototype serve-and-volleyer, a man who has tasted no appreciable success on the capricious clay since he accidentally wound up in the semifinals here five years ago. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199606.gz"
"61888"	"you"	"see"	" That, you see, would be the cost for the railroad to buy and repair 80 miles of track west of town, a spur built in the mid-1920s and soon to be abandoned by its owner, the Southern Pacific Railroad. It's simply cheaper to stick to the mainline, Amtrak has decided, and to build a new station 30 miles south of the city. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199606.gz"

"62192"	"you"	"see"	" Everybody else, you see, had to play by the rules. And the rules in 1990 were that campaign contributions could not exceed $550. Later, the limit rose to $610. Either way, the $670,000 Symington received from his wife for his 1990-91 bid exceeded those limits. By more than a little bit. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199606.gz"
"62193"	"you"	"see"	" Symington's office, you see, had distributed a statement on the day that the governor filed for personal bankruptcy saying Symington had had a net worth of $10 million when he was elected governor in February 1991. That's an important date, because just three months later, in May 1991, Symington listed in a financial statement his net worth as $23 MILLION IN THE RED. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199606.gz"
"62390"	"you"	"see"	" But, you see, if there were no need for procedures to save the mother's life, there would be no ``partial-birth abortions,'' and no issue. People with a larger agenda would have to contrive another atrocity _ maybe distribute a diagram of a newborn being speared with a garden rake. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199606.gz"
"63056"	"you"	"see"	" Amateurs, you see, once were the backbone of the game. Before the Masters ever became a classic, Georgia classics were tournaments with such intriguing names as Piney Woods, Golden Isles, Radium Springs, General Oglethorpe, Idle Hour, and of course, Dogwood and the State Amateur. The first important championship Bobby Jones ever won was the Georgia State Amateur. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199606.gz"
"63458"	"you"	"see"	" Los Angeles, you see, is no longer the city he works in. Divac's trade to Charlotte for high school sensation Kobe Bryant won't be official until July 9, but the lovable, bearded giant _ hard as it is for him to believe _ is a Hornet now. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"
"63549"	"you"	"see"	" Viper Militia, you see, was obviously too threatening, particularly when coupled with a cache of full-automatic rifles and bombs. We're going understated, people, by using a moniker that bespeaks a complete lack of offensive firepower. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"
"63558"	"you"	"see"	" I had been cleaning out the drawer, you see, to make room for what was, at the time, my expanding library of videocassette tapes. My wife had duly informed me that the living-room floor behind the television set was no longer an acceptable place to store them. Nor, for that matter, was the space UNDER the television table. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"
"63825"	"you"	"see"	" One short generation ago, space travel was a wondrous novelty, one that only Washington's wondrously deep pockets could bankroll. Now it's just another business. Last week NASA picked Lockheed Martin to build a possible replacement for the space shuttle; it would be this nation's first major new spacecraft in 25 years. NASA, you see, no longer wants to be in the business of owning and launching rockets _ it wants to stick to research. The goal is to have a fleet of rockets owned and operated by industry, hauling stuff aloft that's both public and private. And Lockheed says that with the X-33, it can do it at one-tenth the cost _ and one-tenth the risk. For one thing, all those things that drop off the current shuttle _ like booster rockets and fuel tanks _ will be gone. The X-33 stays in one piece. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"
"64076"	"you"	"see"	" Many, many times, in fact. Gipson, you see, first stumbled upon the Roost in 1953. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"
"64185"	"you"	"see"	" London, you see, now counts itself among the world's leading gastronomic capitals, with 12,000 eating places and at least 50 kinds of cuisine. This hardly means that every meal or every restaurant will be a winner. But with a new generation of talented young chefs showing the way, at least 1,000 of those restaurants have won high praise from critics and guidebooks. And 36 have received the highly coveted but seldom awarded top rating in the Michelin Guide. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"
"64207"	"you"	"see"	" The cows, you see, represent ``cals,'' my jocular shorthand for cal-ories. The cows (old beasts sounds like obese, right?) were stand-ins for the great herds of calories that for most of my life have been everywhere I have turned, chasing me, literally getting under my skin. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"

"64698"	"you"	"see"	" The two men enjoy the most curiously sweet relationship. Ebersol, you see, was handed the job that Schanzer thought was his for future delivery. And yet, instinctively, Ebersol made the decision to keep Schanzer, and they drew closer together. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"

Eggert, you see, wants to prevent foreign (read American) music, television and words from intruding upon Freeland; he wants to keep the country's culture traditional and pristine.

"92017"	"you"	"see"	" At its core, Cole heart Shaquille, even if a ``Go Spurs Go'' poster hangs on one wall in the administrative office. As for that button, Smith fully intends to find it some day. There was a reason, you see, that he tucked it away for safekeeping in the first place. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"
"92677"	"you"	"see"	" Two 19-year-olds go out drinking in a state where they are supposed to wait until they are 21. Unusual? Not in this world. News? None bigger, at least on the cable news broadcasts and television talk shows. The 19-year-olds' names, you see, are rather familiar. And their father, well, he lives at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"93108"	"you"	"see"	" Real-life critics, you see, have it rough nowadays. Not only are we expected to sit through all the witless trash that comes down the pike; we have to write about it, too, knowing full well that our highbrow rants will do nothing to slow the juggernaut of mass taste. (If critics mattered, ``Pearl Harbor'' would have closed before it opened.) The resulting frustration is bad for our souls, and quite possibly actionable as well. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"93214"	"you"	"see"	" Which is not to say Eastport is always sleepy. We Eastporters glowered a few years back when Maine comic Tim Sample joked that he visits every year for ``the empty building festival.'' That deadpan dart is aimed at our historic, if, ahem, somewhat underutilized, red brick downtown. Still, thousands come each year for Eastport's four-day Fourth of July celebration, Maine's most enthusiastic holiday fete. Eastport, you see, knows the true value of liberty; seized by the British during the War of 1812, it was returned only with the signing of the Treaty of Ghent. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"

Kennedy High School football field as valedictorian of the class of 2001, and her speech, like her life, had a new theme. ``The American dream, you see, holds me in its grasp because I have been blessed to live my own version of it,'' she declared. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"94086"	"you"	"see"	" A rational voice in the back of my head interjects that making such unlikely ideas possible is precisely what jazz has been marching toward all these years. If it can't be infinitely stretched, if what was a flower pot can't be remade into a stapler, it isn't jazz. Because, you see, jazz is a mixture of form and improvisation. The form makes it exist in an official sense as a composition and endears it to you on the spot; the improvisation is its future, ensuring its existence beyond the author's copyright, expressing its need to be reinterpreted. You remember the flower pot with fondness, but you must accommodate the possibility of the stapler. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"

"94552"	"you"	"see"	" David and Joe escape unscathed and flee to tawdry, not-in-Kansas-anymore Rouge City. There a hologram called Dr. Know (voiced by Robin Williams) directs them to the end of the world _ a submerged Manhattan _ and a reunion for David with Professor Hobby. Much of the mechanical lad's journey has been a test by his creator, you see, not unlike 2001's challenge to the human race from the monolith. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"94947"	"you"	"see"	" So cats drive up in a van and spirit away the Brodys' dog, who was guarding professor Brody's lab.

If you have any questions, please call Bruce Janssen on the Star's News Desk at (816) 234-4716.  CRIME-DOG (Kansas City, Mo.) _ Rikky has a credibility problem. Not that Rikky isn't dedicated, well-trained and enthusiastic. It's just that he's, well ... cute. Which is fine for, say, movie-star dogs. Benji. Lady. Tramp. In a movie-star dog, cute, you want. But not so much when it comes to busting drug-runners on the Lake of the Ozarks. Rikky, you see, is an officer of the Missouri Water Patrol. Word is, he's the first full-time water dog of any marine patrol agency in the country. Rikky is also an English cocker spaniel. By MATT STEARNS. Story will move in the ``a'' category.  BUSINESS OFFERINGS  PRIVACY (Kansas City, Mo.) _ Nearly a billion pieces of mail have been sent out nationally, telling customers they could prohibit financial institutions from sharing their nonpublic records with unaffiliated businesses, such as telemarketers, who might profit from the information. But despite privacy alarms sounded by many consumer groups, most Americans hve reacted with yawns. By PAUL WENSKE. Story will move in the ``f'' category.

"95463"	"you"	"see"	" Stan applies to a drama school, where he is told he must audition with a partner. So he picks out an attractive actress wannabe who coaches him through his chosen scene from The Godfather, Part II. Stan is hardly the next Al Pacino and the teachers can barely stifle giggles during his audition, but somehow he gets accepted to join the class. Not only does he make it into the school, but he is soon making it with his audition partner, Julie (Isabelle Carre). Actors, you see, have more active sex lives than butchers. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"
"95707"	"you"	"see"	" The NHL, you see, saw a Stars victory as a way to bolster the sport's popularity in the Sun Belt. In so doing, the NHL was performing a variation on the NBA theme that put Patrick Ewing in a New York Knicks uniform. Wanting a franchise player in the biggest market in the country, the NBA stuck the Knicks' placard in a freezer to make it easy to pick out of draft-lottery bin. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"
"97277"	"you"	"see"	" Montan, you see, is the guy who sticks up for Superman. And for Batman, Bugs Bunny, the Flintstones and Scooby Doo, among others. As senior intellectual property counsel for AOL Time Warner's Warner Bros. unit, Montan ensures that those lucrative trademarks are not exploited by counterfeiters or unwitting artists who assume that those familiar characters belong to their adoring public. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"

"102381"	"you"	"see"	" The Bush administration's commission on Social Security reform issued its latest report last week, just as Enron entered its death throes. Most of the criticism of that commission's work, my own included, has focused on its, yes, Enron-like accounting: items seem to migrate onto or off the balance sheet to suit the commission's convenience. Thus when the Social Security system takes in more money than it pays out, as it does at present, this has no significance _ the federal budget is unified, you see, so it doesn't mean anything when one particular piece of it is in surplus. But in 2016, when the Social Security system starts to pay out more than it takes in, there will be a crisis _ Social Security, you see, must stand on its own. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"

I hope we remember you for a thousand years as competent, conventional and safe. No surprises. It's not that I don't believe security officials who say Salt Lake City will be the safest place in the world in the next three weeks. I believe. I believe. But a lot of nice people have put considerable effort into being good hosts for the next three weeks, and I hope their kind intentions come off. By George Vecsey. 1,200 words.  (ART ADV: Four graphics will be sent on a schedule of the list of events, the television schedule, a map of the venues and a list of minor changes to some of the sports this time around, to NYT graphics clients.)  OLY-SKI-BODE (Salt Lake City) _ Inside the high-tech mote built to secure the Salt Lake Winter Games, past the magnetometers and checkpoints, a world of spectators will find their way to a free-spirited American skier who was raised in a cabin lit by kerosene lamps. Soon, they will discover Bode Miller. At 6 foot 2 inches, he is a tall tale, but without the exaggeration. It's all true. He is the one who refused to conform on a senior English paper even though it meant exiting high school without his diploma. He's the one who races with mittens on his hands, who once wrecked a BMW when he tried warming his boots on the dashboard and who constantly defies convention by racing down mountains with his arms flailing like a drummer in a heavy-metal band. He may be as stubborn as a grease stain, but Miller has parlayed his untamed approach into a bewildering four World Cup titles this season. By Selena Roberts. 1,500 words.  OLY-MOGULS-HARDAWAY (Undated) _ The MTV network cameras have been following moguls skier Hannah Hardaway around the world for the last several weeks. Glib, telegenic and America's best chance for a medal in a sport the United States has traditionally dominated, the 23-year-old Ivy League educated Hardaway is a natural, a television producer's dream. As for MTV's angle, well, Hardaway does listen to music just before stepping into the start house of competitions. By Bill Pennington. 1,000 words.  OLY-FIG-HUGHES (Salt Lake City) _ It's as if an anonymous note has been passed around about Sarah Hughes. ``You know Sarah Hughes? She flutzes.'' The lutz jump, you see, is done from the outside edge of the skate, while the flip is done from an inside edge. But some skaters attempting a lutz have a tendency to switch from an outside to an inside edge at the last minute, resulting in a combination lutz and flip _ or ``flutz.'' The comments usually come in the form of a whisper in some back corridor of a rink, in the back alley of a figure-skating competition. Somewhere in the past few months, along with Hughes' rise from an up-and-comer to an Olympic threat to Michelle Kwan, the planted flutz buzz has become stereophonic. By Selena Roberts. 1,000 words.  OLY-NHL-TEAMMATES (Undated) _ Five hockey seasons ago, when Michael Peca played for Buffalo and Alexei Yashin played for Ottawa, the Sabres and the Senators met in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs. Both men were centers with different physiques and different playing styles. At 6 feet 3 inches and 225 pounds, Yashin's strength was offense. At 5-11 and 190 pounds, Peca's strength was defense. Peca was assigned to check Yashin. Now, they are teammates on the Islanders, Peca the captain and Yashin one of the alternates. But they will face each other again in the Olympics.

SCI-TREE-DISEASE (Undated) _ The best known tree diseases are chestnut blight and Dutch elm disease, each still attacking trees today. But scientists say a host of devastating forest pathogens have continued to arrive. Among the most recent is sudden oak death syndrome, which has killed thousands of oaks and other trees in California and may threaten the mighty redwood as well. Fast-moving and usually hard or impossible to cure, these exotic diseases have destroyed countless trees in forests, cities and suburbs. The results can be seen not only in landscapes stripped of beautiful but in changes to forest ecosystems and in the economic costs of the loss of vast natural resources. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon.

SCI-PARTICLE-PHYSICS (Undated) _ Last week in a quiet triumph, Fermilab, the high-energy physics laboratory outside Chicago, announced a discovery of great importance in the search for a theory of everything _ the seamless intellectual framework that would explain how the universe is made. Firing up the Tevatron, the most powerful particle accelerator in the world, an international team of scientists slammed together matter and antimatter, creating volleys of silent, invisible explosions. Then they sifted the debris through their computers, looking for the long-sought prey: exotic wisps called supersymmetric particles _ SUSY's for short. They found nothing. But in finding nothing, they explained a lot. By George Johnson. (1800 words)  With graphic.

(The ``HNS'' tag appears in all sluglines.)  WASHINGTON NEWS (``w'' category)  BUSH-BUDGET (Washington) _ President Bush asks Congress for $2.12 trillion to run the federal government in fiscal 2003. He urges cuts in popular domestic programs to offset his 90 percent hike in spending on domestic security and his 14.5 percent boost in defense spending. He also casts himself as an accountability-oriented chief executive by imposing a performance scorecard on 26 federal departments and programs. By STEWART M. POWELL.  BUDGET-SECURITY (Washington) _ President Bush's budget proposal nearly doubles spending for domestic security, with money to fight bioterrorism, tighten border controls, improve airline security and help firefighters. By ROMA KHANNA.  MILITARY-BUDGET (Washington) _ Critics say President Bush's new defense budget would bankroll huge weapons systems already being developed but would add little for new projects designed to combat terrorism. The president is asking Congress for a $48 billion, or 12 percent, boost in defense spending. By ERIC ROSENBERG.  BUDGET-COUNTER-TERRORISM (Washington) _ The Justice Department and FBI are expected to nearly double their counterterrorism efforts next year as part of President Bush's overall push to beef up domestic security. In his $2.1 trillion budget plan, Bush proposes spending $38 billion on homeland security, compared with $22 billion being spent this year. By MARK HELM.  ENRON-POWERS (Washington) _ The head of Enron Corp.'s special committee investigating the company's off-balance-sheet deals testifies on Capitol Hill. By DAVID IVANOVICH.

Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings, meanwhile, calls for a special prosecutor to probe the failed energy giant's ties to the Bush administration. By JULIE MASON.  ENRON-EMPLOYEES (Washington) _ We get reaction from Enron employees and Washington officials in the wake of Kenneth Lay's refusal to cooperate with congressional investigators. By PATTY REINERT.  NEW-YORK-MEDICAID (Washington) _ Despite intense lobbying by New York Gov. George Pataki, President Bush's budget does not include a $1.8 billion federal Medicaid bailout payment to New York. The omission, according to one fiscal watchdog, means that New York taxpayers ``will be on the hook'' to pay for the state's budget gap. Pataki, a Republican, is seeking a third term against two Democratic challengers. By LARA JAKES JORDAN.  NATIONAL NEWS (``a'' category)  BUDGET-NASA (Houston) _ Proposed spending for NASA increases about 1 percent to $15 billion, though funding for human space flight activities will fall from $6.8 billion to $6.2 billion. To curb costs, NASA will pursue privatization of the space shuttle and create a non-NASA organization to manage research on the international space station.

OLY-SKI-BODE (Salt Lake City) _ Inside the high-tech mote built to secure the Salt Lake Winter Games, past the magnetometers and checkpoints, a world of spectators will find their way to a free-spirited American skier who was raised in a cabin lit by kerosene lamps. Soon, they will discover Bode Miller. At 6 foot 2, he is a tall tale, but without the exaggeration. It's all true. He is the one who refused to conform on a senior English paper even though it meant exiting high school without his diploma. He's the one who races with mittens on his hands, who once wrecked a BMW when he tried warming his boots on the dashboard and who constantly defies convention by racing down mountains with his arms flailing like a drummer in a heavy-metal band.

But some skaters attempting a lutz have a tendency to switch from an outside to an inside edge at the last minute, resulting in a combination lutz and flip _ or ``flutz.'' The comments usually come in the form of a whisper in some back corridor of a rink, in the back alley of a figure-skating competition.

NYT News Service  INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  SAUDI-PILGRIMS (Jiddah, Saudi Arabia) _ Security has always been a challenge during the hajj to Mecca, which culminates with a four-day series of rituals, Feb. 18-21 this year. Over the years, the hajj has been marred by fire, disease, demonstrations, stampedes and riots. Saudi Arabia is welcoming up to 1.5 million pilgrims for the annual hajj to Mecca _ the largest annual mass migration of people on the planet _ and is experimenting with what it hopes will be a fool-proof system of identification. Bleary-eyed pilgrims, many of whom have disembarked from the first plane ride of their lives, are randomly chosen at Passport Control to have their eyes digitally scanned by an American security company. In an adjoining entry hall, a French fingerprinting firm that does work for the U.S. Postal Service and the New York City Police Department digitally scans index fingers. By Elaine Sciolino.

Nor did anyone seem surprised that New York proved, once and for all, that it was open for business despite the events of Sept. 11. By Suzanne Daley.  NATIONAL _ GENERAL (Moved in ``a'' category)  NY-POWER (New York) _ New York City, which had been facing as recently as last summer a looming electricity crisis as more computers and air conditioners in a booming economy bumped up against the limits of the local power supply, now has all the energy it needs through at least the middle of next year and perhaps beyond, electricity experts say. The dramatic turn of events is partly a result of Sept. 11, which removed in one horrific day about 100 megawatts of power demand. The recession, which has stripped tens of thousands of jobs since then, has further reduced pressure on the system. The supply side of the electricity equation has also fundamentally changed. The collapse of Enron, the giant energy trading company _ and the prospect of an energy glut in many parts of the country _ has frightened investors who were once eager to pour money into power plant projects. By Kirk Johnson.  CALIF-OKIES (Weedpatch, Calif.) _ In this centennial year of John Steinbeck's birth, the vestiges of Okie culture are vanishing here, as the Dust Bowl generation ages and the texture of the community changes. Every morning, Doris Weddell, a retired librarian who is spearheading a preservation effort, picks up her scissors to clip the obituaries: Ann M. Heid (1929, Cici, Okla.), Alice R. Terry (1912, Anadarko, Okla.), Roy Earl Livsey (1913, Thayler, Texas). There are new migrants now, who have altered the face of small California towns like Arvin and Lamont. In Lamont (population 13,295), not far from the corner where a young Buck Owens used to play hard-knocks country music on a cotton truck, Mexican panaderias, or bakeries, open at 5 a.m., while in Arvin (population 12,956), the old Safeway is now a supermercado.

The profits were made on investments in a partnership called Southampton Place, which brought the insiders a return equal to more than 1,000 percent on an annualized basis, all while taking very little risk while inserting themselves in the middle of a transaction between Enron and one of the partnerships that played a role in the company's eventual collapse.

The giant pension fund has criticized corporate directors for failing to protect shareholders and has publicly advocated greater independence and vigilance by corporate boards and outside accounting firms. But in the case of Enron Corp., Calpers was the watchdog that did not bark. By Diana B. Henriques.  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphics clients.)  SUPERBOWL-AD-COLUMN (New York) _ There was widespread anxiety before Super Bowl XXXVI that advertisers buying commercial time during the game would seek to capitalize on Sept. 11 by unleashing mawkish, hyperpatriotic ads.

Fast-moving and usually hard or impossible to cure, these exotic diseases have destroyed countless trees in forests, cities and suburbs. The results can be seen not only in landscapes stripped of beautiful but in changes to forest ecosystems and in the economic costs of the loss of vast natural resources. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon.

Then they sifted the debris through their computers, looking for the long-sought prey: exotic wisps called supersymmetric particles _ SUSY's for short. They found nothing.

For 14 years in the 1980s and 1990s, researchers at L'Oreal tracked 10 men month by month, shaving a square centimeter of their scalp and then watching to see how many of the 200 to 300 hairs in that patch grew back.

Another of my uncles, Sam, also a retired solicitor, keeps track of places with fine food and wine and shared his discovery of the Inn at Whitewell, a country pub 45 miles northwest of Manchester, near the town of Clitheroe, in Lancashire. The highway part is on the harrowing side, dodge 'em style. ``Everyone does 80, you see,'' Sam explained. The country roads part is an idyll of pure English scenery untouched by time. Dense hedges and glades line winding roads. The wild green hills of Lancashire rim the horizon. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"

Forget it. Make it ``soupcon of leftover steak tartare,'' perhaps, or ``echoes of lobster bisque.''  Vineyards in California wine country, you see, are scooping up leftovers at San Francisco's finest restaurants and composting them to get the best soil quality and, they hope, the best grapes. More than 1,400 food businesses and thousands of San Francisco residents are providing food scraps to create the compost, processed by Norcal Waste Systems, a disposal and recycling company. A manager at one organic vineyard called the compost ``some of the best stuff I've ever seen.''  Chateau Orange Rind, anyone?  Men and Women and Their Money  Wealthy women trust their financial advisers more than wealthy men do, but the women spend more time than the men making their own investment decisions, according to a new study that counters a long-held stereotype about money and the sexes.  ``We have burst the myth that women abrogate responsibility for their money,'' said Sharon Hadary, executive director of the Center for Women's Business Research, a nonprofit group in Washington that conducted the study. Hadary said the study shows that ``high-net-worth women are equally involved in managing their investments and equally independent.''  The study looked at the personal financial decision making of 118 men and 107 women worth $5 million or more, based on interviews conducted in April. It found that women devote 11.1 hours a month to their investments, compared with 10.7 hours spent by men.  Like men, women want their investing to secure a comfortable life and a worry-free future, the study showed, but women greatly differed with men on another financial goal: philanthropy. Fifty-eight percent of women wanted enough wealth to be able to give money away, compared with 39 percent of men.  Hadary said this finding substantiated two earlier studies by the group, in 1999 and 2000, that showed women to be more philanthropically inclined than men.  The current study showed that 93 percent of the women and 83 percent of the men felt that their financial adviser was acting in their best interests.  But it also showed that about 60 percent of both men and women thought that they ``only know some or very little of what they need to know to make good investment decisions.''  The Tide Is Going Out For Stock Mutual Funds  For the first time since 1988, investors this year are almost certain to end up taking more money out of stock mutual funds than they moved into them, according to Lipper, the mutual fund analysis firm.  As of Thursday, stock funds had net outflows this year of about $10 billion, and that trend is not likely to be reversed in the last days of the year, said Donald Cassidy, a senior analyst at Lipper.  ``December is typically slow, seasonally, for fund buying,'' Cassidy said, and the uneven performance of the stock market so far this month is likely to dampen investors' enthusiasm.  Thanks in large part to the market rally that began on Oct. 10, November was the first month of net inflows into stock funds since May.  The November inflow was about $10 billion, but Lipper characterized that as ``modest,'' considering the climb of about 22 percent in major stock market indexes from Oct. 10 through November. Investors are likely to remain cautious about stocks well into 2003, Cassidy said.  On the other hand, inflows into bond mutual funds continued to be strong in November and are likely to break the one-year record of $120 billion, set in 1986, by at least 10 percent, Lipper estimated. Bond funds have had net inflows in each of the first 11 months this year, for a total of $127 billion through November.  A Dubious Distinction for GE  When measured in terms of changes in total market value, General Electric stock was the worst performer in the world this year through Dec. 12, according to Morningstar Inc.  GE stock lost $140 billion in market capitalization, equal to almost twice the gains of the top 10 performers combined.  GE's stock price declined by 35 percent during the period, a dismal performance, to be sure, but hardly the worst among major companies.  But GE's $398 billion market capitalization at the beginning of the year was so high that the fall in its stock price destroyed shareholders' wealth in colossal proportions. The $140 billion loss was bigger than the entire market cap of any one of the four next-biggest losers on the list _ Intel, Tyco International, AOL Time Warner and IBM _ according to Morningstar data.  By contrast, the biggest gains in shareholder wealth were relatively modest. Procter &amp; Gamble, whose stock price rose 10.8 percent, had the biggest gain in market capitalization, amounting to $11 billion. The four next-biggest winners, in descending order, were United Parcel Service, Kraft Foods, Boston Scientific and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone.   </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20021220.0200 type=story > <HEADLINE> HARD TRUTHS ARE AVOIDED ON SOCIAL SECURITY </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WASHINGTON  (BC-ECON-COLUMN-$ADV22-NY) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"

"137552"	"you"	"see"	" In the year 2525 (honestly, it's something like that), society has figured out that the only way for everybody to get along, to dispense with trouble, is to avoid displaying or even having emotions. Books are burned. Masterpiece paintings, too. Cuteness damns wee little dogs, which sometimes get gunned down like they were dangerous freedom fighters. Into this dystopian world walks Christian Bale (who still, obviously, cares way too much about his ab roller). He plays John Preston, the top-dog government do-gooder, which in this case means he'll do really bad things to you if you so much as show him a sniffle. In many ways, this movie is ``Fahrenheit 451,'' ``THX 1138,'' ``Gattaca,'' ``Logan's Run'' and ``Minority Report'' rolled into one. Preston, you see, is about to figure out that feelings are a good thing. And soon he's gonna take on the whole darned system. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200305.gz"

Let's imagine the lead sentence: ``Stung by allegations of Nazi ties and Hitler-worship, Mr. Schwarzenegger's camp on Tuesday accused Gray Davis of being like Stalin _ who, historians note, was a man Hitler both feared and despised.'' Intemperate rhetoric from the right, you see, is a symptom of the boiling madness that seethes beneath the mantle of Republican respectability; intemperate rhetoric from the left is, well, funny.

He glowers at his employees, berates them for giving bad haircuts, complains that they aren't bringing in enough new clients. Before every commercial break, someone is on the verge of tears and/or about to be fired. But then, with a passive-aggressive elan that may one day be studied in college psychology courses, Antin insists he really loves them.

KMART-SEARS (Undated) -- Kmart will buy Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. for $11 billion, the companies announced Wednesday, in a deal that unites the two struggling merchandising giants in a bid to survive against rivals like Wal-Mart, which roared past both on its way to becoming by far the nation's largest retailer. The companies plan to maintain separate identities, but shoppers are likely to eventually find large numbers of Kmarts transformed into Sears stores. Under the deal, which will create the nation's third-largest retailer behind Wal-mart and Home Depot, Kmart products like Martha Stewart housewares will start appearing in Sears stores once the merger is completed next March. Kmart stores, meanwhile, are expected to begin selling Sears exclusives like Craftsman tools and Lands' End apparel. The merger is a triumph for Kmart's largest shareholder, Edward S. Lampert, who brought the company out of bankruptcy protection only 18 months ago. By Constance L. Hays.  With photos, NYT4-8,21-22.  An early lede has moved.  HOUSE-DELAY (Washington) -- House Republicans voted Wednesday to abandon an 11-year-old party rule that would automatically require a member of the leadership to temporarily step down if indicted, an action spurred by an investigation in Texas connected to House Majority Leader Tom DeLay. Meeting behind closed doors, the assembled lawmakers agreed that a party steering committee would review any indictments handed down against leaders or committee chairmen and determine if action is warranted. Leaders would have to step aside if convicted. By Carl Hulse.  IRAQ-MILILTARY (Washington) -- Looking ahead to the military's role in Fallujah during reconstruction. By Eric Schmitt.  CHINA-ASIA (Chiang Rai, Thailand) -- In pagoda-style buildings donated by the Chinese government to the university here, Long Seaxiong, 19, stays up nights to master the intricacies of Mandarin. The sacrifice is worth it, he says, and the choice of studying Chinese was an easy one over perfecting his faltering English. China, not America, is the future, he insists, speaking for many of his generation in Asia. The Sirindhorn Chinese Language and Culture Center here is part of China's expanding presence across Southeast Asia and the Pacific, where Beijing is making a big push to market itself and its language, similar to how the United States promoted its culture and values during the Cold War. It is not a hard sell. Put off from visiting the United States by the difficulty of gaining visas after 9/11, more and more Southeast Asians are traveling to China as students and tourists. Likewise, Chinese tourists, less fearful than Americans of the threat of becoming targets of terrorism, are becoming the dominant tourist group in the region, outnumbering Americans in places like Thailand and fast catching up to the ubiquitous Japanese.

RUNNING-EVOLVE (Undated) -- The evolution of physiques for long-distance running made humans look the way we do now -- whether winning a marathon, nursing a strained Achilles tendon or sitting on an ample gluteus maximus in front of the TV. If walking upright first set early human ancestors apart from their ape cousins, it may have been their eventual ability to run long distances with a spring in their step over the African savanna that influenced the transition to today's human body form, scientists report. Endurance running, unique to humans among primates and uncommon in all mammals other than dogs, horses and hyenas, apparently evolved at least 2 million years ago and probably enabled human ancestors to hunt and scavenge for food over large distances. And that probably proved decisive in the pursuit of high-protein food for development of larger brains. By John Noble Wilford.  With a graphic.  Story has moved.

"147609"	"you"	"see"	" In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Rear Admiral John Hutson pointed out that Gonzales' recommendations regarding torture brought increased animosity toward the United States, hurt our intelligence effort, and increased the risks to our troops.All of this is true. Torture is counterproductive. But actually it's a lot worse. It's also just plain wrong .That's why there are so many laws against it. Not because it's counterproductive . . but because it's just plain wrong. And it is the rule of law that distinguishes us from animals that don't know right from wrong.With some things -- like torture, like slavery -- well, no matter how many people might say such practices are okay, they are not okay. They are objectively evil. They are morally abhorrent. . . .or, at least, they should be.There is a memorable passage in Tom Sawyer where Tom asks the slave Jim what he thinks of slavery. As I recall the conversation, Jim replies:Just because everyone says they think it's right; just because everyone tells you it's right; well, that don't make it right!I don't think you need religion to understand that. But I do believe that faith can reinforce it.Moses, the great prophet of the Hebrew, Christian and Muslim traditions, was sent by God to Egypt, where the Jews were prisoners. They were being tortured -- ground down is the way the Bible puts it. And Moses' instructions were to end the torture.And that is what we are called to do -- end the torture.Let me be specific:A friend of mine, Army Sgt. Sam Provance, was stationed at the Abu Graib prison in 2003. He is a decorated Army careerist, anything but a troublemaker. But he does have a conscience.Not unlike the vast majority of the prisoners at Abu Graib, Sam was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. In Sam's case, the wrong place was that terrible prison; the wrong time was the night shift.Sam was not an military policeman or interrogator, but he was close enough to hear the screams of those being abused -- close enough to see the Iraqi boy who had been tortured before his father's eyes. The purpose, of course, was to 'set the conditions for successful interrogation, to use the euphemism coined by Maj. Gen. Geoffrey Miller who, after commanding the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, 'migrated, together with the abusive interrogation techniques used there, to Abu Graib.The boy's father, you see, was an Iraqi general, who might know something and, if so, might spill the beans if the right 'conditions were set. Sam told me that what he found most 'chilling was how:-- The prisoners had been demonized as 'the enemy and rendered subhuman.-- The interrogators made so light of what they were doing.-- The interrogators had absolute power -- the kind, Sam pointed out, that corrupts absolutely.-- Sam's fellow soldiers waved off his objections.-- Back in Germany, his superiors also waved Sam off, relegating him to an undefined position in the supply room.-- They removed his clearances and did all they could to make him a pariah among his comrades.Since when has it become a blemish on an U.S. Army career to refuse to condone torture? How is it that someone with the courage to say 'That's just plain wrong ends up ostracized in his community? Has objecting to torture become unpatriotic?Why is it that Army Specialist Joseph Darby, who also complained through channels about the torture at Abu Graib, has received numerous death threats for 'ratting out his fellow soldiers, and now has to live in protective custody?And why do so many Americans apparently believe torture is all right?I don't know, but 'Well, that don't make it right!Remember why Socrates was condemned to death?The charges were two: Making the worst case appear the better and corrupting the youth.I suggest you download and read Gonzales' Jan. 25, 2002, memorandum to the president. Is that not a consummate example of making the worse case appear the better?Then consider how the youth we send to war have been brutalized by the green light given for torture. Corrupting the youth? I find what Sgt. Provance says most troubling.I am against the death penalty. . .even for such unconscionable behavior as Gonzales'. But I break out in a cold sweat at the thought our senators might approve him for the post of attorney general. This would send precisely the wrong signal to our young troops and, indeed, to the world.A self-professed evangelical Christian, Mr. Gonzales must be aware that Jesus of Nazareth asked us to visit prisoners -- not torture them. We will 'judge not, but rather leave the judgment in God's hands for the future.In a democracy, though, we -- each of us, as well as our senators -- are responsible for the here and now. And our senators must vote on the Gonzales nomination. </P> 	nyt_eng_200501.gz

COVER STORIES  AUDUBON-QUARTET (Blacksburg, Va.) -- The Audubon String Quartet was whimsically named 31 years ago by four young string players to evoke nature's lyrical beauty and an earlier, more innocent America. But in the world of classical music, it has since come to stand for an ugly, almost epic legal feud that has damaged lives and divided loyalties. It is a bitter story, in which music plays no redemptive role. By Daniel J. Wakin.  ROCKETBOOM (Undated) -- Amanda Congdon is a big star on really small screens -- like the 4{frac12}- inch window she appears in on computer monitors every weekday morning or the 2{frac12} inches she has to work with on the new video iPod. Congdon, you see, is the anchor of a daily, three-minute, mock TV news report shot on a camcorder, edited on a laptop and posted on a blog called Rocketboom, which now reaches more than 100,000 fans a day. What makes Rocketboom so different from most of the other video blogs, or vlogs, that have popped up in the last year or so is that the daily episodes are consistently entertaining. With the designer who created the site and films the episodes, Congdon, 24, has fashioned a quirky, charming persona, with an inventive take on the news that is closer in spirit to Letterman than CNN. The fact that she is an attractive young woman probably doesn't hurt either. By Robert Mackey.  FEATURES  THEATER-SINGING-CLASS (Undated) -- In Barbara Cook's master theater singing class, natural rhythm trumps classical training. By Charles Isherwood.  THEATER-WOMEN-FORUM (Undated) -- Of the 39 plays and musicals that opened on Broadway this year, three were directed by women (a husband-and-wife team directed a fourth, the short-lived Blonde in the Thunderbird). Of the 34 new shows in 2004, women directed 2. These are not particularly encouraging figures for those looking for the new female directorial voices.  FILM-RINGER (Santa Monica, Calif.) -- For Edward Barbanell, the Dec. 23 opening of The Ringer would seem to represent an important moment in movie history. This film, as no major Hollywood film before, features a substantial number of actors who have intellectual disabilities. They are portraying reasonably competent, genuine characters -- not the stereotypical victims, villains and heroes who have most often defined the disability experience in studio movies. And in a particularly striking turnabout, these actors with disabilities are playing comedy, inviting the audience to laugh with them, not at them. By Patricia E. Bauer.  SPAIN-ARCHITECTURE (Undated) -- Powered by a democratic awakening after decades of Fascist rule and by the dividends of European Union membership, Spain is clearly outpacing its European siblings in the breadth and daring of its new architecture. Robin Pogrebin reports on Terry Riley's Spanish odyssey, for his swan-song exhibition as MoMA's chief architecture curator.

TRAVEL-NY-CHEAP-EATS (New York) -- So let's say you make it to Manhattan and find a cheap place to stay. No small accomplishment. The next hurdle: eating well without eating through your entire budget. By Peter Meehan  TRAVEL-ZANZIBAR (Undated) -- Tourism in Zanzibar and other Muslim islands off the coast of East Africa is undergoing a resurgence, despite the war in Iraq and bombings in the Middle East that have frightened many Western travelers away from Islamic countries. Stone Town, the first stop for most travelers here, retains the atmospheric trappings of urban life in Muslim cities but hews to a much looser interpretation of Islam than many places in the Middle East. By Edward Wong.  TRAVEL-HOLIDAYS (Undated) -- If the thought of tinsel, turkey and trees leaves you feeling tired, tense and tortured, why not forget about celebrating Christmas at home. With many hotels and resorts offering special rates during the holiday season to lure visitors, forget the guilt and think about escaping the drudgery of your kitchen (with or without the family). The holidays are a surprisingly great time to be a tourist. By Jennifer Conlin  REGULAR FEATURES  PRACTICAL-TRAVELER (Undated) -- For millions of travelers, credit card reward programs are the best way to score free airline tickets and hotel rooms. But with credit card issuers and travel companies ratcheting up the competition for customers in recent months -- for instance, JetBlue recently rolled out a new card with American Express -- how do you know which card in your wallet is worth reaching for?

The many conservative pundits now deploring Tom DeLay take a similarly reductive line. Washington power can corrupt absolutely, explained the Wall Street Journal editorial page while bemoaning that people like Mr. Abramoff came to Washington to clean up Washington and then were corrupted by the capital's evil ways. The DeLay Republicans, you see, are merely repeating the history of the decadent, power-fattened Democrats who preceded them, most especially Jim Wright, the speaker of the House who resigned in 1989. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"

You will survive everything if you can live your life from the point of view of truth.  - Oprah Winfrey, graduation address to Wellesley College, 1997  Like many admirers, I had a tough time reconciling the words above - and the spirit behind them - with the speaker's continued support of James Frey.  Frey, the author of the blockbuster memoir A Million Little Pieces, has faced a deluge of media attention amid revelations by TheSmokingGun.com that the writer likely lied about the extensive criminal career he outlines in his book.  Winfrey had featured the book in October on her talk show's tremendously popular book club, guaranteeing huge sales. Last week, amid an outpouring of I-told-you-sos from long-skeptical critics, Winfrey defended her choice.  If you're an addict whose life has been moved by this story and you feel that what James went through was able to - to help you hold on a little bit longer, and you connected to that, that is real, said Winfrey, who defended the so-called emotional truth of Frey's book while blaming its publisher for mislabeling it. And it's - it's irrelevant discussing, you know, what - what happened or did not happen to the police.  Readers were initially spellbound by Frey's vivid accounts of his raging addiction and recovery, including waking up on an airplane covered in blood and vomit, spending three months in jail and provoking a confrontation with police that resulted in multiple felony charges.  According to the TheSmokingGun.com, a six-week investigation showed Frey's actual crimes brought only fines and traffic tickets for charges like driving under the influence, with no significant jail time.  TheSmokingGun.com editor, William Bastone, assumed Winfrey was doing what any good CEO would do in damage control mode: protect her franchise.  She has to either still vouch for it or say, We recommended a book full of bunk, and not only was my staff asleep at the wheel, but I was too,' said Bastone, noting that no other major news organization thought to check Frey's account against police and court records.  The only stuff we looked at were incidents for which there are a paper trail ... (and) everything we looked up was full of lies, Bastone said. (Winfrey said) the belief this book is changing the lives of people trumps the fact that maybe the story is a fake. You would expect somebody in her position would take the ethical stand.  But I think Winfrey, ever an astute judge of the public mind, isn't just covering her assets here. She may know a truth that is painful for critics and journalists to acknowledge.  As long as most fans of the book want to believe it is true, they will accept the slimmest of explanations to preserve its entertainment value.  Even though the public will tell you they want truth in memoirs, what the publishing industry's research tells them is that they want something they can believe is true, yet is first an interesting story, Jayson Blair - the New York Times reporter fired for plagiarizing, and whose own memoir was criticized for inaccuracies - told the Los Angeles Times.  It's the same sort of odd public bargain audiences have made with reality TV.  Almost from the genre's start, viewers knew the wild antics displayed on shows such as Survivor, The Bachelor and American Idol were not the unvarnished truth. But the thrill of watching Richard Hatch or Simon Cowell in action made many of us accept the fiction.  Reality TV producers have a host of tricky techniques: having participants re-enact juicy moments the cameras missed, plying subjects with alcohol to lower inhibitions and staging events with the precision of a military march.  The same skepticism arises when considering a literary trend identified by Washington Monthly as the nobody memoir. Exemplified by Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes and Elizabeth Wurtzel's Prozac Nation, these books captivate readers by describing remarkable tales of personal suffering and survival that are tough to verify because the authors were unknown before publication.  It's a strange dynamic, given the derision heaped on journalists such as Stephen Glass or Blair when their made-up tales became public.  But when popular authors such as Augusten Burroughs admit their widely read memoirs contain fictionalized accounts, the old saw about never letting facts get in the way of a good story never seems more fitting. For example, despite being sued by the family that raised him, which feels it was badly portrayed in his childhood memoir Running with Scissors, Burroughs has seen the tome turned into a highly anticipated movie starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Annette Benning.  The Frey/Pieces fracas has revealed uncomfortable truths: Publishers vet books for legal problems more than factual accuracy, and the memoir label or lack of a disclaimer doesn't necessarily mean a nonfiction book is mostly true.  (Pieces' publisher, Doubleday, has said it supports Frey but will include a yet-undisclosed author's note on the accuracy issue in future printings.)  But the most depressing lesson for this critic, given that Pieces remains atop many bestseller lists - it was knocked to second place last week on Amazon.com's list by Winfrey's newest book club selection, Elie Wiesel's controversial Holocaust memoir, Night - is that the book-buying public may not care.  Just as long as they get a good story.  Truth allows you to live every day with integrity. Everything you do and say shows the world who you really are. Let it be the truth.  - Winfrey, from a column for O magazine.  Times researcher Angie Holan contributed to this report. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060120.0365 type=story > <HEADLINE> FOR LEGENDARY FOLKLORIST AND ACTIVIST STETSON KENNEDY THERE IS A NEW BATTLE - FOR HIS REPUTATION </HEADLINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"

"169176"	"you"	"see"	" Edmond, you see, is a prosperous, middle-class city dweller who one night all of a sudden decides he hates his wife, becomes a racist and a homophobe, and hurts some people real bad. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169682"	"you"	"see"	" It is tempting to believe that such behavior is Gibson's problem alone. The rest of us, you see, have washed ourselves clean of prejudices and would never, ever, in a million years make a bigoted remark. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169721"	"you"	"see"	" She simply wants him to impersonate her husband for a few days, she says. He's recently deceased, you see, in a tragic accident far away, and yet if he'd only lived a little longer his mother's trust fund would have kicked in, to the tune of 2 million pounds. And now this man off the street looks so much like him that maybe, just maybe ... </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169909"	"you"	"see"	" One common theme in the New Hampshire papers bemoans the demise of small-d democracy that will inevitably occur if New Hampshire's primary primacy is diluted in any way. Another laments the political paradise lost if shrewd New Hampshire voters no longer have a singular role querying and testing the candidates. New Hampshire, you see, is by turns both the tribune of the common man and the home of the nation's savviest voters. (Suggested new license plate motto: New Hampshire - Little State, Big Ego.) </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"

MARTIN-EXHIBIT (Beacon, N.Y.) -- Dia:Beacon, a bulwark of Minimalism on the banks of the Hudson River north of Manhattan, has three permanent galleries devoted to the artist Agnes Martin, who died in 2004 at 92. Over the past two years they have been used for a retrospective of her paintings, installed in decade-long increments. Agnes Martin: A Field of Vision: Paintings From the 1980s is now in place. It is light-glinting, deep and purposeful, like the river flowing nearby. By Holland Cotter.  AUDIO-BOOKS-ONLINE (Undated) -- A feature on various services, including LibriVox.org, that provide recordings of public-domain books for little or no cost over the Web. By Craig Silverman.  ANTIQUES-COLUMN (Undated) -- The weekly antiques column by Wendy Moonan.  ESCAPES (l code)  THE-OTHER-TIJUANA (Undated) -- When you walk across the border from the United States to Mexico, and the steel revolving doors clank behind you, locking you in, there they are -- the pharmacists in their crisp white coats offering you discount drugs on the street, as if they were Sno-Kones, not bottles of pills. The Avenida Revolucion stretches ahead like a psychedelic version of Disneyland's Main Street, with its multiplex margarita bars and outdoor party music and throngs of San Diego teenagers enjoying a day's parole from being under 21. Everything you expected to see, you see, and you think you know Tijuana. But a few blocks away is the Centro Cultural Tijuana, a monumental arts complex with a planetarium centerpiece, a recently opened a native-plants and pre-Columbian sculpture garden, and a new gallery and performance space under construction. And the city keeps surprising as you go. This is a Tijuana you don't know. Most Mexicans, who don't cut Tijuana much slack -- provincial backwater, border badlands -- don't know it either. But Tijuana is Mexico's fastest-growing city and is developing a new identity that is bringing it out of the shadows of its own reputation. By William L. Hamilton.  With photo and map.  PA-ROAD-TRIP (Undated) -- In the Laurel Highlands of southwestern Pennsylvania, cornfields undulate between forested slopes, and rivers spill downward in a rush of whitewater, luring fishermen and rafters. The green hills served as a military training ground for George Washington and gave Frank Lloyd Wright the setting for Fallingwater, his cantilevered masterpiece of a house set over a swiftly flowing creek. Tragedies have been sudden and shocking: the deaths of thousands in the Johnstown Flood and, 112 years later on Sept. 11, 2001, the crash of the hijacked United Flight 93. Today, a trip over the rural roads leads through a layered landscape of city and town, swimming holes and memorials, shaded by the shiny leaves of the mountain laurel. By Bethany Schneider.  With photo and map.  OYSTER-FESTIVALS (Undated) -- Of all the unlikely luxury foods, nothing stirs the imagination quite like the oyster. Like caviar or escargot, it fiddles with that old schism between appearance and flavor -- in simpler terms, it's a gross-out food that happens to taste pretty good. But there's also that bit about its being an aphrodisiac and the fascinating fact that sometimes a grain of sand slips through that thick, curmudgeonly exterior and morphs into a pearl. Yet the oyster, unlike its uptown buddies, can still very much hang with the common folk, as is proven every fall, when towns up and down the East Coast -- from Chincoteague, Va., to Oyster Bay, N.Y., and beyond -- swing open the gates for their annual oyster festivals.

"170039"	"you"	"see"	" Bobo, you see, has been the point man for head coach Mark Richt in the highly-scrutinized competition to determine which of four players would be Georgia's starting quarterback this season.

"171184"	"you"	"see"	" A team effort, you see, and Furyk wanted to keep it that way. When asked if he wanted the umbrella, he said no. That's why we've got the rainsuit, he said, and besides, no one else had an umbrella up. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171622"	"you"	"see"	" A: That's always temporary. Sometimes you'll have a board of education that looks at a book list and they'll take The Martian Chronicles off the list for a year and put it back the next year. But that's not dangerous, you see, because it occurs only for a small period of time. If I can get people to pick up a book, that's great. People all over the country are still examining Fahrenheit 451. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
