CITY STREETS  From Ron Spetrino:  I was next in line at a checkout counter in the Woolworth store at Seventh Avenue and 56th Street. As I approached the cashier, the woman in front of me began perusing her sales slip.  ``What is this on my receipt?'' she blurted out to the cashier.  ``That's the senior citizen discount,'' the clerk cheerfully explained.  Visibly shaken, the woman _ perhaps in her 40s _ exclaimed: ``How dare you make such an assumption! Why, even my mother isn't eligible for that discount!''  ``Oh,'' the clerk replied. ``Then it's just a discount.''  Not at all placated by having saved money, the woman sputtered, ``That's most insulting.'' She stormed out. I stepped up and graciously announced that I accept all discounts.  From Virginia Smith:  The place: Riverside Park, home to vast numbers of dogs and their doting owners. A woman walking near me was pushing a young child in her stroller. Each time the child saw a dog, she went into a frenzy of ``woof woofs.'' Then, one I would describe as a ``designer'' dog _ wrinkled and hairless _ walked by. The little girl shouted in a delighted voice, ``Moo!''  The assemblage, with the exception of the dog's owner, broke into howls of laughter.  From Diane Oshin:  As the mother of a 3-year-old, certain things come as no surprise. But yesterday's phone call really threw me. My son, David, called his friend Jillian, and this is what followed:  ``Hi, this is David. Is Jillian there? Well, is her Mommy home? Is Jeff there (her Daddy)? Do you know when she'll be home?''  I presumed correctly that all of his questions were being fielded by the baby sitter caring for Jillian's sister, Cloe.  When it became clear that David was not going to connect with Jillian he asked, ``Well then, can I have Jillian's voice mail?''  From James Pearson:  The place is Sal's Barber Shop, First Avenue in the 20s. A customer comes in and sits down, waiting his turn in silence. Eventually, he looks up and speaks to no one in particular. ``We finally heard from the boy in camp,'' he says. ``He wrote to the dog.''  This is what a friend wants to know:  ``Whatever happened to those old end-of-the-school-year plays? My fourth grader, attending a public school on the Upper West Side, has snagged two minor roles this June.  ``In the first skit, set in a concentration camp, she plays the part of Prisoner No. 1. In the second, she plays one of the mothers of a lesbian couple with kids.''  Our friend wonders if a play about whaling might still be interesting enough.  DAVID LETTERMAN LATE SHOW TOP TEN  ``Signs You Won't Be Qualifying for the U.S. Olympic Team''  10. Keep accidentally burning your wrestling opponents with your cigarette  9. You need an advanced pulley system to get over the high hurdles.  8. When you hear the starter's pistol, you ball up like a frightened armadillo.  7. To get you to the trials, firemen had to remove the side of your house.  6. When you started running the 100-meter dash, Bob Dole was still in high school  5. Boxing opponents get their gloves caught in your stomach.  4. You train by standing in front of mirror trying to smile like Mary Lou Retton.  3. ``Being 35 and still living at home with your parents'' not yet an Olympic sport  2. When your relay partner tries to take the baton, you shout, ``Screw you -- get your own damn  stick!''  1. Can't get your ass through the parallel bars.  DENNIS MILLER AS HEARD ON HBO'S ``DENNIS MILLER LIVE''  On working at home: ``According to a recent study more than 40 percent of companies now can work from their homes. Yeah, it's called being fired.''  On Clinton vs. Dole: ``President Clinton is reportedly feeling so confident about his lead in the polls over Bob Dole that he's ready to start dating again.''  On ValuJet Airlines: ``The Federal Aviation Administration asked ValuJet Airlines to cease operations after its 30 day review of the company revealed deficiencies in its safety practices. A spokesperson for ValuJet said that with the fleet grounded, the company will have to lay off its entire maintenance division. So, best of luck, Tony.''  On Ted Kaczynski: ``Unabomber suspect Ted Kaczynski is owed $1200 in royalties from a publisher who sold the Unabomber manuscript. But if they send him the royalties and he accepts them, it would mean he admits to being the Unabomber. You know, it's about time this guy knows what it's like to be afraid to open his mail.''  On the French: ``The French Government announced a crackdown on religious cults this week that they believe have endangered the community by brainwashing its members. Yeah, God forbid anything gets washed in France.''  On Star Trek: `` This September, a weekend-long celebration will be held in Huntsville, Alabama, to mark the 30th anniversary of 'Star Trek.' The Huntsville City Council says they'll welcome all extraterrestrials, as long as none of them are Jews.''  On the 'Fantasy Man': ``A Nashville Man known as the 'Fantasy Man' for tricking women into having sex blindfolded by telling them he was their boyfriend has been sentenced to 15 years in prison. You might want to take that blindfold along with you, 'Fantasy Man'.''  On ``Prison Reform'':  ``Premium cable, weight rooms, basketball courts and conjugal visits amazingly enough have not thrown a paralyzing fear of returning to prison into the habitual offender.''  ``Prison is getting way too costly. It has been estimated that keeping a guy behind bars can cost upwards of $20,000 a year. You know, it would be a lot cheaper just to put these people in a Motel 6.''  ``Our system actually lets inmates sue if they don't like the guards or the food or the work or the reception on the giant screen TV. Why are they able to sue? The broke the law, so they shouldn't get to use it anymore.''  ``Our infrastructure's crumbling, our beaches are filthy, public buildings are in disrepair, my koi pond need a good skimming... we're ignoring a valuable source of free labor. Hell, think of how many Kathie Lee Gifford jogging suits the population of Sing Sing could sew up in one day.''  ``Perhaps we should look into a system like the dry cleaners have. We just put 'em on hangers in alphabetical order, then after a while we go in with a claim ticket, the line whizzes around 'till we get the right guy, we check carefully to see it they got the stain out, and if not, back they go.'  ``You think prisoners should have privileges? Okay, but let's compromise. They want cable television? Fine give 'em a 24-hour feed of the security-cam at the convenience store they knocked off. Conjugal visits? Sure. Doesn't Leona Helmsley still have some community service to work off? Movies? Well, put your best black and white stripe wonder bra on, Richard Speck, we just got the director's cut of 'Nell'.''  ``You want a weight room? You got a weight room. It's spelled W-A-I-T. It's your cell, now get in it and wait.''  BILL'S WORLD  By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star  Maybe it would help things at the U.N. if Hillary Rodham Clinton had an imaginary conversation with Dag Hammarskjold.  Hillary Rodham Clinton is making public jokes about her imaginary conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt. No doubt among Democrats they are producing imaginary laughter.  ``I have no spiritual advisers or any other alternative to my deeply held Methodist faith and traditions,'' Mrs. Clinton says. Reporters wanting more on this may want to adapt Horace Greeley's advice and ``Go Wesley.''  The imaginary conversation we'd like hear would be between Hillary Clinton and Paula Jones.  The Supreme Court has decided to rule in Paula Jones' suit against Mr. Clinton. Doesn't that give the president a home court advantage?  Why are people making fun of Mrs. Clinton for invented conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt? Did they expect her to talk to a Republican like Pat Nixon?  Bob Woodward's new book about Bill Clinton and Bob Dole says Dole once wrote the president a letter of apology for attacking him. How did it start? ``Dear Billiberal''?  Congressional Democrats plan to run on a ``families first'' platform. But if they win, won't they have less time to spend with their families?  A fellow in San Francisco is selling a new beer enriched with calcium. No, it's called Sophie McCall, not what we guessed _ Milker Lite.  The communist running against Boris Yeltsin wants Russia to have a coalition government. That's progress. The only people the old communists would ask to be in a coalition were dead communists.

By MICHAEL D. TOWLE. Story will move in ``w'' Washington category.  REPUBLIC OF TEXAS  AUSTIN, Texas _ Process servers fan out across Texas as the state retaliates against supporters of the Republic of Texas. A court order nullifies the liens Republic supporters filed against state officials. By JOHN GONZALEZ. Story will move in ``a'' general news category.  LAB-PAP SMEARS  UNDATED _ A diagnostic laboratory in Tyler, Texas, which did work for hundreds of east Texas doctors and clinics, has been ordered to stop performing Pap smears and other cancer tests after a federal agency found ``serious deficiencies,'' including at least 32 cases of incorrect readings, officials say. By LOU CHAPMAN. Story will move in ``a'' general news category.  TEXAS-HISTORY  UNDATED _ It was 14 years in the making, but late this month, the Texas State Historical Association will publish The New Handbook of Texas, a six-volume set that includes 23,640 topics on 6,945 pages with 13,093 bibliographic citations. For $395, it is an ultimate reference resource, lovingly written by many of the crack historians in the state. By JEFF GUINN. Story has moved in ``a'' general news category.  COUNTRY MUSIC-DOGS  FORT WORTH, Texas _ The disappearance this year of George Strait's high-profile companion, Buster, brought home a simple country-music truth: An errant lover is a misfortune, but a missing dog is a tragedy. You see, pooches _ like Mama, trains, prison and getting drunk _ play a big part in country music. By SHIRLEY JINKINS. Story will move in ``e'' entertainment category.  FILM-LONE STAR  UNDATED _ Rio County, Texas, is a place so thoroughly compromised by evil that it might as well cease to exist. The (fictional) region's last chance for salvation comes with the accidental unearthing of a long-buried set of bones _ all that remains of the sorry carcass of a corrupt sheriff whose disappearance has fueled decades of local gossip. The mystery of what became of Sheriff Charley Wade forms the caustic nucleus of John Sayles' ``Lone Star,'' a large-ensemble mystery of a scope far greater than the mere question of ``whodunit.'' By MICHAEL H. PRICE. Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment category.  FILM-STEALING BEAUTY  UNDATED _ Bernardo Bertolucci's ``Stealing Beauty,'' a limited-release entry from Fox's Searchlight label, is more a case of stealing the show for 18-year-old Liv Tyler, the most natural new talent to grace the screen in a great many years. By MICHAEL H. PRICE. Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment category.  SEAN PENN-VIDEO  UNDATED _ Balancing the ability to direct and act has never been a simple task for Hollywood types, although folks like Clint Eastwood, Kevin Costner and Mel Gibson seem to pull it off nicely. At least 35-year-old actor-turned-director Sean Penn has the good sense to focus on one at a time, choosing not to perform in pictures where he's fulfilling directing chores. Viewers can compare for themselves and decide where his greater strengths lie as two Penn-related projects arrive on home video this week. By MICHAEL H. PRICE.

Bob Woodward's new book about Bill Clinton and Bob Dole says Dole once wrote the president a letter of apology for attacking him. How did it start? ``Dear Billiberal''?  Congressional Democrats plan to run on a ``families first'' platform. But if they win, won't they have less time to spend with their families?  A fellow in San Francisco is selling a new beer enriched with calcium. No, it's called Sophie McCall, not what we guessed _ Milker Lite.  The communist running against Boris Yeltsin wants Russia to have a coalition government. That's progress. The only people the old communists would ask to be in a coalition were dead communists.

CITY STREETS  From Ron Spetrino:  I was next in line at a checkout counter in the Woolworth store at Seventh Avenue and 56th Street. As I approached the cashier, the woman in front of me began perusing her sales slip.  ``What is this on my receipt?'' she blurted out to the cashier.  ``That's the senior citizen discount,'' the clerk cheerfully explained.  Visibly shaken, the woman _ perhaps in her 40s _ exclaimed: ``How dare you make such an assumption! Why, even my mother isn't eligible for that discount!''  ``Oh,'' the clerk replied. ``Then it's just a discount.''  Not at all placated by having saved money, the woman sputtered, ``That's most insulting.'' She stormed out. I stepped up and graciously announced that I accept all discounts.  From Virginia Smith:  The place: Riverside Park, home to vast numbers of dogs and their doting owners. A woman walking near me was pushing a young child in her stroller. Each time the child saw a dog, she went into a frenzy of ``woof woofs.'' Then, one I would describe as a ``designer'' dog _ wrinkled and hairless _ walked by. The little girl shouted in a delighted voice, ``Moo!''  The assemblage, with the exception of the dog's owner, broke into howls of laughter.  From Diane Oshin:  As the mother of a 3-year-old, certain things come as no surprise. But yesterday's phone call really threw me. My son, David, called his friend Jillian, and this is what followed:  ``Hi, this is David. Is Jillian there? Well, is her Mommy home? Is Jeff there (her Daddy)? Do you know when she'll be home?''  I presumed correctly that all of his questions were being fielded by the baby sitter caring for Jillian's sister, Cloe.  When it became clear that David was not going to connect with Jillian he asked, ``Well then, can I have Jillian's voice mail?''  From James Pearson:  The place is Sal's Barber Shop, First Avenue in the 20s. A customer comes in and sits down, waiting his turn in silence. Eventually, he looks up and speaks to no one in particular. ``We finally heard from the boy in camp,'' he says. ``He wrote to the dog.''  This is what a friend wants to know:  ``Whatever happened to those old end-of-the-school-year plays? My fourth grader, attending a public school on the Upper West Side, has snagged two minor roles this June.  ``In the first skit, set in a concentration camp, she plays the part of Prisoner No. 1. In the second, she plays one of the mothers of a lesbian couple with kids.''  Our friend wonders if a play about whaling might still be interesting enough.  DAVID LETTERMAN LATE SHOW TOP TEN  ``Signs You Won't Be Qualifying for the U.S. Olympic Team''  10. Keep accidentally burning your wrestling opponents with your cigarette  9. You need an advanced pulley system to get over the high hurdles.  8. When you hear the starter's pistol, you ball up like a frightened armadillo.  7. To get you to the trials, firemen had to remove the side of your house.  6. When you started running the 100-meter dash, Bob Dole was still in high school  5. Boxing opponents get their gloves caught in your stomach.  4. You train by standing in front of mirror trying to smile like Mary Lou Retton.  3. ``Being 35 and still living at home with your parents'' not yet an Olympic sport  2. When your relay partner tries to take the baton, you shout, ``Screw you -- get your own damn  stick!''  1. Can't get your ass through the parallel bars.  DENNIS MILLER AS HEARD ON HBO'S ``DENNIS MILLER LIVE''  On working at home: ``According to a recent study more than 40 percent of companies now can work from their homes. Yeah, it's called being fired.''  On Clinton vs. Dole: ``President Clinton is reportedly feeling so confident about his lead in the polls over Bob Dole that he's ready to start dating again.''  On ValuJet Airlines: ``The Federal Aviation Administration asked ValuJet Airlines to cease operations after its 30 day review of the company revealed deficiencies in its safety practices. A spokesperson for ValuJet said that with the fleet grounded, the company will have to lay off its entire maintenance division. So, best of luck, Tony.''  On Ted Kaczynski: ``Unabomber suspect Ted Kaczynski is owed $1200 in royalties from a publisher who sold the Unabomber manuscript. But if they send him the royalties and he accepts them, it would mean he admits to being the Unabomber. You know, it's about time this guy knows what it's like to be afraid to open his mail.''  On the French: ``The French Government announced a crackdown on religious cults this week that they believe have endangered the community by brainwashing its members. Yeah, God forbid anything gets washed in France.''  On Star Trek: `` This September, a weekend-long celebration will be held in Huntsville, Alabama, to mark the 30th anniversary of 'Star Trek.' The Huntsville City Council says they'll welcome all extraterrestrials, as long as none of them are Jews.''  On the 'Fantasy Man': ``A Nashville Man known as the 'Fantasy Man' for tricking women into having sex blindfolded by telling them he was their boyfriend has been sentenced to 15 years in prison. You might want to take that blindfold along with you, 'Fantasy Man'.''  On ``Prison Reform'':  ``Premium cable, weight rooms, basketball courts and conjugal visits amazingly enough have not thrown a paralyzing fear of returning to prison into the habitual offender.''  ``Prison is getting way too costly. It has been estimated that keeping a guy behind bars can cost upwards of $20,000 a year. You know, it would be a lot cheaper just to put these people in a Motel 6.''  ``Our system actually lets inmates sue if they don't like the guards or the food or the work or the reception on the giant screen TV. Why are they able to sue? The broke the law, so they shouldn't get to use it anymore.''  ``Our infrastructure's crumbling, our beaches are filthy, public buildings are in disrepair, my koi pond need a good skimming... we're ignoring a valuable source of free labor. Hell, think of how many Kathie Lee Gifford jogging suits the population of Sing Sing could sew up in one day.''  ``Perhaps we should look into a system like the dry cleaners have. We just put 'em on hangers in alphabetical order, then after a while we go in with a claim ticket, the line whizzes around 'till we get the right guy, we check carefully to see it they got the stain out, and if not, back they go.'  ``You think prisoners should have privileges? Okay, but let's compromise. They want cable television? Fine give 'em a 24-hour feed of the security-cam at the convenience store they knocked off. Conjugal visits? Sure. Doesn't Leona Helmsley still have some community service to work off? Movies? Well, put your best black and white stripe wonder bra on, Richard Speck, we just got the director's cut of 'Nell'.''  ``You want a weight room? You got a weight room. It's spelled W-A-I-T. It's your cell, now get in it and wait.''  BILL'S WORLD  By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star  Maybe it would help things at the U.N. if Hillary Rodham Clinton had an imaginary conversation with Dag Hammarskjold.  Hillary Rodham Clinton is making public jokes about her imaginary conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt. No doubt among Democrats they are producing imaginary laughter.  ``I have no spiritual advisers or any other alternative to my deeply held Methodist faith and traditions,'' Mrs. Clinton says. Reporters wanting more on this may want to adapt Horace Greeley's advice and ``Go Wesley.''  The imaginary conversation we'd like hear would be between Hillary Clinton and Paula Jones.  The Supreme Court has decided to rule in Paula Jones' suit against Mr. Clinton. Doesn't that give the president a home court advantage?

As I approached the cashier, the woman in front of me began perusing her sales slip.  ``What is this on my receipt?'' she blurted out to the cashier.  ``That's the senior citizen discount,'' the clerk cheerfully explained.  Visibly shaken, the woman _ perhaps in her 40s _ exclaimed: ``How dare you make such an assumption! Why, even my mother isn't eligible for that discount!''  ``Oh,'' the clerk replied. ``Then it's just a discount.''  Not at all placated by having saved money, the woman sputtered, ``That's most insulting.'' She stormed out. I stepped up and graciously announced that I accept all discounts.  From Virginia Smith:  The place: Riverside Park, home to vast numbers of dogs and their doting owners. A woman walking near me was pushing a young child in her stroller. Each time the child saw a dog, she went into a frenzy of ``woof woofs.'' Then, one I would describe as a ``designer'' dog _ wrinkled and hairless _ walked by. The little girl shouted in a delighted voice, ``Moo!''  The assemblage, with the exception of the dog's owner, broke into howls of laughter.  From Diane Oshin:  As the mother of a 3-year-old, certain things come as no surprise. But yesterday's phone call really threw me. My son, David, called his friend Jillian, and this is what followed:  ``Hi, this is David. Is Jillian there? Well, is her Mommy home? Is Jeff there (her Daddy)? Do you know when she'll be home?''  I presumed correctly that all of his questions were being fielded by the baby sitter caring for Jillian's sister, Cloe.  When it became clear that David was not going to connect with Jillian he asked, ``Well then, can I have Jillian's voice mail?''  From James Pearson:  The place is Sal's Barber Shop, First Avenue in the 20s. A customer comes in and sits down, waiting his turn in silence. Eventually, he looks up and speaks to no one in particular. ``We finally heard from the boy in camp,'' he says. ``He wrote to the dog.''  This is what a friend wants to know:  ``Whatever happened to those old end-of-the-school-year plays? My fourth grader, attending a public school on the Upper West Side, has snagged two minor roles this June.  ``In the first skit, set in a concentration camp, she plays the part of Prisoner No. 1. In the second, she plays one of the mothers of a lesbian couple with kids.''  Our friend wonders if a play about whaling might still be interesting enough.  DAVID LETTERMAN LATE SHOW TOP TEN  ``Signs You Won't Be Qualifying for the U.S. Olympic Team''  10. Keep accidentally burning your wrestling opponents with your cigarette  9. You need an advanced pulley system to get over the high hurdles.  8. When you hear the starter's pistol, you ball up like a frightened armadillo.  7. To get you to the trials, firemen had to remove the side of your house.  6. When you started running the 100-meter dash, Bob Dole was still in high school  5. Boxing opponents get their gloves caught in your stomach.  4. You train by standing in front of mirror trying to smile like Mary Lou Retton.  3. ``Being 35 and still living at home with your parents'' not yet an Olympic sport  2. When your relay partner tries to take the baton, you shout, ``Screw you -- get your own damn  stick!''  1. Can't get your ass through the parallel bars.  DENNIS MILLER AS HEARD ON HBO'S ``DENNIS MILLER LIVE''  On working at home: ``According to a recent study more than 40 percent of companies now can work from their homes. Yeah, it's called being fired.''  On Clinton vs. Dole: ``President Clinton is reportedly feeling so confident about his lead in the polls over Bob Dole that he's ready to start dating again.''  On ValuJet Airlines: ``The Federal Aviation Administration asked ValuJet Airlines to cease operations after its 30 day review of the company revealed deficiencies in its safety practices. A spokesperson for ValuJet said that with the fleet grounded, the company will have to lay off its entire maintenance division. So, best of luck, Tony.''  On Ted Kaczynski: ``Unabomber suspect Ted Kaczynski is owed $1200 in royalties from a publisher who sold the Unabomber manuscript. But if they send him the royalties and he accepts them, it would mean he admits to being the Unabomber. You know, it's about time this guy knows what it's like to be afraid to open his mail.''  On the French: ``The French Government announced a crackdown on religious cults this week that they believe have endangered the community by brainwashing its members. Yeah, God forbid anything gets washed in France.''  On Star Trek: `` This September, a weekend-long celebration will be held in Huntsville, Alabama, to mark the 30th anniversary of 'Star Trek.' The Huntsville City Council says they'll welcome all extraterrestrials, as long as none of them are Jews.''  On the 'Fantasy Man': ``A Nashville Man known as the 'Fantasy Man' for tricking women into having sex blindfolded by telling them he was their boyfriend has been sentenced to 15 years in prison. You might want to take that blindfold along with you, 'Fantasy Man'.''  On ``Prison Reform'':  ``Premium cable, weight rooms, basketball courts and conjugal visits amazingly enough have not thrown a paralyzing fear of returning to prison into the habitual offender.''  ``Prison is getting way too costly. It has been estimated that keeping a guy behind bars can cost upwards of $20,000 a year. You know, it would be a lot cheaper just to put these people in a Motel 6.''  ``Our system actually lets inmates sue if they don't like the guards or the food or the work or the reception on the giant screen TV. Why are they able to sue? The broke the law, so they shouldn't get to use it anymore.''  ``Our infrastructure's crumbling, our beaches are filthy, public buildings are in disrepair, my koi pond need a good skimming... we're ignoring a valuable source of free labor. Hell, think of how many Kathie Lee Gifford jogging suits the population of Sing Sing could sew up in one day.''  ``Perhaps we should look into a system like the dry cleaners have. We just put 'em on hangers in alphabetical order, then after a while we go in with a claim ticket, the line whizzes around 'till we get the right guy, we check carefully to see it they got the stain out, and if not, back they go.'  ``You think prisoners should have privileges? Okay, but let's compromise. They want cable television? Fine give 'em a 24-hour feed of the security-cam at the convenience store they knocked off. Conjugal visits? Sure. Doesn't Leona Helmsley still have some community service to work off? Movies? Well, put your best black and white stripe wonder bra on, Richard Speck, we just got the director's cut of 'Nell'.''  ``You want a weight room? You got a weight room. It's spelled W-A-I-T. It's your cell, now get in it and wait.''  BILL'S WORLD  By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star  Maybe it would help things at the U.N. if Hillary Rodham Clinton had an imaginary conversation with Dag Hammarskjold.  Hillary Rodham Clinton is making public jokes about her imaginary conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt. No doubt among Democrats they are producing imaginary laughter.  ``I have no spiritual advisers or any other alternative to my deeply held Methodist faith and traditions,'' Mrs. Clinton says. Reporters wanting more on this may want to adapt Horace Greeley's advice and ``Go Wesley.''  The imaginary conversation we'd like hear would be between Hillary Clinton and Paula Jones.  The Supreme Court has decided to rule in Paula Jones' suit against Mr. Clinton. Doesn't that give the president a home court advantage?  Why are people making fun of Mrs. Clinton for invented conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt? Did they expect her to talk to a Republican like Pat Nixon?  Bob Woodward's new book about Bill Clinton and Bob Dole says Dole once wrote the president a letter of apology for attacking him. How did it start? ``Dear Billiberal''?  Congressional Democrats plan to run on a ``families first'' platform. But if they win, won't they have less time to spend with their families?  A fellow in San Francisco is selling a new beer enriched with calcium. No, it's called Sophie McCall, not what we guessed _ Milker Lite.  The communist running against Boris Yeltsin wants Russia to have a coalition government. That's progress. The only people the old communists would ask to be in a coalition were dead communists.
