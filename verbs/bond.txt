"6304"	"they"	"bond"	" The format for the new show is decidedly different than the cookie-cutter clones of the daytime chat genre. Somers trots on a celebrity guest, they chat amiably about his or her life, they bond, and then a serious topic of interest to the guest is introduced -- accompanied by an expert or two to lend insight. It all takes place on a set modeled after Somers' actual living room. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199410.gz"
"13174"	"they"	"bond"	" ``Extreme'' is more or less ``Baywatch Bundles Up,'' featuring hunky guys and plucky women who follow the orders of James Brolin in serving as a steep-mountain search-and-rescue team. They save lives, they bond, they fall in love. And then for kicks, they go skiing -- fast. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"
