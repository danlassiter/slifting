"20459"	"they"	"sit"	" Dozens of residents meet with social workers, nurses and counselors at a Red Cross Service Center at the Best Western Trade Winds, where 70 rooms are being used for emergency housing. With fresh bandages on their cuts, they sit, solemn-faced and hunched over tables, listening to instructions on how to get vouchers for clothing and housing. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"85573"	"they"	"sit"	" To get into a detox program, they're told, you need a Medicaid card. To get a Medicaid card you need to be on welfare. But then, because of budget cuts, they're told welfare only treats alcoholics until further notice. Finally, they're told by another poker-faced functionary that if they're lucky enough to be HIV-positive, they can get emergency Medicaid and detox. Shakur is totally convincing as the patient one; Roth doesn't miss a twitch as the jumpy little dreg who pushes the envelope. Both want only to get into a program so they can get off the streets to safety. At one point, they sit, bleeding, in a hospital emergency room, wearily unaware that they've come full circle. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

But Bush, a 36-year-old man with clear blue eyes, a perfectly shaved goatee and a seemingly endless reservoir of positive energy, is unabashed.

FOREIGN  With story BC-SAFRICA-ABALONE-NYT  A look at the lucrative business of abalone poaching in South Africa.  A study in Science says wild fish are biting the dust so fast there may be hardly any left to eat by 2050.  Downtown, the theater is long-shuttered and the streets are empty at midday. A few businesses - a thrift ship, a tattoo parlor, a place to take out payday loans - fill some space. What seems to give Aberdeen a pulse are the shrines to the best known product of this coastal town: the poet of despair, Kurt Cobain.  The consumer confidence numbers are out, and they indicate the Democrats will take back the White House in 2008. Such a forecast may seem a little bold, coming as it does just days before a midterm election, long before either party has chosen a presidential candidate and well before anyone can be sure how the economy will be performing then.  1103 TOTAL VOLUME -- 27p x 1 7/8 -- NYSE, Nasdaq &amp; Amex: declines/advances  If the Bluffs are not at the end of the world, they are in the same ZIP code.

No more than a few dozen people live full time along the high bluffs that give the villages their names. Most streets are not paved.

IRAQ (Baghdad, Iraq) -- The top American military spokesman in Iraq on Thursday played down recent tensions between the Bush administration and the Iraqi government. In a briefing in Baghdad, the spokesman, Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, sought to project an image of cooperation between the two governments, though he acknowledged that there had been episodes of disagreement. Semple. (EDS: an early version of this story has moved.)  SAFRICA-ABALONE (Port Elizabeth, South Africa) -- Drugs or fake Nikes may be the contraband of choice in many places. In Port Elizabeth, it is Haliotis midea -- abalone -- poached from the ocean bed, shucked from its curlicue shell and spirited out of the country by the ton to connoisseurs across Asia. Abalone smuggling is not just a huge business. It is also a peephole into post-apartheid society and the economics and genealogy of a particular criminal class in modern South Africa. That class, some experts say, is about to kill the golden gastropod that sustains it. Abalone poaching has become so widespread, dwarfing the take by the licensed abalone industry, that it threatens to wipe the species from the southern tip of Africa. A journal by Michael Wines.  AIR-SAFETY (Chantilly, Va.) -- Using the wrong runway, the error that led to the crash in Kentucky that killed 49 people in August, is not so rare, a top official of the FAA said Thursday. A search of 10 years of records found 117 other cases in which the crew was confused, said the official, Nicholas A. Sabatini, the associate administrator for aviation safety. That number does not include two cases in the past week. On Saturday evening in Newark, a Continental Airlines Boeing 757 mistook a taxiway for the parallel runway and landed on it. The taxiway was empty, which is not always the case. On Monday at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, controllers said an Alaska Airlines 737 had taken off on the wrong runway; safety officials are investigating whether the problem was confusion between the tower and the cockpit about which runway had been assigned.

FOREIGN  With story BC-SAFRICA-ABALONE-NYT  A look at the lucrative business of abalone poaching in South Africa.  A study in Science says wild fish are biting the dust so fast there may be hardly any left to eat by 2050.  There is, unquestionably, a striking amount of testosterone in the Virginia Senate race between Senator George Allen, football-tossing conservative, and James Webb, Democrat, Vietnam vet and chronicler of the warrior tradition.  But the real struggle in this exceedingly tight campaign, one of a handful that will determine control of the Senate, may be over the votes of women.  The consumer confidence numbers are out, and they indicate the Democrats will take back the White House in 2008. Such a forecast may seem a little bold, coming as it does just days before a midterm election, long before either party has chosen a presidential candidate and well before anyone can be sure how the economy will be performing then.
