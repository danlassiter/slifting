"50932"	"she"	"retorts"	" The talk turns to ``The Grotesque,'' which Ms. Styler produced and for which no release date has been set. Asked to describe Sting as an actor, she retorts, ``Cheap and cheerful.'' During the filming of ``Stormy Monday,'' Figgis found Sting to be ``a good actor with a natural sense of timing'' and thought that his talents were best suited to playing dark characters who are suffering from some inner conflict. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"
"145361"	"she"	"retorts"	" In the premiere, George Sr. escapes, and his twin brother, Oscar, reappears just in time to be repeatedly mistaken for his fugitive twin by the police. Jessica Walters plays the mother, Lucille, a martini-sipping autocrat who is icily selfish and deliciously mean and crazy. When her neurotic, sexually ambiguous youngest son, Buster, tries to defy her, she retorts, Suddenly he's too much of a big shot to brush his mother's hair? Walters' role is a familiar one, the kind of imperious doyenne Blythe Danner and Maggie Smith often play, but she brings her own nutty steel to the part: last season, she held her own against Liza Minnelli, who returns later this season to play Lucille Austero, Lucille Bluth's archrival and Buster's girlfriend. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"157460"	"he"	"retorts"	" The actors are appealing and well cast, but their characters are quite basic, borrowed shamelessly from Brat Pack movies of the mid-'80s. And '80s nostalgia is the real pleasure of Reunion, an opportunity to revel in the music and the innocent promiscuity of the pre-HIV era. The premiere pays homage to its antecedents: in a diner, Aaron asks Carla what he should give Jenna as a graduation present. When she suggests a Tennessee Williams play, he retorts, It's cute, but I don't know, it sounds a little too 'St. Elmo's Fire.' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
"158347"	"she"	"retorts"	" Everyone on Hot Properties behaves like a dumb blonde. Gail O'Grady plays the lead role of Ava, the owner of the real estate agency, who has kept her age a secret from her new (unseen) 25-year-old husband. (When one of her co-workers asks her when she plans to tell him her real date of birth, she retorts, he can do the math on my tombstone.) </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
"158922"	"he"	"retorts"	" Miller, whose profile eerily matches early portraits of Byron, skillfully blends his restless passion and moments of sour self-awareness. Byron is caustic about his future wife from the first, noting that he would like her more if she were less perfect. When Lady Melbourne (Vanessa Redgrave) first points out Miss Milbanke as a young woman in search of a husband, he retorts, Could she not find one in Jane Austen? (This could be a scriptwriter's revenge on Austen, who referred to Byron several times in Persuasion, not entirely flatteringly.) </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
