"84468"	"I"	"shovel"	" Otposhavett, 49, moved here from Thomaston, Conn., eight years ago, just to be in snow country. He didn't know how he'd make a living, only that he'd manage somehow. And he has, doing carpentry and painting and the like. (Being a a snow spotter for the National Weather Service is a volunteer job made for weather buffs.) He and his wife snowmobile and snowshoe the way the locals do, to get around more than to whoop it up. ``I chop wood for the stove, I shovel, and it keeps me outside, where I love to be,'' he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
