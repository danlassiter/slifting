LOVE CAN'T FIND A PLACE  Courtney Love, widow of grunge-rock star Kurt Cobain, says that she's having trouble finding a place for the ashes of her husband to rest in peace.  Love's personal assistant, Dean Mathiesen, says that Lake View Cemetery on Seattle's Capitol Hill rejected Cobain's ashes ``because they already had their hands full with Bruce Lee and Brandon (Lee) being buried there, and they couldn't take on another celebrity.''  Whereupon the widow turned to Calvary Catholic Cemetery. ``We had chosen a really nice tombstone,'' said Mathiesen, ``a really nice setup in a new area that had just opened up. . . . But when it came down to it, the monument was like $50,000 to $75,000. Courtney didn't want to do it.''  ``I don't have that kind of money,'' Love said, noting that Calvary wanted another $100,000 a year for security, ``and Kurt didn't have that kind of money.''

The official word is that the story _ of such importance that it will be featured on the cover, of course _ will dwell on the politics and personal life of the Gingriches (and that should just about cover everything).  P.S. Here's to objective journalism: The New York Observer's thumbnail profile of Mrs. Huffington (part of its Women of the Big East feature) says that she's ``already planning an inaugural ball for her new best friend _ Newt!''

What made them suspicious about the bag was that a monkey's head was sticking out of it.''  _ From the Washington newsletter Roll Call, which called last week's incident ``a close call.'' The monkey was confiscated by DC Animal Control and turned over to the Humane Society; its bearer was not charged.  LOVE CAN'T FIND A PLACE  Courtney Love, widow of grunge-rock star Kurt Cobain, says that she's having trouble finding a place for the ashes of her husband to rest in peace.  Love's personal assistant, Dean Mathiesen, says that Lake View Cemetery on Seattle's Capitol Hill rejected Cobain's ashes ``because they already had their hands full with Bruce Lee and Brandon (Lee) being buried there, and they couldn't take on another celebrity.''  Whereupon the widow turned to Calvary Catholic Cemetery. ``We had chosen a really nice tombstone,'' said Mathiesen, ``a really nice setup in a new area that had just opened up. . . . But when it came down to it, the monument was like $50,000 to $75,000. Courtney didn't want to do it.''  ``I don't have that kind of money,'' Love said, noting that Calvary wanted another $100,000 a year for security, ``and Kurt didn't have that kind of money.''  HAS GINGRICH FOUND HIS BOSWELL?  Arianna Huffington, candidate's wife, Picasso biographer, would-be talk show personality and self-appointed spiritual counselor, is working on a cover story for the Ladies Home Journal about House Speaker Newt Gingrich.  According to the Hill, Huffington is trailing her man around Capitol Hill. The official word is that the story _ of such importance that it will be featured on the cover, of course _ will dwell on the politics and personal life of the Gingriches (and that should just about cover everything).  P.S. Here's to objective journalism: The New York Observer's thumbnail profile of Mrs. Huffington (part of its Women of the Big East feature) says that she's ``already planning an inaugural ball for her new best friend _ Newt!''  IKE TURNER IS A GROOM AGAIN  Ike Turner, 63, married singer Jeannette Bassell, 32, at the Circus Circus Casino in Las Vegas Tuesday night.  Turner's allegedly abusive relationship with his former wife, Tina Turner, was portrayed in her autobiography, ``I, Tina,'' and in the movie based on the book, ``What's Love Got to Do With It?'' His own version of his life story, ``Takin' Back My Name,'' will be published in September.  WHO SAID WHAT  ``Hey, how about Bob Hope's Christmas Show for the Militia? Hey, all you guys and gals, doing a tough, dirty but necessary job out here in Michigan. ...

PLAY THIS PUNCHLINE BACKWARDS AND IT SOUNDS LIKE `TRIGGER IS DEAD'  A man's walking along the beach and he sees a bottle.

Obviously class officers have been able to keep track of where she's living.  ``I'm trying to learn what the limits of leadership are,'' Mr. Clinton says. Well, you can lead a House to barter, but you can't make it think.  ``I think our heads are kind of getting on straighter today as a people,'' says the president. Are folks chiropracticing?  ``The United States is better positioned for the 21st century than any nation in the world,'' says Mr. Clinton. Good. It would be a hassle to move.  A new law makes shooting an arrow from a snowmobile in Indiana illegal. We had no idea the National Archery Snowmobile Association had so little clout in the state legislature.

"27354"	"he"	"thinks"	" All the same, Tubby is thoroughly miserable. And none of his assorted therapies seem to help: not his cognitive behavior therapy, not his acupuncture therapy, not his physiotherapy, not his aromatherapy. When Tubby stumbles across some essays by the existentialist philosopher Kierkegaard (essays with inspirational titles like ``Fear and Trembling,'' ``The Sickness Unto Death'' and ``The Concept of Dread''), he feels an immediate sense of identification. He is, he thinks, the very definition of Kierkegaard's ``unhappiest man,'' a man incapable of living in the present, a man who lives only in past memory or future hope. Tubby's shrink tells him he's simply suffering from low self-esteem. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"

"31865"	"he"	"thinks"	" In medicine, McCall will say, the financial incentives have always been there. In the old fee-for-service system, he thinks, there was an incentive to do too much, too many tests, too many X-rays. Now, he suspects, the new managed care, which rewards gate-keeping doctors for keeping down costs, may mean doing too little. It is not that all, or many, doctors will consciously change their practice to change their income, he thinks, but that since so much of medicine is judgment, everything that affects a doctor's attitude may affect his methods. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"

And Kyle Calabrese, 5, is against the fence, staring at the ``big kids'' and preparing to start first grade at P.S. 31 in Bayside, Queens. (Nancy Siesel/New York Times Photo)  (NYT15) BALTIMORE -- Sept. 7, 1995 -- BBO-TV-SPORTS, 9-7 -- Cal Ripken flanked by his father and his mother Wednesday night at Camden Yards in Baltimore after he played in his 2,131st straight game. Total time Ripken spent on camera: 58 minutes 52 seconds, including 19:18 of the 22-minute ovation break in the fifth inning after the 2,131st game became official. For a 4:45 chunk of cheers, the camera never strayed from Rip. (Barton Silverman/New York Times Photo)  (NYT14) BRIDGEPORT, Conn. -- Sept. 7, 1995 -- BRIDGEPORT-MOON, 9-7 -- Rabbi Israel C. Stein of Bridgeport confronts John Williams and other Unification Church members as they arrive Thursday at the University of Bridgeport for Rev. Sun Myung Moon's honorary degree ceremony. ``This is a normal American university with a unique funding source,'' says Dr. Richard L. Rubenstein, left, president of the university, of Rev. Moon's ownership of the school. (George Ruhe/New York Times Photo)  (NYT13) UNDATED -- Sept. 7, 1995 -- BUSINESS-SPEAKERS-CLR, 9-7 -- Harvey Mackay, businessman, author and motivational speaker, is a one-man band of self-promotion. At $50,000 a pop, he gives 50 or so speeches a year, raking in $2.5 million. The number of business and trade conferences is growing, more people are becoming speakers, and fees are rising. Most speakers bureaus - companies that provide speakers to banquets, conferences and other corporate events - report revenue growth around 20-percent a year. (Susan Biddle/New York Times Photo)  (NYT12) NEW YORK -- Sept. 7, 1995 -- DEADBEAT-DAD'S-EXWIFE, 9-7 -- Joseph Nichols, 15, at home in Manhattan with his mother, Marilyn Nichols Kane, and his stepfather, David Kane. On Aug. 18, a judge sent her former husband, Jeffrey Nichols, a prominent precious-metals trader, to jail for contempt until he pays $68,000 of the $580,000 he owes in child support. If Nichols has become the poster boy for America's deadbeat dads, Mrs. Kane has emerged as something of a patron saint for their spouses and children. (Thomas Dallal/New York Times Photo)  (NYT11) NEW YORK -- Sept. 7, 1995 -- KENNEDY-MAGAZINE-CLR, 9-7 -- John F. Kennedy Jr., speaking from a podium in Federal Hall (The hallowed site in downtown Manhattan where George Washington was inaugurated in 1789.), launches his magazine, ``George,'' to great fanfare. The first cover features supermodel Cindy Crawford, resplendent as our first president, sporting a powdered wig, a Revolutionary uniform -- and a bare midrift. ``Our first choice,'' says Kennedy, ``was Alan Greenspan in Speedos.'' (Marilynn K. Yee/New York Times Photo)  (NYT10) NEW YORK -- Sept. 7, 1995 -- ANTACID-AD-WARS-CLR, 9-7 -- In the biggest push for off-the-shelf drug sales in years, the makers of Tagamet (displayed here at a Manhattan Duane Reade drug store) and Pepcid are pouring $100 million each into the first round of an already chaotic marketing free-for-all. The competition will become even more fierce when Zantac, the world's biggest drug, storms into the market for nonprescription treatments for heartburn. (Ruby Washington/New York Times Photo)  (NYT9) MOSCOW -- Sept. 7, 1995 -- RUSSIA-VERITAS, 9-7 -- Maksim Bykovsky, a graduate student and businessman, rises slowly to his feet, a full glass of vodka in his hand. It is time for the third toast - to the dead, he thinks, but isn't sure. He's had a bit too much to drink already, and the party is just getting under way. Confusion is common on the complicated etiquette of how to drink and toast in Russia. In the military, it is traditional to drink the third toast to those who've died in war - that is, unless it's the second toast. (Otto Pohl/New York Times Photo)  (NYT8) NEW YORK -- Sept. 7, 1995 -- ADV. FOR SUN. SEPT. 10 -- INVEST-Q&AMP;A-FARRELL-LYNCH, 9-7 -- Robert Farrell has been watching the stock market for Merrill Lynch for 38 years, through bull markets and bear markets, and now has the title of senior investment advisor. He sees plenty of signs of excess in the current bull market, but doesn't think the end is nigh. ``From a cyclical standpoint, I think the market is still reasonably positive,'' he says.

So you pack up your bags, hop the subway and go straight to Brooklyn. In a matter of minutes, and just two miles from Manhattan, you arrive at 113 Prospect Park West in Brooklyn, a brownstone that is Bed and Breakfast on the Park, a seven-guest-room accommodation of a highly unusual nature.

The renovation of the Great Hall means a major facelift for one of the most visible and heavily trafficked spots not just in the Met but in any New York museum. (Jack Manning/New York Times Photo)  (NYT5) UNDATED -- September 7, 1995 -- ADV. FOR SUN. SEPT. 10 -- BOWIE-POP-CLR, 9-7 -- In the 70's, David Bowie, who was born and raised in London, turned out some of the most innovative popular music on either side of the Atlantic. Now 48, Bowie's forthcoming Virgin release ``Outside'' reunites him with the producer Brian Eno, collaborator on ``Low'' and ``Heroes,'' and recaptures the cool menace that propelled his music two decades ago.

He now faces the questions that confront any artist who has inspired a major uproar at a minor age. Will he evolve or keep repackaging the material that made him famous? (Tom Brazil/New York Times Photo)  (NYT2) NEW YORK -- September 7, 1995 -- ADV. FOR SUN. SEPT. 10 -- NY-ARCHITECTURE-CLR, 9-7 -- A look at New York City's skyline from lower Manhattan. Lower Manhattan, usually called the financial district, and its incomparable skyline are in serious trouble. The treasury of landmark-quality superskyscrapers are in poor physical condition, with many of the buildings untenanted. They are desperately in need not only of major capital investment but also of new ideas about how to use them. (Keith Meyers/New York Times Photo)  (NYT1) FAIRFIELD COUNTY, Conn.-- September 7, 1995 -- ADV. FOR SUN. SEPT. 10 -- JASON-ROBARDS-1, 9-7 -- Jason Robards, 73, at home in Fairfield County, Conn. He is performing in not one but two new plays in New York this season.

With the storm adrift over the Canadian Maritimes, the counterclockwise circulation of air around the sluggish system continues to direct winds from the northwest across New England and the northern Middle Atlantic states. Persistent, offshore winds will push surface waters farther out to sea, making coastal shallows a foot or so shallower than normal. This weekend, times of low tides could prove to be hazardous to mariners who venture into shallows off the New Jersey, Delaware, New York and Connecticut Coasts. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19951222.0448 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-TEXBUDGET-TEX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> The Fort Worth Star-Telegram plans to move the following stories for clients of the NYTimes News Service for AMs of Saturday, Dec. 23, and thereafter.

CONGRESS-TEXODUS  WASHINGTON _ After years of relative stability, the Texas congressional delegation has been hit with so many retirement announcements that political junkies have coined a new word to describe the trend: Texodus. With a year left in the current Congress, seven Texas House members have announced that they will not seek re-election. Their en masse departure is likely to diminish the state's clout in Washington and could pave the way for dramatic Republican gains in the state's 30-member House contingent. By RON HUTCHESON.

They complained it was over budget, over schedule and overrated. But with a dozen Air Force C-17s now involved in the NATO peacekeeping mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina, it seems those complaints may have been overstated. By MICHAEL D. TOWLE.

PANTEX-EXPLOSION  UNDATED _ An explosion of 80 pounds of plastic explosives during an emergency exercise at an Energy Department complex near Amarillo, Texas, rocked a nearby farmhouse, apparently cracking the slab, brick walls and a water line, according to a letter from a farm couple that estimates repairs at $7,000. ``The blast broke my house,'' said Jeri Osborne, who lives across the road from Pantex, a U.S. government complex where nuclear weapons are disassembled and plutonium is stored.

NICOLE KIDMAN By Ivor Davis. 1,200 words + photos (Not available Great Britain and Australia.)  Nicole Kidman's daredevil spirit compels her to ``keep up'' with husband Tom Cruise both on-screen and off. Like Cruise, Kidman drives race cars, jumps from airplanes and swims with sharks. Kidman also fights hard and risks much to prove she's her husband's equal on film. Will her portrayal of Isabel Archer in ``Portrait of a Lady'' bring her closer to her goal? Kidman talks about her desire to live dangerously. __________________________________  2. WHO KILLED THE ITALIAN FILM INDUSTRY? By Lene Lovschall. From Europ Magazine. 800 words.  Rome is a fascinating combination of legend and reality. So is Cinecitta. This cinema city, once known as ``Hollywood on the Tiber,'' is falling into disrepair. The great tradition of Italian film is in trouble. _____________________________________  3. JOHN TRAVOLTA By Jeanne Wolf. 1,400 words + photo. (N/A in Australia, Brazil.)  John Travolta is no angel, notoriously devoted to the good life of worldly pleasures. But in Nora Ephron's new film, ``Michael,'' Travolta gets a chance to play a new kind of angel, one who drinks and smokes and loves women - in short, an angel Travolta-style. The actor talks about the new movie, his barrage of post-''Pulp Fiction'' movies, his own take on angels and why he's jealous of Tom Cruise. ___________________________________  4. ELMORE LEONARD : A PROFESSIONAL APPROACH TO CRIME By Lauris Wren. 1,400 words + photo  Acclaimed by the New York Times as ``the master of the contemporary crime novel,'' Elmore Leonard's novels are fixtures on bestseller lists, with movie and TV adaptations of his work in store. Leonard talks about the new movies, how he crafts the quirky petty criminals who are his trademark, why he gave up a successful career as a Western novelist to write crime stories, and why it doesn't matter to him that he literally doesn't recognize some of his books by the time they reach the screen. ___________________________________  5.

RALPH FIENNES By James Fallon. From W Magazine. 1,500 words + photo  Actor Ralph Fiennes, (shortly to be seen in the movie ``The English Patient,'') claims he hates being a star. He loves acting, which he has been doing ever since the age of 7, when his father gave him a toy theatre and he would put on productions for his long-suffering brothers and sisters. But stardom isn't about acting, he thinks, stardom is about hype. ___________________________________  7. HOLLYWOOD DOLLARS By Tal Shahaf. From Europ Magazine. 1,000 words.  ``Mission Impossible,'' ``Rob Roy,'' ``Patriot Games,'' ``101 Dalmations'' etc. ..... What do all these box-office hits have in common? They were all produced in Great Britain. The British film indusry is flourishing, thanks to American production money. __________________________________  8. ANITA O'DAY By Leonce Gaiter. 1,400 words + photo  A contemporary of - and, some said, an equal to - master jazz vocalists such as Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan, Anita O'Day is only now receiving the general recognition that jazz critics have long awarded her. But at 75, O'Day has little time for stardom - she'd rather keep singing. In this interview she talks about her new acclaim, her unique singing style, her 14-year-struggle against a heroin addiction and how she succeeded as a white woman in the traditionally black world of jazz. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19970115.0073 type=story > <HEADLINE> ABBOTT LOSES BID TO BLOCK RIVALS ON HYPERTENSION DRUG (REPEAT) </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> Washington, Jan. 15 (Bloomberg) (BC-ABBOTT-REPEAT-BLOOM) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

"87353"	"he"	"thinks"	" Consider just some of the revelations of the past few months. Brave, heroic Switzerland turns out to have been a nest of nervous collaborators; ``ordinary Germans'' are portrayed as willing murderers; a Czech exile, brought up a Catholic, rises to become secretary of state of the United States and discovers that she is a Jew. As if to give shape to the ambiguity of our memory of World War II, a film set during it wins 12 Oscar nominations. The film's romantic hero is ``The English Patient'' _ yet the patient is not English at all, but a Hungarian spy for the Nazis. In the book by Michael Ondaatje on which the film is based, a Sikh bravely disarms bombs for the Allies; yet when he hears of Hiroshima, he thinks, ``They would never have dropped such a bomb on a white nation.'' All is muddled; all uncertain. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19970216.0069 type=story > <HEADLINE> WHO WAS TO BLAME </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-WAR:COLLABORATORS-NEWSWEEK-NYTSF) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"

INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  CHINA-MOOD (Beijing) _ After Deng's death, Beijing shows few signs of tension or public concern. By Seth Faison.  CHINA-ECON (Tokyo) _ Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China's policy of economic openness, seemed to possess a magical touch with China's economy in its rocky transition from communism to capitalism. But Deng has left his successors facing even tougher challenges, ones that he may not have been brave enough to take on. By Sheryl WuDunn.  (ART ADV: Chart on China's exports has been sent to NYT graphics clients.)  CHINA-DISSIDENTS (New York) _ Inside the world of China's exiled dissidents, where they talk about the future, the shape of China after the death of Deng Xiaoping has been the main topic for years, with nearly as many opinions as dissidents.

As the Russian-built airliner rose from the runway to take in a spectacular view of the snow-crested Tian Shan mountain range, some of the 60 or so passengers voiced the surprise and concern of millions of Chinese who were coming to terms with the death on Wednesday of the man whose policies had led the country for two decades.

INTERNATIONAL NEWS (``i'' category)  TALIBAN (Islamabad, Pakistan) _ Afghanistan's Taliban regime offers to release eight imprisoned aid workers if the United States agrees to declare that Afghanistan ``will not be the target of attack.'' Taliban gunners fire on, but fail to bring down, a high-flying airplane circling Kabul. By DUDLEY ALTHAUS.  PAKISTAN-ISLAM (Islamabad, Pakistan) _ As Pakistani President Musharraf signs on for the U.S. led coalition against bin Laden and the Taliban, Muslim's here and elsewhere face a crisis of faith. Can they support an attack by a non-Muslim nation on another Islamic country even if bin Laden is guilty? Does an attack on Muslims in Afghanistan require joining the struggle? The responses from the majority of Pakistanis could determine the fate of Musharraf's government and the success of the U.S. campaign to build a coalition to take out bin Laden. By DUDLEY ALTHAUS.  With photos by EDWARD ORNELAS.  AFGHAN-WEATHER (Undated) _ With winter approaching, the fate and fighting tactics of American troops in the Afghanistan mountains may depend on a tiny, usually forgotten band of heroes: military meteorologists. Mountain weather is much more complex than it looks; the gnarled terrain plays maliciously with moisture, temperature, wind, and snow, and can suddenly freeze soldiers' skin, entomb tanks in snowdrifts, generate wind shear able to flick helicopters into peaks. The overall question is: Will iffy weather forecasts doom U.S. actions in Afghanistan as they almost wrecked the D-Day invasion? By KEAY DAVIDSON.  WASHINGTON NEWS (``w'' category)  TERROR-BIN-LADEN (Washington) _ Osama bin Laden views the United States as a weak and decadent nation whose armed forces suffer from what he once described as ``low spiritual morale.'' Terrorism experts say that after launching the Sept. 11 attacks, bin Laden expects either a withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Gulf region or a U.S.-led air war that would be ineffective and indiscriminate in its casualties. That, he thinks, would lead the Arab world to unite against America. By DAN FREEDMAN. (2ndld-writethru filed Wednesday.)

NATIONAL NEWS ((``a'' category)  CHANGED-AMERICA (San Antonio) _ By now, the searing images of the devastation and death on Sept. 11 are forever burned in America's consciousness _ playing over and over in our minds like a kind of 21st-century version of Zapruder's Kennedy assassination film. But while the nation grapples with grief, uncertainty and anger, some are asking just how America has been changed by those brutal attacks and impending conflict. The short answer, experts say, is that while the nation has been badly shaken, it is not broken. But it is unquestionably different. By MARINA PISANO. (Filed Thursday.)  WARFARE (Bridgeport, Calif.) _ A battalion of U.S. Marines from Camp Lejeune, N.C., joined by 200 British commandos, goes through  a night of training at the USMC mountain warfare training center on the east slope of the Sierra about 20 miles north of Bridgeport. The rough terrain is a lot like the topography of Afghanistan, where they may well be fighting weeks or months from now. By MICHAEL TAYLOR.  BLACK-MUSLIMS (San Francisco) _ Ten days ago, a Black Muslim activist in Atlanta said Osama bin Laden, if responsible for the attacks on Sept. 11, was justified in targeting the United States. ``He is fighting for a way of life that stands for justice and against oppression,'' said Bilal Sunni-Ali. ``This is just the beginning of what will happen in America.''

EXP-TERROR-COALITION (Washington) _ Assured of logistical and political support from several partners in the region, President Bush warned the Taliban government that ``full warning has been given, and time is running out.'' By Elaine Sciolino and Steven Lee Myers.  EXP-AFGHAN-REBELS (Jabul-Seraj, Afghanistan) _ Sipping tea in an elegant garden here just 50 miles from Kabul, the foreign minister of the rebel Northern Alliance made a breezy claim for the future government it hopes to form. In it, he said, ``the people of Afghanistan will have the right of self-determination.'' But the alliance has been accused of shelling civilians, carrying out summary executions, burning and looting the houses of suspected Taliban sympathizers and engaging in opium and weapons trafficking, according to human rights groups. By David Rohde and John F. Burns.  EXP-SAUDI-WAHHABISM (Jidda, Saudi Arabia) _ The faith that drives Osama bin Laden and his followers is a particularly austere and conservative brand of Islam known as Wahhabism, which was instrumental in creating the Saudi monarchy _ and could tear it down. By Neil MacFarquhar.  EXP-CHINA-AUTOS (Beijing) _ Urban planners may fret about traffic and pollution. But judging from the pent-up dreams expressed at a huge car lot in southern Beijing, private car ownership is an unstoppable wave, bringing vast changes in social attitudes and habits along with new challenges to the environment. By Erik Eckholm.  EXP-CARIBBEAN-ECON (Nassau, Bahamas) _ The suicide attacks that reduced the World Trade Center and part of the Pentagon to rubble have also shaken economies throughout the Caribbean, with island after island facing drastic reductions in American tourists and their dollars. By David Gonzalez.  EXP-TERROR-SPECIAL-FORCES (Washington) _ For all the emphasis that Pentagon planners have put on special operations forces in a war against the network of Osama bin Laden and the Taliban government, at the moment relatively few of these secretive soldiers are within striking distance of the heart of Afghanistan, according to officials at the Pentagon. By Thom Shanker.  EXP-TERROR-INFO-CLAMPDOWN (Washington) _ If the United States is embarking on the first war of the 21st century, and one that the president has said may be ``secret even in success,'' then the damming up of information out of Washington is part of the strategy. By Elisabeth Bumiller.  EXP-TERROR-RESERVISTS (Horsham, Pa.) _ Across the nation, as reservists in every branch of the armed services are called to duty for up to two years, this is a time of wrenching goodbyes and rearranged lives. By Tamar Lewin.  EXP-TERROR-BLIND-SURVIVOR (New York) _ While much of the world will never forget the images of destruction, Omar E. Rivera will never forget the violent, terrifying sounds. Rivera, who is blind, and his yellow Labrador retriever, Salty, escaped unharmed from the 71st-floor office of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. By Winnie Hu.  EXP-NY-MUSLIM-TEENS (New York) _ They are Americans who feel duty-bound by Islam to obey American laws. But if their country called them to war against a Muslim army, some of them say they might refuse to fight. They cannot be shaken from the conviction that America is intrinsically anti-Muslim. Yet they see it as the one place where Muslims are free to be themselves. By Susan Sachs.

"98141"	"she"	"thinks"	" A Manhattan hospital worker is taking the bus instead of the subway, but the bus is packed _ probably, she thinks, with people who have the same idea she has. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"103081"	"she"	"thinks"	" How, she thinks, could he deceive her? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"104758"	"she"	"thinks"	" The book is a loving portrait of her parents, she thinks, but she was unsure how they'd react. But on a Christmas visit to Zambia last month, ``Dad said to me, `Well done, well written . . . and, by the way, you forgot a few good bits.' We talked a little bit about Olivia and why I shouldn't feel guilty about that.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"105222"	"he"	"thinks"	" These people's marriages tend to be filled with odd holes and silences, and their extramarital affairs are usually desultory, ships-in-the-night type liaisons. In most cases they do not really know the other person, much less make an emotional connection. Wales, the journalist in ``Quality Time'' who has been having an affair with a woman married to a wealthy real estate baron, is surprised when she mentions her parents; such a reference, he thinks, ``seemed so intimate and so irrelevant'' to their affair. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"105892"	"he"	"thinks"	" Michaels also has been aggressively promoting Hop-On to other reporters. He told a publication called the Wireless Reporter in August that the company would reach $500million in sales in the next year. ``Even that prediction, he thinks, is conservative,'' the online publication said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"106506"	"he"	"thinks"	" He is aware of the global campaign to ban land mines. It would be a good idea, he thinks, to work out some kind of stricter regulation of the things, at minimum to require better mapping of where mines are sown so they can be safely recovered. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"

"107435"	"he"	"thinks"	" Naison launches into the play-by-play of the parable. Early in the game, he slugs a double, stretches it into a triple and makes sure to knock over the third baseman when he slides in safely. Park Slope goes on to win, something like 9-2, he thinks, and another ``racialization'' is defused. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"

"107639"	"he"	"thinks"	" The key to success, he thinks, is to find a way to emulate the efficiency of muscle tissue: ``Muscle is so damn good at this stuff. If you took all of the muscles off of a healthy adult male and put them in full contraction, they would lift 20 tons. And they run on carrots.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"

"110270"	"he"	"thinks"	" The issue of tipping is addressed several times. Ginsberg's basic truth: You can't tell who will leave a good tip. In one restaurant, a fellow waiter complains that he is getting only low-tipping parties. With a straight face, he says these groups include ``old people, young people, couples with children, groups of women, people celebrating birthdays, and families.'' Another waiter refuses to spend any time at a table after the people order white zinfandel, which he likens to wine coolers. They obviously are unsophisticated diners, he thinks, and will leave a poor tip. They do. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"110547"	"she"	"thinks"	" In the opening scenes, we meet the politically savvy Kate, a former governor of Ohio and a judge before that. She is called to Washington, she thinks, to be told she's on the president's short list for the Supreme Court. But she quickly finds out she's the nominee. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"

"112249"	"he"	"thinks"	" ``The dancers today, most of them are the offspring of that particular crew that was dancing back in the '70s,'' says Laufman. ``Their children are no longer back-to-the-land, they're computer programmers and high-tech people. They've taken over the contra dances and made it into a high-tech kind of thing.'' Dancers today, he thinks, want more complicated, technical dances. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"116513"	"he"	"thinks"	" ``But Kobe's got an iron stomach, he thinks,'' trainer Gary Vitti said. ``He's eating what he wants and he's doing fine, so God bless him.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"120311"	"she"	"thinks"	" ``I can see her, Claudia Isham in 1978, locked in the bathroom of that little brick house,'' says the narrator of Sally MacLeod's ``Passing Strange.'' Her teen-age features, she thinks, ``huddled around her hatchet nose as if in commiseration, instantly reveal her as a person exempt from life's more gratuitous delights; love at first sight, for instance.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"
"120700"	"he"	"thinks"	" And that, he thinks, will mean directors are going to have to start taking their jobs more seriously. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"

"121789"	"she"	"thinks"	" Mary Jo Shipley, Arlington, would like a recipe for Texas sheet cake and another for a recipe she clipped but never tried _ called, she thinks, Texas best brownies. Both recipes have chocolate icing. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"122718"	"he"	"thinks"	" But the drought, he thinks, is connected to an event that is related to El Nino: its opposite effect, the cooling of water in the central Pacific. This effect is called La Nina and has been operating for the past few months, although it has faded away. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"123463"	"she"	"thinks"	" In her view, young people are experiencing a mediated nostalgia for a period in history that for them might as well be the age of King George III, in large part because of television. So the taste for fur trimmings and other hippie-like elements comes not just from the filtering down of bohemian trends seen on the runway, but, she thinks, from ``That '70s Show'' and the retro programming on Nickelodeon. And of course, some girls are inspired by the vintage clothes their mothers wear, Radoczy said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"124411"	"he"	"thinks"	" Billy saw the World Trade Center come down from his kitchen window. The work always flows for him, but this time he could not draw. This was, he thinks, because his art is always happy. He just sat on his fire escape with a beer, looking at the smoke, smelling the smell. Then, after a few weeks, he did two paintings: a New York City fireman and the Statue of Liberty. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"127193"	"she"	"thinks"	" As for Irena, she feels lost, unmoored, a stranger in both Paris and Prague. Her French friends _ who once welcomed her as a symbol of emigre suffering, as ``living proof of what they thought'' about the evils of Stalinism _ now believe that she should ``confirm that suffering'' by her ``joyous return to the homeland.'' Her Czech friends meanwhile have little interest in the achievements and sorrows of her last 20 years. To be accepted here in Prague, she thinks, she would have to set her life in France ``on the altar of the homeland and set fire to it.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"127971"	"she"	"thinks"	" Diane Roback, a senior editor at Publishers Weekly, interviewed Carter at the time of his teen-aimed 1993 book ``Talking Peace: A Vision for the Next Generation.'' His strength as a writer, she thinks, is inseparable from the human rights work that won him the Nobel. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"130633"	"he"	"thinks"	" Ken Goldstein, an economist at the Conference Board, said he suspects that even as spending has held up, people are starting to worry that the boom of the late 1990s will not come back for a long time. As a result, he thinks, there will be less spending on what he calls consumer ``wish lists.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"134411"	"she"	"thinks"	" But it's for precisely that reason, she thinks, that Truman cannot be held personally responsible for every twist and turn of American Cold War policies. Truman's limitations, she thinks, meant that authority devolved onto advisers like Dean Rusk, Dean Acheson, James Byrnes and, in general, the American foreign-policy elite. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"

"134657"	"he"	"thinks"	" This monthly is a compilation of articles culled from books, small press publications, the Internet and ``other sources.'' It's always a pleasure to flip through ``Utne'' because it let's you see what smart young people are thinking about. This issue focuses on ways of reclaiming your time from our hectic, overbooked, overscheduled lifestyle. You'll find advice on how to escape the tyranny of the appointment book, ways to go Zen and just enjoy the moment, and a look at the refusal to schedule as a political statement. (Wow!) There's also an experimental calendar that abandons the increasingly sterile and dehumanizing conventional calendar (once rich with saints' days, moon phases, and tips on planting and fishing but now often is just another lever for raising productivity). You'll also find in this issue an examination of our hate-love relationship with war. Research psychologist Lawrence LeShan suggests that it is simplistic and fruitless to portray people as intrinsically hating war. Rather, he thinks, it's best to acknowledge that war offers apparent solutions to many psychological and social problems, thus making make it profoundly appealing to many people and cultures. Starting from this blunt fact, he hopes, we can develop realistic ways to prevent war. Other articles look at yerba mate (ACCENT OVER ``E'') as a healthful, ecologically sound alternative to coffee and tea; at a ``jock'' whose teacher made him fall in love with ideas; and at the Internet's future. ``Utne'' will make a fine gift for a young person who thinks. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"

"136776"	"he"	"thinks"	" Pornography has briefly appeared. A semi-nude shot was recently posted. A ripple of comments ensued, and then the community moved its attention to other things: whatever happened to Wite-Out, for instance, or what people were eating for lunch. Perhaps most remarkable is the site's general civility. Popovic invites people to share pictures of themselves the first time they post. That there are faces next to names, he thinks, may help. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"137576"	"she"	"thinks"	" Susan became a chemistry teacher because it was the one subject in high school she never understood. It made her a better teacher, she thinks, ``to understand not understanding.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200305.gz"
"137798"	"she"	"thinks"	" In this television adaptation of their stage hit, Tandy _ who won a Tony on Broadway and an Emmy on television _ plays an elderly Appalachian hill woman who refuses to be moved from the home where, she thinks, her husband's ghost still communicates with her. Screenplay by Cronyn and his future wife, Susan Cooper. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200306.gz"
"139550"	"he"	"thinks"	" She is a Mexican mother of two and a legal U.S. resident who wants to get involved in the public school system. He is an Ethiopian taxi driver with a green card who is getting evicted from his apartment building after five years because, he thinks, the city wants to tear it down to make way for a ritzy new condo development. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"139735"	"she"	"thinks"	" Fetija Ctljic, 35, stopped on the edge of the mass graves. Her husband's remains were identified last week and should be buried there soon. Her father's remains, she thinks, are lost in the woods sloping up from the village. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"140264"	"he"	"thinks"	" He has other theories. Blue, he thinks, should be reserved for big things -- the ocean, the sky or the meditating mind. Yellow, he believes, aids inspiration, so one of his boxy rooms glows like potent lemon custard. Still, neither his tropical plants nor his radical palette nor his neo-Gothic chairs (which cast a somber shadow onto the scene) could completely exorcise the ambience of a dull workplace or overcome the low ceilings and neon lights. And so he has embraced the jarring discrepancy between the 9-to-5 world and his own Victorian exoticism. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"140335"	"he"	"thinks"	" He is a bit wistful that his books have not sold better. Partly, he thinks, it's because people think of him as a reporter, that they don't take him quite seriously as an artist, though I only did (journalism) in a serious way for about five years. Another factor, he suspects, is that the novel has lost its place at the center of the American intellectual experience. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"141903"	"he"	"thinks"	" Shapleigh's plan is based on a Kansas state income tax formula, which is a three-step graduated tax on income (from 3.5 percent to 6.45 percent annually), and he figures that Texas could raise $34.6 billion each biennium. And, he thinks, it could do that with a flat tax of 5 percent. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"148324"	"he"	"thinks"	" A pure gesture, he thinks, has no excess. He has suffered from the ideal of purity, but he would not have given it up. And: He has always thought of Pearl as pure, a white flower hidden in a cool sheath of green leaves. Did she think she was emptying herself of all excess? Did this emptying mean she would become one of the dead? Eventually, Joseph comes unraveled in an improbable scene that verges on the melodramatic. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"

"149454"	"he"	"thinks"	" Bryce Youngren, a principal at Polaris Venture Partners in Waltham, said his firm has been seeing more foreign interest in buying Polaris-backed companies. If the dollar continues to slide, he thinks, that will become a more common exit scenario. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"
"151272"	"he"	"thinks"	" When the video finally clicks off, Woods is left to wonder the identity of the player in his No. 21 jersey. Who, he thinks, is that impostor? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"153105"	"he"	"thinks"	" Samir fires back, quickly spelling each word. He does not miss one. Maybe, he thinks, he will be so lucky next week. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
"154467"	"she"	"thinks"	" She considered moving back to North Carolina, where she has friends who might understand her better. Aaron, she thinks, will be with her and her children no matter where they are. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"154674"	"he"	"thinks"	" It also tells customers that their meat comes from a real place. As Jensen says: The consumer really puts a face on the food. People are cut off from agriculture, he thinks, and what they hear in the news tends to frighten them. Like River Rock, Pineland cattle eat grass as long as possible, then are finished in small feedlots on grain, hay, and some corn and soybean meal. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"154681"	"she"	"thinks"	" In another bit of gender-bending, the female Paddy has the job of copyboy at a Glasgow newspaper. She is too young to have made her mark there but old enough to be entranced by the world of journalism. (The year is 1981.) She moves warily through the Scottish Daily News office and its adjacent bar, where writers and editors spend their spare time. She was usually immune because of her age and miserable position, Mina writes about Paddy, but when drink was thrown into the mix they could turn on anyone. There are times, she thinks, when these newsmen are thinking her a snooty wee cow. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"156295"	"she"	"thinks"	" People want teeth like Chiclets, said Katie L. Dawson, president of the American Dental Hygienists' Association and a clinical hygienist for the last 30 years. The makeover shows on television, she thinks, are a large part of the reason oral hygiene -- especially whitening -- has become so popular. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"157606"	"she"	"thinks"	" She has not heard from another daughter, still in Louisiana, who, she thinks, is helping with the rescue effort. And she has no idea what she will do now, or how she will get home. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
"158228"	"she"	"thinks"	" She only allows her ninth-grade students to use school computers to write papers, because she is there to help if they have questions and also because, she thinks, her presence cuts down on plagiarism. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
"158564"	"he"	"thinks"	" He's only got a limited amount of time to fill out the paperwork, and he's already blown the deadline for his refund. The process, he thinks, is an outrage, and it's the main reason Brown is voting yes on Proposition 75, the union dues measure on the Nov. 8 special election ballot. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
"164709"	"he"	"thinks"	" It seems possible if he just practices more and builds up the strength in his hands. Maybe, he thinks, he can qualify in May. Patience, he tells himself. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"165513"	"he"	"thinks"	" In a few months, he thinks, the new cabinet will be able to undo the previous government's legacy of corruption and nepotism - despite international isolation and funding cuts. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"

"166820"	"she"	"thinks"	" The scenes in Paris may lose some viewers. The film's middle is circuitous and episodic, reflecting Emily's unrooted life. She moves in with an old friend (B?atrice Dalle); gets caught up in drama between broken-hearted Irene and the girl who just dumped her (Laetitia Spigarelli); and tries to track down Tricky (the British music producer-singer, playing himself), an old friend of Lee's who, she thinks, can convince Lee's dad to give her visitation rights to see her son. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"166830"	"she"	"thinks"	" A private, meticulous person, always immaculately groomed, her hair arranged in a careful chignon, Maryam is satisfied, she thinks, with her small life -- her house, her garden, her cat, her few women friends with which she shares an occasional dinner, her son, Sami, and his wife, Ziba. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"167992"	"he"	"thinks"	" little woman. Like me, he thinks, but so much better. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"169503"	"he"	"thinks"	" He likes to sprinkle micro-arugula over a pizza just before serving, top a turkey burger with a bunch of micro-mustard, scatter bok choy greens over salmon or rack of lamb or strew arugula and mustard atop a grilled steak. The hotter greens, he thinks, work well in fish tacos. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169980"	"he"	"thinks"	" Herbs would be more practical, he thinks, but he appreciates the tomato initiative. After all, it's August and we're all in a tomato haze. As Voiland of Red Fire Farms says, they're the epitome of late summer. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060823.0071 type=story > <HEADLINE> FOOD-RICKEY-ART-BOS </HEADLINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"170035"	"he"	"thinks"	" Sans mustache, Marc finds himself in a twilight zone. Agnès doesn't say a word about his minor makeover. Sure, she's still frisky and loving with him, but, ahem: Notice anything different? He's initially nervous for her to see it, boyishly ducking when he enters the bedroom and hiding his face behind a towel. But when he stops playing, he assumes that she's startled. Her refusal to mention his clean-shaven face must be part of some practical joke, he thinks, and an elaborate one, too, since his co-workers and friends (including one played by Mathieu Amalric) don't say anything, either. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"

"170770"	"he"	"thinks"	" He's an implacable machine politician who despises Blair because, he thinks, the lesser man got the job that's rightfully his, Harris said in an interview. I think he's been seething with resentment ever since. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"172293"	"he"	"thinks"	" Ho delivers his message in Vreelandesque aphorism. Perfection is a cheap caricature of style, he writes. Candles don't set a mood, people do. The index to his book contains an entry headed Myths, enslaving. One of them, he thinks, is the idea that you should always be ready for drop-in guests. No, you shouldn't, he counters, unless you're running a bed-and-breakfast. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172320"	"he"	"thinks"	" But there is one trend that's been dying in recent years: bulky, scary masks. Burda says he carries half as many masks as he did five years ago, largely, he thinks, because those who dress up still want to be recognizable. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"173107"	"he"	"thinks"	" Pinzur, however, thinks it is unrealistic to expect the levels of patient compliance needed to achieve the results that Bakker and Beaglehole envision. A more reasonable goal, he thinks, would be to reduce the total number of amputations by half. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173575"	"he"	"thinks"	" He would like one day to work as a mortician or perhaps a veterinarian. Those professions, he thinks, would not require him to interact much with people. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
