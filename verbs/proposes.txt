"12962"	"he"	"proposes"	" Flirtation, he proposes, is a way of keeping things in play, of cultivating wishes, of making room for the open-endedness of life. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"
"35348"	"he"	"proposes"	" In Evans's scheme, listening stations would monitor the nocturnal flight calls of thrushes, warblers, sparrows and other migrants. Computers would instantly identify every bird from its distinctive call and estimate how many individuals of each species passed over a particular site between dusk and dawn. One line of 40 stations, he proposes, would stretch 1,300 miles from Cape May on the New Jersey shore to eastern Nebraska. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"

"86048"	"he"	"proposes"	" Dr. Preston Marx, a researcher at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in Manhattan, who ran the Holloman chimp colony before the Coulston Foundation took over, favors maintaining a few large colonies to keep research chimps in optimal conditions _ housing them in large groups, which are not only better for the animals' mental health but also, according to a recent accounting at Yerkes, cost about $10 a day instead of about $16 for caging. These central colonies, he proposes, would run ``a shuttle system, where, for instance, a chimp might go to a medical facility for six months, be involved in a protocol to test a new vaccine, and then go back home.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"121521"	"he"	"proposes"	" The behavior of a meme, he proposes, follows general principles governing such replication. He characterizes a meme as a state of electrical energy among neurons in the brain, a pattern that has the unusual ability to replicate itself quickly by spurring other groups of neurons to fire in similar fashion. Or as he puts it: a meme is ``the state of a node in a neuronal network capable of generating a copy of itself.'' These patterns or ``states'' can be experienced as sensations or ideas or feelings. They can also result in actions, some of which communicate the meme to others. Such communications _ in books and artifacts and conversations _ inspire identical patterns of neuronal firing in other brains. This is the origin of culture. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"138395"	"it"	"proposes"	" As a contemptuous, nose-thumbing expression of this Danish director's misanthropy, the movie is relentlessly true to its hateful vision, depicting as a lie the ideal of embracing human community (and especially the cozy, cookie-baking dream of small-town America). The only true solidarity to be found in any group, it proposes, is through vengeful, xenophobic mob violence. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200310.gz"
"162679"	"he"	"proposes"	" In the beginning, he proposes, was the riverine ecology of Mesopotamia, in which the annual spring floods of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers were the sources of all fertility. The names of some Hebrew months stem from Mesopotamia; the Epic of Gilgamesh contains a counterpart to the Bible's flood tale. Perhaps, too, the very idea of exile from Eden was connected with the need to abandon Mesopotamia. Hillel points out that periodic flooding had troubling consequences: Silt could clog irrigation canals, while seeping salination could decrease soil's productivity. Settled populations (and conquerors) would move on to other pastures. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
