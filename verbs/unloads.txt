, it seems,	 Men, it seems,are the first to withdraw honoring and shift to a different set of behaviors after marriage. Do they do this because they falsely hustled the woman at the outset? Have they baited and switched? Or have they simply reneged on the crucial promise to love and honor the woman they selected as their life partner. If it is the latter, as it seems to be in most cases, the question, again, is why? Is this pattern of behavior so culturally accepted -- even expected -- that men do not even notice they are acting this way? And if this is the case, how did we get on this destructive road? </P> 	nyt_eng_200502.gz
, it concluded,	 But when the Office of Management and Budget looked at a very similar issue in 2001, it was not as optimistic. OMB had to evaluate the implications of stock investments by the National Railroad Retirement Fund. Over time, it concluded, stocks could only be guaranteed to provide the same return as ultrasafe government bonds (about 5 percent). In effect, the agency decided that the higher returns from the stock market were offset by the higher risks. </P> 	nyt_eng_200502.gz

A dead lamb in formaldehyde, it is, among other things, an elegiac reference to Christ as the lamb of God, a familiar subject in Christian iconography. The vitrine turns the piece into a reliquary, the repository of something sacred - and something real.

It was the aural equivalent of standing tall and saying, 'Here I am,' of marching with strength rather than tiptoeing with timidity. Brown discovered the One while messing around with the song I Feel Good, and once he found it, he writes, everyone tried to copy it: And I don't blame them.

But, they found, little progress has occurred in Latin America and Africa, and the former Soviet states are slipping into deeper poverty. Because China and India accounted for 60 percent of the world's poor in 1990, the goal of halving poverty may be achieved a decade from now, even while many regions see no progress. </P> 	nyt_eng_200502.gz

, he said,	 The first cities to get most independent films are New York and Los Angeles, said Russ Collins, executive director of the Michigan Theater, which was built in 1928 and shows independent films in its vast auditorium and in an intimate screening room. Next comes a ring of big cities like Chicago, Dallas and Seattle, he said -- an assertion confirmed by the distributors. The third tier includes smaller cities and college towns with sizable moviegoing populations, like Ann Arbor. The fourth tier, he said, receives movies long after they open or perhaps not at all, forcing avid filmgoers to buy or rent DVDs and videos. </P> 	nyt_eng_200502.gz
, she said,	 None of the cell phone carriers make public their subscriber base by age group. But Mary Nell Westbrook, a spokeswoman for Sprint PCS, called the elderly market a very narrow segment.

Sprint, Westbrook added, targets youth and baby boomers, who are obvious users. </P> 	nyt_eng_200502.gz

, he said,	 A 7-Eleven spokesman, Jack Wilkie, said the decision to set the product mix threshold at 85 percent was based on the company's desire to have consistent products in every 7-Eleven store.
