NEW YORK _  Dear Diary:  This summer, my friend Bev was near the front of a long line waiting for standby tickets for ``Hairspray'' when she noticed a well-dressed middle-aged woman edging her way into the front of the line.  ``Excuse me,'' Bev said to the woman, ``there's a line here.''  Ignoring her, the woman edged past a few more people. Bev tapped her on the shoulder.  ``Perhaps you didn't hear me,'' she said. ``This is a line.''  The woman turned on her and said: ``Oh I do this all the time. Obviously you're not a New Yorker.''  ``I am a New Yorker,'' Bev snapped back. ``And you're the kind of person who gives us a bad name.''  When the other people standing nearby, many of them tourists, heard this, they broke into applause. The woman slunk off, presumably to the end of the line.  _ DIANA KASH  Dear Diary:  In the '70s, my dad and I enjoyed many a Mets game in Shea Stadium. Watching players like Tom Seaver, Rusty Staub, Dave Kingman and Ed Kranepool certainly made for some wonderful childhood memories.  Some 25 years later, my dad and I returned to Shea for the first time since then. To the cry of ``Ice cold Coca-Cola,'' he responded, ``Two, please.'' He handed a $10 bill to the vendor, who handed him the Cokes, turned and walked away.  ``Hey!'' shouted my dad. ``Where's my change?''  ``Sir,'' replied the vendor, ``they cost $5 each.''  Perhaps the Mets should change the name to Chez Stadium.  _ SCOTT MANAS  Karen Flynn reports hearing the following conversation recently over the loudspeaker on a Metro-North train leaving Grand Central Terminal.  ``It's still not working.''  ``Well, try again.''  ``OK.'' Pause. ``Nope, it's still showing a problem.''  ``Ah, jeez. Are you sure you're trying the right thing?''  ``Yeah. But I'll try to restart.'' Pause. ``Nope, still nothing.''  ``OK. Let's call someone to come down and take a look.''  A few minutes passed.  Then: ``Are we going to move everyone?''  ``Yeah. I think so.''  ``Where? Across the platform?''  ``Maybe.''  Then:  ``They're not going to move us!''  ``You've got to be kidding.''  ``I know.'' Pause. ``OK, I'll try the brakes one more time.''  Another pause. Then the train pulled out of the station.  Dear Diary:  I was seated in a synagogue in Forest Hills, Queens, during the High Holy Day services when I noticed something unusual. The man seated in front of me was wearing a yarmulke adorned with the logo of the New York Yankees.  Yes, there was the bat inside a top hat with the Uncle Sam stripes.  When the ark was opened and the congregation rose, I could see the letters ``NY Yankees'' printed on top of the yarmulke. I had never seen one like that before.  Later, I told one of the ushers about it. He wasn't surprised. ``I know that guy,'' he said. ``He follows the team religiously.''  _ STANLEY D. FRIEDMAN  Dear Diary:  I was recently leaving a Midtown office building when I realized I had let the door close in the face of a woman behind me instead of holding it for her as I would normally do when my mind was less preoccupied.  I immediately turned around and said, ``I'm sorry, madam.''  She cast an unforgiving eye in my direction and snarled: ``Yeah, yeah, sorry. That's the story of my life.''  _ JERRY GAST  Dear Diary:  A recent contribution about redcaps reminded me of this:  A long time ago, when the earth was greener and seemed to hold more promise and JFK was in the White House, I worked in a bookstore in the Port Authority Bus Terminal. One day, a very proper Englishwoman walked into the shop and asked one of my co-workers about some announcements over the loudspeaker.  ``I hear them all the time calling for a redcap,'' she said. ``What is a redcap?''  ``A redcap is a porter,'' my colleague explained pleasantly. Then, continuing to make polite conversation, he inquired, ``What do they call porters in England?''  She looked at him with the sort of pitying gaze that one generally restricts to the terminally daft, and replied simply, ``Porter.''  _ STANLEY GINSBERG  Dear Diary:  On a recent bike ride through Central Park I noticed an unusually cute dog and exchanged smiles with its owner. It was a pleasure to stop and compliment her on such an adorable albeit strange-looking pup.  ``What is he?'' I asked, expecting to hear something like ``Part cocker spaniel, part Scottie.''  The answer? ``He's a vegetarian.''  _ DANDY STEVENSON  Dear Diary:  On a recent visit to the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in the Bronx, I remembered to place metal objects in a plastic box before I stepped through the security gate. But as soon as I stepped through, alarm bells began to ring. I explained to the security guard that I had metal in my right hip after total hip replacement surgery.  With a scowl on his face, he said, ``Next time, leave it outside before you come into the building.''  Would you believe he didn't laugh along with me?  _ MARTIN GOLD  Dear Diary:  Once in the early '80s, I was in D'Agostino's supermarket on Broadway near 72nd Street and saw a woman get in line behind another customer whose purchase was being tallied and bagged. The cashier told the woman just arriving that she was closing her register.  The customer, referring to the light on the register, replied, ``Your light says you're open.'' The cashier repeated that she was closing her register. The customer again said, ``Your light says you're open.''  The cashier then made my day, saying, ``I'm telling you with my mouth I'm closing my register.''  _ JOHN STEINHEIMER </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20021006.0184 type=story > <HEADLINE> SECURITY REPORT CALLS FOR PLAN TO SHARE DATA </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 10-06-02 23:10:00EDT (BC-U.S.-SECURITY-REPORT-) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
