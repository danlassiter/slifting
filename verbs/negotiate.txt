We want our businesses and careers to flourish, our suppliers and customers to behave predictably, our houses to look a certain way, our children's lives to follow particular trajectories, our schools and churches and supermarkets to be well-governed, presidential politics to progress this way or that, according to our tastes. We think prospectively about all of this, seeking to advance our goals. We decide, we negotiate, we position ourselves for future choices. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"
