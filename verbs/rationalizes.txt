"138469"	"he"	"rationalizes"	" In one episode, eyeing the cameras before him, David valiantly comes to the aid of an employee in a wheelchair during a fire drill, only to leave her stranded when lugging her down a staircase proves too strenuous. It's only a drill, he rationalizes, leaving the poor young woman abandoned on an endless spiral of steps. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200310.gz"
"170151"	"she"	"rationalizes"	" After not getting a promotion, she -- surprise, surprise -- realizes the error of her ways and agrees to sing in a Wal-Mart-sponsored musical because, she rationalizes, it will give her an opportunity to tell the cackling brass about the retail giant's evils. The scenes are staged haphazardly by Capellaro, who arranges her actors in straight lines or tucks them away in a corner of the stage. By the time the disembodied head of the late Sam Walton, Wal-Mart's founder, makes an appearance (don't ask why), contorting his face like a demented clown and singing, Is this the thanks I get for being dead?, I had had enough and left at intermission. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
