Susan Dime-Meehan, executive director of the National Depressive and Manic Depressive Association, based in Chicago, said at a news conference held by the American Psychiatric Association on Wednesday that the new guidelines ``will lead to earlier diagnosis and better treatment.''   The American Psychiatric Association officially issued the 30-page manual on the best methods of treating people with manic-depression, which doctors now often call bipolar affective disorder. It is characterized by wide mood swings, often alternating between manic elation and severe depression.   Two to three million adults in the United States, or about 1.6 percent of the nation's population, suffer from the disorder. Without treatment, about one-fifth of those with the illness will commit suicide.   MICHIGAN SENATE VOTES AGAIN TO BAN ASSISTED SUICIDE   LANSING, Mich. -- The state Senate voted Wednesday to outlaw suicide assistance once again and this time to make the ban permanent.   The bill, aimed squarely at stopping Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the retired pathologist who since 1990 has helped 21 gravely ill people kill themselves, now goes to the Michigan House, which is expected to pass it.   Gov. John Engler, an outspoken opponent of suicide assistance, says he will sign the measure, which would take effect April 1.   ``I think the prudent policy is to make sure Jack Kevorkian isn't free to operate throughout the state, bringing us the type of publicity we don't want,'' Engler told reporters Wednesday before the 26-9 vote in the Senate.   In an interview on Tuesday, Kevorkian termed the bill silly'' and said that if it passed it would ``just be declared unconstitutional again.''   HOUSE REPUBLICANS ANNOUNCE SWEEPING CHANGES, JOB CUTBACKS   WASHINGTON -- Republicans in the House of Representatives Wednesday ripped up the rulebook by which Democrats controlled the chamber for 42 years and offered a radical new one which, they promised, would make the unwieldy House smaller, more open and far more parsimonious.   Among many other changes, the new rules would dismantle three House committees and 25 subcommittees, slash some 600 employees from the committees' payrolls, end closed-door hearings and unrecorded committee votes and require any tax increase to gain the votes of three-fifths of lawmakers rather than half.   The next House speaker, Newt Gingrich, said later that the individual changes were, in a way, outweighed by the collective message they send to the nation's angry electorate.   The changes still have to be approved by the full House, and some are sure to rankle those Republicans whose power and prestige will ebb as their committees shrink in size.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941207.0193 type=story > <HEADLINE> ELIZABETH BIDDIE KRAMER, PHILANTHROPIST, DIES AT 86 </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-KRAMER-OBIT-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"
