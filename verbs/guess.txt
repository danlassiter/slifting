"513"	"I"	"guess"	" ``What can you tell them?'' Piniella said. ``About the only thing is, I guess, to make him throw strikes. But if he's throwing strikes and he's getting his breaking ball over, you're on your own.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199407.gz"
"603"	"I"	"guess"	" Raveling weighed several factors ranging from his love for Los Angeles (``I'm kind of a L.A. guy, I guess,'' he said) to his son, Mark, who will be a senior at USC this year. He doesn't play basketball. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199407.gz"
"620"	"I"	"guess"	" ``I'm kind of an L.A. guy, I guess,'' he said with a shrug. ``Deep down inside I was scared if I got back there I'd have a lonely feeling about being out here (with) my friends.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199407.gz"
"621"	"I"	"guess"	" ``Tough luck, I guess,'' Piazza said as he hurriedly dressed and left the stadium before the contest was even over. ``I hit a couple of balls hard but couldn't get under it. I was just trying to go out and have some fun.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199407.gz"

"1230"	"I"	"guess"	" ``That's about the worst I could play,'' she said. ``I mean, I've shot worse rounds, I guess, but to come to the U.S. Open and shoot 80, that's pretty disappointing.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199407.gz"
"1343"	"I"	"guess"	" ``Somebody's got to be predicting something,'' said Bills running back Thurman Thomas. ``They will keep saying it, I guess, until it finally happens. And then they can say, `See, I told you so.' Well, they can keep saying it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199407.gz"

"1586"	"I"	"guess"	" ``A normal Buddy practice,'' said the former Bears and Eagles quarterback, signed by Ryan to back up Steve Beuerlein. ``The only thing that surprised me, I guess, is there weren't any fights.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199407.gz"

"2246"	"I"	"guess"	" ``It (the cleat) got stuck in the dirt, and when I turned, I forgot to lift, I guess,'' said Portugal, who was wearing a brace that went from his ankle to his mid-thigh. ``It hurt. There's no getting around that.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199408.gz"
"2516"	"I"	"guess"	" ``This is crazy, man, with all of the positive things that have been going on with myself, the city and the team, to have something like that put a damper on things just because one police officer, I guess, has a chip on his shoulder,'' Sanders said. ``There were plenty of witnesses at the scene and I can't wait until we hear from those guys. . . .

"2864"	"I"	"guess"	" This marks his seventh year as coach at Modesto, said Richert. ``The thing about this level is, you got guys calling you before the season starts, asking you what they should do to keep in shape. It's almost like adopting 12 kids for the summer. What it comes down to, I guess, is that they're not spoiled yet.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199408.gz"

"4888"	"I"	"guess"	" ``Thank you,'' said Rams defensive end Fred Stokes, glad that someone else had noticed the difficulty in defensing this offense. ``Our job is to try to contain him, I guess, as far as not letting him just run around freely.

"5363"	"I"	"guess"	" ``I kind of slipped over into the Raiders' way of playing there, I guess,'' said Davis. ``It wasn't good judgment on my part, but none of the referees were helping Leslie, so I thought I had to do something.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199409.gz"

"5647"	"I"	"guess"	" ``It could be cathartic for me, I guess,'' continues Phelps, who's in her late 30s and has a 4-year-old son, Taylor, by West. ``But I prefer to think of it as part of a learning process.

"6422"	"I"	"guess"	" ``Things are going OK, I guess,'' he said. ``The country's at peace. But there's this feeling that we're on the edge of something bad. Look at the national debt. It's a monster! It's immoral for the Congress to have let that happen.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199410.gz"
"6607"	"I"	"guess"	" And there I sat, responding occasionally with ``Duh, yeah?'' If nothing else, I know how an exile feels. Sisterhood, I guess, is something else again. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199410.gz"

"7110"	"I"	"guess"	" Elwyn knew more history of the community and its people than, I guess, anybody else. It sort of comes with the business of death, that you keep up with the lives of folks and their folks before them. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199410.gz"
"7414"	"I"	"guess"	" ``I like it very much, and I liked the book,'' he said, slowly. ``I don't like all the scatalogical stuff as much as some people. I've never found that stuff all that funny, really. But I think a lot of the situations are very funny -- it's just, there could be a little less doodie, I guess, for me.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199410.gz"
"7886"	"I"	"guess"	" ``There is no back around who doesn't like to carry rather than block,'' Baxter said. ``I've been blocking for J.J. and going for short. Now, I guess, I'll be converting.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"

"8486"	"I"	"guess"	" ``Benoit Benjamin, I guess, was the star of the game,'' said Bulls Coach Phil Jackson. ``And he was a real factor in the lane for them.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"
"8503"	"I"	"guess"	" ``We've been together for 10 years,'' guitarist Melchiondo said. ``But as soon as we got on `Beavis and Butt-Head,' we sold something like 2,000 albums overnight. Then, every time they showed the video, we'd sell that many copies again. Making videos is fine, I guess, but I don't like the fact that MTV holds all the cards. They can take (awful) bands like Collective Soul or Candlebox and make them happen big time.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"
"8504"	"I"	"guess"	" ``It's a funny thing,'' Melchiondo said. ``A lot of your record's success is contingent on whether your video gets played and I don't think that's right. I'd like to see a situation where every local cable system gives you a choice of video channels, like they do with radio stations, and take MTV out of the picture. It's not entirely their fault, I guess, but they do have too much power.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"
"8668"	"I"	"guess"	" To encourage alternative sleep-styles would, I guess, risk public morality and national productivity. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"

"9589"	"I"	"guess"	" ``On the depth chart, I've gone from four to three, I guess,'' Rivers said smiling. ``I want to help the team, this team, I hope. I'm anxious to play games, to get over that part so I can just play basketball.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"
"9686"	"I"	"guess"	" ``James brought John in with the expectation he wouldn't make drastic changes,'' said one Details editor, who, like many others interviewed, did not want to be named out of consideration for Leland's feelings. ``It fell short, I guess, of where we were in terms of edginess.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"
"9759"	"I"	"guess"	" ``It's something I know has gone on in this city. It's particularly noteworthy that it goes on even with someone as well known and respected as David Dinkins, which shows you, I guess, some of the problem. It's something that I'd like to see the Taxi and Limousine Commission do a lot more to turn around.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"
"9907"	"I"	"guess"	" ``The earth was saying happy birthday to me, I guess,'' she joked. ``The guy next to us jumped out of his seat. He was shocked.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"
"10026"	"I"	"guess"	" Near the manor house on a recent afternoon, a farmer laughed when asked what he thought a future owner might do with it. ``Tear it down, I guess,'' he said. ``I can't imagine that anyone would actually buy it.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"
"10198"	"I"	"guess"	" My father and his buddy, a policeman who was quite into guns, hunted rabbits, squirrels, rattlesnakes and sometimes (sorry, Bambi) deer. We ate some of these things and shot the others, I guess, in self-defense. I marveled when the men slit the deer's belly and things of every imaginable shape came spilling out. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"
"10219"	"I"	"guess"	" ``Erbacon has always been put down, just because it's a poor community, I guess,'' said Jody Long, who commutes to a sawmill in another town. The 27-mile drive takes over an hour on the winding mountain roads. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"

"10425"	"I"	"guess"	" ``The other teams, I guess, would be the Rams, who may be moving to St. Louis, or Tampa Bay, and I don't see their ownership situation being resolved before February or March. There's a case to be made that Jimmy could be interested in Tampa for obvious reasons. They might feel in Tampa that having him signed as the coach would make the team more attractive to a buyer. Or they might go the other way, thinking that leaving it open would allow a buyer to bring in his own coach, as I did with Jimmy.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"
"10684"	"I"	"guess"	" ``I don't know,'' said Albert. ``Bus, I guess, but it's a long way and I think it'd cost a bunch of money.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"
"10854"	"I"	"guess"	" This Cowboys team has played a host of the latter. About 15, going on 16, when you get right down to it. When you've been at the top of the football world for two seasons, I guess, any game that doesn't directly have diamond rings or two billion worldwide TV viewers riding on it is deemed a meaningless tuneup. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"
"10863"	"I"	"guess"	" The method is efficient, I guess, but it turns the giver into an order-filler whose judgment and opinions are neither trusted nor desired and the child into one more loyal but bored U.S. consumer. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"

"11033"	"I"	"guess"	" ``They felt like JEW shouldn't be displayed, I guess,'' Allen said. Last year the request surfaced again, this time by James E. Williams. ``Nobody seemed to be worried about it,'' he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"

"11297"	"I"	"guess"	" ``I think he already has,'' Williams says. ``The first thing, I guess, was the attitude. Right away, morale shot up and stayed up. We started feeling good about ourselves again. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"
"11440"	"I"	"guess"	" ``It's the main reason I chose USC, I guess,'' he says. ``They had a famous tailback tradition -- and the idea of following in that tradition appealed to me. They call it `Tailback U.' and the guy who fills that job is someone special. But they had also called Lamar `Tailback High' when I was there, so I didn't figure it would be that different.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"

"11952"	"I"	"guess"	" ``I took, I guess, a large financial risk, but (Leustig and Wilson) really did the work,'' Costner said. ``They did the lion's share. It's like a lot of things. Sometimes I get too much credit, and sometimes I get too much blame.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"

"12195"	"I"	"guess"	" He has already publicly complained about Limbaugh's daily assaults on his presidency and implied that they are adding to the huge virus of cynicism injected into the vein of our body politic. The man is president of the United States. He can command network attention any time he wants; he can lob a missile down the Bosnian smokestack, tell us to spend less on new cars or stupid toys and spend more time saving money, talking and reading to our children but he doesn't because, I guess, he is virtually obsessed with his own future as well as the reality of Rush Limbaugh on the radio. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"
"12405"	"I"	"guess"	" ``Sort of like having your own stock company of players, I guess,'' Singleton said.

"16808"	"I"	"guess"	" For the truly gifted, the written score is only a reference book for periodic consultation. In pianists like Alicia de Larrocha (not to mention Art Tatum), there exists a seemingly unimpeded flow from mind to fingertip. An E-flat chord is heard in the head; one appears on the keyboard.

"17981"	"I"	"guess"	" WIC is scheduled to go out the window under the new Republican plan. Mothers who use it would no longer be able to purchase formula and cereal with aid from the federal government and would, I guess, have to look at a state bureaucracy for such help. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"

"19919"	"I"	"guess"	" He had the surgery, all right. But the truth is he hurt himself the year before, not in May of '89. ``I was taken out by Kevin Mitchell in '88, and I landed on it,'' he explained. ``I didn't say anything about it to anyone.

"19993"	"I"	"guess"	" Revelacious is a word with possibilities. Referencable is another. The other day I heard a woman say she believed something a witness said in the O.J.

"20210"	"I"	"guess"	" Although he got bumped from the cover of this week's Sports Illustrated by Joe Montana's retirement (``Joe deserves it, I guess,'') and had his last name badly mispronounced by Tagliabue, who announced that Philadelphia had picked ``Mike Mamew-la'' with the seventh pick, it couldn't have turned any better for Mamula. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"

"21288"	"I"	"guess"	" A long pause. ``I think that we're interpreters, aren't we? We interpret the lyrics for the writer to the audience. Because most of the writers, I guess, don't perform.

"23064"	"I"	"guess"	" Gibson, who appears this week on both ``Late Show With David Letterman'' and ``The Tonight Show,'' has been acting in movies since he was 20. He got into the profession by a kind of accident. An older sister sent in an application to drama school on his behalf. ``I was manic as a teenager,'' he says. ``Literally climbing the walls.

"25518"	"I"	"guess"	" When Frank was growing up in Tucson, the old Geronimo Hotel seemed like ``the last stop for a sad collection of pensioners and postwar alcoholics, sprinkled with a dash of indignant, feisty old men resentful at finding their last years spent in such a fleabag.'' He moved in himself in 1974 and found that the hotel ``also functioned as Junkies Inc.'' Frank tells of his heroin addiction among his pals at the Geronimo and of his rehabilitation. It's disturbing, but at moments sadly romantic. As Frank writes, ``How I was able to wring anything nice out of the Geronimo existence is, I guess, the basis of this tale.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

If anybody can tell me they're scared of New Jersey _ even though they won the Cup _ I can't believe it. They're good, but they don't scare you.

Negative thinker? Disorganized?  If so, you too may have what it takes to be highly ineffective.  Since its publication, Stephen R. Covey's ``The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1989) has been among the best-selling books on the market.  People like reading about success, I guess, but it seems to me that more people can identify with failure. For the masses, then, here are ``The 7 Habits of Highly Ineffective People.'' -0- 1. POOR LISTENING  A cornerstone of true ineffectiveness is poor listening.  Church is a bastion of poor listening. Why listen to remedies for your soul when you can daydream about catching a large trout? God Himself could be delivering the guest sermon, and half the congregation would be thinking about Egg McMuffins.  As M. Scott Peck says, listening is very hard work _ though nowhere near as hard as jackhammering. Many people feign interest, so it's not always easy to know if they're actually listening. It's a bad sign if they're humming show tunes. 2. NEGATIVE THINKING  All highly ineffective people share this trait. Not only do they see the glass as half-empty, they see it as one more thing to wash.  Not to be negative, but negativity can be a very negative thing. Especially interminable negativity which lasts a negative eon.  There are, of course, plenty of perfectly good reasons to be negative: pestilence, famine, supermarket tomatoes.  And who among us isn't daunted by the Big Questions: Where did we come from? Why are we here? And, if there is an afterlife, do they validate parking?  Negative people go through life saying, ``I'm not good enough,'' ``I can't do it'' and, inexplicably, ``The rain in Spain stays mainly on the plain.'' Fortunately, they rarely say these things aloud. 3. DISORGANIZATION  Effective people are organized. They have their ducks in a row.  Unfortunately, I have mine in a column, but let's not get bogged down in waterfowl issues. The point is ... well, I'm not sure what the point is. I had it here in my notes somewhere, but now I can't seem to _ ah, yes, here it is.  The point is, not all organization is good. If all organization were good, we wouldn't have organized crime. Al Capone was organized. Mussolini was organized.  Ants are extremely organized, but they have yet to win a seat in the House of Representatives. They don't even hold much sway in the animal kingdom, though in all fairness it's hard to hold sway when you're holding dead moth parts.  To be sure, a fool and his attempts at organization are soon parted. For example, the best-laid plans do you no good if you place them in your briefcase and then drive off with your briefcase on top of your car.  Sure, disorganization can cause your effectiveness to take a swan dive, but there we go getting bogged down in waterfowl issues again. 4. INAPPROPRIATENESS  There's a time and place for everything, which is why it's always good to carry a watch and a map.  Failures of time-and-place judgment result in all sorts of inappropriate behavior. For example, it's okay to yell ``Fire!'' after ``Ready ... aim ... '' but it's inappropriate to yell it in a crowded theater.  It is also inappropriate to yell ``Avocado!'' in a crowded theater _ not because it would cause a panic, but because it's inappropriate to yell ``Avocado!'' anywhere except at produce auctions.  It is inappropriate to rise for the seventh-inning stretch singing ``Take Me Out to the Ball Game'' when it's the bottom of the fifth and the ball is in play.  Or to hum that catchy little ``Jeopardy'' tune when your dinner date is taking too long with the menu. Or to wear a bunny suit to a funeral, especially if it's your funeral.  Naturally, effective people never commit these honest but harmful gaffes. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas would never have survived his Senate confirmation hearing had there been even the slightest suggestion he had ever yelled ``Avocado!'' in a crowded theater. 5. DECISIONS BY DEFAULT  In my college days, which lasted two terms _ Johnson's and Nixon's _ I was determined to squander the experience by spending a bare minimum of time on campus.  Thus, I made my course selections not according to academic curiosity, degree requirements, professional goals or any other sane criteria. No, I made my choices strictly for convenience, enrolling only in classes that met during banked hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  It was the ``Big Bang'' approach to higher education: Each semester, my class schedule was a hodgepodge that appeared to have resulted from an explosion in the registrar's office. At 9 a.m., ``Intermediate Farsi.'' At 10:30 a.m., ``Abnormal Ornithology.'' At 1 p.m., ``Schopenhauer: Genius or Stand-Up Comic.''  Eventually, university officials decided that my accumulated credits bore a slight resemblance to a political science degree, a conclusion derived largely from the discovery that I had taken several classes ``in or near the political science building.''  It's easy enough to get a degree by default, but to live a whole life that way requires sheer, determined acquiescence _ that is, a willingness to make important decisions by not making them.  Thank God so many people exist by this simple code, allowing inertia to determine where they live, who they live with and even what they do for a living. If the average apple fell farther from the tree, no man would follow his father into sewage treatment or embalming, and then where would we be? 6. RANDOMIZATION  This habit is the opposite of systematization. Quite simply, it is the pursuit of tasks in random order instead of logical sequence.  We all know someone at work who operates this way _ usually the head of planning. Reaping before sowing, leaping before looking, dressing before showering _ these are illogical, inefficient ways to go through life.  In southern California, where I live, we prepare for earthquakes after they strike. This approach has proven highly ineffective, but by now it's tradition and, if I'm not mistaken, required by state law.  Apparently, putting the cart before the horse is normal human behavior, even though carts are getting hard to find these days. The consequences may be greatest where interpersonal relationships are concerned, which is why the divorce rate runs higher than voter turnout. 7. PROCRASTINATION  Interestingly, the beginning and ending of ``procrastination'' are ``pro'' and ``nation.' Someone who is ``pro-nation'' is called a patriot, and every four years can be found at the Olympic wrestling venue waving a flag the size of a fumigation tent.  How, you might ask, does all this relate to the habit we call procrastination? Well, it doesn't, really, but this little linguistic digression has enabled me to put off writing anything meaningful about procrastination, a task I've been dreading.  And that's the true spirit of procrastination, isn't it _ avoiding what we don't want to do? Of course, 90 percent of life is ``what we don't want to do,'' which is why we so diligently devote ourselves to the other 10 percent.  But there's a blessing in all this. Putting off changing the oil in your car, for example, leads to costly repairs, which triggers self-loathing, which results in erratic behavior, marital discord, counseling, divorce-lawyer fees and so forth. A lot of money changes hands, which stimulates the economy, which results in a higher gross national product.  So if you put off changing your motor oil, take heart: You're not just a procrastinator, you're a patriot.

And most couples are.  As a researcher, however, I've seen a disturbing trend: A substantial number of married couples _ up to 10 to 15 percent _ have sex only a few times a year, or not at all.  How does this happen? When most couples get married, they are highly romantic, and their desire and attraction for each other are intense. But in some marriages the passion quickly fades; sex may prove unsatisfying _ even physically painful _ and the couples abandon it, although they may preserve the more fulfilling parts of the relationship.  Other sexless couples lose the urge over time, often as the result of conflicts over child care or work being played out in the bedroom. But whatever the reason, most experts agree that when a couple no longer makes love, the marriage is headed for trouble.  THE BIGGEST SEXUAL TURNOFFS: ANGER AND VENGEANCE  It's not easy to guess which couples aren't having sex. Charlotte (names have been changed to protect privacy), a great-looking woman in her mid-30s, hardly seems a likely candidate for the problem.  A former college beauty queen and part-time model, she's been married for the past 11 years to Jim, a dashing politician. When you see them together, you'd assume they have a pretty wonderful sex life.  In fact, Jim and Charlotte haven't had sex for almost a year and a half, and their physical relationship in the preceding two years was minimal at best.  ``We were very passionate back when we were courting,'' Charlotte remembers.  What happened? The reason Charlotte no longer wants to have sex with Jim is that her almost constant anger with him has blocked her feelings of arousal.  ``As it became clear that he wanted me only when it was convenient, I got more and more turned off. He'd reach over to me almost as an afterthought and want sex _ not lovemaking.  Jim is furious with Charlotte for denying him the emotional and physical relief he craves. He doesn't have affairs, but he openly threatens that he might if Charlotte doesn't ``get her act together.''  Still, Jim doubts that they'll ever divorce.  ``I'm not going to leave my kids,'' he insists. ``Besides, Charlotte is a great mother and a wonderful political wife. We really do very well with one another except when we're alone in the bedroom.''  Jim and Charlotte know they have problems, and they've gone to a marriage counselor a few times. It hasn't helped. Jim felt that the sessions resulted in ``Jim bashing'' and, after trying a couple of different therapists, they've given up.  Sadly, this is the most common pattern of sexless marriages _ a relationship where there's a lot of anger and two people who simply don't know how to change their behavior.  WHEN THERE'S LOVE (BUT NOT DESIRE)  Some women with minimal sexual experience get involved with a man without realizing that good chemistry is missing.  Others are seduced by the excitement of knowing someone is attracted to them _ and overlook the fact that what they feel in response is tepid. Later these women can become so turned off by sex with their husband that the best they can do to preserve the marriage is avoid having sex altogether.  That's the case with Juanita, 30, a vibrant beauty who is alternately depressed by her eight-year marriage to Christopher and accepting of it.  When they met in college, he was courtly, polite and absolutely smitten with her. The first man in her life not to pressure her for sex right away, he treated her with respect and made sure her needs and ambitions were given the same serious consideration as his own.  They didn't have sex before their wedding night, but Juanita wasn't a virgin _ her only other lover had broken her heart by having an affair. So Juanita was especially happy to find a man like Christopher, someone who wanted sex between them to be special and sacred.  The first signs of trouble for the couple surfaced on their honeymoon. Christopher had difficulty getting an erection; he also experienced premature ejaculation. Juanita was philosophical at the time. She figured it was just a bad case of first-night jitters.  But things didn't get better. After seeing a marriage counselor and a sex therapist, Christopher went to a medical doctor to see if there was a physical reason for his problems. When the tests indicated there wasn't, Christopher and Juanita gave up hope.  Over time their physical relationship did improve enough for Juanita to get pregnant. But sex in general has remained an unpleasant experience. And after their daughter was born, their sex life dwindled away.  Though not satisfied with the situation, Juanita is resigned to it:  ``I feel that I'm too young to not have sex, but then I'm lucky to have such a fine man, so it's a compromise. I suppose life itself is a compromise.''  I JUST CAN'T STAND THE WAY HE TOUCHES ME  Linda, a flight attendant in her mid-30s, faces a different challenge in her marriage _ she so hates the way her husband, John, makes love that three years ago she said never again.  The problem: John is an insensitive lover.  ``I used to get all black and blue,'' Linda says. ``I'd tell him he had to be gentler, but he never changed. In time, I flinched at his touch _ I was always being manhandled.''  In other ways Linda is satisfied with her marriage. John makes a good living as an attorney and is a caring father. Despite his admirable qualities, though, he's become totally unappealing to her. Unfortunately, though, while time, familiarity and therapy can improve a couple's sex life, basic physical repulsion is difficult to overcome.  As might be expected, Linda's lack of desire for her husband has resulted in arguments and coolness in the relationship. But while Linda has no desire for John, the feeling isn't mutual.  ``I just can't help it. If he went elsewhere for sex, I would really understand, although I pray he doesn't break up the family, because we both really believe in that.''  NOT INTERESTED, THANKS  Of course, there are rare situations when both husband and wife agree that sex is no longer important to them. While more typical among older couples, this can happen to people in their 30s and 40s as well.  Trudy, a computer-industry production worker, and her husband, Bruce, a letter carrier, both of whom are 40, never had much of a sex life, even in the beginning of their 18-year marriage.  Though they made love once or twice a week in their first year as newlyweds, ``I never felt the earth move,'' Trudy admits.  Over the next couple of years sex decreased to perhaps once a month, then more irregularly until they realized at last that they weren't making love at all anymore.  ``At first we were worried,'' Trudy says. ``We went to a marriage counselor, who gave us some exercises that made us feel ridiculous.  I know this isn't politically correct to say, but I think society has made a big deal out of sex, and there are a lot of people afraid to admit it. In fact, if people were honest, many would say they can get by just fine without it.''  THE BOTTOM LINE: CAN SEXLESS MARRIAGES SURVIVE?  Obviously some couples, like Trudy and Bruce, make peace with little or no sex. Generally, however, abstinence takes a high toll on a relationship. The partners become angry and start to think about having affairs or getting divorced.  This is especially true for husbands; little or no sex bothers men much more than women.  In a study I conducted of more than 5,000 American couples, more women than men said they were satisfied with their marriage even when sex had disappeared entirely from the relationship. Men, on the other hand, were much more likely to say they were dissatisfied when sex was disappointing or absent.  Is there hope for couples who aren't having sex? Most will need some kind of therapist or counselor to help rid the marriage of the underlying emotional or relationship issues that are causing their problems. There may even be a sexual dysfunction that needs medical attention.  One thing is certain: Ignoring the situation won't make it go away.  Masters and Johnson, the noted sex therapists, say couples must either ``use it or lose it,'' and they're right. If women don't make love for long periods of time, it becomes harder for them to have an orgasm or to feel uninhibited. Men who abstain from sex often develop arousal problems and other performance anxieties.  The good news is that sex can resume in a marriage. Even women who have avoided it are amazed at the stirrings within them once love and trust are reestablished.

Includes a color slide of Warren Beatty and Annette Bening in a scene from ``Love Affair.'' World rights except Chicago. By CINDY PEARLMAN Distributed by New York Times Special Features  Kevin Bacon was on the set of the 1987 PBS movie ``Lemon Sky'' when it happened. He saw this beautiful actress with a tangle of blonde curly hair _ and fell head over heels in love.  ``I kept reminding myself, `Kevin, this is not a good idea. Kevin, stop it,''' he recalls.  But he couldn't stop. He thought about this woman day and night.  ``We had a kissing scene and I was in heaven,'' he says. ``Sometimes it's movie kissing. This was kissing kissing.''  Bacon knew, of course, that relationships that begin on movie sets are usually doomed. But that didn't stop him from asking his lovely co-star, Kyra Sedgwick, for a few dates while they were shooting. What was the harm?  When the dates led to a romantic relationship, Bacon figured it would be over soon.  ``Falling in love on a movie set is like summer camp,'' Bacon explains. ``The rule is that you have to remind yourself that in eight weeks it will be over. It's not real life. There probably won't be a happy ending.''  Famous last words. Bacon and Sedgwick's love affair eventually led them to the altar. They now have two kids and couldn't be happier.  And they aren't the only celebrity couples whose relationships began after they met on the set. Here's a look at some of the other famous lovebirds who will be celebrating Valentine's Day together this year:  THE COUPLE: Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid  THE SET: ``Innerspace'' (1987)  LOVE NOTES: When Meg met Dennis ... it was true terror, she says.  ``I was just beginning my career and thought, `This is very bad. I can't fall in love.'  ``Yet I couldn't stop staring at him. I kept thinking to myself, `He is beautiful. Look how nice he looks in that shirt!'''  The two later married and went on to co-star in 1993's ``Flesh and Bone.''  THE COUPLE: Lauren Holly and Jim Carrey  THE SET: ``Dumb and Dumber'' (1994)  LOVE NOTES: Holly believes she was fated to get together with the man whose face seems to made of Silly Putty.  ``We met when I auditioned for the first `Ace Ventura,''' she says, referring to Carrey's 1994 hit film. ``It's so bizarre. I was in the middle of breaking up with someone and I met Jim during the audition and I thought, `Who is this guy?'  ``I didn't watch (Carrey's TV series) `In Living Color.' I remember thinking to myself, `Wow, he's tall and he's cute.'''  She didn't get the part, but a year later she was cast as Carrey's co-star in ``Dumb and Dumber.''  ``It seems fated that we did `Dumb and Dumber' together and fell in love,'' Holly says. ``Our first date was on the set. I remember we went to a restaurant in Utah and there were peacocks and things wandering around the property. It was very romantic and beautiful until Jim started doing peacock faces.''  THE COUPLE: Warren Beatty and Annette Bening  THE SET: ``Bugsy'' (1991)  LOVE NOTES: Beatty, a confirmed bachelor, wasn't looking to get hitched. Then something unexpected happened.  ``I remember that we needed to cast a very strong actress but weren't happy with anyone we saw,'' Beatty recalls. ``I heard of this Annette Bening and saw a couple of her films. Now this was an actress!  ``So we decided to do something very low-key and go out for a quick pizza dinner to discuss the project. I knew within five minutes that this was a very special woman. She just radiated joy.''  The two fell in love while making that film and later married. They now have two children and, in 1994, they co-starred in the appropriately named ``Love Affair.''  THE COUPLE: Timothy Hutton and Uma Thurman  THE SET: ``Beautiful Girls,'' which is scheduled to be released nationwide Feb. 16  LOVE NOTES: Hutton, who is divorced from actress Debra Winger, says he doesn't believe in love at first sight.  ``I believe in an incredible connection at first sight. Love is something that happens over a period of time.''  He spent a period of time with Thurman on the very cold Minnesota set of ``Beautiful Girls.'' In one scene, in an ice-fishing shack, Hutton's character tries to pick up Thurman's.  ``Our dating does change the irony of that scene now,'' he says. ``Believe me, we really didn't know each other when we shot that scene.''  But he had always wanted to meet her.  ``When I heard they wanted Uma to do this movie, I was so hoping that would happen because I always really liked her as an actress,'' he explains. ``There's just something about her that makes you realize she's smart, interesting and beautiful.  ``When she arrived on the set I said to myself, `This is just great!'''  THE COUPLE: Hugh Grant and Elizabeth Hurley  THE SET: ``Rowing With the Wind,'' a 1986 British film  LOVE NOTES: Grant vividly recalls his first thoughts when he met the now-famous supermodel.  ``I thought that she was acting very ratty to me on the set,'' he says. ``I was acting very ratty to her. We were both being disagreeable, so it must have been true love.''  No wedding yet but no funeral for the relationship _ even after Grant's summer escapade on Los Angeles' Sunset Boulevard. Word is that Grant and Hurley are about to start work on a movie together.  THE COUPLE: John Travolta and Kelly Preston  THE SET: ``The Experts'' (1989)  LOVE NOTES: ``She was married to someone else at the time we met on this set,'' Travolta says. ``So you kind of resist love at first sight when you know these things. What I admired is that she loved being married.  ``After the initial crush, I would say the relationship was an evolution. A few years later, in 1991, I found myself proposing in Switzerland at midnight. It was almost like a movie.''  THE COUPLE: Kate Capshaw and Steven Spielberg  THE SET: ``Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' (1984)  LOVE NOTES: Capshaw had to phone home about this one. She called all her girlfriends to tell them about this dream of a director she had met during an audition.  ``It was like I knew. I just knew,'' Capshaw says with a sigh. ``I remember meeting Steven and thinking, `This is it.' Then, of course, he got married to someone else, which just killed me. But it all worked out in the end.  ``I remember from the first day on that set thinking, `He is so wonderful. I hope this movie never ends.'''  THE COUPLE: Melanie Griffith and Antonio Banderas  THE SET: ``Two Much,'' which is scheduled to be released in March  LOVE NOTES: Banderas plays a man who pretends to be his own twin in order to romance two sisters. In real life, he fell in love with only one woman: Griffith.  ``I cannot probably even describe this love,'' he says. ``Who can describe love? It's like describing life. I just knew there was something inside me that was stronger than myself. You just can't stop it.''  THE COUPLE: Gwyneth Paltrow and Brad Pitt  THE SET: ``Seven'' (1995)  LOVE NOTES: ``It was such a dark movie and Gwyn was like this ray of sunshine,'' Pitt says. ``She's so very special.''  While accepting his Golden Globe award this year, Pitt thanked ``his angel,'' referring to Paltrow as the love of his life.  THE COUPLE: Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman  THE SET: ``Days of Thunder'' (1990)  LOVE NOTES: He played a race-car driver. She was his doctor. The diagnosis: L-O-V-E.  Cruise laughs as he recalls, ``Dustin Hoffman called me after I started dating Nicole and said, `She is beautiful. She's talented. What is she doing with you?'''  Now his wife, Kidman has taught Cruise ``so many things,'' he says.  ``She really is a best friend. She taught me to literally go out and smell the flowers. Nic enjoys gardening and tells me to get out there and start picking weeds. Sometimes I can't believe this woman left her family in Australia to be with me.''  THE COUPLE: Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson  THE SET: ``Volunteers'' (1985)  LOVE NOTES: ``I was this wisenheimer guy and she was this wisenheimer girl,'' Hanks says. ``We went out and had fun together. At first it was just friends and then I had to say, `Whoa! This is better than friends.'''  The two, now married, recently celebrated the birth of their second child.  THE COUPLE: Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin  THE SET: ``The Marrying Man'' (1991)  LOVE NOTES: So what if tabloids reported that they were prima donnas on the set? So what if the movie flopped? Basinger knew their romance was a big hit.  ``It's amazing that we got together, since Alec is such a people person,'' she says. ``He likes to go out and do lunch and be in a crowd. I like to hide in my house. I'm so shy.  ``But he gave me the courage to explore my fears. It was so liberating and exhilarating.''  The husband-and-wife actors, who also co-starred in ``The Getaway'' (1994), are new parents of a baby girl. -0- SIDEBAR: RELATIONSHIPS THAT FADED TO BLACK  Some couples meet on the set, act out real-life love scenes and then yell, ``Cut!''  These twosomes decided to let their on-set relationships fade to black:  THE COUPLE: Kelly LeBrock and Steven Seagal.  THE SCRIPT: They met on the set of 1990's ``Hard to Kill,'' got married and later divorced.  THE COUPLE: Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder.  THE SCRIPT: They met on the set of 1990's ``Edward Scissorhands,'' began a romance and broke up about two years later.  THE COUPLE: Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis.  THE SCRIPT: They met on the set of 1993's ``Kalifornia,'' became lovers and then broke up about a year later.

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Amanda Donohoe in a scene from ``The Thorn Birds: The Missing Years.'' By JEANNE WOLF Distributed by New York Times Special Features  Provocative. Outspoken. Feisty. Independent.  Those are just a few of the labels that have been attached to actress Amanda Donohoe.  Never one to shy away from controversy or challenge, she clinched her reputation as a maverick when she began portraying one of prime-time television's first bisexual characters: attorney C.J. Lamb on ``L.A. Law.'' Donohoe caused a national sensation when she planted a kiss on the lips of co-star Michele Greene in one memorable episode.  Now Donohoe is attracting attention again, stepping where other actresses might fear to tread. For the new NBC miniseries ``The Thorn Birds: The Missing Years'' (airing Feb. 11 and 13), Donohoe has taken over the role that made Rachel Ward a household name. She stars as Meggie O'Neal, the woman who fell in love with a priest (played by Richard Chamberlain) in 1983's ``The Thorn Birds.''  While Chamberlain is reprising his portrayal of the conflicted Father Ralph de Bricassart in the four-hour sequel, Ward turned down the offer to step back into the role of his lover. That opened the door for Donohoe, who jumped at the chance to offer viewers her own version of Meggie.  ``I don't know if viewers will be critical of me or not, but I hope they'll at least be curious enough to tune in,'' Donohoe says during an interview in a suite at a Pasadena, Calif., hotel. ```The Thorn Birds' is such a wonderful classic love story, like a `Romeo and Juliet,' that I don't think it makes a difference who plays the main characters. It's the story that's important.''  Interestingly, Donohoe has never seen the original production, which was watched by millions worldwide in the '80s.  ``I didn't watch `The Thorn Birds,' even though it was a huge success in England, where I was living,'' she says. ``In fact, there was a commercial break right after the scene where Father Ralph and Meg make love, and I remember that all over the U.K. there was a huge power surge as people got up from their TV sets and rushed to plug in their electric kettles to make a cup of tea.''  After snaring the role of Meggie, Donohoe purposely avoided watching Ward's performance.  ``You always feel insecure when you take on a new role,'' she says. ``I think to give yourself more insecurity by watching how somebody else played the part would be suicidal.''  One thing that helped Donohoe's performance was the support of Chamberlain.  ``He never once made me feel like I was stepping into someone else's shoes,'' she says. ``Richard is such a sweetie and he has a wonderful sense of humor.''  Both stars needed a sense of humor for the sequences in which Father Ralph and Meggie reignite their passion after a crisis brings him back to her home in the Australian outback.  ``When it came to our love scene,'' Donohoe recalls with a grin, ``we said, `OK, we'll give you the beginning, the middle and the end. You know, a little foreplay, intercourse and then orgasm. ... We just sort of did it in three acts and it was very funny. The hard part was trying to keep a straight face.''  Filming love scenes is always a bit difficult, Donohoe says.  ``Even if you find the guy you're doing it with attractive, it doesn't help. In fact, sometimes it makes it worse. You're simulating sex with a virtual stranger and you can either get embarrassed or you can laugh. I choose to laugh, but sometimes I'm thinking, `What a way to make a living!'''  She may have thought that more than once during her career, which has featured a string of unconventional roles. In one of her earliest films, Nicolas Roeg's ``Castaway'' (1987), she played a woman who answers an ad to spend a year on a desert island with a chauvinistic adventurer. She spent most of her onscreen time naked.  Then, in 1988, she got worldwide attention as the vampirish Lady Sylvia Marsh in Ken Russell's outrageous horror-comedy ``The Lair of the White Worm.''  But it was ``L.A. Law'' that made Donohoe famous.  ``More people saw me play C.J. on television than all the characters I'd played in films,'' she says. ``I certainly hadn't realized the power of prime time. We had an enormous audience.''  And while the viewers in that audience were sometimes shocked by C.J.'s bisexual antics, they enjoyed watching her each week.  ``In spite of her sexual ambiguity, people seemed to love her,'' she says. ``She was funny, accessible and interesting. People used to come up to me and say that C.J. was the sort of person they'd like to have for a best friend. Nobody had ever said that about any other character I'd played.''  For Donohoe, the road to American TV stardom began in her bedroom in the middle-class suburban London home in which she grew up.  ``My imagination was my escape and my survival,'' she says. ``I used to create `Dynasty' and `Dallas' with my dolls. I wasn't an avid reader, but I had a very vivid life in my imagination that was stimulated mostly by movies and television.''  At one point, she wanted to be Vivien Leigh.  ``I watched `Gone With the Wind' about 150 times,'' she says with a smile. ``A lot of the movies that were on TV when I was a kid were from the '30s, '40s and '50s. Women were very strong characters in a lot of those films. I think I grew up with a very strong sense of my femaleness because of those films.''  That strong sense of self helped when she decided to quit school at 16 to study acting. Over the next few years she had a romantic relationship with rock star Adam Ant and became active in anti-establishment causes.  Even when she began to succeed in films, Donohoe maintained her reputation for speaking out forthrightly on subjects ranging from nuclear disarmament to better roles for women in Hollywood.  Donohoe enjoys being independent, even though she feels that trait has contributed to the fact that, at 33, she is single.  ``I've always been very driven, very ambitious,'' she says. ``I think it can be very intimidating when a woman really knows her mind and understands her sexuality. That can be very threatening to men who'd rather have you shut up and go back to the kitchen sink. Men in general are intimidated by strong women and that's unfortunate.''  Though Donohoe is occasionally lonely, she's also ambivalent about the idea of spending the rest of her life with one man.  ``I think I've had a terror of being trapped in a marriage _ with children _ that I didn't want to be in,'' she says. ``There's that fear of making a mistake. I've seen so many divorces and so many dysfunctional families.''  As a single woman, Donohoe is able to commute easily between homes in Santa Monica and London and to work as much as she wants to. Most recently she received respectable reviews for her juicy turn as the crafty lady-in-waiting in the critically acclaimed ``The Madness of King George'' and starred in a sequel to ``Shame'' for the USA cable network, playing a maverick biker/lawyer.  Donohoe admits, however, that she may be mellowing a bit.  ``I surprised myself at some of the things I've done in my career,'' she says. ``I don't think I'm as brave as I used to be. I don't need to stand up on that soapbox and shout about things so much. I don't need to break down the walls anymore, and I've done that in my career.  ``I'm getting happier and happier,'' she continues reflectfully after a long pause. ``It has nothing to do with my work. It has a lot to do with my own process of self-discovery.  ``I said, `Why am I having such awful relationships? Why am I behaving so badly?' It was a rather long and agonizing process, but I think I'm well on the road. It's all a process of discovery.'' c.1996 Jeanne Wolf  (Jeanne Wolf, who is based in Hollywood, reports on the entertainment industry for television, radio and print outlets.)

I saw him on a highlight film catching a ball one-handed. But just because Fenway Park has the wall, it doesn't mean a guy is going to hit a bunch of home runs. Canseco made the comment, I guess, last year that he was going to hit 70 home runs or something. It's not a given. They might go there and pitch him away all the time and he won't hit any.

(a)  MORIAL-QNA _ undated _ At 38, New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial is one of the youngest leaders of a major American city.

Bill Hensley, my public relations friend, had this brainstorm about getting together a collection of old North Carolina comrades of various ages and past connections, guys who don't see a lot of each other any more, for a little golf, some beer and barbecue. So we gathered on the shore of Badin Lake, which used to be the largest mudhole I'd ever seen when I was growing up about 12 miles away.

Bill Hensley, my public relations friend, had this brainstorm about getting together a collection of old North Carolina comrades of various ages and past connections, guys who don't see a lot of each other any more, for a little golf, some beer and barbecue. So we gathered on the shore of Badin Lake, which used to be the largest mudhole I'd ever seen when I was growing up about 12 miles away. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"

From Let's Live magazine By KATHY SENA c.1995 Kathy Sena (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  When Monica Lewis found out she was pregnant with her first child, she planned to eat only well-balanced meals and snack on plenty of fruits and vegetables, she recalls.  But, thanks to a three-month bout of morning sickness, it wasn't that easy.  ``As it turned out, I could eat macaroni and cheese and applesauce and that was about it for my first trimester,'' says Lewis, now the mother of a healthy 3-year-old daughter.  When you're pregnant, eating right can sometimes be a challenge. Of course, you want to do what's best for your baby and yourself. You've already heard about what you shouldn't consume during the nine months of pregnancy: caffeine, alcohol and cigarettes.  But, what should you put into your body during this crucial time? Which vitamins and minerals does your developing baby need? Can certain foods or herbs ease some of the uncomfortable side effects of pregnancy? And what can you do to ease morning sickness _ which affects more than half of all pregnant women? VITAMINS ARE IMPORTANT  Taking specific prenatal vitamins and minerals can not only make a difference in the health of an unborn baby, it can also help ease some of the most common discomforts of pregnancy.  Here are some important prenatal vitamins and minerals:  _ Folic acid:  Doctors agree that folic acid (a B vitamin) is one of the most important vitamins a mother-to-be can take.  Since 1992, the U.S. Public Health Service has recommended that all fertile women should consume 0.4 milligrams of folic acid per day from foods such as legumes and dark, leafy green vegetables or supplements.  Folic acid helps ward off neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, in the developing fetus. In 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that folic acid could probably prevent half of the 2,500 cases of neural tube defects that occur each year in the United States.  _ Vitamin B6:  ``It has been shown that taking a vitamin B6 supplement is effective in reducing severe morning sickness in pregnancy,'' says M. Sara Rosenthal, author of ``The Pregnancy Sourcebook'' (Lowell House, 1994).  Unfortunately, Rosenthal notes, the vitamin doesn't seem to have any effect on mild-to-moderate nausea.  _ Vitamin D:  This vitamin helps to ensure proper absorption and uses of calcium and phosphorus in the diet, says William H. Lee, a registered pharmacist and author of the handbook, ``How Do I Know If I Need Vitamins, and If I Do Which One?'' (Lee Press, 1991).  _ Iron:  This mineral is essential for prevention of anemia in both mother and baby during pregnancy, experts say.  _ Vitamin B complex, calcium and magnesium:  Feeling a little stressed? These vitamins and minerals can help normalize the emotional ups and downs that often occur during pregnancy, Lee says.  It's important to note that too much of certain vitamins can be harmful to the developing fetus. Women should always consult their doctors to determine the correct vitamin dosage. WHAT CAN HERBS DO TO EASE PREGNANCY DISCOMFORT?  According to Jeanne Rose, author of ``Herbs and Aromatherapy for the Reproductive System'' (Frog Ltd., 1994), the following herbal teas can provide helpful benefits during pregnancy.  _ Raspberry leaf contains fragarine (a uterine tonic/relaxant) and is a standard herb used as a tea throughout pregnancy and lactation.  _ Basil, catnip, chamomile, peppermint and raspberry leaf teas are considered to be antispasmodic and can help alleviate morning sickness.  _ Basil, lavender and nutmeg teas are recommended by midwives at birthing time.  _ Alfalfa, comfrey leaf, fennel seed and nettle tops herb teas can encourage milk production.  There are other prenatal uses for herbs besides tea, according to Rose. For instance, aromatherapy can be soothing during both pregnancy and labor, she says.  _ Chamomile and lavender essential oils, inhaled via a diffuser or simply from a handkerchief, will often bring relief from nausea.  Note that the handkerchief must be kept in a plastic bag so the essential oils won't evaporate.  _ Basil and lavender oils may be inhaled for stimulation and relaxation, respectively, during labor.  Rose notes that certain herbs should be avoided or used with caution during pregnancy.  ``Some herbs have strong medicinal qualities that may harm the developing fetus,'' she warns. Women are best advised to talk with their doctors about which herbs are right for them. WHAT TO DO FOR MORNING-NOON-AND-NIGHT SICKNESS  Morning sickness puts 50,000 women a year in the hospital and affects more than half of all pregnant women, according to Miriam Erick. Erick is a boston-based, nationally recognized expert on morning sickness and co-writer (with Liz Weiss) of the video, ``Morning Sickness All Day &AMP; All Night _ A 24-Hour Survival Guide for Pregnant Women and Their Families'' (Lemon-Aid Films Inc., 1994).  Morning sickness doesn't just happen in the morning, Erick says. If it becomes severe, the nausea resulting from morning sickness can cause a woman to vomit up to 15 times a day. In turn, this can disrupt her metabolism, deplete her of fluids and make her anemic. Some women have even broken ribs or ruptured blood vessels by dry heaving.  However, there are ways to reduce morning sickness:  _ Know the facts.  Many pregnant women are told that morning sickness is all in their heads, but many experts believe it is caused by an increase in hormones, especially estrogen. Morning sickness can actually be a good sign that these hormones are protecting the developing fetus, Erick says.  However, if women don't experience morning sickness, there's no need to worry, she notes.  _ Think snacks, not meals.  ``Small feedings of soup _ such as a shotglass of soup at a time _ with bread every 15 minutes will usually work,'' says Mark Decker, an obstetrician in private practice in West Bend, Wis.  _ Avoid unpleasant odors.  ``I call it the `radar nose of pregnancy,''' Erick laughs, describing the enhanced sense of smell many pregnant women notice.  Almost any normal smell can suddenly trigger nausea in a woman who's suffering from morning sickness. Even a formerly favorite smell, such as fresh-brewed coffee, can cause nausea.  The fresh, natural smell of lemon helps many women overcome the symptoms of morning sickness, Erick reports. Simply cutting a lemon in half and breathing in the scent can often immediately relieve nausea.  _ Try liquid-filled foods.  ``We all need 2 quarts of fluids every day,'' Erick says. But, if the idea of drinking that much liquid is more than most women can stand, they should look for foods that contain water, such as apples, celery sticks, pears and watermelon.  _ Eat what sounds good.  While women certainly want to maintain a healthy diet during pregnancy, if they're battling an especially tough case of morning sickness, ``this is the time to think about what sounds good,'' Erick says.  ``Eat what you want at the moment, even if it's lemonade or spicy chicken.''  This unconventional approach struck Erick when she asked her patients to describe what appealed to them when they were feeling nauseous. She found the responses varied widely, including spicy, crunchy, bitter, hot and fruity foods.  _ Don't worry about cravings.  During this time it's not uncommon for women to crave foods they never liked before they were pregnant.  ``The most important thing is to take in fluids and calories,'' Erick says.  _ Wake up slowly.  If possible, women should try to rearrange their work days so they don't have to rush in the morning, Weiss suggests. The jolt of a loud alarm clock can be enough to cause nausea while pregnant.  Also, getting plenty of rest can help lessen the effects of morning sickness.  _ Don't be surprised if morning sickness lasts beyond three months.  Morning sickness that lasts for 17 weeks is about average.  ``Twenty percent (of pregnant women) have morning sickness for nine months,'' Erick says.  The most important thing for women to do is work together with their doctors, she emphasizes.  ``If you consume no food or drink for 24 hours; or, if the volume of your urine is greatly reduced, see your doctor.''  Women may need to receive intravenous fluids to avoid further dehydration. Some obstetricians treat dehydration due to morning sickness by administering intravenous solutions in the office, according to Decker.

From Child magazine By MARTHA RADDATZ c.1996 Martha Raddatz (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  After the Olympic Games in Atlanta, the dream of a gold medal permeated kids' minds. But is it a goal to which they should aspire? That depends on whether the desire is athletic fulfillment or athletic fame.  According to Mary Kirk, associate professor of physical education at Northern Kentucky University in Highland Heights and author of a recent study on organized sports, many parents and coaches ``are pushing their kids too early and too far,'' increasing both the physical and psychological risks.  Once the pressure is removed, however, the benefits can be vast. Research has long shown that boys develop important skills from competitive sports, including an ability to work with a team, to perform under pressure, to set goals and to accept criticism.  The news is even more encouraging for girls. A study by the Women's Sports Foundation in East Meadow, N.Y., revealed that girls involved in sports are less likely to use drugs or get pregnant and more likely to graduate from high school. MODERN CONCERNS  After a decade of couch-potato habits and alarming rates of childhood obesity, it's refreshing to hear that more kids are participating in organized recreational or competitive sports _ more than 20 million, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in Chicago.  ``Organized sports have grown tremendously,'' confirms Sally S. Harris, a pediatrician with the Palo Alto Medical Clinic in California and chairwoman of the AAP section on sports medicine.  ``It's become more difficult for kids to participate in informal activities because of the structured way families live nowadays, so signing them up for leagues and lessons has taken the place of neighborhood pickup games.''  While many parents want their kids to get involved out of a love of sports, there is yet another, more modern reason: to fill the time when parents are at work.  Charles Pine of Seattle, father of 6-year-old twins Zachary and Jonathan, signed up his sons for tennis and swimming lessons when they turned 5. Because he and his wife both work, Pine likes to keep the twins busy with outside activities.  ``This makes us feel that we aren't leaving them in daycare, so it takes some pressure off,'' the father admits.  Parental convenience aside, organized sports offer something essential to young children.  ``Physical skills are not only crucial to development, but they provide simple, timeless fun,'' explains CiCi Nielsen, head teacher at the New Milford, Conn., Head Start Center.  Fun seems to be the key in developing a healthy attitude. According to sports psychologist Jim Loehr, the Orlando, Fla.-based author of ``Toughness Training for Life'' (Dutton, 1993), athletic fulfillment begins as play, something children are equipped to do from birth.  ``Making sports a job at a young age is the exact opposite of what sports should be _ just plain fun,'' he emphasizes. IS YOUR CHILD READY?  The AAP recommends waiting until children are age 6 before letting them begin competitive team sports.  ``Prior to that, kids do best in a nonstructured environment where they can experiment with different skills,'' Harris says. ``At this early age, they don't respond to repetition or coaching. And no amount of practice will speed up the development of their coordination.''  Does that mean a 3- or 4-year-old shouldn't take gymnastics or play soccer?  No, Harris says, ``as long as they're allowed to play at their developmental level. It's when we expect them to compete and strategize like adults that the trouble begins.''  While kids exhibit sports readiness _ through their ability and enthusiasm _ at many different ages and stages, parents should expose them to basic physical activities such as running, jumping, balancing and kicking by the early grade-school years. If these motor skills are not developed by about age 8, your child won't be able to keep up with other kids at a time when sports become a form of socializing, Loehr says.  Kids who get a slow start in sports may be labeled uncoordinated; but, Harris notes, don't let them give up trying because ``they could catch up with the others eventually.'' DANGERS ON THE FIELD  A healthy dose of sports may be a fun way to keep kids active, but parents shouldn't discount the safety risks, either.  According to the Scottish Rite Children's Medical Center in Atlanta, sports injuries in children ages 6 through 13 are on the rise. Many of the injuries, the center reports, are occurring because of intensive training schedules, long playing seasons, poor equipment and specialty camps that emphasize single-sport training.  ``We're seeing more and more overuse injuries,'' Harris says, ``which used to be rare in children.''  Some examples: stress fractures of the lower back in gymnasts, inflammation of the heel in soccer players, tendinitis and bursitis of the shoulder in swimmers and baseball players and tendinitis of the shoulder and elbow in tennis players.  Why the rise in sports injuries to kids? Most experts agree that pressure is a major reason. Kirk found that ``not all kids are ready for a competitive environment, and some parents and coaches don't recognize this as a problem.''  In Kirk's study, 49 percent of the children lacked the fundamental skills needed for the sports in which they were participating.  Remarkably, that's the same percentage of kids that have significant cardiac risk factors, such as obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and an inactive lifestyle, according to a study by the National Association of Sports and Physical Education in Reston, Va. PERFORMANCE PRESSURES  The National Alliance for Youth Sports in West Palm Beach, Fla., takes the charge of ``too much too soon'' even further.  ``The physical and emotional stresses placed on some youngsters amount to child abuse,'' says Fred Engh, president of the nonprofit organization.  ``Because of the professional atmosphere created in children's athletics these days, parents and coaches simply lose perspective. When the child doesn't live up to expectations, emotions can go wild.''  Allan Overland, a Seattle tennis pro, has witnessed parents telling their children, ``If you don't win, don't bother asking me for a ride home.''  Overland is currently coaching the Pine twins, Zachary and Jonathan. Because he is a twin himself and knows how competitive they can be, Overland suggested that the boys take separate lessons and that their father not attend.  ``I agreed with the coach that they do better when I don't watch,'' Pine says, adding that he has a tendency to ``push it'' with the boys, so he forces himself to restrain his instincts.  ``I know they want to please me,'' Pine says. ``They get concerned if they don't feel I'm happy.''  That attitude would be a red flag for Cynthia Smith, a coach for young children at Hill's Gymnastics in Gaithersburg, Md., where 19-year-old gymnast Dominique Dawes trained before competing in the Olympics.  ``I've had parents who insist that their 5-year-old daughter work out five days a week because they are convinced the child is the next great Olympian,'' Smith says.  But inevitably, these are the children who develop problems.  ``If they are doing it for someone else instead of themselves, they will not reap any benefits,'' she emphasizes. CREATING A WIN-WIN SITUATION  Not all parental involvement in kids' sports is bad. Like a lot of fathers, Dan Gjelten of St. Paul, Minn., had a vision of his son, Arne, 9, playing ``really good baseball or hockey.'' He signed Arne up at an early age, but it soon became obvious that his son was not terribly competitive.  Gjelten fought his instincts to push Arne by ``remembering how difficult it was for me when I was a kid. My goal is to show Arne the joys of physical fitness,'' Gjelten says. ``He doesn't have to win.''  Little League coach Clay Jensen of El Sobrante, Calif., thinks playing team sports can be an invaluable experience. His ball players have gone on to high school with higher grade-point averages and a greater interest in school activities.  ``Instead of getting into trouble on the streets, these kids have developed their athletic abilities and their self-confidence,'' Jensen says.  This is certainly a goal for all young athletes, and one that experts feel can be attained if care and caution are applied to the physical and psychological aspects of sports. Teach your children the joy of movement and competitive play, Loehr recommends, and you will give them the greatest gift you can give: a head start on a lifetime of fitness, health and happiness.

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Dermot Mulroney in a scene from ``The Trigger Effect.'' By IAN SPELLING (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  ``You saw `Survival Quest?''' Dermot Mulroney says with a laugh, referring to a movie made in 1989, ``I'm impressed.  ``I've been in big films no one saw and small films that weren't supposed to get seen but did. But `Survival Quest,' that's a small film no one saw.''  Indeed, the actor's resume includes ``Sunset'' (1988), a Bruce Willis film gone awry; ``Young Guns'' (1988), an independent film bought by a major studio and transformed into a hit; ``Longtime Companion'' (1990), a critically adored independent film that turned a profit; the duds ``Career Opportunities'' (1991) and ``The Thing Called Love'' (1993); and the winners ``Living in Oblivion'' (1995) and ``How to Make an American Quilt'' (1995).  ``I've been on deck as `the next big thing' for 11 years, and I think it's a bunch of crap,'' Mulroney, 32, says during a phone interview from his Los Angeles home. ``For me, the reward of what I do is doing it.  ``I long ago gave up hoping my movies go through the roof or caring whether people like them. If I made that stuff part of what I'm doing this for, I'd be insane, if not just bitter.  ``Instead, I just enjoy my life and work and try to be as good as I can be. I don't pressure myself, because I already get paid handsomely and I've always been able to pursue the roles that interest me.''  The latest role to interest Mulroney is Joe, a key character in the drama ``The Trigger Effect,'' which will open nationwide on Aug. 30. The film was written and directed by David Koepp, whose screenwriting credits include ``Jurassic Park'' (1993) and ``Mission: Impossible.''  ``Trigger'' presents the question: How would people react if, in a major American city, all lights, phones, radios, TV sets, etc., mysteriously went dead one night?  That's precisely the situation which an upwardly mobile young couple _ Matt (Kyle MacLachlan) and Annie (Elisabeth Shue) _ and their friend Joe find themselves.  Suddenly, their neighbors are a potential menace, and it takes armed robbery just to get medicine for Matt and Annie's baby.  Joe makes an edgy situation even edgier by buying a gun and by generating a sexual heat with Annie that threatens her marriage.  ``This is a dark movie, which is what I love about it,'' Mulroney says. ``It's powerful but subtle, and Koepp never really tells you, `This is what you're supposed to be thinking.'  ``He really leaves it to the audience to decide what's going on, to find in it how they'd relate to a similar situation.  ``I like the feeling of impending doom. Anything horrible can happen to anybody at any time, and it's a challenge to play that without overdramatizing it or, on the other hand, completely sanitizing it.  As for Joe, Mulroney reports that he appreciated the changes the character undergoes. When night comes, average Joe reveals his true colors.  ``He's misleading,'' Mulroney says. ``He's this T-shirt-wearing nice guy, but he doesn't make the right decisions at the right moment, especially when he buys the gun.  ``Joe gives you the impression of being very capable, of being an `I can handle it' guy. But how he handles things doesn't help his friends or him.''  Mulroney says Koepp did a nice job of bringing the script to life, but he saves his greatest praise for his co-stars.  He and MacLachlan had worked together before, briefly, on the ensemble film ``Where the Day Takes You'' (1992). Mulroney had never met Shue before they began filming ``Trigger.''  ``Elisabeth is great, and we spent a lot of time figuring out how far to go with the attraction between Annie and Joe. Kyle makes the movie, though, which is a good thing because it's about a passive man who has to become decisive when his family needs him.''  And how does Mulroney act in a real-life crisis?  ``The closest I've come to a real crisis was when we had the earthquake in L.A.,'' he says. ``(During a crisis) I find myself being really calm, which isn't to say I always make the right decisions.  ``I don't experience a lot of fear,'' he adds. ``I like heights, I like small, crowded rooms and I'm not stricken by phobias of any sort. It's not in my makeup.''  That makeup was formed in 1963, when Mulroney was born in Alexandria, Va. He began acting in a neighborhood troupe at age 7 and stayed with it through high school and during his college years at Northwestern University in Illinois.  At the end of Mulroney's senior year at Northwestern, an agent from William Morris visited the school.  ``This was on the heels of (the success of) John Malkovich, Glenne Headly and Laurie Metcalf, who all came out of Steppenwolf,'' Mulroney says, referring to the Chicago theater group that launched several of today's highly respected actors. ``So, the hunt was on for more Chicago prospects.''  Mulroney met with the agent and performed a scene from Sam Shepard's play ``Fool for Love.''  ``I did my thing, and she said, `Sign here,' then shipped me out to L.A.,'' Mulroney recalls, laughing. ``I moved out here in August, 1985, and got my first job on Jan. 4, 1986.  ``It was a TV movie called `Sin of Innocence,' with Bill Bixby and Dee Wallace, and I was the male lead. So I didn't start out with bit parts and work my way up, which was an interesting experience.  ``I was thrown right into the fire.''  Since then, Mulroney has worked steadily in a variety of television and movie projects.  ``When you look at the things I've done, there are some wild ones, good and terrible, but most of them have a great spirit and were fun to make,'' he says. ``I've met some extraordinary people, and that's what I look for when I consider what to do next.''  By Mulroney's side for the better part of his career has been his wife, actress Catherine Keener, whom he met while shooting ``Survival Quest,'' and who can be seen in the current release ``Walking and Talking.''  ``We've been married six years, and she's the greatest,'' he says. ``We got together six months after finishing the film and we've been together ever since.''  The couple acted together again most recently in ``Oblivion.''  Mulroney can currently be seen in the new Robert Altman film, ``Kansas City.'' He plays Johnny O'Hara, a small-time 1930s hood kidnapped by big-time gangster Seldom Seen (Harry Belafonte) in retaliation for robbing one of Seen's best customers.  O'Hara's wife, Blondie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), responds by kidnapping Carolyn Stilton (Miranda Richardson), a socialite with ties to Seen.  ``Oh man, to be in an Altman film, I just about fell over when I got the call,'' Mulroney says enthusiastically. ``Talk about a plum role.  ``The whole thing was amazing, being in Kansas City, the period costumes, working with that cast and Altman. A lot of people may not get the story, but that's their problem.''  Mulroney's latest project is ``My Best Friend's Wedding,'' a comedy co-starring Julia Roberts.  The film is being shot in Chicago, but Mulroney's enjoying a few days off in Los Angeles, where he's performing with his band, the Low and Sweet Orchestra.  ``We do punk-folk music, I guess,'' Mulroney says when asked to describe the band's sound. ``I play the mandolin and cello and sing backup.''  In ``Wedding,'' Mulroney and Roberts play best pals and former college paramours who struck a deal that if they weren't married by age 28, they'd marry each other.  Right around Mulroney's 28th birthday, he calls Roberts to inform her that he's getting married.  ``That drastically affects Julia's life, and she does everything she can to throw a wrench into my wedding to Cameron Diaz,'' Mulroney says. ``We're not exactly inventing the wheel in terms of the story, but it's a romp and very romantic.  ``I'm marrying Cameron and Julia wants me. Big problems I've got, right?  ``And I get PAID to do this stuff.''  c.1996 Ian Spelling  (Ian Spelling is a New York-based free-lance writer.)

Includes a color slide of Kimberly Williams and David Conrad, the stars of ``Relativity.'' By CINDY PEARLMAN c.1996 Cindy Pearlman World rights except Chicago. (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  On a blazing hot summer day in the corner of a Culver City, Calif., sound stage, Kimberly Williams and David Conrad are proving there is one major requirement to filming their new ABC series ``Relativity'': strong lips. The two actors have been necking for hours.  ``I have never done so many kissing scenes in my life,'' Williams later reports. ``It has gotten to the point where I have lotion to put on my chin after a few takes.''  Director Mark Piznarski informs them that they can finally break their lip lock. This is a cut.  He announces, ``Well, I'm going to stop rolling the camera. You guys can stop kissing whenever you want to ... You can really stop kissing now.''  On the TV drama, Conrad and Williams play two people who are mad about each other. And the ABC network is mad about ``Relativity,'' which premieres this fall.  While most other proposed drama series were kissed off by the network, this one is being given four weeks at the prized and lofty ``NYPD Blue'' Tuesday-night time slot (10 p.m. Eastern Standard Time) to pick up an audience.  Some might remember that that's the old ``thirtysomething'' time slot, which is fitting because ``Relativity'' comes from the critically acclaimed team of Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick, who created that yuppie drama, as well as the beloved but short-lived ``My So-Called Life.''  Over coffee in Washington, D.C., where he has come to promote his summer hit film ``Courage Under Fire,'' director-producer Zwick says the duo was looking to get back into television.  ``We have a deal with ABC to provide three series,'' he says. ``Relativity'' is the second of those post-``thirtysomething'' projects.  ``Relativity'' is about Isabel Lukens (Williams), a beautiful and smart 24-year-old from Los Angeles who runs away to Rome to mull over a marriage proposal from her boyfriend, the slightly dweeby and controlling Everett Moreland (Randall Batinkoff).  While sightseeing, she runs into the adorable Leo Roth (Conrad), who, coincidentally, is also from Los Angeles and is in Rome to get over his mother's death.  It's love at first sight, but when the vacation is over both return to Los Angeles to face the music.  ``This is more than the story of a young couple,'' Zwick says. ``It's based on the Freudian premise that when two people go to bed together there are six people in the room. It's about a young couple and their families.''  Behind the scenes, Herskovitz and Zwick are heavily involved with the show. However, they say, the ``voice'' of the show belongs to co-executive producer and writer Jason Katims.  Katims met Herskovitz and Zwick when he was hired to work on ``My So-Called Life.'' A New York City playwright, Katims wrote a few scripts for ``My So-Called Life'' and ended up as a story editor. Last spring he co-wrote the David Schwimmer film ``The Pallbearer'' (1996).  After ``My So Called Life'' was cancelled, he expected his TV run to end. But Zwick and Herskovitz made him an offer he couldn't refuse.  ``They simply said, `Wanna do a new show?''' Katims recalls during a telephone interview from the set of ``Relativity.''  Katims explains how the scripts evolved.  ``I started writing the first script with a young couple's wedding day,'' he says. ``Then Ed and Marshall said, `Why cheat the audience out of the days, weeks and months that lead up to a wedding? There are all those pivotal and sometimes shocking events, such as the families meeting. Think of all that drama.'''  Zwick is quick to point to the series' depth, ``The show is more the anatomy of this relationship. They're in love with each other, but this couple doesn't really know each other.''  Prior to shooting, the difficult task was finding the perfect couple. In the case of Williams, best known for her role as Steve Martin's daughter in the ``Father of the Bride'' movies, she had auditioned for an upcoming movie called ``The Honest Courtesan'' directed by Herskovitz for a 1997 release.  ``Of course, we had seen `Father of the Bride' (1991) and thought she was perfect for the series,'' Herskovitz says during a telephone interview. ``She's a rare talent. When you work with her it's interesting because people see that face and think she isn't acting, that she's just being herself. That's not true. This woman can act.''  Casting Leo was more troublesome.  ``We did a huge search,'' says Zwick, who along with Katims found Conrad on an audition tape sent to them by ABC.  ``We were on our fourth tape and his audition was buried in between 20 other guys','' Katims says. ``After looking at 60 actors, the whole thing is really a blur, but we noticed a real wonderful heartfelt quality in David.''  Williams and Conrad did a reading together and it was instant chemistry. But, like any good soap opera, will there be a glitch?  Katims says the relationship will have bumps.  ``They'll have all the normal concerns such as `When should we move in together? Do I really want to be with your family? How will we deal with our different religious and ethnic backgrounds? Should we get married?'''  Will they say ``I do''?  That has not been decided, Katims says.  ``The approach we're taking is improvisational. We'll see what happens between the characters to determine their future. We don't have any particular plans.''  One plan from ABC is to move the series to Saturday nights after the initial four-week run on Tuesdays. Herskovitz says he's ``reserving judgment'' about the time slot.  ``It's possibly OK. We're not experts on programming decisions. I hope it proves to be a boost for us.''  ``I think we'll have more time to build an audience on Saturday night because the expectations won't be so high,'' Katims says.  Expectations have always been high for Zwick, a native of the Chicago suburbs, and Herskovitz, who hails from Philadelphia.  ``Ed and I met at the American Film Institute,'' Herskovitz recalls. They were directing fellows in 1975.  ``We saw each other as mutual threats and ended up becoming friends. It's been an amazing partnership,'' Zwick says.  Both worked on the series ``Family'' and the Emmy Award-winning ``Special Bulletin.''  Zwick has a feature-film-directing career that includes ``About Last Night'' (1986), ``Glory'' (1989) and ``Courage Under Fire'' (1986).  Herskovitz directed ``Jack the Bear'' (1993) and the upcoming ``The Honest Courtesan,'' starring Jacqueline Bisset and Catherine McCormack.  As for their success on ``thirtysomething,'' Zwick says, ``We never expected the show to take off. I always thought it would have limited appeal.''  ``We were aware some people couldn't stand the show. It was strange that even people who hated it would still analyze it,'' Herskovitz says.  As for the much-awaited ``thirtysomething'' reunion special, don't hold your breath.  ``We'll do it eventually, but we don't know when,'' Herskovitz says. ``I don't think you'll be seeing `A Very ``thirtysomething'' Thanksgiving Special' this year.''

By SHARON JOHNSON c.1996 USAir magazine (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  A Minneapolis executive recently completed a 30-day diary in which he noted the times he experienced tightness in his neck, a pounding heartbeat and a loss of confidence. His physician used heart monitors and other technical devices to measure his physiological responses in situations ranging from commuting to public speaking.  With the data, the physician designed a stress prescription that included neck exercises the executive could do in the privacy of his office, a low-fat diet to decrease his risk of heart attack and instruction in visualization as a tool to cope with a difficult boss.  A Boston executive who suffered anxiety attacks because she feared that her job would be eliminated changed the way she formulated her to-do list. Each day she included five items that would help her get a new job or switch industries.  She also learned to decrease her anxiety by consulting an imaginary mentor who handled challenges in a positive way. Whenever the woman faced an exasperating situation, such as a budget cut, she considered what the mentor would do.  These techniques are just two of the many ways top businesspeople cope with stress today. Stress has always been a challenge for executives, but it has increased in recent years because of downsizing and other economic trends, according to John H. Howard, a professor and management psychologist at the University of Western Ontario who has been surveying executives about their response to stress since 1971.  ``Executive positions are stressful even in good times because they involve uncertainty, overwork, a feeling of helplessness and urgency,'' he explains.  The stress of urgency also has increased, Howard says, because executives have insufficient time between tasks. In studying 300 managers at 12 major companies, Howard found that the typical executive performed a different task every seven minutes. That means having to switch focus more than eight times an hour.  As a result, stress has become a major health concern. More than half of those in high-stress positions suffer from such physical or mental health problems as exhaustion, headaches and insomnia, according to a study by the Northwestern National Life Insurance Co. in Minneapolis.  As researchers learn about stress and its effects on mental and physical health, more effective prevention and treatment plans are being developed. Research has also identified with greater specificity those who suffer stress and why.  ``Although two-thirds of the 3,000 executives we interviewed for a study at the University of Massachusetts Medical School reported a significant amount of stress, only half of them said it was a negative factor in their lives,'' says James. M. Rippe, a cardiologist and director of the Center of Clinical and Lifestyle Research in Shewsbury, Mass.  ``Personal stresses such as divorce or the problems of caring for a handicapped child were harder for executives at all levels to handle than stress at work.  ``The higher the executive's position, the less stress he reported. Although chief executive officers felt stress from pressure to keep their businesses successful, they reported less stress than other executives because they had more control over what they did and when they did it.  ``Money also helped, because the CEOs didn't have to worry about how they would pay for their children's college education and could buy services that enabled them to avoid the hassles of daily life.''  According to Dr. James Campbell Quick, editor of the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, female executives respond better than men to stress even though they often have the primary responsibility for raising children and caring for the home.  ``Women are better at establishing friendships and networking, so if something goes wrong in their professional or personal lives, they have several women from whom they can get emotional support and help,'' Quick says.  Work experience also affects stress levels. Executives who had been in their positions two to four years had less stress than those in their first managerial jobs or those who had been in the same positions for decades, Quick's research showed.  ``The key to avoiding stress is to tackle responsibilities that allow an executive to grow but are not so difficult that the executive feels overwhelmed, or so easy that he becomes bored and allows his performance to slip,'' Quick says.  Schools such as New York University's School of Continuing Education, have developed such workshops as ``The Time-Stress Connection,'' at which executives examine the personal attitudes, lifestyles and habits that determine daily effectiveness and explore what perpetuates the inefficient use of time and increased stress levels.  ``It's critical for an executive to know his or her long-term objectives because it can help in weathering crises outside one's control,'' says Carolyn Goldberg, the course instructor.  Regular exercise also helps control stress, says Rippe, author of the book ``Fit Over Forty'' (Morrow, 1996). More than 90 percent of the CEOs he surveyed participated in calisthenics at least three times a week, 70 percent said they ran regularly and more than 50 percent lifted weights.  Studies have shown the importance of using a variety of strategies to combat stress.  ``A businessperson may run three miles on weekends to help reduce workweek stress. (But) If he or she is out of town and develops a high level of anxiety before a meeting, a several-mile run won't be an option. Other techniques such as deep breathing exercises, visualization of a successful performance or recollection of a previous meeting where he or she triumphed might be a better approach,'' Howard explains.  Such experts as Salvatore R. Maddi, a professor of psychology at the University of California at Irvine and president of the Hardiness Institute at Irvine, have developed ways to help executives cope with such catastrophic events as the loss of a job or the death of a mate.  Maddi studied executives at Illinois Bell Telephone who had thrived during the breakup of the utility despite changes that left other executives unable to perform effectively.  ``The executives who thrived had hardy personalities,'' Maddi says. ``They had a strong sense of commitment, control and challenge. They could find ways to involve themselves in the changes so that they didn't feel overwhelmed by the loss of responsibilities or elimination of departments.  ``They viewed the changes as challenges rather than threats, then found something they could control, such as coming up with a new product.''  The Hardiness Institute offers workshops and self-help materials. One technique Maddi uses is situational reconstruction. For example, after a stress-producing event such as the loss of a key contract, the executive would imagine specific ways in which the situation might have turned out better or worse.  Situational reconstruction leads to action plans so that executives don't sink into self-pity and become immobilized.  However, some executives arrive at the institute already immobilized. In those cases Maddi recommends compensatory self-improvement.  For example, instead of sending out resumes, an unemployed executive would concentrate on a task over which he has complete control, such as improving his computer skills.  ``Once he has mastered the skill, the executive comes back with a renewed sense of accomplishment and self-esteem,'' Maddi says. ``He realizes that the catastrophic event is just one part of life and he can overcome it, just as he mastered the skills in his compensatory self-improvement project.  ``Best of all many executives identify new interests that can lead to even more satisfying jobs than the ones they lost and gain a technique that enables them to overcome stress throughout life.'' -0- TEN RELAXATION TIPS  John H. Howard, a professor and management psychologist at the University of Western Ontario, suggests the following to help reduce stress:  1. Don't procrastinate by doing low-priority tasks, thereby neglecting high priorities until there is a crisis. It's difficult to use time and energy to your best advantage without specific goals.  2. Accept the things out of your control. An overbearing boss or subordinate is unlikely to change, no matter what you do.  3. Avoid business lunches. Lunchtime should be a psychological break.  4. Avoid chronic hurriedness. Cultivate good judgment and decision, not speed.  5. If you have been working 60-hour weeks, cut back. Productivity drops in people under high stress.  6. When you are tense, relax your muscle groups. Start with arms, then face and neck, then shoulders and abdomen and finally legs.  7. If a stressful event is approaching, visualize yourself doing it well and in a relaxed manner.  8. Take a daily music break for at least 10 minutes.  9. Learn to feel comfortable confiding in someone, but not the same person every time. Give others support.  10. Laugh more. (Sharon Johnson writes for The New York Times, Working Woman and Self.

It was he who brought Atlanta's first major league championship to town in 1969, first season of divisional play in the National League.

THE ``LATE SHOW'' TOP TEN  From the home office in Coral Gables, Fla...  ``Good Things About Being a Senior Citizen''  As presented on the Friday, Nov. 22 broadcast of the LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN.  As presented by 10 residents of Century Village in Pembroke Pines, Fla.:  10. The 3M's: Mahjong, Metamucil and Matlock!  9. When you're on a Carnival cruise and Kathie Lee starts singing, you can turn off your hearing aid.  8. Instead of tipping waiters, I just tell them they can have my car when I die.  7. It's easy to annoy all young people. Step one: get in car. Step two: turn on blinker. Step three: leave it on for 50 miles.  6. The early bird special at Hooters  5. You can say whatever the hell pops into your mind. Waffles!  4. Once you hit 70, you start to look damn good in polyester!  3. My new bridge partner: Bob Dole  2. Social Security will be bankrupt in 50 years, and guess what --we don't care.  1. You're lookin' at a guy who's nailed all the Golden Girls.  OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN''  ON THE CBS TELEVISION NETWORK  (Monday, Nov. 18-Thursday, Nov. 21)  ``A week ago Saturday, Bob Dole appeared on Saturday Night Live.' The previous week, Bob Dole was actually on this program down in Washington, D.C. Are you like me, ladies and gentlemen, are you beginning to get the feeling that maybe Bob doesn't know the election is over?''  ``I feel bad for President Clinton. That's a tough situation there in Hawaii, you know. He sees those women in grass skirts, and he doesn't know whether to smoke them or chase them.''  ``Bad news, I guess, for O.J. Simpson out there in Santa Monica. In the civil suit against him, the prosecution will not be able to play the Mark Fuhrman tapes in front of the jury. You know, the tapes in which Mark Fuhrman uses racial slurs? However, those tapes will be played at the next Texaco board meeting.''  ``Tomorrow, in the civil case out there in Santa Monica, O.J. Simpson will actually testify -- first time, actually take the stand. Are you like me -- do you get the feeling that when O.J. puts his hand on the Bible, it might not fit?''  ``Earlier this week out in Los Angeles -- this is unbelievable --there was a $50 a plate fundraising banquet for O.J. Simpson...I understand it was a lovely party. First, they had cocktails and then the guests were invited to follow the trail of blood into the dining room.''  ``But, I think the highlight of the evening -- and, by the way, they raised $5,000 at this fundraiser for O.J. Simpson -- I think the most exciting part, of course, was when they auctioned off the murder weapon.''  ``Last week, Michael Jackson, of course, married the woman who is carrying his child -- in Australia, I believe. Very, very touching ceremony. The justice of the peace said, All right, you may now kiss the bride, and then she lifted his surgical mask.'''  ``Debbie, Michael's wife, was actually married once before. This is her second marriage. Her first husband was a chemistry professor. So, it's interesting to me, she's gone now from a science teacher to a science project.''  ``I think this is also encouraging. Executives at Texaco have promised that for the next 24 hours, they will try not to light up a cross.''  MARRIAGE ANYONE? Vol. II  Frank Klimko of the San Diego Union Tribune imagined the following matches made in mirth:  If Bea Arthur married Sting, she'd be Bea Sting  If Woody Allen married Natalie Wood then divorced him to marry Gregory Peck, then divorced him to marry Ben Hur, he'd be Woody Wood Peck Hur.  If Dolly Parton married Tommy Smothers then went even further back in show business to marry Mr. Lucky, then divorced him to marry Martin Short, then divorced him to marry blues great Buddy Guy, we'd all nod knowingly when we heard Dolly Smothers Lucky Short Guy.  If Boog Powell married Felipe Alou, he'd be Boog Alou.  If Snoop Doggy Dogg married Winnie the Pooh, he'd be Snoop Doggy Dog Pooh.  If Liv Ullman married Judge Lance Ito then divorced him to marry Jerry Mathers, she'd be Liv Ito Beaver.  If Sondra Locke married Elliott Ness, then divorced him to marry Hermann Munster, she'd be Sandra Locke Ness Munster.  CAN'T ANYBODY HERE PLAY THIS GAME?  But the Jets do have trouble. Offensive tackle Harry Boatswain summed up their feeling.  ``Special teams?'' he said. ``It feels like a special-education team this year.''  _ Quoted in the New York Times  BILL'S WORLDBy Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star  Mr. Clinton and China's president plan to exchange visits over the next two years. Sounds like a revival of ping-pong diplomacy.  Mr. Clinton's visit to Thailand was the first by an American president since Richard Nixon went there in 1969. No, Nixon was on a state visit, not a work-release program.  Hillary Rodham Clinton says she will ``speak out and write about'' welfare reform. Has anyone agreed to listen to or read her words?  Mr. Clinton's search for a Republican for his new Cabinet hasn't turned up much yet, it's reported. For one thing, Abe Lincoln isn't available.  Economists think retailers will do well this Christmas. One way to make sure is to buy expensive, anonymous gifts for newspaper columnists.  The White House Christmas tree this year is a Colorado blue spruce from Ohio. Sounds like George Bush _ a New England Yankee from Texas.  The height of the White House Christmas tree is 18.5 feet. Too bad Ross Perot wasn't elected. That's the same size as his ego.  The recent Army scandals prove to Aunt Ilse from Oelwein that the question of whether women should be in combat has long since been answered.

THE ``LATE SHOW'' TOP TEN  From the home office in Coral Gables, Fla...  ``Good Things About Being a Senior Citizen''  As presented on the Friday, Nov. 22 broadcast of the LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN.  As presented by 10 residents of Century Village in Pembroke Pines, Fla.:  10. The 3M's: Mahjong, Metamucil and Matlock!  9. When you're on a Carnival cruise and Kathie Lee starts singing, you can turn off your hearing aid.  8. Instead of tipping waiters, I just tell them they can have my car when I die.  7. It's easy to annoy all young people. Step one: get in car. Step two: turn on blinker. Step three: leave it on for 50 miles.  6. The early bird special at Hooters  5. You can say whatever the hell pops into your mind. Waffles!  4. Once you hit 70, you start to look damn good in polyester!  3. My new bridge partner: Bob Dole  2. Social Security will be bankrupt in 50 years, and guess what --we don't care.  1. You're lookin' at a guy who's nailed all the Golden Girls.  OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN''  ON THE CBS TELEVISION NETWORK  (Monday, Nov. 18-Thursday, Nov. 21)  ``A week ago Saturday, Bob Dole appeared on Saturday Night Live.' The previous week, Bob Dole was actually on this program down in Washington, D.C. Are you like me, ladies and gentlemen, are you beginning to get the feeling that maybe Bob doesn't know the election is over?''  ``I feel bad for President Clinton. That's a tough situation there in Hawaii, you know. He sees those women in grass skirts, and he doesn't know whether to smoke them or chase them.''  ``Bad news, I guess, for O.J. Simpson out there in Santa Monica. In the civil suit against him, the prosecution will not be able to play the Mark Fuhrman tapes in front of the jury. You know, the tapes in which Mark Fuhrman uses racial slurs? However, those tapes will be played at the next Texaco board meeting.''  ``Tomorrow, in the civil case out there in Santa Monica, O.J. Simpson will actually testify -- first time, actually take the stand. Are you like me -- do you get the feeling that when O.J. puts his hand on the Bible, it might not fit?''  ``Earlier this week out in Los Angeles -- this is unbelievable --there was a $50 a plate fundraising banquet for O.J. Simpson...I understand it was a lovely party. First, they had cocktails and then the guests were invited to follow the trail of blood into the dining room.''  ``But, I think the highlight of the evening -- and, by the way, they raised $5,000 at this fundraiser for O.J. Simpson -- I think the most exciting part, of course, was when they auctioned off the murder weapon.''  ``Last week, Michael Jackson, of course, married the woman who is carrying his child -- in Australia, I believe. Very, very touching ceremony. The justice of the peace said, All right, you may now kiss the bride, and then she lifted his surgical mask.'''  ``Debbie, Michael's wife, was actually married once before. This is her second marriage. Her first husband was a chemistry professor. So, it's interesting to me, she's gone now from a science teacher to a science project.''  ``I think this is also encouraging. Executives at Texaco have promised that for the next 24 hours, they will try not to light up a cross.''  MARRIAGE ANYONE? Vol. II  Frank Klimko of the San Diego Union Tribune imagined the following matches made in mirth:  If Bea Arthur married Sting, she'd be Bea Sting  If Woody Allen married Natalie Wood then divorced him to marry Gregory Peck, then divorced him to marry Ben Hur, he'd be Woody Wood Peck Hur.  If Dolly Parton married Tommy Smothers then went even further back in show business to marry Mr. Lucky, then divorced him to marry Martin Short, then divorced him to marry blues great Buddy Guy, we'd all nod knowingly when we heard Dolly Smothers Lucky Short Guy.  If Boog Powell married Felipe Alou, he'd be Boog Alou.  If Snoop Doggy Dogg married Winnie the Pooh, he'd be Snoop Doggy Dog Pooh.  If Liv Ullman married Judge Lance Ito then divorced him to marry Jerry Mathers, she'd be Liv Ito Beaver.  If Sondra Locke married Elliott Ness, then divorced him to marry Hermann Munster, she'd be Sandra Locke Ness Munster.  CAN'T ANYBODY HERE PLAY THIS GAME?  But the Jets do have trouble. Offensive tackle Harry Boatswain summed up their feeling.  ``Special teams?'' he said. ``It feels like a special-education team this year.''  _ Quoted in the New York Times  BILL'S WORLDBy Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star  Mr. Clinton and China's president plan to exchange visits over the next two years. Sounds like a revival of ping-pong diplomacy.  Mr. Clinton's visit to Thailand was the first by an American president since Richard Nixon went there in 1969. No, Nixon was on a state visit, not a work-release program.  Hillary Rodham Clinton says she will ``speak out and write about'' welfare reform. Has anyone agreed to listen to or read her words?  Mr. Clinton's search for a Republican for his new Cabinet hasn't turned up much yet, it's reported. For one thing, Abe Lincoln isn't available.  Economists think retailers will do well this Christmas. One way to make sure is to buy expensive, anonymous gifts for newspaper columnists.  The White House Christmas tree this year is a Colorado blue spruce from Ohio. Sounds like George Bush _ a New England Yankee from Texas.  The height of the White House Christmas tree is 18.5 feet. Too bad Ross Perot wasn't elected. That's the same size as his ego.  The recent Army scandals prove to Aunt Ilse from Oelwein that the question of whether women should be in combat has long since been answered.  Experts think the economy will grow steadily into the 21st century, a new survey shows. It would be more impressive as if they'd say the 22nd.  Offer not available in any store!

"79945"	"I"	"guess"	" ``You turn on the news, and it's the top story, and you think to yourself that there's got to be something going on in the world that is more important than this,'' he said. ``Maybe not to my client, or to the plaintiffs, but certainly to the rest of the world.

Money managers reacted by advising Lott to keep his hands off the Fed, chaired by Alan Greenspan. ``Any politician who takes on Greenspan will lose, because the bond market is rooting for Greenspan,'' said James Awad, president of the New York money management firm of Awad &AMP; Associates.

"80886"	"I"	"guess"	" Lott caused a stir in the investment community when he voiced concern about the Fed's free hand in conducting monetary policy. The central bank has set interest rates higher than needed, the senator said on Fox News Sunday, a talk show. ``I'm a little nervous about the degree of independence'' the Fed's board of governors has, he said. ``But at the same time, I realize that (independence) is important.

"81981"	"I"	"guess"	" A: Well, the tough thing in making this film was that I had to stick to the facts. I took that very seriously, because I know that some people get their history through movies. So I wanted to be accurate and factual. If I'd had a free hand as a dramatist, I would have made De La Beckwith take the witness stand and have him and DeLaughter go at each other in the climax, but it didn't happen that way. What did happen is that, in the course of the trial, Bobby told me, he ran into De La Beckwith in the men's room at the courthouse. He said that De La Beckwith basically said, ``How do you think it's goin' for you, son?'' with this kind of big grin on his face, and Bobby said, ``Well, we'll see soon enough, I guess,'' and De La Beckwith said, ``That we will, son, that we will,'' and he had this cocky grin on his face, like nobody could touch him. I took that little nub of an encounter and I made a full scene out of it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"

"82833"	"I"	"guess"	" ``My mother was murdered by some guy that, I guess, had some type of stalker mentality for her,'' Glenn said. ``They found her abandoned body three days later in an old building. He had beat her to death, so me and my little sister were left alone. My father never called, never once let me know where to reach him, or even said something like: `If you need anything, give me a call.' Something like that would have meant something even if he didn't mean it. I used to ride the bus in Columbus, and I'd look around. Is that guy my father? Is that guy? I used to wonder. My memory of my mom is of her wonderful smile. She lived to make me and my little sister happy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"83794"	"I"	"guess"	" ``We're very happy with where we are right now,'' said BC coach Jim O'Brien, whose team will play three games in the next six days, highlighted by a FleetCenter matchup with Massachusetts Saturday. ``It's the coach in me, I guess, but we talk in terms of always looking for perfection.

"83844"	"I"	"guess"	" ``Having someone sniff your armpits is a little odd,'' she said, smiling. ``But it's part of developing good deodorants, I guess, and you're paid, so I don't worry about it.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

"84093"	"I"	"guess"	" ``I don't think that would really change how we do things in practice in Arlington,''' Anderson said. ``Legislation, I guess, would put forth some kind of sanction against us if we did.

"84234"	"I"	"guess"	" The lesson, I guess, is that we should be grateful that the guy who doesn't buy cases of Pennzoil does care _ immensely, at that _ about raising a decent son, getting out of the house once in a while _ just the two of us _ and bragging about his wife's success. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"84251"	"I"	"guess"	" Of course, if you're really interested in throwing shekels at performance, BMW will also sell you its own sport version of the 540i for an extra $8,360, adding a stiffer suspension, a big air dam on the front and a lot more speed. (One way to look at it, I guess, is that if you feel compelled to drive at its top speed of 155 miles an hour, you won't need money for the future anyway.) </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

"86694"	"I"	"guess"	" ``It was a big shot, an important shot, I guess,'' said Curley, who played the final 16:45 of regulation and the OT with four fouls. ``But Scoonie was just going to try and go for a full-court layup and everybody else was just going to crash the boards for a rebound.

"87222"	"I"	"guess"	" ``I was into the Seattle stuff, I guess, when everyone was into it,'' says Johns. ``But I've kind of grown out of it a bit. They're good bands and everything, but I listen to more than that. I've always listened to Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath _ and I listen to them a lot, still. And I'm starting to listen to a lot of thrash-metal stuff. Just the energy of it is really good. And a lot of my friends are into hot, old-school hardcore punk stuff like Minor Threat and Black Flag, which I also listen to.

"89269"	"I"	"guess"	" ``The year before I started my job here, they added a hard-rock/metal category,'' he said, referring to the 1988 awards. ``But they had no voting members in that field. So the award went to Jethro Tull because, I guess, the flute is metallic. After that, I vowed that we wouldn't add another category without getting the members first.'' So Greene held off on granting the award until he and leaders of American Indian music could persuade enough members to join the recording academy and start a screening committee to nominate records. (To vote on the Grammys, one must have technical or creative credits on at least six different commercially released songs or albums.) The next challenge was figuring out what recordings were eligible. Did music from Canadians count? Yes. How about white musicians making Indian music? Yes (much to the consternation of many American Indian musicians). </P> "	"nyt_eng_200102.gz"
"89352"	"I"	"guess"	" WHIPP: Which, I guess, in part explains Judi Dench. I give a little more credit to Burstyn, who gave us such a fearless, heartrending performance in ``Requiem for a Dream.''

"90863"	"I"	"guess"	" Perhaps one reason the movie seemed so great to him as a boy was that it mirrored many of the stories he had heard from his father, who had been a supply sergeant in the U.S. Army. ``He was stationed in the Middle East, and as a Jew he dealt with anti-Semitism,'' Weinstein said. ``He was in Cairo, and I know that after the war he drifted into Israel and tried to help supply the Haganah, the Jewish underground military organization in Palestine.

"91929"	"I"	"guess"	" ``It was a nice way, I guess, to end that chapter of my life, to win four in a row,'' Woods said of the Masters victory. ``But it's hard to say that I'm ending it, because I'm just five years into my career.

"92899"	"I"	"guess"	" Well, for a couple of reasons. First of all, my family has always been grounded in Massachusetts, and we love Massachusetts. So Massachusetts remains our home base in that context. I've commuted around the world back to Massachusetts. When I was working for a British company, I used to come back and forth to the Boston area. We've owned a home for, I guess, about 20 years on Nantucket island. We've had our home in Dover since 1988. We just find that this is our spiritual home town. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"

"93369"	"I"	"guess"	" DePaul center Steven Hunter appears to have been the guy who helped himself the most at the just-concluded predraft camp in Chicago. That's Wallace's take, anyway. ``When he was a reserve as a freshman, you thought if he made the natural progression, that he'd be a possible lottery pick as a senior,'' Wallace said. Instead, Hunter declared after his sophomore season, which was only slightly more eventful than his uninspiring freshman year. ``It was a lackluster year,'' Wallace said. ``But he showed enough flashes (at the camp) to move into the first round, probably inside the top 20.'' Hunter is a 7-footer who has shot-blocking capabilities but otherwise ordinary numbers (5.5 rebounds, 11.4 points on a sub-.500 team). Wallace said the camp was better than in past years because a number of underclassmen showed up and played well. Other than Hunter, that would include Gilbert Arenas of Arizona, Omar Cook of St. John's, and Kenny Satterfield of Cincinnati . . . What do we make of the resounding rejection (57-43 percent) of the arena referendum in Charlotte? Well, judging by Stern's comments, he seems to be telling the folks in Charlotte to work it out and not to depend on him to bail them out. He didn't issue any threats. He didn't state the obvious, which is that the initiative would likely sail through if George Shinn and Ray Woolridge sold the team. He simply told them to solve it. ``I would like to hope that because these two enterprises (the city and the team) do mean a certain amount to each other, that there will be a way to find a way to do what has to be done there, and that's to build a new building,'' Stern said. The NBA wants the Hornets in Charlotte, and Stern generally gets what he wants. As of now, Louisville probably is the most logical choice for relocation, although the arrival of Rick Pitino to coach the Cardinals may be enough to placate the basketball people in that city . . . Keith Van Horn to Utah? That's one predraft trade rumor that's out there. The Jazz would have to part with a combination of players, and Van Horn's trade situation is still affected by the dreaded base-year compensation rules. Utah is also interested to see Russian Andrei Kirilenko, whom the Jazz selected with the 24th pick in the 1999 draft. He is slated to play in the Utah Summer League and join the team this season. Kirilenko, a 6-10 center/power forward, has been playing in Russia since being drafted at the age of 18 . . . It will be interesting to see what happens to high school big man DeSagana Diop. He's a full slab (7 feet, 300 pounds) and was widely perceived to be one of the top six picks. He still could be. But he also is, as Wallace noted, ``somewhat of a mystery man'' because he hasn't had any workouts yet and missed a lot of the All-Star games with a foot injury . . . Damage Control Dept.: After Antonio Davis's name was mentioned in the ongoing trial in Atlanta regarding strippers at a nightclub providing succor and other salacious stuff, agent Bill Duffy quickly got his client in a teleconference with Toronto reporters. Davis said he would soon file a lawsuit against the individual who mentioned his name in testimony. ``I don't know if it's a personal attack or not,'' Davis said. ``The bottom line is he said my name and it's a lie. He's not yelling out a bunch of names. He's yelling out particular people. He makes it sound like I was one of the top five or six guys who were doing this stuff, which is completely false.'' Davis did admit to visiting the club, but said it was before he was married, very early in his NBA career. ``I was young and, I guess, stupid,'' he said. Stern was asked about the situation in Atlanta and cracked, ``Wouldn't you rather talk about declining ratings and attendance being off?'' He did add, ``We have to do a better job of identifying places like that and warning our players against it. There is a line you traditionally try to walk, a very thin one, from saying based upon every innuendo or what vowel somebody's name ends with as to whether you should go to a place or not, and we're not going to be a party to that.'' . . . This will be a busy week for the Celtics, who will have four days devoted to working out players for the draft. Included in the group of about 16-20 players will be a couple of foreigners: point guard Tony Parker, who played in France, and Vladimir Radmanovic, a 6-10 forward who played in Yugoslavia. The Celtics also will take a look at point guards Jamaal Tinsley and Earl Watson as well as former Worcester Burncoat High School star Michael Bradley, who went to Kentucky to play for Pitino only to see Pitino leave to coach the Celtics shortly after Bradley had made his commitment. Bradley subsequently transferred to Villanova and played one year, declaring early for this year's draft. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"

"94754"	"I"	"guess"	" A very classy and kind gesture by O'Connell at Saturday's draft, calling longtime scouts Bob Tindall, Jim Morrison, and Jean Ratelle to the podium as a way of announcing their retirements. Three truly terrific men. Ex-Bruin Peter McNab on the ever-classy Ratelle: ``When I came to Boston, I knew nothing about playing defensive hockey. Not a thing. And Ratty's way was just wonderful. When we went out on that long trip at the start of October, he quietly got me on the plane and said, `Look, you and I are going to work on a few things out there, OK?' That's all. Simple. And for months he worked with me, on faceoffs, on positioning, on defensive coverage. Just little things, like saying, `OK, now (Rick) MacLeish is fast, very fast, don't get caught trying to chase him _ stay with him.' You couldn't help but learn from Ratty. He was so patient, so smart. And you know, he didn't tell anyone what he was doing, how he was helping, and he never came up later and said anything to me, or looked for thanks. That was the way his generation did things, I guess, and I'll never forget how much he helped me.'' . . . The Coyotes grabbed the fastest skater in the draft when they selected Fredrik Sjostrom No. 11 overall last Saturday. The speedy Sjostrom was tutored on blades by his mom, a Swedish speedskater in the '76 Olympics. With the 180th pick, the Desert Dogs took Scott Polaski, a cousin of US Olympic speedskater Bonnie Blair. The genes look good. Just wonder how they're going to slip the hood of those unitards over their helmets. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010701.0022 type=story > <HEADLINE> SPARKS GLAD TO BE HOME </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> LOS ANGELES (BC-BKL-SPARKS-LADN) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"

Flies swarmed men with matted hair, and fights unfolded in the tangle of bodies for the tiny corners of space.

But while they hardly make noise about it, few of the reservists here say they were ever given that choice. In fact, the letters they clutch clearly state that they have been ``involuntarily ordered to active duty.'' By Greg Winter.  With photos, NYT21-24.

, he said,	 Speaking to the National Association of Business Economics in St. Louis, Meyer said the Fed's aggressive campaign of interest rate cuts this year has not rippled through the economy and the financial markets as much as traditional economic theory would have predicted. As a result, he said, the Fed has been forced to cut rates more deeply than past experience would have suggested is necessary. </P> 	nyt_eng_200111.gz
, he said,	 Meyer also said the outlook for a quick recovery would be tempered somewhat if Congress and the Bush administration cannot agree on a fiscal stimulus package in coming weeks. The long-term forecast, he said, was being dimmed a bit by the likelihood that federal budget surpluses would be smaller than previously projected, a development likely to push up interest rates. </P> 	nyt_eng_200111.gz

EMI has the option to raise its stake to 5 percent next year, the companies said. The agreement allows the London-based Newsplayer to include EMI video footage of bands like Genesis and artists like Nat King Cole in its database. Like other music companies, EMI, which is also based in London, has been seeking ways to make money from online music, as sales from conventional retail outlets fall. EMI shares, which are traded in London, fell 7.50 pence, or 2.14 percent, to 3.43 pounds.  TELECOMMUNICATIONS  SATELLITE RADIO COMPANY NAMES CHIEF  SiriusSatellite Radio in New York said on Tuesday that it had named Joseph P. Clayton president and chief executive. Clayton had been vice chairman at Global Crossing in Rochester, a worldwide Internet and long-distance services provider, and had held numerous posts in consumer electronics over the years. The 52-year-old Clayton succeeds David Margolese, the Sirius chairman, whom the company said had given up the chief executive post last month. Sirius plans to introduce its 100-channel digital radio service on Feb. 14, 2002, in Denver, Houston and Phoenix. The Sirius rival, XM Satellite Radio, introduced its 100-channel digital radio service in two markets in September, and introduced its service nationally earlier this month.  RESEARCH  GENOMICS-DERIVED DRUG TO BE TESTED  Millennium Pharmaceuticals said on Tuesday that the first drug discovered using its genomics technology had entered clinical trials. Millennium, based in Cambridge, Mass., is widely considered a leader in sifting through genetic data to find genes that might be involved in disease, and big drug companies have paid hundreds of millions of dollars for access to its technology. But pressure was growing on the company to show that it could actually develop a drug. ``People were beginning to say, `When are we going to see the proof here?''' said Rachel Leheny, an analyst at Lehman Brothers. The drug, taken orally, is for obesity and is being developed with Abbott Laboratories. The drug inhibits an enzyme that may play a role in regulating metabolism. The new drug, called MLN4760, joins only a handful of other drugs in the pharmaceutical industry that were developed using genomics. Millennium has several other drugs being tested in patients, but those were acquired from other companies. Millennium's shares rose 2 cents, to $33.52.  HARDWARE  CHIP MACHINE SALES SLIP FURTHER  Still suffering through its worst slump ever, the chip-making equipment industry in the third quarter shipped products worth less than half as much in total and took in a quarter as many new orders as during the year-earlier period, a trade association said. The group, Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International, based in San Jose, Calif., said equipment suppliers worldwide reported shipments worth $5.6 billion, a 56 percent drop from the $13.0 billion in the comparable 2000 period and a 20 percent drop from the second quarter of this year. Projecting a bleak outlook for shipments during the fourth quarter and early next year, when goods ordered between July and September will be shipped, new orders last quarter were $3.47 billion, down 77 percent from the $15.49 billion in the third quarter of 2000. ``We don't see clear signals for a sustainable recovery in the near term,'' said Elizabeth Schumann, the association's director of research and statistics. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20011127.0224 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-TERROR-ADVISORY-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> The New York Times plans these stories, photos and graphics on the situation in Afghanistan and the terrorist attacks on the United States for the paper of Wednesday, Nov. 28.

ATTACK-OVERVIEW (Undated) _ A synoptic look at the day's news related to the situation in Afghanistan and terrorist attacks in the United States. By Clyde Haberman. (700 words)  PAGE ONE  TERROR-ASHCROFT (Washington) _ Attorney General John Ashcroft said Tuesday that about 600 people are in jail in connection with the investigation of the Sept. 11 attacks, and some of them, he added, are members of the al-Qaida terrorist network who may have been planning additional terrorist incidents. By David Johnston.  Editors, this story replaces the previously budgeted TERROR-INQUIRY, now scratched.  TERROR-DETAIN-ASSESS (Washington) _ A news analysis on the decision by the administration to release a list of those who remain in federal custody. By Todd S. Purdum.  ATTACK-PRISONERS (Tashgurghan, Afghanistan) _ Like some lost caravan, the trucks rumbled across the steppe bearing their wretched cargo, 800 Taliban prisoners bound for an uncertain fate. The prisoners were the sorry byproduct of the Northern Alliance's most recent victory, in Kunduz. It was a defeated army this, all rags and filth and lowered heads. The prisoners had come to this way station to wait for some word on their final destination. By Dexter Filkins.  With photos, NYT1-4.  ATTACK-UPRISING (Qala Jangi, Afghanistan) _ The Northern Alliance crushed a two-day uprising of Taliban prisoners of war, an effort that, according to the victors, required a tank firing point-blank into a house containing the last holdouts. American and British troops assisted. By Carlotta Gall.  ANTHRAX-CT (dateline to come) _ The death of an 84-year-old man who lived in the same area as the elderly woman who died of inhalation anthrax last week does not appear to be related, Gov. John G. Rowland said Tuesday. The man died at home, several weeks ago, and his body was not discovered for a few days, Rowland said. ``The 84-year-old man from Seymour did not die from anthrax,'' he said.

By James Dao and Thom Shanker.  AFGHAN-DEFECT (Quetta, Pakistan) _ At least on the outside, Mullah Amirjan Selabe had already begun to reinvent himself. After slipping across the border out of Afghanistan, he had unfurled the Taliban's telltale black turban, replacing it with a gray one with white stripes. Selabe is one of countless Taliban soldiers or commanders who have disappeared by melding themselves in Afghan communities in Pakistan. By Norimitsu Onishi.  PENDLETON-MARINES (Oceanview, Calif.) _ With more than 2,000 Marines from this base alone now overseas, some of them on the ground in Afghanistan, a slow but steady stream of reservists is flowing in to fill the empty barracks and prepare for assignments at bases in the United States and abroad. Though they have finished with their term of duty, the officers on this base of 41,000 Marines proudly state that the reservists are here because they want to be. But while they hardly make noise about it, a few of the reservists say they were ever given that choice. By Greg Winter.  With photos, NYT21-24.

By Douglas Frantz and Jeff Gerth.  National  AIRPORT-SECURITY (Washington) _ Transportation Secretary Mineta talks about the new transportation security agency within his department.

He also sets a goal of no more than 10 minutes to clear security screening at all U.S. airports. By Matthew L. Wald.  TERROR-DETAIN (Undated) _ The Justice Department has quietly tightened the rules that govern the detention of foreigners in the United States, allowing the government to hold an alien indefinitely even after a federal immigration judge has ordered the alien to be released for lack of evidence.

The prisoners were the sorry byproduct of the Northern Alliance's most recent victory, in Kunduz. It was a defeated army. The prisoners had come to this spot to wait for some word on their final destination. By Dexter Filkins.  With photos, NYT1-4.

EGYPT-TOURISM (Cairo) _ When developers started building Egypt's first private international airport three years ago at the Red Sea resort of Marsa Alam, they had visions of tourists by the thousands whisked from the cold and damp of the north European winter to enjoy fun in the sun. Then came Sept. 11. Now the airport gets one plane a week, the hotels are half-closed or shut down entirely, and the whole of the Egyptian tourist industry, its most important source of revenue, is gasping for breath.

Interviewed on NPR's ``All Things Considered'' after he won the most  recent book award, he read a poem called ``Memories of 1936-37,'' about  ``my nazi girlfriend,'' whose family kept a picture of Hitler on the  mantelpiece.  When her brother beat him up, he writes, ``I decided to  kill Hitler, anddid / with the help of millions of others.''

, they said,	 But that support, they said, will continue only as long as the Bush  administration convincingly explains its reasons for fighting in  Afghanistan, and Americans perceive their leaders are being honest about  the possibility of losing soldiers.    ``America's public tolerance for casualties is directly related to  how the war is being explained to them by the national leadership,''  said Tom Nichols, professor of strategy at US Naval College in Newport,  R.I. </P> 	nyt_eng_200111.gz
, he writes,	 Business Week adds useful detail to the story, but it doesn't come  out shining either: Writer John Byrne asks, ``Why the confession'' if  the book's methodology isn't being challenged, and then never answers  the question. Similarly, he writes, ``This confession is a doozy,'' but  then never backs it up. Nonetheless, the story succeeds solidly in  saying ``we told you so'': Three times it invokes the ``oops'' that  headlined the magazine's 1984 cover story about the companies cited for  excellence that quickly went downhill.  -----  The never-ending story </P> 	nyt_eng_200111.gz

, he says,	 The duck, he says, is poached in olive oil at 115 to 120 degrees,  the result of long experimentation to get the temperature just right;  each degree changed the texture and the taste of the duck. ``Rather than  me dictate what to do with a product, the product tells me how best to  proceed,'' he says. </P> 	nyt_eng_200111.gz

, they said,	 Drug industry officials counter that regulatory requirements are as  rigorous as they have ever been, and slowing the process will only keep  much-needed drugs off the market. Such a slowdown would be costly to  companies, but even worse, they said, it could be devastating to  seriously ill patients. </P> 	nyt_eng_200111.gz
, they say,	 Their concerns are bolstered, they say, by the growing number of  drugs that have been recalled in the past three years  _ nearly a dozen  implicated in more than 1,000 deaths. The list includes the diabetes  drug Rezulin, the diet pill Redux, the heartburn medication Propulsid,  the painkiller Duract, the drug Lotronex to treat irritable bowel  syndrome and, most recently, the cholesterol drug Baycol. </P> 	nyt_eng_200111.gz
, he said,	 Last year, for the first time since the user fee act was  implemented, the agency slowed its review of new drugs, increasing the  median approval time to 15.6 months from 11.6 the year before. One FDA  official compared the workload to running a marathon at the pace of a  100-yard dash. The agency has managed so far, he said, but would need  more funding to continue at the same pace. </P> 	nyt_eng_200111.gz
, they said,	 Industry officials said they are willing to consider reasonable fee  increases to protect the current review process. Even a slowdown of a  few months as was seen last year, they said, is cause for concern. The  delays can cost companies hundreds of millions of dollars, and for small  biotech companies waiting for their first product approval, they can be  devastating. </P> 	nyt_eng_200111.gz

Though Carter had constructed pens and outbuildings on the family farm, he and his wife hired an architect to design the house, he said, because ``we needed one to referee between me and Rosalynn on what the house ought to be like.''

The collection has prompted a four-year tangled dispute over his competence and control over his Fragonards, Bonnards and Fra Angelicos. The art is stored in a duty-free port near Zurich, he said. He rarely sees it, he said, because he lives in a nursing home and is hindered by his physical state. </P> 	nyt_eng_200111.gz

, he says,	 For Hockney, the proof is in the paintings. By looking at the art itself, he says, one can find aspects that could have been done only with the help of optics: highlights in Vermeer; a woman who seems to have two elbows on the same arm in Chardin's ``Return From the Market''; the pattern on a carpet in Lorenzo Lotto's ``Husband and Wife.'' Having studied paintings with Falco, Hockney said, ``It is inconceivable that artists wouldn't have used such devices.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200111.gz

The primary resistance from art historians, he said, is ``that there are no eyewitness accounts.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200111.gz
, he said,	 Hockney said that before photography, artists used lenses to project images of their subjects, images that were ephemeral, ``until the chemical process could freeze it on a piece of paper.'' An optical projection looks like a photograph, he said, ``except that it has soft edges.'' When Hockney demonstrates the process, people say the results resemble a painting. ``The paintings looked like optical projections because they came first,'' he said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200111.gz

CRASH-TESTS (Detroit) _ The Jeep Liberty and Ford Explorer both perform poorly in a new bumper collision test by the Insurance Inst. for Highway Safety.

Friedman's ``Foreign Affairs.''  ENTERTAINMENT/ARTS  (Will move in `e' news category or as indicated)  MOVIES-TRAVOLTA (Los Angeles) _ Another in the series ``Watching Movies With'': John Travolta sat quietly in a square, well-cushioned chair along the back wall of his home screening room. He had just finished watching ``Yankee Doodle Dandy,'' a glossy Warner Brothers bio-pic about the legendary George M. Cohan, a movie that's been dear to him since he was a little boy in New Jersey dreaming about a life on the stage. Travolta rubbed his eyes. Yes, he had been crying; there was no use denying it. He nodded sheepishly. The movie that had meant so much to him as a boy, he discovered, still had the power to reach into his heart. And now, in the wake of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, what had once seemed corny, flag-waving jingoism in the screen saga of the man who wrote ``You're a Grand Old Flag'' and ``Over There'' instead came across as almost eerily in touch with the current national mood. By Rick Lyman.  With photo.  BROADWAY-REPLACEMENT (New York) _ The wig was loose. The dress was tight. The lift was botched. The turn was late. Well, that's what rehearsing is for, isn't it? Oops, no, sorry. That's the other show business. This was the one where time is money, where an actress and dancer of the caliber of Charlotte d'Amboise was supposed to get it right the first time. One full run-through with the cast _ the put-in, they call it _ was all d'Amboise got before she had to go out there and dance her heart out. In front of a real audience. Hundreds of people with high expectations and newly incurred credit card debt. As the replacement for Karen Ziemba in ``Contact,'' the Tony-winning musical, she was entitled to only one rehearsal with the entire ensemble of dancers and actors, around whom she would have to leap and pirouette eight times a week. Starting here, starting now. Occasionally, new blood can totally transform a show: look at what Reba McEntire did for ``Annie Get Your Gun.'' And frequently, a fresh face invigorates a tired cast that may have entered the zombie phase of its performance cycle. By Peter Marks.  With photo.  IMPRESSIONIST-STILL-LIFE (Washington) _ There's absolutely nothing still about a good still-life painting. And because a high number of the 90 works in ``Impressionist Still Life'' at the Phillips Collection here are exceptionally good to outright great, a show that doesn't promise much on paper feels very active, very alive.

INTERNATIONAL (i)  ATTACK-MADRASSAS (Peshawar, Pakistan) _ Pakistan, ever more wary of  the brand of Islamic fundamentalism it has bred, is cracking down on  madrassas, trying to expel all foreign students and trying to control  the curriculum.

By Elizabeth Neuffer. 950 words.  ATTACK-AID (Khoja Ghar District, Afghanistan) _ A few weeks ago,  food packets were falling from the sky. Now it's parkas, hats, gloves,  blankets and sleeping bags.

BEDFORD-TEENS (Undated) _ For most parents of teenagers, the  revelations early this week about a Columbine-esque plot at New Bedford  High School boil down to a simple yet heart-wrenching question: What  about my child? Is he or she somehow on a trajectory that could lead to  a catastrophic conclusion? By Barbara Meltz. 1050 words.  HOMESTYLE (l)  GARDEN-COLUMN (Apopka, Fla.) _ When people think of Florida farming,  they think of oranges. In Apopka, however, the cash crop is houseplants  _ millions of them.

By Royal Ford. 860 words.  ENTERTAINMENT/ARTS (e)  MUSIC-JUNOON _ Death threats and phone taps are hardly a concern for  most rock bands, but Junoon has dealt with these adversities for years.  Known as the ``U2 of Pakistan,'' Junoon imparts messages of peace and  tolerance in a country where rock music has been frowned upon and  ``where religious extremism and terror are in your face,'' says the  band's founder, Salman Ahmad. By Steve Morse. 680 words.  ARCHITECT-KHAN (Undated) -  Can architecture be a way of bridging  the gap between Western and Islamic cultures? For most of us, the need  to build that bridge is something we've only recently become aware of.  But someone who has long been trying is the Aga Khan. By Robert  Campbell. 910 words.  COMPUTERS (a)  COMPUTERS-COLUMN (Undated) _ In these perilous times, I'm glad the  FBI is hard at work on new technologies to outwit terrorists and  criminals. And while it's good to see corporate America rallying around  to help, there's such a thing as being too supportive. By Hiawatha Bray.  810 words.  FINANCIAL (f)  ONBUSINESS-COLUMN (Undated) _  If you came into this year counting  on the nation's economic forecasters to warn you about the coming  recession, you would be very disappointed.

SPORTS (s)  SKI-OLYMPICS (Undated)  - When the US Alpine Ski Team clicks in for  action eight weeks from now in Utah, legitimate Olympic medal hopes will  be riding on two young skiers as familiar with Sugarloaf's Narrow Gauge  as most people are with walking through their living rooms: Kirsten  Clark and Bode Miller.

, they say,	 No longer are parents distancing themselves from such events, saying  ``It couldn't happen here.'' Instead, both they _ and their children _believe it could happen  anywhere. The lethal ingredients, they say, exist in many households  throughout the country: unsupervised, bored teens  desensitized to  violence, whose troubles somehow fall beneath parental radar. And though  school security has been beefed up at many places in recent years, the  number of programs to treat troubled teens  has decreased. </P> 	nyt_eng_200111.gz
, she says,	 And at a time when mental health problems are increasing among  children, she says, the number of programs for them has declined.    ``What the schools did was increase security, but not mental health  programs, especially early intervention. So we shouldn't be surprised  when these things happen,'' says Gorman, who has lobbied the state  legislature, in vain, for more mental health funding for children and  teens. </P> 	nyt_eng_200111.gz

If his company starts working hand-in-glove with American cops, he asks, what will he do when the government of Germany or Greece asks for a similar favor?

FEATURES  MOVIES-TRAVOLTA (Los Angeles) _ Another in the series ``Watching Movies With'': John Travolta sat quietly in a square, well-cushioned chair along the back wall of his home screening room. He had just finished watching ``Yankee Doodle Dandy,'' a glossy Warner Brothers bio-pic about the legendary George M. Cohan, a movie that's been dear to him since he was a little boy in New Jersey dreaming about a life on the stage. Travolta rubbed his eyes. Yes, he had been crying; there was no use denying it. He nodded sheepishly. The movie that had meant so much to him as a boy, he discovered, still had the power to reach into his heart. And now, in the wake of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, what had once seemed corny, flag-waving jingoism in the screen saga of the man who wrote ``You're a Grand Old Flag'' and ``Over There'' instead came across as almost eerily in touch with the current national mood. By Rick Lyman.  BROADWAY-REPLACEMENT (New York) _ The wig was loose. The dress was tight. The lift was botched. The turn was late. Well, that's what rehearsing is for, isn't it? Oops, no, sorry. That's the other show business. This was the one where time is money, where an actress and dancer of the caliber of Charlotte d'Amboise was supposed to get it right the first time. One full run-through with the cast _ the put-in, they call it _ was all d'Amboise got before she had to go out there and dance her heart out. In front of a real audience. Hundreds of people with high expectations and newly incurred credit card debt. As the replacement for Karen Ziemba in ``Contact,'' the Tony-winning musical, she was entitled to only one rehearsal with the entire ensemble of dancers and actors, around whom she would have to leap and pirouette eight times a week. Starting here, starting now. Occasionally, new blood can totally transform a show: look at what Reba McEntire did for ``Annie Get Your Gun.'' And frequently, a fresh face invigorates a tired cast that may have entered the zombie phase of its performance cycle. By Peter Marks.  IMPRESSIONIST-STILL-LIFE (Washington) _ There's absolutely nothing still about a good still-life painting. And because a high number of the 90 works in ``Impressionist Still Life'' at the Phillips Collection here are exceptionally good to outright great, a show that doesn't promise much on paper feels very active, very alive.

, it seems,	 Making a Christmas movie just to fill the holiday schedule isn't the best reason to do a film, either. Garth Brooks and his business partner, Lisa Sanderson, no doubt had good intentions when they persuaded Whoopi Goldberg to sign on with ``Call Me Claus, airing Sunday on TNT. The story is a cute one: Santa Claus, it seems, faces a term limit. After 200 years on the job, he must find a successor. He picks Lucy Cullins, a producer at a home-shopping channel who firmly embraced the Christmas spirit as a child but has a hard time summoning a ho-ho-ho as an adult. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"102142"	"I"	"guess"	" ``It came from a feeling, I guess, that we can't control the situation and that we should do our best to keep a positive outlook,'' Stabenow said. ``We've had some incredibly serious and stressful issues in front of us, and it was a way to bring back some levity.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"102298"	"I"	"guess"	" ``What has happened with the current situation with what the world's going through, with what the United States is going through people, I guess, are staying close to family until they see how it plays out,'' he said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"102311"	"I"	"guess"	" ``Air Force is a good club, I guess,'' Carroll said. ``With all the bowl hype and guys getting suspended, it could have been difficult (for Utah) to hold the focus you would like for the game.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"102421"	"I"	"guess"	" ``We've talked before that we'll increase the numbers in areas to fulfill a mission requirement, and shrink it in others,'' Stufflebeem said when asked if the Marine force would continue to grow. ``And so we'll continue to be agile, I guess, is maybe a word to put, and not become predictable in that.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"102539"	"I"	"guess"	" ``It does, I guess,'' Adams said. ``But the last couple of years, the way I was treated with arbitration and stuff, it really isn't (surprising). But they haven't called me. I don't even receive a phone call. That's strange.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"102649"	"I"	"guess"	" I do not understand how this thing works. I got the pants on, the jacket, the tummy stuffing and the hat. But the beard is too big, I guess, and it keeps falling off my chin. Plus, it kinda smells funny. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"102668"	"I"	"guess"	" Phillips has considered options like Todd Zeile, Jay Payton, Tsuyoshi Shinjo and Justice for the No. 5 spot in the lineup. ``I think Justice can do it, or maybe Zeile against lefties,'' Phillips said. ``Payton and Shinjo, I guess, could do it.

"102907"	"I"	"guess"	" ``Yes, I do question these people who call these numbers wrong,'' Selig said. ``I'm just, I guess, disappointed at anything else that people don't understand. I believe that these numbers are real, and our bankers believe they're real. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"

"104275"	"I"	"guess"	" ``The Bully'' (Unrated; debuts Tuesday) _ Larry Clark's newest dismal attempt at ``provocative'' filmmaking. Based on the true story of a 1993 murder in Florida, it poses as an honest, raw, unflinching exploration of alienated middle-class white teenagers. It's lurching, sloppy and unfocused. Clark made his name in 1995 with ``Kids,'' a pseudo-searing look at dead-end kids in New York who do ``it'' a lot. Well, surprise _ the kids in ``Bully'' do it a lot, too! Almost every conversation takes place while they're naked or having sex or groping each other with Clark's camera up someone's bluejeaned crotch. It would be pornographic, I guess, if it weren't so darn silly. Grade: D- </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"104785"	"I"	"guess"	" ``It's a hot potato,'' said Arthur W. Bowman, editor of Bowman's Accounting Report. ``The risk, I guess, is still high, but you would think that whatever results would fall on Andersen's shoulders. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"105633"	"I"	"guess"	" Today just three companies in the United States still make and sell punch cards. ``I'm one of the last of the Mohicans, I guess,'' said Bob Oliver of National Card West in Long Beach, Calif. His company sells 100 million punch cards a year, mostly to racetracks in California and sports betting operations in Las Vegas that use them as betting slips. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"105746"	"I"	"guess"	" ``Dad, he's my Pops, I guess,'' Apolo said. ``He and I are closer than ever now. When I was younger, I would never have dreamt it would be that way. For my dad to support me he pretty much had to work all the time. I'd come home at 2:30 in the afternoon, make supper and go to bed before he even got home. It was pretty much that way since I was 8 years old.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"106705"	"I"	"guess"	" ``A teacher in my area of expertise was a pitching coach, so that was always a goal, I guess,'' Colborn, 55, said. ``I was not looking to change jobs. That department (in Seattle) was just starting to blossom, being a real force in a lot of countries, and I was getting a good network of support. But to have an offer at the major-league level -- I didn't think I'd ever have a chance. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"106944"	"I"	"guess"	" ``In the early '90s, I guess, I was doing a reading from ``many things have happened,'' and I read something I thought was maybe a little funny and everybody laughed,'' she recalls. ``Before that, in my whole life I don't remember saying something funny to make people laugh. It was something I didn't think I was supposed to do.'' ___ </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"107106"	"I"	"guess"	" I don't believe that I know yet what the conceptual answers are for ``Company.'' The energy will be different, I guess, from the original because you can't do something from the '60s, early '70s, in the year 2002 without the knowledge we have. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"108031"	"I"	"guess"	" ``It beats being out on the street, I guess,'' she says, resigned. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"108452"	"I"	"guess"	" ``I felt so lucky and blessed that those things came in. It was kind of unbelievable. I wasn't even thinking about `Mulholland Drive,' then _ bango! _ the door opened and there they were.'' That, I guess, is how Lynch's hillside compound is designed to work: if you're set up right, you're always home when epiphanies come calling. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"109035"	"I"	"guess"	" ``The last couple of days it wasn't like the first night,'' said military police Sergeant Donald Wilcox, 29. ``Those guys, I guess, bugged out.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"109606"	"I"	"guess"	" ``I envisioned that,'' Eisner said, ``and unfortunately, I guess, for us, that is what happened.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"109827"	"I"	"guess"	" ``The changes are a good thing for everyone, but it is going to take some time to see where it takes us as a culture,'' she added. ``But the old stage sets need to put away. . . . The rural setting is now urban; instead of being oppressed, we are oppressing each other; where there was failure, now there is success and expectation of success; where there was poverty, now there is wealth . . .

"111929"	"I"	"guess"	" ``It was just some kind of equipment failure inside the engine,'' he said. ``We had a top-five race car without a doubt.

"112558"	"I"	"guess"	" I was, I guess, a bit obnoxious about it, ostentatiously turning down desserts at friends' houses and preaching my new religion.

"113193"	"I"	"guess"	" ``I think he is a general in rehabilitation or, I guess, an American who is being rehabilitated,'' said James Kirby Martin, a history professor at the University of Houston and author of a book about Arnold. ``I think we are learning that the Revolution isn't the simplistic contest between good and evil that we were perhaps taught when we were schoolchildren, that indeed it was far more complex than that, and not all the good people were on one side and the bad people on the other side.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"113378"	"I"	"guess"	" ``My books aren't only about Lyndon Johnson,'' Caro insists. ``I was never interested in just writing the biography of some great man. I want to use Johnson to demonstrate certain aspects of history, and, more importantly, of types of political power, how that is gained and used. So the first volume is really about rural political power, and the second, I guess, is about a stolen election. But ``Master of the Senate'' is about Johnson's genius to create power where none existed before, how a great reader of men demonstrated unparalleled ability to eventually control a body designed ``not'' to be controlled by one man.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"113588"	"I"	"guess"	" Clearly Bouder has achieved that, and extending her career into something even more spectacular and lasting is largely in her control. ``I'm just trying to work my way up, I guess,'' she said. ``But every time I think that I am gaining something, I look at Miranda Weese and Wendy Whelan and realize I'm that much further back.'' Weese and Whelan are City Ballet principal dancers. ``Still,'' Bouder added, ``I'm not giving up.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"

"119092"	"I"	"guess"	" Parker has made a mistake, too. While he clearly feels an affinity for the material, he tricks it up with too many distractions. What was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical, with an added-on final twist that seems more like something from ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' or ``The Hidden'' than anything Melville ever wrote. Sometimes, I guess, a film _ or a filmmaker _ can just try too hard. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"

"125650"	"I"	"guess"	" A terrific ensemble cast _ Anthony LaPaglia, Poppy Montgomery, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Eric Close, Enrique Murciano _ lifts this series above the mediocre, but maybe not far enough. The show, a procedural drama along the lines of ``Law &amp; Order'' and ``CSI,'' tracks the workings of the FBI's Missing Persons Squad. The pilot hooked me with its early use of a clock; cases not solved within a certain time are usually not solved. But late in the pilot, the clock became a nonfactor, which annoyed me. (I'll get over it.) I became further annoyed when I tried to think of something original for future story lines. That's why they pay the producers the big bucks, I guess, but I'm skeptical.

Furthermore, he said, the concerns about Saddam's nuclear capabilities followed the tenor of the intelligence we had been hearing for some time. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, they concluded,	 But at the start of the Bush administration, the intelligence agencies also agreed that Iraq had not in fact resumed its nuclear weapons program. Iraq's nuclear infrastructure, they concluded, had been dismantled by sanctions and inspections. In short, Saddam's nuclear ambitions appear to have been contained. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, they reported,	 It turned out, they reported, that Iraq had for years used high-strength aluminum tubes to make combustion chambers for slim rockets fired from launcher pods. Back in 1996, inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency had even examined some of these tubes, also made of 7075-T6 aluminum, at a military complex, the Nasser metal fabrication plant in Baghdad, where the Iraqis acknowledged making rockets. According to the international agency, the rocket tubes, some 66,000 of them, were 900 millimeters in length, with a diameter of 81 millimeters and walls 3.3 millimeters thick. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, they conceded,	 Joe and his WINPAC colleagues at the CIA were not persuaded. Yes, they conceded, the tubes could be used as rocket casings. But this made no sense, they argued in a new report, because Iraq wanted tubes made at tolerances that far exceed any known conventional weapons. In other words, Iraq was demanding a level of precision craftsmanship unnecessary for ordinary mass-produced rockets. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, they noted,	 By year's end, Energy Department analysts published a classified report that even more firmly rejected the theory that the tubes could work as rotors in a 1950s Zippe centrifuge. These particular Zippe centrifuges, they noted, were especially ill suited for bomb making. They were a prototype designed for laboratory experiments, operating as single units. To produce enough enriched uranium to make just one bomb a year, Iraq would need up to 16,000 of them working in concert, a challenge for even the most sophisticated centrifuge plants. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, they insist,	 Not so, agency officials said. In July 2002, they insist, they were the first intelligence agency to seek JAEIC's intervention.

, he argued,	 Warning against wishful thinking or willful blindness, Cheney used the speech to lay out a rationale for pre-emptive action against Iraq. Simply resuming U.N. inspections, he argued, could give false comfort that Saddam was contained. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, they argued,	 A week later President Bush announced that he would ask Congress for authorization to oust Saddam. He also met that day with senior members of the House and Senate, some of whom expressed concern that the administration had yet to show the American people tangible evidence of an imminent threat. The fact that Saddam gassed his own people in the 1980s, they argued, was not sufficient evidence of a threat to the United States in 2002. New intelligence was needed, lawmakers in both parties warned. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, he said,	 The White House did much to increase the impact of The Times' article. The morning the article was published, Cheney went on the NBC News program Meet the Press and confirmed when asked that the tubes were the most alarming evidence behind the administration's view that Iraq had resumed its nuclear weapons program. The tubes, he said, had raised our level of concern. Rice, the national security adviser, went on CNN the same day and said the tubes are only really suited for nuclear weapons programs. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, they said,	 On Dec. 7, 2002, Iraq submitted a 12,200-page declaration about unconventional arms to the United Nations that made no mention of the tubes. Soon after, WINPAC analysts at the CIA assessed the declaration for President Bush. The analysts criticized Iraq for failing to acknowledge or explain why it sought tubes we believe suitable for use in a gas centrifuge uranium effort. Nor, they said, did it acknowledge efforts to procure uranium from Niger. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz
, they said,	 Intelligence analysts at the State Department waged a quiet battle against much of the proposed language on tubes. A year before, they had sent Powell a report explaining why they believed the tubes were more likely for rockets. The National Intelligence Estimate included their dissent -- that they saw no compelling evidence of a comprehensive effort to revive a nuclear weapons program. Now, in the days before the Security Council speech, they sent the secretary detailed memos warning him away from a long list of assertions in the drafts, the Intelligence Committee found. The language on the tubes, they said, contained egregious errors and highly misleading claims. Changes were made, language softened. The line about the mere pressure of my hand, for instance, was removed. </P> 	nyt_eng_200410.gz

As travelers in ever-greater numbers pack Denver International Airport, while security measures remain heightened, the sprawling white-tented compound on the prairie has become a grand stage for the practice of passing time. (July was the busiest month on record for DIA, logging a little more than 4 million passengers.)  People flop on the floor and listen to music through earphones, their eyes closed. They hunch over paperbacks, tap on keyboards, yap into cellphones, watch CNN and stare into some middle distance where they observe nothing but the fuzzy thoughts in their frazzled heads.

They arrive early to prepare for the odyssey through the security hive, and then they sit on molded-plastic seats for an hour or two.  If you're at DIA and you've got time (face it, you do), you've also got options.  First, you need to understand the logic of the place. There's the big terminal,with its two-story density of amenities, and there's three concourses, lined up and parallel to one another, like tines on a fork: A, B and C. Concourse B dwarfs the others. Concourse C is the smallest. Once you submit to the security gantlet, you're free to roam.  In the terminal: Start with a cappuccino from Brew Mountain ExpressO. With its unctuous cap of foam and espresso bitterness, Brew Mountain's cappuccino beat those from four other shops, all of which were milky and weak.  You should nibble on chocolate between sips of cappuccino, and the terminal houses the best of the two fancy chocolate shops at DIA. Both Stephany's Chocolates and the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory maintain outposts, with Stephany's in the terminal and Rocky Mountain in Concourse B. We taste-tested truffles from both. Rocky Mountain's were a good deal larger -- like golf balls to Stephany's kumquats -- but lacking in nuance. Stephany's chocolate mousse truffle especially thrilled.  Enjoy your dark treats in the padded chairs on the east side of the terminal, facing a wall of windows overlooking the airport and surrounded by tall potted plants. It's relatively peaceful there.

That Super Bowl was about winning an NFL championship. Sunday's game was about the return of John Lynch.  I'm just glad I didn't walk into the wrong locker room when I came in, or walk out to the wrong sideline, said Lynch, who got a long standing ovation after his pre-game introduction.  A blunder by the 33-year-old Lynch enabled the Bucs to score their only touchdown and turned the momentum in Tampa Bay's favor.  Denver led, 10-0, early in the second quarter when Brad Johnson threw deep to Michael Clayton. The Bucs receiver fell down while making the catch at the Bronco 20-yard line, but got up before Lynch came over to touch him down. Lynch had a free shot at Clayton but merely tapped him, assuming he was down. Clayton got up and ran for a touchdown that got the Bucs back in the game.  Lynch was fined for a hit he delivered on a Kansas City player three weeks ago.  Ultimately, the responsibility is on me there and I have to tackle him, I guess, Lynch said. But there is a new league emphasis that if you hit them while they're lying down, you will be penalized 15 yards.  I asked the referee: 'Would you have given me a 15-yard penalty if I hit him when he was down?' He said yes. So from now on, I guess I'll just take the 15-yard penalty.  Lynch came back to make a big play for the Broncos late in the third quarter. The Bucs had tied it, 13-13, and faced third down with less than a yard to go at their 44. Mike Alsott got the call, but Lynch blitzed and nailed him for a two-yard loss, forcing the Bucs to punt.  That's one of my best friends in this world, Lynch said of Alsott. I've never had an opportunity to tackle him, but (defensive coordinator Larrry Coyle) made the call. Mike's a tough guy to bring down, and I know why people have been bouncing off him so many years.  For the Bucs on that play, there were too many people to block.  Lynch has seen that a few times before from the other side of the field. This time he enjoyed it more.

Oh my God, I can't wait to see her. Is she going to sing? Trevi's scandals were astonishing: She'd landed on Mexico's Most Wanted list; hidden a dead infant which has never been found; eluded Interpol for more than a year; slipped in and out of at least three countries without detection; ignited a prison scandal in Brazil by, according to investigators, impregnating herself with a syringe smuggled from a Brazilian druglord as part of a plot to avoid extradition to Mexico; and allegedly helped mastermind a secret cult. So what's an award director to do? Even though Trevi was one of Mexico's most famous singers, she wasn't on the ballot. Her unexpected acquittal on Sept. 21 shocked even Trevi. Now that she was out, how could she get an award without any votes? Simple -- Medina made one up. He announced that Gloria would receive the first ever Soul of the People Award.

, he sensed,	 ALEXANDER-BATTLE-SCENE (Undated) -- Last year, the Oxford University historian Robin Lane Fox, the author of a much-admired 1973 biography of Alexander the Great, found himself astride a horse, carrying a wooden lance, thundering through the desert dust with scores of mounted companions as Alexander's greatest conquest unfolded. The setting was an uninhabited stretch of Morocco -- far from the Persian village of Gaugamela in present-day Iraq, where the historic battle occurred in 331 B.C. And the messianic warrior Fox followed wasn't the 25-year-old Alexander but the actor Colin Farrell, who plays the lead in Oliver Stone's Alexander, which has its premiere on Nov. 24. Fox, after decades of researching often-incomplete texts about Alexander's time, was now empirically testing history. Yes, he sensed, you could charge with a lance without using stirrups. No, his body told him, you couldn't carry a shield in your other arm while riding. And what of the popular notion that Alexander guided his soldiers with battlefield commands? That, too, felt hollow in the noisy rattle of battle Historical films routinely reinterpret or simply trash history. Indeed, Stone is a pariah in some quarters for his conspiratorial assertions in J.F.K. and Nixon. But the filming of the Battle of Gaugamela appears to have been a more complex experience, one in which there was often no historical consensus, forcing Stone and his consultants to extrapolate their grand movie reality around an earnest synthesis of the authentic and the plausible, with at least a small dollop of the merely cool.

Only days from staging the Latin People's Choice Awards ( El Premio de la Gente) in Los Angeles, he said, Hundreds of people were calling and asking 'Is Gloria going to be there? Oh my God, I can't wait to see her. Is she going to sing? Trevi's scandals were astonishing: She'd landed on Mexico's Most Wanted list; hidden a dead infant which has never been found; eluded Interpol for more than a year; slipped in and out of at least three countries without detection; ignited a prison scandal in Brazil by, according to investigators, impregnating herself with a syringe smuggled from a Brazilian druglord as part of a plot to avoid extradition to Mexico; and allegedly helped mastermind a secret cult. So what's an award director to do? Even though Trevi was one of Mexico's most famous singers, she wasn't on the ballot. Her unexpected acquittal on Sept. 21 shocked even Trevi. Now that she was out, how could she get an award without any votes? Simple -- Medina made one up. He announced that Gloria would receive the first ever Soul of the People Award.

, he sensed,	 ALEXANDER-BATTLE-SCENE (Undated) -- Last year, the Oxford University historian Robin Lane Fox, the author of a much-admired 1973 biography of Alexander the Great, found himself astride a horse, carrying a wooden lance, thundering through the desert dust with scores of mounted companions as Alexander's greatest conquest unfolded. The setting was an uninhabited stretch of Morocco -- far from the Persian village of Gaugamela in present-day Iraq, where the historic battle occurred in 331 B.C. And the messianic warrior Fox followed wasn't the 25-year-old Alexander but the actor Colin Farrell, who plays the lead in Oliver Stone's Alexander, which has its premiere on Nov. 24. Fox, after decades of researching often-incomplete texts about Alexander's time, was now empirically testing history. Yes, he sensed, you could charge with a lance without using stirrups. No, his body told him, you couldn't carry a shield in your other arm while riding. And what of the popular notion that Alexander guided his soldiers with battlefield commands? That, too, felt hollow in the noisy rattle of battle Historical films routinely reinterpret or simply trash history. Indeed, Stone is a pariah in some quarters for his conspiratorial assertions in J.F.K. and Nixon. But the filming of the Battle of Gaugamela appears to have been a more complex experience, one in which there was often no historical consensus, forcing Stone and his consultants to extrapolate their grand movie reality around an earnest synthesis of the authentic and the plausible, with at least a small dollop of the merely cool.

, he said,	 Mark Rodgers, a spokesman for Cape Wind, said the company must still raise the capital needed to build the project. But if all goes well, he said, the plant could be producing power as early as 2007. The power would go into the regional grid, not precisely to Cape Cod and the islands, he said. But on a day with average wind, it would produce about 420 megawatts -- three-fourths of average electricity needs for the local area. </P> 	nyt_eng_200411.gz
, she said,	 Adams and the project's supporters dismiss that criticism. The corps requires applicants to pay for studies of their proposals, she said, because it would not be right for taxpayers to pay for them.

He said photo simulations of what the wind farm will look like from shore -- it will be 4.7 miles away at its closest point -- assume the clearest of weather conditions. Often, he said, the distant view from shore is obscured by haze, so the turbines would not be so obvious. </P> 	nyt_eng_200411.gz

Jorge Posada hasn't caught the Big Unit in either of his last two starts, yielding to John Flaherty, and Flaherty felt compelled to visit the mound during Johnson's last start when it appeared the Unit was gesturing unhappily over Flaherty's pitch-calling. He didn't call me out, Flaherty said. I went out to find out what was going on. He made some animated gestures about, I guess, in and out.

Its idea of a joke is to repeat the phrase blunt testicular trauma four or five times in a single scene. Some of the characters, notably Sarah's father (Richard Jenkins) and her younger sister (Mena Suvari), begin as easy targets for tired satire and then turn nice and soft.

The emergence of Tom Brokaw's replacement, Brian Williams (and his popular blog), has shown that viewers will try something new. ABC is revamping its World News Tonight early next month, replacing the late Peter Jennings with Elizabeth Vargas and Bob Woodruff, and has continued Nightline instead of canceling it after the departure of anchor Ted Koppel. CBS has not moved quickly to fill Dan Rather's chair, but network head Les Moonves has said all the right things about the state of network news. It's still important, he said, but the bigs can't take anything for granted. For viewers, that's refreshing and promising. This could get interesting. </P> 	nyt_eng_200512.gz

SCI-CANCER-GENETICS (Undated) -- To their own amazement, scientists are now finding that untangling the genetics of cancer is, if not within reach, within possibility. In fact, they say, what looked like an impenetrable shield protecting cancer cells turns out to be little more than a flimsy cloak. And those seemingly impervious cancer cells are very much poised to die. Preventing Cancer: The Promise of Genetics, part of a series.  SCI-EINSTEIN-QUANTUM-PHYSICS (Undated) -- Albert Einstein, in 1935, dreamed up a trick of synchronized atoms -- spooky action at a distance, as he called it -- as an example of the absurdity of quantum mechanics. Today that paper, written when Einstein was a relatively ancient 56 years old, is the most cited of Einstein's papers. But far from demolishing quantum theory, that paper wound up as the cornerstone for the new field of quantum information. Nary a week goes by that does not bring news of another feat of quantum trickery once only dreamed of in thought experiments: particles (or at least all their properties) being teleported across the room in a microscopic version of Star Trek beaming; electrical cat currents that circle a loop in opposite directions at the same time. At the University of California, Santa Barbara, researchers are planning an experiment in which a small mirror will be in two different places at once. By Dennis Overbye.  SCI-PSYCHOTHERAPY (Anaheim, Calif.) -- In mid-December, 9,000 psychologists, social workers and students, along with many of the world's most celebrated living therapists, attended a landmark meeting to consider the state of psychotherapy, its current challenges and its future. Although the participants agreed it was a time for bold action, psychotherapists are deeply divided over whether that action should be guided by the cool logic of science or a spirit of humanistic activism. The answer will determine not only what psychotherapy means, many experts said, but its place in the 21st century. By Benedict Carey.  SCI-GLOBAL-WARMING (Undated) -- Earth scientists with the longest frames of reference, particularly those whose specialties begin with the prefix paleo, often seem to be the least agitated about human-caused global warming. This has been true even in 2005, a year that saw the biggest summer retreat of Arctic sea ice ever measured, a new sign that warming seas are rising at an accelerating pace and global temperatures continuing a sharp climb that began around 1990 and appears unmatched in 2,000 years. But these backward-looking experts have seen it all before. In fact, the planet has nothing to worry about from global warming. A hot, steamy earth would be fine for most forms of life. Earth and its biological veneer are far more resilient than human societies, particularly those still mired in poverty or pushed to the margins of the livable. Only we humans have to be concerned, and species like polar bears that, like the poorest people, are pushed to an edge -- in the bear's case the tenuous ecosystem built around coastal sea ice. An essay by Andrew C. Revkin.  SCI-Q&amp;A (Undated) -- A science question answered: I never used to hear about peanut allergies, especially fatal ones. Is the number increasing? By C. Claiborne Ray.  SCI-NUKE-WASTE (Undated) -- Decades ago, when the future of nuclear power seemed boundless, scientists and engineers thought they had a ready solution to the problem of what to do with all the radioactive waste given off by power plants: reprocess it and put it back to work, either in those same plants or as material for atomic bombs. The idea never got off the ground in this country, in part because it proved too expensive. But now, as waste piles up at reactors around the country and other disposal options are vanishing, Congress is sending the Energy Department back to explore reprocessing once again. By Matthew L. Wald.  SCI-EVOLUTION-HUMOR (Undated) -- On Web sites, with games and in silly songs, scientists are advancing the idea that creationism and its doctrinal relative, intelligent design, are not just misguided -- they are laughably misguided. So with a majority of the public still in denial over evolution, scientists are turning to humor. Commentary, by Cornelia Dean.  SCI-WATCH (Undated) -- News and notes on science: Planting trees to absorb greenhouse gases may create more problems that it solves, researchers say. By Henry Fountain.  With  SCI-NAPOLEON-LICE (Undated) -- The 1812 invasion of Russia by Napoleon's Grand Army ranks as one of the worst military fiascoes of all time. Of half a million soldiers sent toward Moscow, only about 5 percent made it back. Now, researchers say that lice their disease-causing bacteria were part of the problem. A short, by Henry Fountain.  SCI-BIRTHING-BABIES (Undated) -- Reflecting on a holiday season as a medical student in 1955 when the babies would not stop coming, an aging physician reflects on the arrogance that at comes with helping to bring life into the world, then disappears with real responsibility. By Larry Zaroff.  SCI-DRUG-ABUSE (Undated) -- Howard Markel, M.D,. a doctor and drug counselor, writes of a new trend in drug abuse among juveniles: controlled prescription drugs, including potent opiate painkillers, tranquillizers and stimulants used to treat attention deficit disorders.  SCI-COLONOSCOPY-RISK (Undated) -- No one disputes that colonoscopies save lives. But recent research has prompted concern that in rare instances certain popular bowel-cleansing preparations that patients gulp down the day before a procedure can severely damage the kidneys.

OLY-SNOWBOARDING (Breckenridge, Colo.) -- Half-pipe snowboarding is the rare professional sport in which athletes perform to popular music and public address announcers narrate moves as they are being made. While competitors careen down the ramp, an on-site deejay spins hip-hop beats and an excitable announcer shouts the names of every different trick - Crippler! Stale Fish! Melon Poke! But there is one trick that needs no goofy name or hyperactive introduction. When the announcer relays it, his voice tends to drop by a decibel. Ten-eighty is all he needs to say. The 1080 is currently the most powerful move in snowboarding, a 1,080-degree spin that separates Olympic contenders from Olympic wannabes.

INTERNATIONAL (i code)  IRAQ (Baghdad, Iraq) -- Developments in the worst day of violence since the Dec. 15 election, with at least 20 people dead in bombings and shootings around the country. Also, voting tallies among members of the Iraqi security forces show almost exclusive support for Shiite and Kurdish candidates, confirming the virtual absence of Sunnis in their ranks. By Richard A.

Sharon, 77, suffered the stroke Dec. 18. Doctors said there was no permanent damage, and Sharon has returned to work. The prime minister's health problems have arisen as he seeks a third term in national elections that will take place on March 28. Opinion polls show his new centrist party, Kadima, remains heavily favored, despite his ailments. By Greg Myre.  RUSSIA-GAS (Moscow) -- The peak of the Russian holiday shopping was disrupted for a St. Petersburg retail chain Monday when two of its stores were struck by devices that emitted foul-smelling gas. At least 77 people were sickened by the odor, though none seriously, the authorities said. The police said the gas appeared to be a form of mercaptan, a group of malodorous compounds, often with an intense sulfuric smell, that includes a form commonly added to odorless natural gas to make fuel leaks detectable. The gas, while capable of producing an almost unbearable stink, is largely harmless, they said. The authorities ruled out terrorism. Instead, they attributed the attacks to the rough edges of Russian capitalism and gangsterism, saying the most likely motive was an effort to hurt the chain's sales on one of the most important shopping days of the year.

JAPAN-HEIR (Tokyo) -- Faced with the harsh reality that neither of the current Japanese emperor's two sons is likely to produce a male heir, a government panel recommended recently that the American-imposed Imperial Household Law of 1947 be revised to allow a female line to hold the throne. The possibility has ignited a furious debate over the most delicate of subjects -- the imperial system and its significance to Japan -- and over topics as varied as the status of Japanese women, the merits of the concubine system and the purity of the imperial Y chromosome.

It ranks dead last on the University of Michigan's listing of states with economic momentum; it has the third-worst unemployment rate in the country; it is 49th in personal income growth; and if you want to buy a big, fancy executive house in the Detroit suburbs right now you can pretty much name your price. That's the good news. The bad news is that the state is far from bottoming out, with job cuts at GM, Ford and bankrupt Delphi still to come. No wonder that the state's governor, Jennifer Granholm, is looking everywhere she can for jobs -- even to Toyota, who she is trying to lure to the state to build an engine plant. By Micheline Maynard.  PENTAGON-WEAPONS (Undated) -- A look at the Pentagon's new policies stressing fewer but more flexible and precise weapons and how defense contractors are reacting. By Leslie Wayne.  GAZPROM (Moscow) -- Last winter, the Kremlin-backed candidate in Ukraine's contested presidential election lost to Viktor A. Yushchenko, the pro-Western leader of the Orange Revolution. This winter, Russia is demanding a five-fold increase in the price of gas supplied to Ukraine, a change widely seen as payback for Moscow's embarrassment a year ago. At the center of this geopolitical game is Gazprom, Russia's natural gas monopoly, the country's largest company, producer of one-third of the world's natural gas, and a corporation aspiring to join the ranks of energy majors such as Exxon Mobile and BP, with the scope and bulk to operate worldwide. Still, the conflict with Ukraine - putting Gazprom in opposition to a pro-Western government in Eastern Europe -- could not have come at a better time for the company. By Andrew E. Kramer.  EU-CARTELS (Paris) -- Across Europe, formerly docile cartel authorities are cracking down on collusion in economically weighty sectors like telecommunications, construction and banking. The drive includes tougher investigations at both the national level and Europewide as well as fines that are nearing 1 billion euros. By James Kanter.  ESTONIA-PORT (Sillamae, Estonia) -- In the early 1960s, the Kremlin ordered the Soviet military to blow up the port of Sillamae to prevent enemy ships from infiltrating this sleepy industrial town of 18,500 where uranium was enriched to build nuclear bombs during the Cold War. Now, Tiit Vahi, a former Estonian prime minister and a leader of the country's revolution against Soviet rule, wants to lure the ships back. His aim is no less than transforming a place once nicknamed Uranium Lake into a bustling commercial port that will allow new EU member Estonia to serve as a bridge between east and west and shake up European trade. By Dan Bilefsky.  Itineraries (aka Business Travel)  BIZ-TRAVEL-OUTLOOK (Undaetd) -- A look at the year ahead -- and how much more unpleasant business travel is going to become. By Chritsopher Elliott.  BIZ-TRAVEL-ROAD (Undated) -- The weekly Business Travel column: A look at what to expect at the checkpoint next year, including more registered-travel options, and more random pat-downs.

CULTURE AND ENTERTAINMENT (e code)  RECORDING-INDUSTRY (Los Angeles) -- Even as the recording industry staggers through another year of declining sales over all, there are new signs that a democratization of music made possible by the Internet is shifting the industry's balance of power. Exploiting online message boards, music blogs and social networks, independent music companies are making big advances at the expense of the four global music conglomerates, whose established business model of blockbuster hits promoted through radio airplay now looks increasingly outdated.

MINN-RECRUIT (Duluth, Minn.) -- As those thinking of becoming soldiers arrive on the slushy doorstep of the Army recruiting station here, they cannot miss the message posted in bold black letters on the storefront right next door. Remember the Fallen Heroes, the sign reads, and then it ticks off numbers -- the number of American troops killed in Iraq, the number wounded, the number of days gone by since this war began. The sign, put up by a former soldier, has stirred intense, though always polite, debate in this city along the edge of Lake Superior. In a way, many of the nation's complicated, vast arguments about war are playing out on a single block here, around a simple piece of wood. In this Northeastern Minnesota Army station, the seven military recruiters, six of whom have themselves served in Iraq, want the sign taken away. But Scott Cameron, a local man who was wounded during the Vietnam War, says his sign should remain. A journal by Monica Davey.  With photo.  NEW-ORLEANS-SUICIDES (New Orleans) -- Mental health professionals say this city appears to be experiencing a sharp increase in suicides in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and interviews and statistics suggest that the rate has shot up to several times the national and local averages. By Adam Nossiter.  With photo.  TEXAS-CONSERVE (Liberty Hill, Texas) -- Young cedar trees in the Texas hill country are obstructive, brambly knots of vegetation. Older ones guzzle scarce moisture. When they are really mature, the golden-cheeked warbler, a songbird in danger of extinction, sometimes move in. Then in the early 1990s, the Interior Department set out to conserve cedar by buying -- or condemning -- cedar-covered land to protect the warbler. There were protests on the capitol steps in Austin. The effort stalled. More than decade later, in a cultural and political turnabout, people like Kerry Russell, a lawyer, rancher and lifelong resident of the area, have largely bought into a conservation program called Safe Harbor that combines federal and state incentives with flexibility for landowners, who can participate by committing land to conservation purposes forever, or for as little as 10 years.

EXP-RUSSIA-GAS (Moscow) -- The peak of the Russian holiday shopping was disrupted for a St. Petersburg retail chain Monday when two of its stores were struck by devices that emitted foul-smelling gas.

TOP  Lede story (1-col. hed):  IRAQ (Baghdad, Iraq) -- Voting results released on Monday from the recent parliamentary election suggest that in contrast to the remarkable surge in Sunni Arab participation in the political process, the Sunnis still have comparatively little representation in the Iraqi security forces. The voting results are a sign of how complete the reversal of fortunes has been for the Sunnis, who ran the security forces under Saddam Hussein. By Richard A.

FOLD  STORMS-RELOCATE (Grand Chenier, La.) -- Cameron Parish, where generations of Cajuns have hunted ducks and pulled up redfish, lost 400 people to Hurricane Audrey in 1957. This fall, when Hurricane Rita destroyed thousands of structures and flattened the coastline, some state officials had had enough. Now Louisiana planners are proposing an idea that would have been unimaginable here a few months ago: moving an entire string of seaside towns and villages -- and the thousands of longtime residents who live in them -- 15 or 20 miles inland to higher and presumably safer ground.

Taking Israel as its model, Ghana hopes to persuade the descendants of African slaves to think of Africa as their homeland, to visit Ghana, invest in it, send their children to be educated there and even retire there.

AUSTRIA-SCHWARZENEGGER (Berlin) -- For years, the quaint Austrian town of Graz trumpeted its special relationship with its outsize native son, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Most conspicuously, the local sports stadium was named after him. But early on Monday, under cover of darkness, Schwarzenegger's name was removed from the arena in a sort of uncontested divorce between Schwarzenegger and the town council, which had been horrified that Schwarzenegger rejected pleas to spare the life of Stanley Tookie Williams, who was executed two weeks ago.

RECORDING-INDUSTRY (Los Angeles) -- Even as the recording industry staggers through another year of declining sales overall, there are new signs that a democratization of music made possible by the Internet is shifting the industry's balance of power.

The world would observe, and judge, two competing and contrasting social systems. For Gaddis, innumerable private perceptions and moral decisions did as much to dissolve the Cold War consensus as international treaties or macroecomonic trends.

By passing a law saying the United States will defend Taiwan if it is attacked, for example, Congress gives future administrations less flexibility in dealing with a crisis, but the threat makes an attack less likely.

, she says,	 On July 30, 1960, Larsen (The White) sat in a taxi outside an Iowa convent and smoked one last cigarette before going inside to begin the process of becoming a nun. She was 19. She and other postulants were welcomed, then assigned beds, places at the table, seats in chapel. It seemed, she says, like summer camp. Five years later, she decided not to take her final vows, but her time in the convent had transformed her into a woman who was strong enough to leave it. This lovely and affectionate memoir reflects the allure of religious life in an era when girls read Kathryn Hulme's novel The Nun's Story and saw themselves in it. Writing in short sections with headings (Black Becomes Us, Custody of the Eyes, A Grapefruit Incident), Larsen creates a vivid picture of those years, from the clothes she wore to her longing for cigarettes (she gave the last of hers to the cabbie) to the comforting presence of her fellow postulants.

, he said,	 Five-month-old Noor al Zahra of Iraq may leave the hospital today after doctors drained fluid from around her brain on Friday. Dr. Roger Hudgins, chief nuerosurgeon at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, inserted a flexible tube, or shunt, to drain fluid from her head to her abdomen, where it will be absorbed. This is the operation we've been hoping to avoid, he said. The surgery does not change her long-term prognosis - Hudgins expects her to grow up healthy but paralyzed from the waist down - but he said it does delay her scheduled return to Iraq for at least two months. Hudgins said shunts like Noor's clog in 30 to 40 percent of cases. If that happens with Noor, he said, doctors would schedule a second operation to clear it. Doctors may also operate if they detect a buildup of fluid in her brain, as opposed to adjacent to her brain, which is what triggered Friday's surgery. Noor, her father and grandmother have been in metro Atlanta since Dec. 31, brought here from a slum near Baghdad after Georgia-based National Guard soldiers with the 48th Brigade Combat Team encountered the baby while raiding a house. Noor suffers from a severe form of spina bifida in which her spine did not fully form. Doctors in Iraq told her family they could not treat Noor. Members of a unit based in Gainesville made connections that led to Childspring International, a Christian charity in Atlanta that brings sick children from abroad to the United States for medical treatment. Childspring brought Noor to Georgia and matched the baby and her father and grandmother with a host family. Hudgins operated on Jan. 9 to repair Noor's back. He had expected to insert a shunt shortly after that surgery, but did not find a fluid buildup until a few days ago. Helen Shepard, a Childspring spokeswoman, said Noor's father and grandmother were encouraged when doctors said initially that she would not need a shunt and that they are grateful for all the help they have received. It's been an emotional week for the family, she said. Hudgins said he expects to evaluate Noor again on March 21, one of several visits during which doctors will perform a brain scan to check for signs of a fluid accumulation. Noor continues to wear a pink cast, put on to protect her left foot after surgery that will permit her to wear shoes. Doctors expect her to wear a splint for two months after the cast is removed, which could happen soon. When she returns to Iraq, Noor will need access to a neurosurgeon in case the shunt clogs - it's inside her body, but headaches, vomiting and sleepiness could signal a problem, Hudgins said. In addition, she will need to visit a urologist occasionally to ensure proper bladder function, which can be a problem in some spina bifida cases but has not been so far with Noor. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz

They tried to make a federal case against him in 1992 for plotting the killing through interstate telephone calls. The federal case was dismissed midtrial. In 1994 the McClintons won a $4 million civil judgment against Sullivan for the wrongful death of their daughter. Civil court cases have a lower standard of proof than criminal cases. But authorities didn't get a real break in the case until 1998, when Harwood's ex-?girlfriend, Trahan, came forward after a television show about the killing aired. After she recounted what she knew, authorities went to Harwood's home in Albemarle, N.C. When he opened his door, he said, I've been waiting for you guys a long time, according to testimony from the GBI agent involved in the arrest. By that time Sullivan was living in Costa Rica. Around the time of his indictment, he asked a local couple to accompany him as he drove, in their car, 12 hours to Panama. He left his dog, Coco, with the woman's mother. Sullivan gave the couple enough money for their return trip and boarded a flight to Venezuela. Then he flew to Thailand. He never returned to Costa Rica for his car or his dog, the man and woman testified through translators. In Thailand, Sullivan married his fourth wife and bought an oceanfront condo in an upscale resort community. Recognized from the TV show America's Most Wanted by people in Thailand, Sullivan was arrested in July 2002. He was extradited to Fulton County in 2004. Bond was denied, and he has been in jail since then.

Then, in 1987, Evans said he was going through notes for 40 books, agonizing over how he was going to write them all, when the revelation struck: he would write them all into Bluefeather Fellini. The epic with its sequel, Bluefeather Fellini in the Sacred Realm, written on 21 legal pads, was published in two parts in 1993 and 1994 by the University Press of Colorado, the house's first fiction. </P> 	nyt_eng_200603.gz

After initially liking the company, Krensavage said he began to think that AAIPharma was using a practice called channel-stuffing.

But in Massachusetts, income from direct marketing is spread over markets, farm stands, sales to restaurants, and community supported agriculture (CSA) shares, where consumers pay a certain sum for a specified amount of vegetables at the beginning of the season. Direct marketing of farm products is growing across the country, says Charlie Touchette, the executive director of the North American Farmers Direct Marketing Association, headquartered in Western Massachusetts. His organization is about to release a study done with Michigan State University. Farmers' markets are booming; farm stands are booming, he says. We're learning overall that customers more and more seem to seek out products from their neighborhood. And farmers are discovering that as supermarkets and big box stores are buying much of their produce overseas, direct sales are the key to surviving, says Webber.

By combining the departments so that curators can focus mostly on shows or on acquisitions, he said, they will communicate better.

He is also installing a solid concrete storm room. </P> 	nyt_eng_200606.gz

So the film places its slightly evolved heroes in the familiar Clerks world, where history means old girlfriends, and culture is old movies. A new character, Elias (Trevor Fehrman), is a Mooby's employee as young and unambitious as the original clerks used to be.

They actually go to sleep instead of stay up for three months or drink themselves into a coma, said Doc McGhee, the band's manager. You just can't do that day in and day out, not as you get older.

We'd hold this little glitch against him if it weren't for the fact that we've taken a few road trips ourselves, and know how loopy he must have been when he crossed the town line. He had driven Interstate 80 across Pennsylvania, and before that on the Ohio turnpike, and before that on other highways over several days all the way from Oregon, with his wife beside him clutching a TripTik, his kids sagging in the back seat and his so-tired-of-driving heart full of gratitude just because they were all still alive. This is the book to read if you're mourning the road trip you can't afford this summer. Sullivan (Rats) is funny and congenial, and he writes his travelogue in short sections that make your snack breaks and pit stops easy to plan.

No true baseball fan wanted to see Carl Everett (ugh) get a hit. A Red Sox victory would have meant nothing in the big scheme of things as opposed to seeing a perfect game. To me, it must start with, and always be about, the baseball, not the blind loyalty to a team. That, I guess, is where I part company with many contemporary Red Sox followers.

"173084"	"I"	"guess"	" Kudos to us, I guess, Hansen said. Are we all gifted? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173336"	"I"	"guess"	" I can appreciate what everyone's doing, I guess, but I learned it from the real guys, Winter, 62, said from a tour date in Vancouver. I'm just glad when anyone can turn people on to the real blues players -- guys like Muddy Waters and Freddie King. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173511"	"I"	"guess"	" Long: But, I guess, why won't you answer that question? It's a yes or no question. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173652"	"I"	"guess"	" But if it ever dries up for him? See ya! Although, I guess, we can always do Vegas. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173714"	"I"	"guess"	" The lower drawers: Pitch Black, Species and, I guess, Dune just because it is such a huge, watchable failure with really big worms. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173770"	"I"	"guess"	" It's up there, I guess, so they can check in to make sure I'm there watching the games, Stillman joked about his nameplate. I've been watching a lot of games, and it's still better to play than to watch. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173857"	"I"	"guess"	" But as its record deal floundered, the band kept moving forward. We had already recorded Boondocks and we had Bring It On Home (LBT's first two top 10 singles). We had a few songs we thought were hit songs. We really believed in what we were doing and we were too stupid and stubborn, I guess, we never even thought about quitting. We just kept on trucking along and we believed if we kept showing up something would happen. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"174039"	"I"	"guess"	" But to state officials, this is about transparency, accountability and, I guess, in a sense, reciprocity, Theriot said, explaining that when the federal government gives grants to the state, federal auditors can examine the state's spending and, if they find a problem, demand the money back. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
"174111"	"I"	"guess"	" I'm more settled, I guess, said Jean, who will turn 18 next week. She was surprised that she so enjoyed the visit. I was in a good place. She was in a good place. My illness just didn't particularly seem relevant. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
"174122"	"I"	"guess"	" I'm always one that as everyone knows, is always pushing, Woods said. I try to find other avenues to challenge myself, and I enjoy that. You know, as I've progressed throughout my career, that's what I've done on and off the golf course. I enjoy, I guess, the challenge of life every day and trying to do something different. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
"174247"	"I"	"guess"	" It's called maturity, I guess, he added. It's not facility because you're probably born with facility. You're increasing your accessibility to options. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
