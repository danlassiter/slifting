"3770"	"he"	"guessed"	" And maybe more than that. After reaching a high ranking of No.10 in 1992, an injury-plagued Krajicek went sliding, all the way to No.30, the skid ending when he beat Sampras in Davis Cup play last month. If Krajicek had lost this match, he guessed, correctly, that it would have been the worst defeat of his four-year professional career. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199408.gz"

"82800"	"I"	"guessed"	" I was not alone; perhaps a dozen other people also gathered round, in interesting, still silence. All, I guessed, felt isolated enough and cowed enough by the furious beastliness to contemplate themselves in awe. Unfenced in, separated from us by a wall and a moat, the lion disappeared behind a rock, then returned to view, maybe 30 feet from where I stood. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

He is unhappy, say people close to him, with how Sony's Epic label promoted his most recent album, ``Invincible,'' which sold only 2 million copies in the United States.

"123369"	"I"	"guessed"	" Just then, a husky largemouth bass cleared the water in the kind of gill-rattling leap straight from the cover of an old Field and Stream. It crashed back into the lake, jumped again, then dove under the kayak, forcing me to pass the rod over my head to keep the line from rubbing against the hull. After a few more runs, the fish surrendered, allowing me to grab it by the lower lip, and hoist it up. Eighteen inches, I guessed, maybe three pounds.

"166560"	"he"	"guessed"	" I was in New Orleans recently for its annual jazz festival, and friends and I spent stupefying time surveying the rampant devastation, little of which seems to have been cleaned up eight months after the fact. One in our number glumly assessed its chances at a full recovery anytime soon: It'll become, he guessed, a weekend city and remain a ghost town during the week. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
