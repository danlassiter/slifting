Chrysler's board, which met today to develop a strategy to counter Kerkorian, approved increasing the stock buyback program by the end of 1996, subject to market conditions. The No. 3 automaker's decision means big gains for Kerkorian, who has a 13.6 percent stake in Chrysler. Kerkorian abandoned a $55-a-share bid for Chrysler in April, when he failed to get enough financing and the company's shares were trading at about 38. Today Chrysler reached a 52-week high of 58 1/8, up 52 percent since then. Published 16:03. (See story: NI AUT) Motorola, Others Add Capacity to Meet Rising Demand, by Margaret D.

Bonds and the dollar were little changed.  Mutual Funds  EMERGING-MARKET-FUNDS (New York) -- Emerging market fund managers shifted money into South African equities in the second quarter because of disenchantment with Latin American investments, a survey found.

COMMERCE-DISMANTLING (Washington) -- The Republican drive to eliminate the Commerce Department got a boost today, as a key Senate committee approved legislation to dismantle the agency and farm out its functions to other parts of the government. A similar bill is pending in the House of Representatives.

Columns &AMP; Commentary  FLOW-OF-FUNDS (Boston) -- As more than $1.5 billion pours in each week, the rate of new purchases is approaching unprecedented levels for mutual funds investing in U.S. stocks.

Glaxo Wellcome Plc today wrote off about $1.3 billion in costs related to Glaxo's $14.7 billion acquisition of Wellcome earlier this year. At the same time, Campbell Soup Co. said the recent $1.1 billion acquisition of a sauce maker kept its most recently quarter profits from gaining.

RATES-OF-RETURN (New York) -- Junk bond investors will have plenty of opportunities to buy high-yielding zero coupon bonds this fall, when Iridium Inc., Gobalstar L.P. and a handful of other high-tech companies sell more than $2 billion of zeroes to grow their fledgling businesses. Companies are selling sell zeroes --which don't pay out interest at first -- to give themselves breathing room to generate cash before they have to start making interest payments. In return, they offer investors yields as high as 14 percent on their investments, returns more akin to stock than bonds. By Beth Williams, with reporting by Scott W. Martin.

Chrysler's board, which met today to develop a strategy to counter Kerkorian, approved increasing the stock buyback program by the end of 1996, subject to market conditions. The No. 3 automaker's decision means a gain of $800 million for Kerkorian, who has a 13.6 percent stake in Chrysler. Kerkorian abandoned a $55-a-share bid for Chrysler in April for lack of financing, when the company's shares were trading at about 38. Chrysler shares have gained 52 percent since then to today's 52-week high of 57 3/4. Published 16:03.

Bob Packwood (R- Oregon) resigned today, ending a 27-year Senate career in the face of a probable vote by his colleagues to expel him from their chamber. ``It is my duty to resign,'' Packwood said in a late-afternoon speech on the Senate floor, his voice quavering with emotion. ``It is the honorable thing to do for this country. I will resign from the Senate, and I leave this institution not with malice but with love. Good Luck. Godspeed.'' Packwood's resignation avoids what could have been an embarrassing debate in the Senate as his colleagues discussed the Senate Ethics Committee's strong recommendation yesterday that he be expelled.

(See story: NI CNG) SEC and FTC Top Senate Panel's Regulator Hit List, by Bob Drummond and Lynn Marek  Washington: The Securities and Exchange Commission and other federal regulatory agencies are almost certain to face dramatic spending cuts next year, Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) said today. That prediction from the Republican presidential candidate came after a Senate appropriations subcommittee he heads approved in a party-line vote cuts of 20 percent in the budgets of the SEC, the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and two smaller agencies. The reductions would take effect beginning in the fiscal year starting on Oct. 1. Gramm said the cuts reflect his skepticism about federal regulation. ``It's no surprise to anyone that I believe that America is over-regulated,'' he said. Published 16:44.

Williams  New York: Motorola Inc. said it will invest $3 billion in a Virginia computer chip plant and two other chipmakers said they'll expand facilities, the latest sign that the industry believes demand will continue to surge. ``The industry collectively is deciding they are going to have to invest more to meet the rising demand'' for computer chips found in everything from computers to telephones, said analyst Rick Whittington of Soundview Financial Corp. Motorola's plant, to be built outside Richmond, will make PowerPC chips and employ 1,000. Japan's Hitachi Ltd. also announced a $400 million expansion of its Irving, Texas, plant and Mitsubishi Semiconductor America Inc. said it plans a $3 million chip-design center next to its Durham, North Carolina, headquarters.

Lawmakers came three votes short of passing the amendment, sponsored by budget hawk John Kasich (R-Ohio), chairman of the Budget Committee, and defense spending critic Ronald Dellums (D-California), ranking Democrat on the National Security Committee. The 210-213 vote was closer than the 203-219 tally on an identical Kasich- Dellums amendment the House considered in June. ``How do you go home and support a billion-dollar program when we're trying to squeeze money out of this budget and the mission of the plane is over?'' Kasich asked. Kasich and Dellums wanted to cut $493 million added to the bill to begin production of additional B-2s. Published 13:38.

Sheer luck, he shrugged, and pocketed $100,000 in prize money. If so, that was one of the few instances where chance shaped Scrushy's fortunes. Those who know him say he didn't get to be head of Healthsouth Corp., a $2 billion health-care juggernaut, because of luck. ``He's intense, likes to win and works very hard at it,'' said William Harnish, president of Forstmann Leff Associates, a New York money management firm that owns 4.1 million Healthsouth shares. ``There may not be another person who has come so far and accomplished so much in corporate America.'' That may sound excessive. But consider that in 1971 Scrushy was 17 years old and making $50 a week pumping gas and cleaning bathrooms. Today he owns 5.8 million shares worth $135 million in a company that dominates the rehabilitation industry. Published 10:54.

At the same time worker productivity rose at the fastest pace in nine years, with output increasing even as workers put in fewer hours. ``Overall, employers are hiring, though more cautiously than last year,'' said Peter Kretzmer, an economist with NationsBanc Capital Markets in Charlotte, North Carolina. New jobless claims fell 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 339,000. Productivity at businesses other than farms rose at a revised 4.8 percent annual rate in the second three months of the year, the biggest gain since the first quarter of 1986. ``The people who were still working worked harder,'' said Carl Palash, chief economist with MCM MoneyWatch in New York.
