"92309"	"you"	"walk"	" The reason to venture to Mole is supposed to be the national park and its walking safaris. In East and South Africa, safari-goers are usually confined to vehicles. Here, you walk, accompanied by an armed guide. The problem is that the Mole safari experience pales when compared with others on the continent. Animals are few _ an elephant here, a warthog there, and that's about it. Down the road from the park is a rather sad attraction, the mosque at Larabanga, a bizarre mud and thatch structure. You're forced to pay a local ``guide,'' who then demands more money for the Imam. The tour consists of a stroll around the building and a fuzzy recital of its history: You're not allowed inside. The villagers were reduced to this squeezing money out of visitors after the national park was created in 1971. They were no longer allowed to hunt there, as they had for centuries; their means of supporting themselves was cut off. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"
