"140325"	"I"	"love"	" A: I love James Wood's essays, The Broken Estate. I love the kind of literary critic that he is. And I love Lionel Trilling. ... And then I love mystery tales. I was going to write my dissertation at one point on the mystery tale. Raymond Chandler, I love, and Trent's Last Case by E.C. Bentley. Oh, I'm a voracious mystery reader. ... And I just finished a very fine book, Colm Toibin's The Master. Right now I'm reading Mordecai Richler's Barney's Version. I love him; I love his sense of humor. And then I'm reading a young writer, Natasha Radojcic Kane -- she wrote the novel Homecoming. And when I was in London recently, I met this really interesting writer, Katie Hickman, who wrote a biography of the great courtesans of 19th-century England. That book is really interesting. Oh, there are so many! </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
