If you have questions, please call Tim Spence at 202-298-6920.  (``HNS'' appears in all sluglines.)  BUSINESS/FINANCIAL NEWS (``f'' category)  TECH-BLACKBERRY (San Antonio) _ The BlackBerry has become one of the hottest technology devices for professionals. Since its introduction three years ago, the handheld device known for easily connecting executives to their e-mail has become an essential tool for mobile professionals. Today, more than 14,000 organizations use the BlackBerry and the number of BlackBerry subscribers exceeds 321,000, according to Research In Motion Ltd. or RIM, the Canadian company that manufacturers of the device. By L.A. LOREK.  SBC-FUTURE (San Antonio) _ SBC Communications Inc. is considered one of the bright stars in the beleaguered telecom section. It has successfully moved into data and long-distance services, outlasting its dot-com and start-up telecom critics. Now, SBC is trying to convince regulators to ease restrictions on its high-speed data services such as DSL (digital subscriber line) so it can better compete with the cable companies that are emerging as its ablest rivals. By SANFORD NOWLIN.  AUTO-ELDORADO-DEMISE (San Antonio) _ Just as Cadillac is poised to celebrate its 100th anniversary and the 50th anniversary of the introduction of the Eldorado Touring Coupe next year, the General Motors luxury division is dropping the Eldorado line. After the 2002 model year, there will be no more Eldorado. By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III.  LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'' category)  PROM-DRESSES (Albany, N.Y.) _ As if high school is not filled with enough angst, it's topped off by the prom. But when it comes to prom dresses, girls don't need to spend all they have earned baby-sitting or folding shirts at The Gap. A funky and frugal alternative to high-priced gowns can be found at secondhand or consignment stores. By KRISTI L. GUSTAFSON.  BIRTHDAY-107 (San Antonio) _ William Martin Sr. remembers the day his ``dear mama'' died as if it were yesterday, even though she's been gone for almost 100 years. His father, a slave's son who built railroads, had boarded a train bound  to Missouri early that day. His father eventually returned, and later married a woman who treated Martin very well, he remembers, but he still misses his mama. ``I'm 107 years old,'' said the former railroad worker and farmer. ``I've been here a long time. I never would have thought I would have been a living man today.'' By MACARENA HERNANDEZ.  TRAVEL (``t'' category)  TRAV-EVERGLADES (Flamingo, Fla.) _ The Florida Everglades will never win the prize for best national park. It hasn't the mystique of Mesa Verde, the vistas of Acadia or the awesome wonder of the Grand Canyon. And what with the heat, the humidity and the mosquitoes, the Everglades never will be confused with Miss Congeniality. Yet the Everglades is full of marvels: purple sunsets, skies obliterated by great flocks of ibis, ruler-length alligators clinging to their mother's back, night-blooming orchids and glistening spider webs threading through a sawgrass-lined slough. By SYD KEARNEY.  With: TRAV-EVERGLADES-INFO  TRAV-PLANES-COLUMN (Undated) _ In this post-9/11 world of intense security and uncertainty, many of us continue to agonize about the feasibility of an occasional long-distance vacation or business trip. Yet several times each week, tens of thousands of flight attendants go to an airport, endure the security screening process and board a plane. Just to go to work. By HARRY SHATTUCK.  TRAV-ST.AUGUSTINE (St. Augustine, Fla.) _ As dusk creeps in on this old city, small groups of people begin clustering. In numbers of 20 to 30, they gather around leaders in strangely ancient-looking garb, clothes reminiscent of, say, a  Colonial-era midwife or minister, or a turn-of-the-century gravedigger. Usually, the guides carry a candle or lantern to keep the crowd together. These dusky gatherings are ``ghost tours,'' the latest manifestation of the tourist trade in this city that owes its prosperity to history. BY JAMES R. GRAY.  SPORTS (``s'' category)  PAN-AM-GAMES (Rio De Janeiro) _ The head of the Brazilian Olympic Committee has asked San Antonio to give up its Pan American Games bid and allow Rio to be the host of the competition in 2007. In an impassioned appeal to the organizers in Texas, Carlos Nuzman said the United States should give other countries a chance to organize and run international sporting events. By ANDREW DOWNIE and DITI KINKHABWALA.  COMMENTARY (``k'' category)  U.S.-VENEZUELA (Washington) _ The conventional wisdom that ``There are no second acts in life,'' got turned on its head earlier this month when Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was removed from office by a citizen uprising, then returned to power 48 hours later when the nation's interim government proved less democratic than the one it had replaced. In the process, I and many other Latin America observers were  caught flatfooted, at once hopeful for a new beginning in Venezuela and uneasy over the way it came about. By THOMAS F. McLARTY III  MIDEAST-POWELL (Washington) _ When Secretary of State Colin Powell departed for the Middle East, U.S. policy seemed to have turned a corner. In response to the gruesome violence and mayhem in the West Bank and Israel, and to prevent the unraveling of our own war on terrorism, President Bush rightly engaged the prestige of his office for the first time to pull both sides away from the abyss that threatened to engulf the entire region.

"130718"	"he"	"remembers"	" There were two or three barbers on every block, he remembers, perhaps through the distorting lens of nostalgia.

"133259"	"she"	"remembers"	" The castoff vases and wall pockets, baskets and bowls went for $2 to $5, she remembers, a pittance now but not then, not for her.

"153501"	"he"	"remembers"	" The transition from Isaacs to Scaasi happened accidentally. Scaasi was doing clothes for glossy models to wear in Fisher body magazine ads in 1953 when, he remembers, I was woken up in the middle of the night by the art director. 'Arnold, we've turned your name around and we're using it in the ad!' </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, he says,	 Rose Kennedy, he says, was a charming, funny, Irish woman who really didn't care about what she said. Whatever popped into her mind she said immediately, and it was usually either amusing or down-to-earth, very direct. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, he says,	 The banyan tree got knocked over twice in last year's hurricanes, in two different directions. Ever the realist, Scaasi is thinking of taking down the tree, if only because, he says, he may not live long enough to see the canopy fully grown again. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, they say,	 A. Certainly the situation for modern families is not easy. But you know, when people romanticize the marriages of the past, they say, Marriage is about making sure that every child has a mother and a father. But for thousands of years, marriage was about getting in-laws, making alliances, determining which child had a right to parents and inheritance. Illegitimate children had no rights. A lot of these traditionalists idealize a paradise that never was. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, I think,	 By contrast, we are living now in an era where social disparities are widening. At the same time, women are working at paid jobs, and they are not at home. Some people wonder what will happen to children when women are no longer compelled to do the child care. Americans believe you can have a winner-take-all economy, because the nuclear family will take care of all altruism and obligation. So when it looks like the nuclear family isn't going to do that, it's very frightening. A lot of the social-issue voting during the last presidential election, I think, was fueled by this. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz

, he admitted,	 Then came the next round of abuse allegations, and this time the case went all the way through the jury process. Even those fans inclined to see him as a victim had to wonder about his insistence on playing -- and, he admitted, lying in bed -- with little children. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, he said,	 Dr. Mauro Moscucci, the lead author, said public reporting could be useful -- if done properly. New York uses a system that takes account of how sick patients are, he said, and that works well when considering many cases. But he said the system might be biased when applied to a few cases of individual doctors who had high-risk patients. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz

, he said,	 Patients, he said, should also be aware that 20 percent of the centers are not fully accredited, and that could mean that they are not staffed or equipped to meet accreditation standards. Even if a center is affiliated with a respected hospital, a patient may not be immediately admitted to a hospital room there. These agreements generally do not specify an admissions process, Kulczycki said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz

, he read,	 Murakami's attachment to American literature is longstanding. As a high-school student in Kobe, in western Japan, he read, in the original, Kurt Vonnegut, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Truman Capote and Raymond Chandler. Like many Japanese of his generation, he became passionate about jazz and rock. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, he replied,	 Whatever they lack in schooling, cordel poets are creative and quick-witted. When Abraao Batista was asked what made him become a poet, he replied, Well, I went to the moon, found St. George and the saints conversing, and they gave me their benediction. Ever since then, I've been jumping about in time and space. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, he said,	 Renato Mannheimer, a pollster at the University of Milan, noted that other referendums in Italy in recent years had also attracted only about 25 percent of voters, calling into question how many people stayed away because church leaders urged Italians to abstain. Italians, he said, are growing more and more apathetic. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, he says,	 At the low-cost carriers, the trends are the same -- though one big low-cost airline, Alaska Air, said Friday it was reducing its flight schedule to safeguard its on-time performance and scheduling reliability during the summer crush. So let's let Boyd summarize the approaching mess. As demand rises, he says, the airlines aren't adding capacity, they're cutting back or staying about even. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, he added,	 Congressional Deputy Roberto Jefferson, the central figure in the scandal, said in interviews with a Brazilian newspaper over the past week that he warned President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the vote-buying arrangement and that da Silva broke into tears at the news. But, he added, da Silva's closest aide always knew all about it, and, he said, other top officials in the leftist Workers' Party actively participated in the arrangement, which involved a large monthly stipend paid in cash out of suitcases. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
, they say,	 To hear the companies and Wall Street analysts tell it, the 1990s are history. The lab companies say they have introduced stringent quality controls to prevent recurrences of the abuses. Nor, they say, are they as dependent as they were on wringing every last cent out of routine analysis of fluid and tissue specimens. Breakthroughs like the mapping of the human genome have spawned a flood of new types of analytical jobs for them, like tests that identify which patients are susceptible to particular types of heart disease or cancer. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz

, he said,	 Souter compared white and black jurors who had expressed similar views on the death penalty during initial questioning; the whites were retained and the blacks removed. The prosecution's reasons for the different treatment, he said, are so far at odds with the evidence that pretext is the fair conclusion, indicating the very discrimination the explanations were meant to deny. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz

As in July, he seemed shrunken since the days when aides cowered before him in his palaces -- at least 30 pounds lighter, his face tightly drawn, deep pouches beneath his eyes, his beard flecked with white, but his hair still black from the hair-dye Iraqi officials have said is one of the few luxuries permitted him in jail. Once a man who prided himself on his immaculate tailoring, he wore, again, the same kind of ill-fitting, store-bought suit provided by his American captors last year, a tie denied him as a precaution against any suicide bid. </P> 	nyt_eng_200506.gz
