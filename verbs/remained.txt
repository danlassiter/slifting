Times News Service  Turkey Day is only a few days away and judging from all the strange advertisements, choosing a bird is not the simple matter it once was.  In the old days, people used to hunt their own turkeys. That is, they used to go to the supermarket, hunt for the pile of frozen fowl and toss one in their shopping cart.  The only Thanksgiving critter criterion was: Would it fit into your oven? All turkeys in those days were exactly the same: frozen. Their sex was irrelevant. We cared little whether they had enjoyed their life up until their demise. In fact, we thought nothing about their lives at all.  I would venture that life was simpler that way, both for the eaters and the eatees.  Now we know that there are all kinds of turkeys. But my favorite are ``Ike Birds,'' those frozen during the Eisenhower Administration.  These are actually the product of early secret military cryogenics testing. It had hoped that if turkeys could be held in a state of suspended frozen animation and later revived, the same could work with soldiers. Then we could have vast armies stored like battalions of fighting Popsicles, needing absolutely no upkeep, other than a good walk-in freezer.  The first part of the cryogenics test was a complete success, which is to say that the birds froze up nice and hard and stayed that way as long as no idiot left the freezer door open.  The problems occurred during the Test Subject Re-Mobilization Phase (i.e. defrosting). Although the birds were successfully taken through a scientifically-controlled temperature elevation protocol until they reached 92.7 degrees, the turkeys never quite achieved the state of animation they enjoyed before the freezing process. In fact, they remained, in a technical sense, dead.  Happily, further experiments showed that if a test subject's temperature was quickly elevated from 0 degrees to roughly 350 degrees Fahrenheit and sustained for a time roughly corresponding to 30 minutes per pound, the birds came out _ according to a recently declassified report _ ``juicy and delicious.''  While the cryogenics testing did not lead to frozen soldiers, generals in charge of the project quickly retired and set up turkey processing plants that made millions of dollars selling turkey meat to the military. (It is merely coincidental that the poultry processing giant Tyson has had close ties to every presidential administration since Truman.)  While real ``Ike Birds'' are a sought-after rarity, the country has simply become buried in millions of pounds of generic frozen turkeys. Which is fine. Or was fine.  Then entrepreneurs started to develop other types of turkeys, such as ``free-range, organic'' birds. ``Free-range, organic'' turkeys apparently live happier lives than their mass-produced brothers and that happiness is reflected in te of the meat. At least, that's what we are supposed to believe.  Frankly, I have a harder time enjoying a bird that once was living a happy and fulfilling life than one that probably was so bummed out that death was a blessing.  Along with the range-running turkeys, there are birds that baste themselves while cooking (a sad sight), turkeys raised in Tibetan communes, turkeys with four drumsticks per side (``Sir Speedy Brand'') and turkeys personally counseled by representatives from the Society for the Preventional of Cruelty to Future Main Courses. The point of these ultra-turkeys is mainly to make us feel bad about buying the plain old 53-cents-a-pound, chock-full-a-chemicals turkey.  It doesn't work with me. My only regret is that none of them can match an actual ``Ike Bird''; an entree that gave his life for our country. It makes you kind of proud to eat a turkey like that.
