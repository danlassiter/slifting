Times News Service  NEW YORK _ Every Friday at 1 p.m. for six months beginning in January of last year, 15 Palestinian and 15 Israeli teen-agers _ from Gaza, Jaffa, Jericho, Jerusalem, Ramallah and Tel Aviv _ gathered together to learn the art of photography, and as political events unhappily unfolded, to argue about bombings, border closings and the fate of Jerusalem.  A year and a half later, on a sweltering evening in New York, Americans, Israelis and Palestinians crammed into the Puffin Room in Soho to view ``Documenting Life Styles,'' a selection of the students' photos.  Given the political context of the program, organized by the International Center for Peace in the Middle East, a nonprofit group based in Tel Aviv, it is shocking how apolitical and untendentious many of the teen-agers' photographs look. There is a comforting lack of Israeli guns, Palestinian rocks, shells of bombed buses.  Are these teen-agers actually leading normal lives? In their pictures, they are almost preternaturally concerned with form: with light, movement, detail, mood and color.  Rachel Gil's photograph is of a quiet procession of Muslim women in black dresses and white scarves over a grassy hill. Next to her photograph she offers an eloquent evaluation of her esthetic: ``There is a feeling of distance between me and my photographed objects . . . The result is one of loneliness and estrangement. The light is very important to me.''  Ahmed el-Saka took a picture of Arabs bent over in prayer, their backs forming a rough and colorful carpet. Sari Abu Zayyad, in a photograph carefully divided into shadow and light, caught in the darkened foreground a man in a kaffiyeh with his back turned, and in the sunny background people in a sandy yard.  In another of his photos a little boy stands on a rooftop, looking out impassively. Avigail Tzarfati took a memorable shot of three little boys in yarmulkes walking on white sand, two of them chatting and one struggling to catch up. Yasirr Abed el-Shafi's shot of the Gaza port is a study in color: yellow rails, signs and awnings, white street and buildings, blue sea and sky.  Roni Kaufman, who took a picture of her school's dingy bathroom _ bare except for the sinks, faucets and floor drains _ comments on her work like a true minimalist: ``I like to focus on one or two things because I like them with few details. In this way of photographing, the picture looks very clear and creates powerful moments.'' What she does not mention is one small detail in her photograph: some Hebrew scrawled on the wall.  What is the writing on the wall? Why are the students so shy of leaving messages in their photographs? Are they weary of politics? Or are their messages hidden?  The lineup of dignitaries who spoke at the opening of ``Documenting Life Styles'' suggests that this is not just a show of smart young esthetes but also a junior peace initiative.  The director of the project, Hally Pancer, and the curator of the show, Michket Krifa, were joined by Ofer Bronchtein, the director of the International Center for Peace in the Middle East; Colette Avital, the consul general of Israel in New York; Nasser al-Kidwa, the Palestinian delegate to the United Nations, and Abba Eban, the former Israeli foreign minister. There was a moment of silence for Yitzhak Rabin, the slain Israeli prime minister.  And Mr. Eban bemoaned that the peace effort begun in 1993 had not come before the Palestinian uprising, or intifada. ``There is no use crying over spilled milk,'' he said, but added that the mistakes suggest ``a way of carrying the jug in the future.''  The jug, to judge from the exhibition, is being carried gingerly by these canny Palestinian and Israeli teen-agers. Though most of their photographs are about light, color and atmosphere, they are not as removed from politics as it might appear. What is at stake, they suggest, IS in fact, light, color and atmosphere _ or, to put it simply, the land itself.  On that question, Ms. Pancer, an American-Israeli, said the Israelis already have the land and ``are constantly looking for escape'' from political realities in their photographs, while the Palestinians are ``more political.''  Badawi Qawasmi, a 17-year-old from Ramallah, who was in New York for the opening, for instance, had on display a photograph of a city square, which he shot from a tower. In the picture is a fountain without water, surrounded by pink-walled, blue-awninged brick buildings that define the angular maze of streets radiating from the center.  The picture has a crazy visual sophistication, as the photographer himself intended. In his statement, he wrote, ``I photograph my environment so strangely that even the people living in it couldn't recognize the places pictured.'' But there was more to it than that. The place was for him both personal and political.  ``From the first day of my life,'' he wrote, ``my parents dreamed of having a child that fit his landscape, his country: Palestine.

Times News Service  NEW YORK _ Every Friday at 1 p.m. for six months beginning in January of last year, 15 Palestinian and 15 Israeli teen-agers _ from Gaza, Jaffa, Jericho, Jerusalem, Ramallah and Tel Aviv _ gathered together to learn the art of photography, and as political events unhappily unfolded, to argue about bombings, border closings and the fate of Jerusalem.  A year and a half later, on a sweltering evening in New York, Americans, Israelis and Palestinians crammed into the Puffin Room in Soho to view ``Documenting Life Styles,'' a selection of the students' photos.  Given the political context of the program, organized by the International Center for Peace in the Middle East, a nonprofit group based in Tel Aviv, it is shocking how apolitical and untendentious many of the teen-agers' photographs look. There is a comforting lack of Israeli guns, Palestinian rocks, shells of bombed buses.  Are these teen-agers actually leading normal lives? In their pictures, they are almost preternaturally concerned with form: with light, movement, detail, mood and color.  Rachel Gil's photograph is of a quiet procession of Muslim women in black dresses and white scarves over a grassy hill. Next to her photograph she offers an eloquent evaluation of her esthetic: ``There is a feeling of distance between me and my photographed objects . . . The result is one of loneliness and estrangement. The light is very important to me.''  Ahmed el-Saka took a picture of Arabs bent over in prayer, their backs forming a rough and colorful carpet. Sari Abu Zayyad, in a photograph carefully divided into shadow and light, caught in the darkened foreground a man in a kaffiyeh with his back turned, and in the sunny background people in a sandy yard.  In another of his photos a little boy stands on a rooftop, looking out impassively. Avigail Tzarfati took a memorable shot of three little boys in yarmulkes walking on white sand, two of them chatting and one struggling to catch up. Yasirr Abed el-Shafi's shot of the Gaza port is a study in color: yellow rails, signs and awnings, white street and buildings, blue sea and sky.  Roni Kaufman, who took a picture of her school's dingy bathroom _ bare except for the sinks, faucets and floor drains _ comments on her work like a true minimalist: ``I like to focus on one or two things because I like them with few details. In this way of photographing, the picture looks very clear and creates powerful moments.'' What she does not mention is one small detail in her photograph: some Hebrew scrawled on the wall.  What is the writing on the wall? Why are the students so shy of leaving messages in their photographs? Are they weary of politics? Or are their messages hidden?  The lineup of dignitaries who spoke at the opening of ``Documenting Life Styles'' suggests that this is not just a show of smart young esthetes but also a junior peace initiative.  The director of the project, Hally Pancer, and the curator of the show, Michket Krifa, were joined by Ofer Bronchtein, the director of the International Center for Peace in the Middle East; Colette Avital, the consul general of Israel in New York; Nasser al-Kidwa, the Palestinian delegate to the United Nations, and Abba Eban, the former Israeli foreign minister. There was a moment of silence for Yitzhak Rabin, the slain Israeli prime minister.  And Mr. Eban bemoaned that the peace effort begun in 1993 had not come before the Palestinian uprising, or intifada. ``There is no use crying over spilled milk,'' he said, but added that the mistakes suggest ``a way of carrying the jug in the future.''  The jug, to judge from the exhibition, is being carried gingerly by these canny Palestinian and Israeli teen-agers. Though most of their photographs are about light, color and atmosphere, they are not as removed from politics as it might appear. What is at stake, they suggest, IS in fact, light, color and atmosphere _ or, to put it simply, the land itself.  On that question, Ms. Pancer, an American-Israeli, said the Israelis already have the land and ``are constantly looking for escape'' from political realities in their photographs, while the Palestinians are ``more political.''  Badawi Qawasmi, a 17-year-old from Ramallah, who was in New York for the opening, for instance, had on display a photograph of a city square, which he shot from a tower. In the picture is a fountain without water, surrounded by pink-walled, blue-awninged brick buildings that define the angular maze of streets radiating from the center.  The picture has a crazy visual sophistication, as the photographer himself intended. In his statement, he wrote, ``I photograph my environment so strangely that even the people living in it couldn't recognize the places pictured.'' But there was more to it than that. The place was for him both personal and political.  ``From the first day of my life,'' he wrote, ``my parents dreamed of having a child that fit his landscape, his country: Palestine. So they called me Badawi. That means one of the Bedouins. This expresses the real connection between me and my landscape, the landscape of Palestine. Those feelings are reflected in my pictures.''  During an interview, he decoded the meaning of his mazelike photograph of the city: ``All streets go there. Jerusalem is the center of the world.''  Koby Sadan, a 16-year-old Israeli from Tel Aviv, would not disagree. In an interview at the opening, he said the main challenge he faced in taking a picture of a boy playing paddle ball in a park was to catch the ball in motion.  He also offered a symbolic reading, ``Actually, it's a game for two, but he's playing alone.'' And what could this mean for Jerusalem? ``I still think Jerusalem is ours completely, but I see how it is important to Palestinians. I understand why they want it.''  ``Documenting Life Styles,'' which originated in East Jerusalem, remains on view at the Puffin Room, 435 Broome Street, near Broadway, in Soho, Manhattan, through Aug. 11.

"71744"	"they"	"suggest"	" Fundamentally, they suggest, the onus lies with our educational system. A number of disciplines and institutions have begun work to change a climate that may be off-putting to women _ to emphasize cooperative learning, to provide mentors, to use materials that relate as much to women's as to men's experiences, and to reach out to girls as early as elementary school. But as yet, there has been little impact. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"
"74649"	"they"	"suggest"	" The Hefleys live on Highway Z, which cuts old Pattonsburg in half. The government, they suggest, should have built a bigger levee, not a new town. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"
"86044"	"they"	"suggest"	" The new mantra of opening foreign markets while defending our own, they suggest, points toward a ``hub and spoke'' trading order in which the United States dominates numerous regional preferential trade areas, rather than a worldwide system in which the U.S. economy is merely first among equals. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
"92392"	"I"	"suggest"	" Lengthy connection times (or no connection at all) were all too common, while the services I managed to use were interesting but not crucial. Perhaps, I suggest, the wireless Internet isn't ready for widespread consumer adoption. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"
"94578"	"I"	"suggest"	" Clearly, someone is buying these books, but most of them probably receive little more than the skimming they deserve. It is easy to deride the ebb and flow of management fashions as reflected in these texts, but the mighty tide of business books needing to be ignored raises a larger question: Does it pay for people in business to read any books at all? The answer, I suggest, is that it depends on how ambitious they are. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"94855"	"they"	"suggest"	" Instead, they suggest, the ozone was formed by the light emitted by all the fireworks. Fireworks burn metal salts to create different colors, and the researchers say that much of the light emitted is of very narrow wavelengths, with enough energy to break apart oxygen molecules _ much as the ultraviolet component of sunlight does. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"

"103434"	"they"	"suggest"	" In a new book, ``The Quest for Paradise: Visions of Heaven and Eternity in the World's Myths and Religions,'' John Ashton, the Bible scholar, and Tom Whyte, a former BBC journalist, include as an illustration a beautiful 17th-century Iranian painting of a woman standing in a garden.

"104148"	"they"	"suggest"	" We have had, at the one end, the ``poor baby'' school, willing to slough Walker's acts off in an ooze of excuses, and at the other end, in far greater number and at many more decibels, the armchair toughs eager, they suggest, to manhandle Walker up against a wall and riddle him with bullet holes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"104993"	"they"	"suggest"	" So, they suggest, companies should produce much more information about their projections for the future. If, along the way, they wind up disclosing less information about the past, who cares? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"105866"	"they"	"suggest"	" Globalization, they suggest, should mix together many different tactics. Governments must have a role in helping native businesses compete. Experimentation and decentralization are essential. Local institutions should be enlisted, not ignored, as the free marketers so often do. And the next trade agreement should recognize that some national industries or regions within a country globalize more quickly than others. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"112377"	"they"	"suggest"	" Several members of Congress have outlined ideas for getting beyond the current grim impasse involving Palestinian suicide attacks against Israeli civilians and an Israeli offensive into West Bank cities.

"124854"	"they"	"suggest"	" In their experiments, the researchers showed that only chemicals from the alpha female can induce the chemical signaling, producing the right mixture, or amount, of pheromones.

"126723"	"they"	"suggest"	" A growing number of the bankers and finance officials from around the world who gathered in Washington this weekend for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank believe that it is near.

"126760"	"they"	"suggest"	" This, said the official _ who did not wish to be identified _ seemed to back up Reyes' claim that he had not been in direct league with the teenagers that night.

Reyes, they suggest, might then have struck. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"128164"	"they"	"suggest"	" The scientists say that bloodworms' rather specific use of copper suggests that the metal plays more roles than its structural one.

"128257"	"they"	"suggest"	" Secrecy is a funny thing. People who deal with big money _ in this case venture capitalists _ don't like to talk about the green stuff in mixed company. It's unseemly, they suggest, and confusing for the have-nots. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"128652"	"they"	"suggest"	" And so it is. But the environmentalists point out that the city and state are already talking about spending $3.6 billion to fix the pipes and associated plumbing that deliver Hetch Hetchy's water to the city. For that kind of money, they suggest, existing reservoirs can be enlarged, or a new one built, to replace Hetch Hetchy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"137944"	"they"	"suggest"	" At 12 weeks, the researchers note, N. furzeri's life span is not much longer than that of a fruit fly raised at similar temperatures. Aside from being a curiosity, they suggest, the fish's short life and ability to be raised in captivity may make it a useful laboratory tool for the study of aging. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200307.gz"
"140794"	"they"	"suggest"	" For Hardt and Negri, the battles are ideological as well, but far less easy to define. In a world of Empire, they suggest, democratic power won't resemble any democracy that has come before. It will be radical, absolute, implemented on a world scale. Vastly different individuals of differing origins and nationalities will participate. They will form not a uniform people or an anonymous mass but a vibrant multitude. And they will unite to undermine Empire. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"141289"	"they"	"suggest"	" In a coming report, Philip B. Heymann and Juliette Kayyem of Harvard University propose a model for confidential oversight of interrogations that fall short of torture.

"154187"	"they"	"suggest"	" Experts say there could be legitimate grounds for questioning the Chinese bid for Unocal as energy resources become scarce.

"161236"	"they"	"suggest"	" This selection, they suggest, occurs at the time a patient first meets the doctor face-to-face. But what happens then is not clear. In our society it is always hard to rule out racism, Lathan said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"162655"	"they"	"suggest"	" A principal part of the strategy of the court-appointed defense lawyers is to challenge the government's claim that Moussaoui's silence contributed in any way to the deaths of those on Sept. 11 because, they suggest, the government knew more than he did at the time of his arrest about al-Qaida's plans. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"165306"	"they"	"suggest"	" An ideal system, they suggest, would put schools near the top of the organizational chart and potentially eliminate or change dozens of administrative jobs.

Support services, like counseling programs, could be outsourced. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"

"167071"	"they"	"suggest"	" Though they have not nailed down the cause of this apparent exception to Mendel's laws, they believe the defective gene produces some special kind of RNA, the chemical cousin of DNA that helps translate its genetic information into protein. The defective gene's RNA, they suggest, interferes with the RNA produced by the normal gene, which may help explain why the defective gene is dominant. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"172963"	"they"	"suggest"	" In addition to maximizing the potential of the New Media, Harris and Halperin write, this required aggressively moving to delegitimize and control the Old Media; promoting a shared stake in success with political allies; insulating their side from Freak Show attacks; and using the Freak Show to devastate opponents. This is why, they suggest, that the Swift boat attacks worked to undermine Sen. John Kerry's reputation, while questions about Bush's Texas Air National Guard service and youthful drug use never appeared to stick. This is why the image of Vice President Al Gore as a phony exaggerator took root in many voters' minds, while concerns about Bush's relative lack of experience did not. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
