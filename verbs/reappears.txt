"17302"	"he"	"reappears"	" The apparent villain of the piece is Cohn, who lies even to his doctor about his homosexuality and who lies to everyone about the fact that he has AIDS. The portrait of hypocrisy in Cohn is corrosive but it is also, in some measure, heroic; Cohn goes down fighting, and in the final analysis he is no hypocrite at all. Right up to the end, he is true to what he is, and there is something of Milton's Satan in him. (Even Kushner, who has confessed to finding some of Cohn's character in his own, seems reluctant to let him go.) Paradoxically, it is Cohn's medicine that prolongs the life of Prior. And after Cohn dies, sung to his rest by his mortal enemy, Ethel Rosenberg, he reappears, making one final deal, this time with God, who needs someone to represent Him in the court of public opinion. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"
