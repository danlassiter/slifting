Lifestyle, Entertainment  VIDEO-REVIEWS-ADVISORY _ undated _ NOTE TO EDITORS: Max McQueen's Video Views column will not move this week because Max is actually taking a vacation. The column will resume next week. (e)  National  OLY-NOTIX _ ATLANTA _ Diana King lost her Olympic spirit Monday when she opened her mail and discovered she'd been shut out of every ticket she had requested. ``I was sick when I opened the envelope and read it. We've really looked forward to this,'' said King, of Marietta, Ga., who ordered $436 in tickets to swimming and track and field events. ``I haven't told my kids yet. I'm not looking forward to that. I don't know how to tell them that this great experience is going to be going on in this town and our family won't be a part of it.'' She wasn't alone. (a)  NOBEL-CARTER _ undated _ Former President Jimmy Carter and the International Olympic Committee are among the nominees for the Nobel Peace Prize, to be announced Oct. 13. The secretive, five-member Nobel committee _ which will announce the winner of the million-dollar prize in Oslo, Norway _ does not release the names of nominees. But Irwin Abrams, a retired history professor at Antioch University in Ohio, has compiled an unofficial list, based partly on press reports. (a)  NOBEER-2takes _ JAY, Fla. _ This tiny town hasn't been jolted like this since oil was discovered in 1970. Or maybe since the theater closed about 30 years ago, ending Jay's heyday when Hollywood movies and free-flowing beer attracted folks from across the northwestern Panhandle. Not until this year, when the Rev. Stanley Ryan started a petition to ban the sale of beer. He also wants to prohibit the sale of magazines such as Playboy and Penthouse. Even lottery tickets. (a)  AUTOTAX-2takes _ TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ David Kuhnlein's 1978 Cadillac Seville cost him $500. It's going to cost the state $187 million. Kuhnlein was one of hundreds of thousands of car owners who paid a $295 impact fee to bring their cars into the state between 1991 and this year. Most simply groused about another bureaucratic bite they thought they couldn't avoid. Kuhnlein did something about it. He filed a class-action suit and won. (a)  LAKE _ LaGRANGE, Ga. _ West Point Lake worth millions, but pollution a threat, study says. ATTN: ALABAMA POINTS. (a)  CARART _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Following the lead of two other states, the Texas Commission on the Arts is hoping to drive home support _ and generate new money _ for the arts with specialty license plates that went on sale Monday. (a)  Sports  HUMMER-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ The trial of Ray Goff has taken another confusing twist. The evidence is tainted. The light of truth is ever more difficult to see for all the what-ifs and should-have-beens that snarl the path. Call it what it is: a fine mess. (s)  VOISIN-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ Until the Jeep collided with the GEO Metro at the rain-slickened intersection of 10th Street and I-75 last Saturday afternoon, squashing the passenger side like an accordion and threatening the lives of Andrea Nachtrieb and Jennifer Orr, members of Georgia Tech's volleyball team were fixated on three things: Tar Heels, win streaks and rankings. (s)  STODA-COLUMN _ ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ He isn't Lee Janzen. And he isn't John Daly or Tom Watson or Tom Kite or Paul Azinger or Payne Stewart or anybody else. Curtis Strange isn't any of the other guys U.S. Ryder Cup captain Lanny Wadkins might have picked or could have picked as a wild-card addition to the team. Wadkins picked Strange. (s)  Business  ELTONJOHNGEORGIASONG _ ATLANTA _ Move over, Ray Charles. Rock superstar Elton John appears in the state of Georgia's new television ad campaign, singing his 1978 ballad ``Georgia.'' (f)  TECH-REPORT _ undated _ TECH REPORT: New seat cushion provides a touch of virtual reality. (f)  CYBERLAW _ ATLANTA _ Georgia State University law school student Denise deLaRue was vainly trying to find her way to class earlier this summer when she was approached by four guys. ``Thank God,'' she thought, ``I'm lost and this is the sa fety patrol.'' She wasn't lost on the campus. Instead she was logged on to a computer, stumbling through cyberspace on the way to a class conducted on the Internet. The notion was to teach law students about the new issues of privacy, censorship and fraud created by this online world. And deLaRue was already getting a firsthand lesson. (f)  KOMANDO-COLUMN _ undated _ KOMANDO ON COMPUTERS: Windows 95 is here and being touted as the easiest PC interface to come along. It may be user-friendly but I don't believe there has ever been so much phone traffic to Redmond, Wash., the home of Microsoft. (f)  Commentary  YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ On the most contentious of all American policy issues, Bill Clinton comes closest to stating a national consensus. His objective on abortion is to make it ``legal, safe and rare.'' Colin Powell couldn't say it any better. What does the anti-choice right say? Well, it stammers, and steams, and stews in its juices. And it schemes up ways to undermine holistic programs that, by all logic, it should support. (k)  SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ A former California parochial school teacher by the name of Rich Gosse is touring the country with a whole new kind of curriculum. He's re-teaching folks the fine but almost forgotten art of flirting. (k)  ASHLEY-COLUMN _ undated _ Even if U.S. diplomacy succeeds in ending the fighting in Bosnia, there are doubts that the U.S. Congress will support sending as many as 25,000 American troops to the country for about a year to keep Muslims, Croats and Serbs from violating a peace agreement.
