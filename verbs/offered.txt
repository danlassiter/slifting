"112858"	"he"	"offered"	" The Tigers' chief, Vellupillai Prabhakaran, has hinted at something similar. Declaring his support for a political resolution to the ethnic conflict, he suggested a solution short of secession: perhaps some form of Tamil administration in the northern and eastern Tamil belts of the country, he offered, could provide a framework for peace. Such an agreement would legitimize a structure already in place; the Tigers effectively rule the land in their control, collecting taxes and running a police force. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"

, he said,	 In this era of celebrity athletes, Duran occasionally meets parents who push their children so hard that family obligations are nudged aside.

, he said,	 Meanwhile, a former Palestinian aide is working to create diplomatic back channels between Israel and Abbas. Elias Zananiri, a former spokesman for Mohammed Dahlan, the powerful civil affairs minister in the defeated Fatah government, said the Israeli election results showed that a majority of Israelis are ready to give up most of the West Bank. In doing so, he said, Israel will be better off signing a deal with Palestinians than carrying out another unilateral withdrawal that Hamas can claim as a victory for its campaign of violence - as it did when Israel left the Gaza Strip last summer. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz

, she said,	 Marlene DaCosta, an exercise physiologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, doesn't feel that Ross's age is necessarily a detriment. The big difference, she said, is the demands on time, when you have a family and children, that can take away from training time. In a situation like that, he has to train smarter because he might not train as frequently as he once had time for. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz

, she said,	 Although children are more likely to face violence on the streets of low-income, urban neighborhoods, Augustyn said exposure to violence in the home - child abuse and spousal abuse - is not confined to a certain demographic group. She said 3.3 million to 10 million children witness physical abuse of their mothers each year, including families in affluent suburban communities. Those children suffer psychological and sometimes physical harm, she said, but pediatricians are unlikely to realize it. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz

, he said,	 For example, he said, it is known that stress increases the hormone cortisol, which could make people more sensitive to building problems like mold or poor ventilation.

SCI-IMPULSIVE-BEHAVIOR (Undated) -- Play hooky, disappear for the weekend, have a fling, binge-shop: reckless spontaneity can be a healthy defiance of routine, an expression of starved desire. Yet for scientists who study mental illness and addiction, impulsive behavior -- the tendency to act or react with little thought -- has emerged as an all-purpose plague, linked to higher risks of smoking, drinking, drug abuse, eating disorders and suicide. Now researchers have begun to resolve the contrary nature of impulsivity, identifying the elements that distinguish benign experimentation from self-destructive acts. The latest work, in brain research and psychological studies, helps explain how impulsive tendencies develop and when they can lead people astray. With photo.  SCI-IRAN-SPACE (Undated) -- The spacecraft is small by world standards -- a microsatellite of a few hundred pounds. Launched in October by the Russians for an oil-rich client, it orbits the earth once every 99 minutes and reportedly has a camera for peering down on large swaths of land. But what makes this satellite of particular interest is not its capabilities, which are rudimentary at best, but its owner: Iran. With last year's launching and another planned for the next few weeks, Tehran has become the newest member of the international space club. The question now asked in Washington and other capitals is whether Iran's efforts are simply part of its desire to expand its technical prowess, or an attempt to add another building block to its nuclear program. In that sense, it is the newest piece of the Iranian atomic puzzle. By William J. Broad and David E. Sanger.  With photo.  SCI-WALK-ON-WATER (Undated) -- In the night that followed the miracle of the loaves and fishes, as St. Mark tells the story in the New Testament, Jesus further astonished his disciples by walking on water. And he went up to them into the ship; and the wind ceased, it is written in Mark 6:51. And they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered. Doron Nof also wondered, in a measured, scientific way. A professor of oceanography at Florida State University, he conducted an inquiry and found what may be a natural explanation: ice. A short by John Noble Wilford.  SCI-Q&amp;A (Undated) -- A science question answered: Why do your muscles and joints ache during and after a fever? Is there a battle being waged there, with pain the aftermath? By C. Claiborne Ray.  SCI-KNAPWEED-MICE (Missoula, Mont.) -- An exotic plant from Europe called spotted knapweed covers the hills and mountainsides with a tough spindly scourge that has destroyed native ecosystems across the American West. In Montana alone, one of the worst-hit states, it covers more than 4 million acres. In the 1970s biologists imported a native enemy of knapweed, the gall fly, from Europe. But while it has not done much to halt the spread of knapweed, it appears to have worsened a serious human health problem. Because the fly larvae provide an abundant food source for deer mice in the winter, the mouse population has tripled, and so has the prevalence of hantavirus, a deadly disease carried by the mice. By Jim Robbins.  With photo.  SCI-INSECT-FLIGHT (Undated) -- When Stephen Yanoviak visited the jungles of Panama in 1998 for a study of how ants forage, he found himself with some unexpected down time. Out of boredom, I started flicking some ants off of a tree, he said. When he did, he noticed something extraordinary. Some of the ants he'd brushed aside fell straight down, but others swerved like miniature choppers, veering at near-right angles from their initial vertical paths and coming to a rest on tree trunks several feet from the ground. Yanoviak mentioned the gliding-ant sighting to his colleague Robert Dudley, an animal flight expert at the University of California at Berkeley. I thought it was the most exciting thing I'd ever heard, he said, and he decided to join Yanoviak in exploring this uncharted biological territory. Since then, their research has shed light on the airborne survival strategies many wingless insect species share, and on the question of how insect flight originated. By Elizabeth Svoboda.  With photo and graphic.  SCI-WATCH (Undated) -- News and notes on science: Australian snakes adapt to a toad invasion; Antarctic plants deal with global warming; timing the Yucatan extinction. By Henry Fountain.  With  SCI-COCKROACHES (Undated) -- Sure, the world may end in fire. Or perhaps in ice. But for those who think the world will end in cockroaches, there may be new cause for concern. Scientists in Belgium have discovered that the insects are good at collective decision-making. A short by Henry Fountain.  SCI-BORN-TO-WANDER (Undated) -- Ah, zugunruhe! Spring is here and it brings with it thoughts of migration. Birds head north, college students go south, the birds to breed, the college students to find a warm spot to study for their final exams. Zugunruhe is what does it to them. Zugunruhe is the need to migrate. Now researchers are studying that need in birds, and finding that it exists not only in migrators but in stay-at-homes. By James Gorman.  SCI-CARIBBEAN-CORAL (Undated) -- Unusually warm water over several months last summer followed by a wave of disease has killed a sizable fraction of the corals in the Caribbean, the latest episode in a worldwide decline of coral reefs. By Kenneth Chang.  SCI-BEDOUINS-GIRL (Tel Aviv, Israel) -- Moshira, a 9-year-old Bedouin girl with a rare genetic disease that left her in a vegetative state for most of her life, died on March 21, the same day she was profiled in an article in The New York Times. (125 words)  With photo.  Editors, papers that have already published or have retained for future use BC-SCI-BEDOUINS-DISEASE, filed on March 20, may wish to make note of this development.  SCI-REGISTERING-DEATH (Undated) -- The business of registering a death is a little-featured part of doctoring. People prefer to ponder the heroic aspects of the profession: brilliant diagnoses and miracle cures, life-saving surgeries and wondrous new vaccines (or, on the other hand, the snippy specialist who is never around and is a jerk to boot). But in addition to writing prescriptions and dispensing advice, physicians are entrusted with a very peculiar task: we are the ones who declare you dead. By Kent Sepkowitz, M.D.  SCI-DISABLED-SIBLINGS (Undated) -- An estimated 7 million typically developing American children have siblings with disabilities, according to the Arc of the United States, a leading advocacy group for the mentally retarded. They face many of the same challenges -- and joys -- as their parents, but they also face other problems. Some resent the extra demands placed on them at an early age by their disabled siblings, and many feel neglected by their often overburdened parents. Some children say they fear catching their siblings' disabilities. Others may wish that they too, were disabled, so that they could get all the attention their siblings do. And many suffer embarrassment about their siblings' inappropriate behavior or abnormal appearance, and then feel guilty about it. By Gretchen Cook.  With photo.  SCI-JAW-DISORDER (Undated) -- Temporomandibular joint disorder came for lunch on a hot, blue afternoon last summer. I took a bite of tomato salad and my jaw took a hard right turn. And stayed there. I couldn't chew. My teeth didn't meet or, horribly, scraped. I cut the salad into tiny pieces, used a spoon and had yogurt for dinner. Maybe, I thought, this will just go away. But the next day my jaw ached from struggling to close all night. It's probably TMJ, said the dentist. Let's see if we can relieve the pain. Probably? If? I had entered a world of fearsome and lovely language -- temporalis, masseter, pterygoid, all terms for jaw muscles. A world of medical mystery, uncertain treatments and, I discovered, a disconcerting gender bias. By Susan Ferraro.

By Eric Nagourney:  -- Remedies: With summer vacation approaching, a panel of medical experts has put together a list of recommendations for treating a common problem among people who spend a lot of time in the water: swimmer's ear.  -- For the Record: People who frequent emergency rooms are widely assumed to be there because they lack insurance, the implication being that their complaints are too minor to take up the ER's valuable time. A new study argues that this is largely a myth.  -- Patterns: Researchers who pored over three decades of flu data from the United States have found that like so many other things, influenza is most likely to begin in California and then move east.  -- Diagnosis: Researchers say they have developed a relatively simple technique for screening newborns for a variety of rare, sometimes fatal diseases that are easy to overlook until it is too late to do much about them.  SCI-NEW-BLADDERS (Undated) -- Bladders created in the laboratory from a patient's own cells and then implanted in seven young people have achieved good long-term results in all of them, a team of researchers reported. By Lawrence K. Altman.  SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) -- The Personal Health column: It's time to take on the widespread myth that people can control their health, that symptoms always reflect definable illnesses, and that some people choose to be sick for lack of anything better to be. By Jane E. Brody.  SCI-RETIRE-OUTLOOK (Undated) -- Having an unhappy youth or a bleak middle age has little effect on whether a man will be happy during retirement, according to a new study. And a prosperous adulthood is no assurance of contentment after one's working years have ended. By Nicholas Bakalar.  SCI-TONSILS-SLEEP (Undated) -- Researchers have found strong evidence that adenotonsillectomy, surgery to remove the tonsils and adenoids, can help relieve childhood behavioral or attention problems, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

She'll also change her hair color and invent the details of a new identity. It's 1972, and she will go underground to avoid arrest for an act she committed to protest the Vietnam War. The ensuing story goes back and forth in time over her 28 years in hiding. Unfortunately, Spiotta is not content to stay with Mary's point of view. We also hear from Nash (formerly Bobby, Mary's accomplice), who has reinvented himself in Seattle, and Mary's 15-year-old son, who's unaware of her past and speaks to us through his long and intelligent journals, which are so long and intelligently rendered that it's difficult to believe they come from a boy his age. Mary, he writes, is cryptic, in odd, sunny ways. Like she isn't really sure she's in the right house or the right life. Like she's a guest here. The book is driven by suspense over the nature of Mary's crime and her and Bobby's fates aren't revealed until the end, and over her fate, and Bobby's, in an era so different from that one long ago. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz

She'll also change her hair color and invent the details of a new identity. It's 1972, and she will go underground to avoid arrest for an act she committed to protest the Vietnam War. The ensuing story goes back and forth in time over her 28 years in hiding. Unfortunately, Spiotta is not content to stay with Mary's point of view. We also hear from Nash (formerly Bobby, Mary's accomplice), who has reinvented himself in Seattle, and Mary's 15-year-old son, who's unaware of her past and speaks to us through his long and intelligent journals, which are so long and intelligently rendered that it's difficult to believe they come from a boy his age. Mary, he writes, is cryptic, in odd, sunny ways. Like she isn't really sure she's in the right house or the right life. Like she's a guest here. The book is driven by suspense over the nature of Mary's crime and her and Bobby's fates aren't revealed until the end, and over her fate, and Bobby's, in an era so different from that one long ago. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz

PAPUA-MINING (Jakarta, Indonesia) -- Titus Natkime, 31, the son of a tribal leader in Papua, was clearly upset with his employer, the American mining company, Freeport-McMoRan. For generations, Natkime's clan has laid claim to much of the land in Papua, the Indonesian province where Freeport mines some of the world's largest copper and gold reserves. Now it was time for a payback, he said. He brought out a draft document showing Freeport's offer: $250,000 to set up a foundation for the clan, plus $100,000 annually, a sizable amount in Indonesia's most remote and poorest province. Why should I accept it? asked Natkime. It's an insult. In comparison, he said, Freeport was making tens of millions of dollars. Such defiance is symptomatic of the growing troubles in Papua, where four people have been killed in recent weeks in protests against Freeport. And it shows that times are changing for multinational companies and governments long used to working out concessions in remote areas with a handshake, over the heads of local people.

MOUSSAOUI-TRIAL (Washington) -- When the jurors in the Zacarias Moussaoui trial take their seats again on Thursday, they will begin a vastly different proceeding from the one they concluded on Monday with the verdict that he was responsible for some of the deaths of Sept. 11, 2001, and is thus eligible for execution. At the end of this next phase, which may take a few weeks, they will be confronted with a verdict form that will be without the subtleties and complex questions of the first phase and instead will ask them to make a more mechanical calculation. The form will ask them to decide which carries more weight: mitigating factors like Moussaoui's troubled mental state, or aggravating factors surrounding the deaths of nearly 3,000 people on Sept. 11.

, he said,	 Junger went to Concord Academy and Wesleyan University. After college, he said, I wasted about 10 years. I lived in D.C. and worked in a bar. I read a lot, and spent a few years writing short stories. You can't make a living doing that, and even if you do, does short fiction change the world? I kept edging toward journalism. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, she said,	 Junger's book infuriates Leah Scheuerman of Poughkeepsie N.Y., the only child of Bessie and Israel Goldberg. She was 24 in 1963 and hasn't spoken publicly about her mother's death until now. In 2003, she said, Junger interviewed her several times for the book, but she became uneasy, and last year I told him he couldn't use any information I gave him. Junger does not quote her directly. When she read an uncorrected reader's edition of A Death in Belmont, she decided to speak out. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, she said,	 Scheuerman disputes Junger's statement in the book that Smith did not lie during his interrogation. He fails to show, she said, that Smith lied about the times he arrived and left the Goldberg home, lied when he said he had not touched the wall mirror, lied in saying he had left the home in good order though it was found to be in disarray. The book has this sentence about Smith's reaction to the verdict: Leah Goldberg thought he looked utterly impassive, as though he expected this and didn't much care. Scheuerman says she was not in court for the verdict, but was home watching TV coverage of the Kennedy assassination. Junger said the line came from an interview with Scheuerman but concedes that she must have been referring to an earlier time in court. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, he said,	 Junger acknowledges that not all the testimony and evidence against Smith is included in the 267-page book and does not deny there may be errors on details. The trial transcript is 3,000 pages, he said. Some selection had to go on. You had to understand the essence of the state's case against Smith. As for Scheuerman's reaction, he said, She really suffered, and she merits being heard. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, he said,	 Retired judge Richard S. Kelley of Braintree, who argued the case for the prosecution, has a more nuanced reaction to the book, which he has read. For Scheuerman, he said, the book opens a wound. As for my part in it, he said, I felt it was factually done. I agree with Mrs. Goldberg's daughter that from the evidence we had and presented, I have no question that Roy Smith was guilty. On the other hand, it was a circumstantial case, and one can't reject the fact that there is always a possibility that unusual circumstances occurred. </P> 	nyt_eng_200604.gz
, he said,	 A Death in Belmont does not pin down the answers. In the interview, Junger said, DeSalvo is a long shot but was enough of a possibility at the time for investigators to take it seriously.

If you're a kid in the United States and you're interested in gardening, your parents take you to a psychiatrist to find out why.)
