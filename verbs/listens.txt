COMMENTARY  FBC-ROBERTS-COLUMN (Tallahassee, Fla.) _ Sports of The Times: Bobby Bowden has dad-gummed and gosh-darned his way into the folksy image of a coach. There is something admirable about compassion, but Bowden has also used his Hee-Haw charms as a recruiting tool at Florida State, able to woo blue-chip talent into the program's protective care. Adrian McPherson had faith in that history. Why not? At major programs across the country, accused players have been propped up by coaches' unconditional love. And FSU, as much as anyone, has laid out the welcome mat for misfits. So, in front of cameras this week, the FSU quarterback expressed disillusionment at being blind-sided by the cold shoulder of the coaching staff when police began nosing around a missing check. By Selena Roberts.  FEATURES  FBC-IOWA (Undated) _ Iowa has been on the outside looking in. The team some think might be the best in the nation is idle for three weeks as the BCS endgame is played out, hoping that someone stumbles. By Joe Lapointe.  FBN-MATCHUPS _ Pro football matchups. By Thomas George.  BKO-ST.ANTHONY-RESCUE (Jersey City) _ The telephone rings continually in Bob Hurley's spacious but cluttered office in the city's Department of Recreation. The calls come from the U.S. Embassy in Germany, from Michael Jordan's agent, from television producers and from St. Anthony High School, where Hurley holds his second job and where he long ago earned his reputation as one of the best basketball coaches in the country. The calls keep coming and Hurley, the recreation director, keeps lunging for the phone, hoping to receive word of another donation toward rescuing St. Anthony, the school that has dominated the last 31 years of his life. The coach, who has a part-time job in name only at St. Anthony, despises asking for anything. But if someone offers, he listens, explains why the tiny school with the huge hoops pedigree needs $500,000 to stay open, and waits for the next call.

"148436"	"he"	"listens"	" He's going to be a really good player because of his mentality, Donovan said. When you take guys of equal talent level coming out of high school, what separates one guy from the next is their makeup and their mentality. Al is a totally team-oriented guy, he's very unselfish, he listens, he tries to do exactly what you tell him to do. He's different in terms of his makeup. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
