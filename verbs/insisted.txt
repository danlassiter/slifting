Times News Service  Josie Natori is of two minds about being the topic of a documentary, to be shown Sunday at 11 p.m. on the Lifetime cable network and four more times this month.  The program, ``Intimate Portrait: Josie Natori,'' traces her life from a sheltered childhood in the Philippines to success, first as a Wall Street investment banker and then as the founder and president of the lingerie, shoe and fragrance business that bears her name.  ``It felt very strange to see the program going through my whole life,'' Ms. Natori, 48, said the other day. ``They went into such detail with everyone in my family _ brothers, sisters, uncles, professors, with the person who introduced my husband and me. These people now know me so intimately.''  Still, she insisted, the attention will not go to her head. ``I'm very flattered, but also a little embarrassed,'' she said. ``This was never a goal, and life goes on as normal.''  c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  NEW YORK _ Usually, James Nadeaux, the dresser for Glenn Close in ``Sunset Boulevard,'' is more concerned with getting the actress in and out of her costumes than with creating costumes himself.  ``The fastest change from head to toe that we have to do is 15 seconds, and the slowest is 30 seconds,'' he said.  But Sunday night, when Ms. Close takes to the stage as a host of the Tony Awards, she will be wearing a design by Nadeaux.  Since the ceremony is in the Minskoff Theater, the home of ``Sunset Boulevard,'' she was asked to make her entrance down the show's grand staircase. ``She wanted to wear something very special, something baroque and Old World,'' Nadeaux said this week. ``It was impossible to get the feel we wanted off the rack or from any top designer. So I suggested, `Why don't we build this dress rather than try to find it?' ''  The result: Ms. Close will appear in a gown of burnished gold with a bodice like a boned corset and a long skirt with a train.  When the Leading Actress in a Musical Award is given (maybe to her), she will be in a tunic and pants by Armani. No boned corset there.  c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  A dinner-dance Thursday to benefit the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington was billed as ``a great feast of language.'' It was dedicated ``to a dying art, the art of conversation,'' said LetitiaBaldrige, the chairwoman of the event.  With wordsmiths like Rita Dove, the former national poet laureate, and the writer Christopher Buckley on hand in that setting, one might have expected nonstop lofty conversation. But guests seemed reluctant to talk about talking itself.  Brendan Gill, the author, and DonnaShalala, the health and human services secretary, seemed more interested in sports.  ``Do you want to know the difference between golf and tennis?'' Gill asked Ms. Shalala, who said she played golf for politics and tennis for love.  ``Tennis is murderous,'' Gill said. ``You want to kill your opponent. But golf is suicide. You want to kill yourself.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950602.0454 type=story > <HEADLINE> CARTILAGE REPAIR TEST TO CONTINUE, FDA SAYS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> BOSTON (BC-CARTILAGE-TREAT-BOS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

Times News Service  North Carolina's Senate race is in many ways a national campaign, thanks to the ability of Sen. Jesse Helms to rouse strong feelings, pro and con, beyond the borders of his state.  Exhibit A: the latest fund-raising reports, which show that Republican Helms and his Democratic challenger, Harvey Gantt, are drawing aid from a wide range of out-of-staters, among them Lester Maddox, the former governor of Georgia (who gave $300 to Helms) and Barbra Streisand (who gave $1,000 to Gantt).  An analysis by The Charlotte Observer found that 53 percent of the identified contributions Helms received from mid-April through June came from outside the state. Seventy percent of Gantt's contributions did. Both candidates are well above the average for out-of-state contributions in the 1994 elections.  Helms' recent contributors included numerous Cuban-Americans drawn by his efforts to tighten sanctions on Cuba.  He also received strong support from political action committees for some major corporations, including Time-Warner, General Electric and General Motors. And he had significant in-state support from North Carolina's bankers.  Gantt raised a substantial amount of money in big cities _ he has held fund raisers recently in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and Washington _ and from organized labor.  He had an eclectic collection of celebrities on his fund-raising rolls, including Michael Jordan, the basketball star; Michael Stipe, the lead singer for R.E.M.; James Garner, the actor; and Charles Kuralt, the journalist.  Only the Names Are the Same  It sounds like a divorce case, but Doggett vs. Doggett is actually the battle for the 10th Congressional District in Texas, the seat once held by Lyndon B. Johnson.  Based in Austin and historically one of the state's most liberal districts, it is held by Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat elected in 1994.  The Republicans think they have found the ideal challenger: Teresa Doggett (no relation), a black woman with Ivy League credentials and a background as a banker and tax lawyer. She ran for state comptroller two years ago and won 45 percent of the vote against popular Democrat John Sharp. (She is also the wife of John Doggett, who went to law school with Justice Clarence Thomas of the Supreme Court and came to his defense at his confirmation hearings.)  Republicans hope she can tilt the balance in a district grown more conservative in recent years.  She calls herself a ``new-style Republican'' who will reach out to blacks and Hispanics. She says she will not be the pawn of Speaker Newt Gingrich or anyone else.  ``I think the man is bright,'' she said, ``but seriously, he doesn't have my style.''  Rep. Doggett, though, plans to make Gingrich a campaign issue. The freshman Democrat, who has about $1 million in his war chest, says he plans to campaign hard and take nothing for granted. His opponent in 1994 was a black woman who got 40 percent of the vote.  ``This is the second time I've been through this Republican strategy,'' he said. ``My support is strong in all parts of the community. My support in the African-American community is strong.''  What about the name issue? ``I think every challenger has to be taken seriously,'' he said, ``especially when there's an opportunity for name confusion.''  Likely Rematch Could Get Nasty  One of the most competitive Senate races in the country this year is playing out in Minnesota, an expected grudge match between Sen. Paul Wellstone, liberal Democrat, and former Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, the Republican he unseated six years ago.  A new poll for The Minneapolis Star Tribune and WCCO-TV shows a relatively close head-to-head contest for this stage of the campaign. If the election were held today, Wellstone would get 47 percent of the vote and Boschwitz 39 percent.  The poll showed a significant gender gap. Wellstone had a 20-point margin over Boschwitz among female voters, while Boschwitz had a 5-point edge with men.  The poll also showed Boschwitz with a commanding lead over several rivals for the Republican nomination in the Sept. 10 primary.  The current advertising wars in Minnesota suggest a searing autumn. One commercial, being run by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, declares that according to the National Taxpayers Union, Wellstone is ``the No. 1 spender in the Senate.''  The commercial adds, ``Wellstone even finished far ahead of Ted Kennedy, and that isn't easy.''  Linda Marson, communications director for the Wellstone campaign, said anti-Wellstone forces had already run nearly half a million dollars' worth of television and radio advertising against the Democrat.  ``They've thrown everything but the kitchen sink at Senator Wellstone,'' she said.  But, she insisted, ``His message of fighting for working families and standing up to the powerful special interests has really resonated with Minnesotans.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960722.0796 type=story > <HEADLINE> SOCK AWAY MONEY NOW TO HEAD OFF SOCIAL INSECURITY </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-ROBERTSON-AZR) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"

FOR SUN., DEC. 22 -- LABOR-DEATH-PROFILE-2-B&AMP;W, 12-20 -- Dereck Bridges, an ironworker in Alabama, shown on the job in a family photograph, plunged 44 feet to his death. Indeed, an average of 17 people die daily in the United States because of the work they do, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As big as that number is, it is a mark of progress: Fatalities in manufacturing and the construction trades have fallen sharply over the years.

After presiding over the most agonizing stretch of ineptitude in the history of one of sport's most beleaguered franchises, Kotite fired himself as coach of the Jets, but says he will coach the team for its season finale on Sunday. ``I wasn't fired,'' he claims. ``I didn't quit.''

In the last week there, he puts tape on a tank that was being refurbished for Kuwait. ``I hope and pray they'll work something out for the rest of the men,'' particularly since so many have worked here all their lives, he says; the Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant shut down Friday, 44,512 tanks and 55 years after it opened.

Long Island's biggest, he weighs 270 pounds and needs a size 64 blazer to cover his enormous chest. Such an appearance should provide testament to the virtues of fitness and discipline, but law enforcement officials and scientists say that such physiques can also implicitly endorse steroids and other substances.

Istanbul is one of the world's great Islamic cities, and the population here is more than 95 percent Muslim, but since the birth of modern Turkey 73 years ago, the country has been steadily adopting Western habits.

Undeterred by the strokes and depression that made Clark's artificial heart so painful, DeVries had complained that, in Utah, he was forced to ``see people die while you're waiting for red tape'' in the form of university approval for more operations.

(EDS: No byline) c.2001 New York Times News Service  A TALKATIVE GORE IS QUIET ON '04 PLANS  Everybody knew that Al Gore was scheduled as the featured speaker when Democrats gathered Saturday night in Manchester, N.H., for a Jefferson-Jackson Dinner. The event had long been on the political calendar and it made political sense, given that the former vice president is pondering whether to run for the presidency again in 2004 and given that the first primary in 2004 will be, of course, in New Hampshire.  What was not known was that Gore would turn a one-night stand into a weeklong sojourn in New England, spending the better part of last week chatting up old political allies in the Granite State.  He has made some other meet-and-greet trips around the country, notably a two-day swing through Iowa a month ago. But a seven-day swing? What's going on.  Gore unexpectedly showed up six days early, on Monday night in Portsmouth, where he rang up some buddies from last year's White House run and invited them to supper. They reported later that he talked about everything from past campaigns to future campaigns, with some musing in between _ the man can muse _ about terrorism. But they said that when they pressed him about 2004, he insisted, as he has for months, that he remained ``undecided.''  On Tuesday, he was all over the state _ Berlin, Hanover, Concord, Dover _ and those who dined and chatted with him reported much the same: Lots of talk about lots of things but no definitive word on 2004.  ``He said he was just thinking about it,'' Paul Robitaille, the Coos County Democratic chairman, said after a breakfast gathering in Berlin.  On Wednesday, Gore showed up in Nashua for a lunch and then headed off for a couple of days of visiting and chatting in Maine, a state that also sometimes figures prominently early in the nominating process. Then it was back to New Hampshire for the Manchester speech Saturday night and a scheduled lunch there Sunday _ at Gore's request _ with Mayor Bob Baines, who is running for re-election.  ``He's just trying to keep in touch with people,'' Baines reported.  CONTRADICTORY POLLS IN U.S. SENATE RACE  This, too, from the Granite State:  The conventional political wisdom about next year's U.S. Senate race in New Hampshire has been that the Republican incumbent, Bob Smith, is his party's most vulnerable member, viewed by his constituents as too conservative and quirky.  Several polls have indicated that he could not beat the likely Democratic candidate, Gov. Jeanne Shaheen. But those same polls also show that Shaheen could not beat Rep. John Sununu, who recently said he intended to challenge Smith in next year's Republican primary.  So how would a Smith-Sununu primary turn out?  The broad assumption has been that Sununu would probably win, and, in fact, polls taken for both men have Sununu safely ahead.  But now comes the first independent Smith-Sununu poll, taken by the state's best known independent polling organization, the American Research Group of Manchester.  And the winner is?  Smith by 6 points.  C. BOYDEN GRAY SILENT ON PLANS  To hear the political buzz down in North Carolina, C. Boyden Gray, big-time Washington lawyer, sometime television talking head and one-time White House counsel to the first President Bush, is thinking about _ or has been urged to think about _ joining the growing field of Republicans seeking to succeed Sen. Jesse Helms, who is retiring.  Gray has deep family roots in North Carolina. He also has the money and name recognition that would provide him with a pretty good jump start in the race should he jump in.  But he's not talking, at least not publicly, about where he stands on the contest.  A cousin, state Rep. Lyons Gray, is talking, however. He told The Raleigh News and Observer the other day that he had no indication that Boyden had any ``current interest'' in duking it out in next year's party primary with the powerful political likes of Elizabeth Dole and former Mayor Richard Vinroot of Charlotte, to mention just two expected candidates.  Speaking of Vinroot ...  He says he is being urged to drop out of the race by some top Republicans, including the party's national chairman, Gov. James S. Gilmore III of Virginia. His reply:  ``I have no plans to do anything but stay the course.''  DEFEATED SENATOR PLANS RUN FOR HOUSE  It is unusual in the world of national politics for a senator who loses a re-election bid to try to make a comeback by running for a seat in the House. Senators have a way of looking upon themselves as rarer and more exotic political birds than representatives, if for no other reason than there are only 100 senators and they run statewide, whereas there are 435 House members and, as senators tend to see it, they represent mere districts.  But that is not the view held by former Sen. Larry Pressler of South Dakota, a Republican who was turned out of office in 1996 when he sought a fourth term. He says he plans to run for a House seat next year _ ``do the House thing'' as he told The Sioux Falls Argus Leader last week.  Actually, it's a different kind of ``House thing'' he'll be doing.  South Dakota has only one congressional district. And it covers the entire state, of course.  It's not the Senate.  But it's getting closer. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20011027.0133 type=story > <HEADLINE> PANAMA PUTS JOURNALISTS ON TRIAL AS CONCERN ABOUT PRESS LAWS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> PANAMA CITY, Panama (BC-R-PANAMA-PRESS-CRACKDOWN-ART-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"

The deepest winter chill typically occurs around this time because only a small amount of solar energy has reached high latitudes during the last 30 days.

NYT News Service  INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  INDIA-PAKISTAN (New Delhi, India) _ India's army chief declares that the military is fully prepared for a large-scale conventional war with Pakistan and was also ready to deliver a devastating nuclear strike should Pakistan use its nuclear arsenal first. General Padmanabhan said he was confident he could sustain his troops' morale even if India's military buildup lasted a long time. ``If we have to go to war, jolly good,'' he said. By Celia W.

TERROR-SINGAPORE (Manila, Philippines) _ Terrorist suspects arrested last month in Singapore were linked with al-Qaida and planned bomb attacks against Western embassies, U.S. naval vessels, U.S. companies and a shuttle bus carrying U.S. troops, the Singapore government says. By Seth Mydans. 1,000 words.  FRANCE-CARLOS-MARRIAGE (Paris) _ A profile of Isabelle Coutant Peyre, the defense lawyer and future wife of Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, better known as Carlos the Jackal, who became an almost-mythical figure in the 1970s and '80s as he executed a string of hijackings and terror attacks across Western Europe. By Suzanne Daley.  COLOMBIA-REBELS (Dateline to come) _ President Andres Pastrana has accepted an offer from a U.N. envoy to try to restart peace talks with Colombia's rebels, but set a Saturday night deadline. If the effort fails to break the stalemate, Pastrana said he would end the process and give the rebels until Monday to vacate a safe-haven the size of Switzerland that he granted them at the start of the talks three years ago. By Juan Forero.  RUSSIA-TV (Moscow) _ Russia's top arbitration court on Friday ruled in favor of closing the independent television channel TV-6, delivering a new blow to the country's media. A spokesmen for TV-6 said the station would contest the ruling but held out little hope for the station's survival. By Patrick E. Tyler.  NIRELAND-SCHOOL (Belfast, Northern Ireland) _ Fresh disturbances flared Thursday as a second Catholic school was targeted by Protestant rioters after clashes that left 48 police officers and several civilians injured. Seventeen cars in the grounds of Our Lady of Mercy School _ not far from Holy Cross School, which has been at the center of bitter sectarian clashes _ were damaged Thursday by men who smashed doors and windscreens. Shocked parents claimed their children were in hysterics and had to be taken home. By Brian Lavery.  NATIONAL _ GENERAL (Moved in ``a'' category)  WTC-VIDEO-TAPE (New York) _ A video tape has emerged that offers perhaps the most sustained depiction of the first hour and a half of the fire department's response to the World Trade Center attack. The tape begins with the crash of the first plane into the tower and runs until the collapse of the second tower. It also captures for the first time some of the organizing by fire department commanders in the lobbies of the building. By Alan Feuer.  The story runs under a 3-column photo.

MONT-SILVER-MINE (Noxon, Mont.) _ On the banks of Rock Creek here in the Cabinet Mountains of northwestern Montana, the only sound breaking the silence is the flow of the icy water. But that could change. Last month federal and state regulators granted a permit for a giant silver and copper mine that would burrow a length of 3 miles under a federal wilderness area, 900 feet below the snowy ridges and the lodgepole pine. The result would be one of the largest underground mines in North America and make this the first time the government has permitted large-scale mining beneath a wilderness area.

By Alexander Stille.  With an ``a'' code.  With photo, NYT1.  EXPANDING-HISTORY (Undated) _ Over the last few decades, historical research has become more and more specialized. But David Christian, a history professor at San Diego State University, has been bucking the trend and urging his colleagues to think big _ very big. In order to understand the last few thousand years of human history, he insisted, scholars needed to understand the rest of the past as well, up to and including the Big Bang _ in short, the whole 20-billion-year span of time itself. By Emily Eakin.  RELIGIOUS-DIVERSITY (Undated) _ An interview with Joseph C. Hough Jr., the president of Union Theological Seminary in New York, who has been calling in recent speeches for Christians to adopt a new theological approach to other faiths _ one that goes considerably beyond simple tolerance _ as a response to Americans' growing awareness of religious diversity in the United States and the world. By Gustav Niebuhr.  MARK-TWAIN-DOCUMENTARY (Undated) _ With his two-part biography of Mark Twain scheduled to be broadcast on U.S. public television stations this weekend, Ken Burns continues to plumb the dusty corners of U.S. history, pulling up static old photographs and panning his cameras over them, simulating movement.

"104903"	"he"	"insisted"	" Understandably, the BBC has rushed to put out the fires. Greg Dyke, its director-general, explained that BBC1 won the ratings race at least in part because ITV had a bad year. But, he insisted, BBC1 also dramatically improved its performance, not least by producing high-quality programs that appealed to large audiences. These included ``Walking With Beasts,'' an animated pre-history series; ``Blue Planet,'' a series about the oceans; and Simon Schama's 16-part ``History of Britain.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"

"107378"	"he"	"insisted"	" Viktor Semyonov, who runs a farm south of Moscow, told me the other day that when McDonald's first showed up, offering to pay rubles if he would grow some strange lettuce called ``iceberg,'' a deputy rudely dismissed the visitors. A silly idea, he insisted, and anyway an American company (actually it was the Canadian branch of the company that opened the Russian frontier) should pay dollars. Semyonov, who had a nose for an opportunity, sent his man to grovel before the foreigners. His farm is now a prosperous supplier of vegetables and herbs from acres of efficient, computer-sprinkled greenhouses. Semyonov went on to serve a term as minister of agriculture. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"108477"	"he"	"insisted"	" The outcome was his ``square paintings,'' which began literally as squares of sun-splashed colors. Some were then accompanied by triangles that suggest roofs (as with ``Picture of a City'') and by semicircles that hint at the cupolas of Moorish homes or mosques (``Red and White Domes''). But these images were not, he insisted, abstractions of what he saw or imagined, because ``art does not reproduce the visible, but makes visible.'' Riley notes that Klee's ``seminal importance'' to her was that through him she came to understand abstraction. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"108841"	"it"	"insisted"	" The Hertz approach had little competition until 1981, when the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the official arm of Reform Judaism, published its own Torah commentary. Edited by Rabbi Gunther Plaut, it took note of the growing body of archaeological and textual evidence that called the accuracy of the biblical account into question. The ``tales'' of Genesis, it flatly stated, were a mix of ``myth, legend, distant memory and search for origins, bound together by the strands of a central theological concept.'' But Exodus, it insisted, belonged in ``the realm of history.'' While there are scholars who consider the Exodus story to be ``folk tales,'' the commentary observed, ``this is a minority view.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"

"113501"	"he"	"insisted"	" ``I admit to plotting to blow up a Jewish synagogue in France,'' Beandali said, in the statement that his lawyer read in the courtroom Tuesday afternoon.

"113971"	"he"	"insisted"	" The sharpest point of contention in this stage of the trial has been the states' proposal for a modular version of Windows. Gates in particular argued ad nauseam that the idea was impossible to achieve, and that even if it were possible, it would produce only the most dire of results _ fragmenting the PC platform into scores if not thousands of incompatible versions of Windows. That, he insisted, would stymie software developers and confuse _ even infuriate _ users. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"115788"	"he"	"insisted"	" When he visited Gibraltar earlier this month, Britain's Foreign Secretary Jack Straw was greeted with cries of ``Judas'' as he tried to persuade people there that an agreement would be in their long-term interest. Aznar, meanwhile, confided to journalists that ultimately, yes, of course he wanted Gibraltar to be Spanish. The Gibraltarians could choose whatever nationality they wanted, he added. What they could not have, he insisted, was the right to settle the territory's future. He fears that such an option would set a precedent for self-determination that Catalans, Basques and others would quickly want to emulate. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"

"124277"	"they"	"insisted"	" Some local researchers were insisting that the Athletics came into Wednesday night's game needing only three more victories to set the major league record. They claimed that the real standard should be the 21 consecutive victories by the Chicago Cubs of 1935. The 1916 Giants did win 26 games without a defeat, but there was a game in there that ended in a tie. By this technicality, they insisted, the Giants' streak of victories was only 12 in succession before the tie and 14 after that, and their long streak is really a 27-game unbeaten streak. In the same way, the 1906 White Sox also had their 19-game streak padded by a tie. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"

But none of them proved related, Moose said. ``Everyone is edgy,'' he noted. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20021014.0390 type=multi > <HEADLINE> FOR U.S. AIRLINES, DAUNTING NUMBERS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 10-14-02 22:09:00EDT (BC-BIZ-TRAVEL-BRIEFS-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Consider this, Delta Air Lines' chief executive, Leo Mullin, advised U.S. Chamber of Commerce officials in a speech last week: Domestic airlines lost $7.4 billion last year _ $10 billion, if you count the federal emergency subsidies. Since Sept. 11, 2001, the six major carriers have cut operating expenses by $8.7 billion, or 13 percent, and capital spending by $8.7 billion, or 13 percent. Passenger capacity has been reduced by 15 percent, and 267 airliners have been eliminated from their fleets.  Delta itself spent $20 million to reinforce cockpit doors, and $60 million in other mandated security costs, and has had a loss of $35 million in potential seat revenue because ``federal marshals occupy space in the cabin closest to the cockpit, generally high-premium first-class seats which the airlines can no longer sell,'' Mullin said.  Never mind that airlines are not actually selling very many domestic first-class seats anyway (most are filled through upgrades to frequent fliers). The fact is, airlines are expected to lose at least $7 billion more this year, and Mullin suggested that someone had to help the industry pay some of those costs to avert disaster.  Airlines, he insisted, ``have no interest in seeking what has been termed a `bailout,' with all the implications for increased government involvement.'' Still, he suggested, Congress ought to eliminate the airlines' need to pass to customers the $2.50 federal security tax for each flight segment, provide ``reimbursement to the airlines for unfounded security mandates'' and generally go about ``removing the national security burden from the airlines.''  Whether the taxpayers or someone else should pay for these relief measures Mullin did not specify. But just in case anyone is getting any ideas, the world's airports have gone on record saying not to send them any extra bills.  ``The failure of some airlines sadly has brought down many others in the industry,'' Ghanem Al-Hajri, the chairman of Airports Council International, told airport executives gathered in Tokyo last week. ``Airports are not the problem and should not be expected to make basket cases of themselves'' to give relief to airlines, he said.   TWO AIRLINES AGREE ON CLUB-SHARING PLAN  As of Monday, passengers on United Airlines and US Airways can use airport clubs of both airlines, as part of the new code-sharing agreement between the carriers. Members of United's Red Carpet Club and the US Airways Club can share a combined 70 facilities in 17 countries, the airlines said.  The new arrangement does not include sharing either carriers' exclusive first-class and business-class international lounges. Nor does it get US Airways passengers into the worldwide airport clubs of United's Star Alliance partners. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20021014.0391 type=story > <HEADLINE> INJURIES AND COSTLY MISCUES SEND THE GIANTS REELING </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.

He negotiated to take over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers a year ago before withdrawing at the last minute. That time, he insisted, he was really, really through. But the peripatetic career of Bill Parcells took yet another unexpected turn last week. A celebrated -- if often ambivalent -- former coach of the New York Giants, the Jets and the New England Patriots, he announced that there would be a fourth act in his NFL saga. Parcells agreed to become coach of the Dallas Cowboys, the franchise that without a hint of irony calls itself America's Team.

Pataki acknowledged in his inaugural address, Jan. 1, 2003, in Albany, N.Y., the depth of New York's budget problem. Now battle lines are being drawn over how to close the immense shortfall. Conservatives, meanwhile, have stepped up their criticism of the governor for allowing spending to grow sharply over the last six years. They have prodded him to forsake his relatively new allies in the labor movement and return to the tough, austere budgeting policies of his first two years in office.

Why not take the South Koreans at their word when they wave placards bearing the slogan ``American troops out of Korea!'' In the bowels of the Pentagon and back offices of Capitol Hill, policy-makers are once again considering a question that seemed long forgotten: Should the United States let South Korea defend itself, and withdraw its 37,000 ground troops?

"139088"	"they"	"insisted"	" Argentina retained the confidence of international investors almost to the end of the 1990s. Analysts shrugged off its large budget and trade deficits; business-friendly, free-market policies would, they insisted, allow the country to grow out of all that. But when confidence collapsed, that optimism proved foolish. Argentina, once a showpiece for the new world order, quickly became a byword for economic catastrophe. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200401.gz"

Improper transliteration from Arabic to English on his Saudi passport, then onto Hamdi's American birth certificate, made his son known as Yaser Hamdi in the United States.

"148251"	"they"	"insisted"	" All but a handful wrote that stealing wasn't the same as shoplifting because when they stole from a store it didn't hurt anybody.
