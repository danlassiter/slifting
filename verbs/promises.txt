Times News Service  BRITAIN'S MAJOR CALLS FOR SMALLER U.N.  UNITED NATIONS (NYT) _ Well into the second day of a three-day festival of speeches by world leaders celebrating the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, Prime Minister John Major of Britain on Monday used the toughest language heard so far in calling for a smaller, more efficient organization.  Officials traveling with Major say that he has a number of U.N. agencies in mind for downsizing or elimination. The list coincides with one that the Clinton administration is working from as it tries to negotiate with Congress over a reform plan. Until the administration can make some concessions to Congress, money to pay more than a billion dollars in overdue American assessments will not be forthcoming.  American officials acknowledge that the agencies now under the most severe scrutiny are the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, which the administration believes no longer serves a useful purpose, and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, whose functions may be overtaken by the new World Trade Organization. In addition, U.S. officials say, a plan to rejoin UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, has all but been abandoned, and there are serious doubts about continued support for the Food and Agricultural Organization and the International Labor Organization.  CHIRAC CONFRONTS FLAP OVER PARIS APARTMENT  PARIS (NYT) _ After his prime Minister had to leave his city-owned apartment or face prosecution for conflict of interest, President Jacques Chirac is being confronted with the possibility of prosecution on a similar charge. The president, who was mayor of Paris for 18 years, stayed on in his Left Bank apartment when a corporation that was indirectly and partly controlled by the city took over the building in 1989. He still lives in the apartment. Chirac's critics say the corporation was formed just to keep his rent from rising when the previous owners put the building up for sale. Chirac's rent was frozen in 1990 at $2,440 a month, including monthly maintenance charges. The 2,035-square-foot apartment has a nearly 7,000-square-foot private garden and is on the Rue du Bac in one of the most desirable quarters of Paris.  Traders on international currency markets, already nervous about the plummeting popularity ratings of Chirac's government in public opinion polls, sold francs heavily for a while on Monday when the news came out that a French lawyer had formally asked prosecutors to rule on whether it was proper for Chirac to stay on when his apartment changed hands.  The daily Le Monde and the satirical weekly, Le Canard Enchaine, have been saying since last summer that the place seemed like a steal, but up to now the president has not paid the complaints much heed, saying that he had been unaware of the real estate transactions. This weekend, though, Prime Minister Alain Juppe was forced under public pressure to move out of a nearby $2,600-a-month city-owned apartment he had occupied since 1990. At the time, Juppe was Chirac's deputy mayor in charge of the city-owned housing stock among other things, and in effect he set his own rent. Prosecutors acted only after a taxpayers' group and about a dozen opposition figures made formal complaints. Even then, they said they would close the books on the case if Juppe vacated the premises by the end of the year.  ENERGY-STARVED ARMENIA PLANS TO RESTART NUCLEAR REACTOR  MEDZAMOR, Armenia (NYT) _ This energy-starved nation, where most homes have electricity just hours a day, plans to restart a nuclear reactor here this week despite Western protests that it is unsafe. Engineers are to commence the nuclear process as soon as possible in this pastoral Caucasus village, after a declaration by Armenian officials that the plant meets international standards.  In doing so, the former Soviet republic has rejected U.S. claims that the reactor, which was closed in 1989 over safety concerns, is unfit to withstand the area's serious earthquakes. Instead, Armenian officials characterize Western objections as a reflection of traditional East-West competition.  Armenia's decision to ignore Western objections and restart its reactor centers on its dire economic circumstances. It also is tightly intertwined in the republic's intense nationalism. A seven-year, undeclared war with neighboring Azerbaijan has combined with post-Soviet economic chaos to close most Armenian factories. The upheaval has ravaged living standards, prompting an exodus that has reduced Armenia's pre-war population of 3.5 million by an estimated 20-30 percent.  IVORY COAST ELECTION SEEN AS MOSTLY A FORMALITY  ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (NYT) _ Since coming to office nearly two years ago, President Henri Konan Bedie has publicly declared his ambition to turn Ivory Coast into West Africa's economic powerhouse. He has even suggested a nickname for his country of 14 million: the ``elephant of Africa.'' Under his guidance, he promises, this beast will soon be pulling the rest of this mostly poor region into the 21st century.  Judging by how he organized the vote on Sunday that gave him his first electoral mandate to run the country, however, Ivorian and foreign political analysts say that Bedie's vision of his country seems to allow little room for democracy. Although Bedie's supporters say turnout was high and that the president, who took office when his predecessor died in December 1993, won more than 90 percent of the vote in a contested election, most foreign observers and many Ivorians came away from the process with an almost opposite conclusion.  If it is true that the incumbent won, they note, few here seemed to bother to vote in what had come to be seen as an empty formality. And if Bedie managed to score nearly as highly as his predecessor, the country's late founding father, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, customarily did in single-party plebiscites, the victory came only after government-designed rules eliminated the president's most viable rivals. If Ivory Coast, with its skyscrapers, glassy-smooth highways, and relatively prosperous middle class is virtually alone among African countries in its stated objective of following Asia's so-called economic dragons into prosperity, Bedie is far from alone among African leaders in seeking to hold on to power by manipulating election rules. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19951023.0577 type=story > <HEADLINE> MONDAY'S MARKETS: DOLLAR TUMBLES, DAMAGING BONDS AND STOCKS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> New York, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) (BC-MONDAY'S-US-MARKETS-BLOOM) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
