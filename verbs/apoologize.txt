By RON HUTCHESON. Story will move in ``w'' Washington category.  SKIING-DISABLED  UNDATED _ Franklin Roosevelt once said physical strength could never withstand the impact of spiritual force. But at a ski resort 70 miles northwest of Denver, it is physical infirmities _ more than 45 types of disabilities, in fact _ that bow before the human spirit. Since 1970, the National Sports Center for the Disabled, located in Winter Park, Colo., has worked to remove the barriers _ physical, social and technical _ that might prevent disabled people from learning and enjoying winter sports. Their philosophy is so simple it could fit on a bumper sticker: No mountain too high. By TONI STROUD. Story will move in ``t'' travel category.  FILM-LARRY FLYNT  UNDATED _ Hardly surprising that a major-studio historical epic should be made about one of the century's sleazier human beings. Eccentricity and tragedy have always made for compelling cinema _ from ``Abraham Lincoln'' to ``The Buddy Holly Story'' _ and American citizens don't come much larger-than-life, more tormented or more off-center than Larry Flynt. By MICHAEL H. PRICE. Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment category.  FILM-MOTHER  UNDATED _ About all that's missing from ``Mother,'' Albert Brooks' gently confrontational new comedy, is a soundtrack bite from B.B. King's famous blues song, ``Nobody Loves Me but My Mother (And She Might Be Jivin' Me Too).'' The attitude comes across loud and clear: Debbie Reynolds, as a 60-ish widow, tells her son John Henderson (Brooks), ``I love you.'' To which he replies, ``I know you think you do.'' By MICHAEL H. PRICE. Story will move in ``e'' entertainment category. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19970107.0419 type=story > <HEADLINE>     Here are the business news stories the Los Angeles Daily News </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> GLENDALE-FEDERAL (Los Angeles) (BC-BUSINESS-LADN) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
