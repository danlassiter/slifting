"4496"	"they"	"conclude"	" Times have changed. Politics today is meaner, cruder, cheaper, slimier. It is more dishonest, less patriotic, almost wholly dominated by the negative. Politicians react not from conviction but from fear. They cringe like frightened rabbits at the prospect of a 30-second attack. The weapon at which they tremble is not a reasoned argument but an inane slogan fueled by the dollars that buy television commercials. They hesitate to act lest their actions be deliberately misinterpreted and the public, incapable of discerning the truth, misunderstand their motives. Their safest route, they conclude, is to vote for nothing and attack the opposition. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199409.gz"
"4736"	"we"	"conclude"	" Nepal's national flag, surprisingly, is not rectangular. This is not an important matter, but we thought you would want something trivial to think about when gasping for breath up there on the mid-flanks of Mount Everest. Half-climbing the world's tallest mountain is, we conclude, better than no climb at all, and this is a way to trudge your way to the 18,000-foot level, onto and over surrounding peaks such as Kala Patter and Gokyo Ri (these names are meaningful to mountaineers). Views, the claim is, are life-changing. ``Trekking'' is the term used for this kind of back-country adventuring, and it sounds far too difficult for the Sunday walker. It's a 27-day trudge, living in tents and small, spartan lodges, guided by Sherpas through an impossibly high-altitude terrain. The price is not that bad: $2,185. But you have to get yourself to and from Nepal. Take a look at its flag. It looks something like two stacked baseball pennants; it's unique and worth a trek to see.

"7484"	"they"	"conclude"	" Since they say IQ is the key to success, they agree it would be tempting to give the dullards a helping hand. But, alas, they conclude, a better society cannot be built on good intentions and taxpayers' money alone. ``For the foreseeable future,'' they write, ``the problems of low cognitive ability are not going to be solved by outside interventions to make children smarter.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199410.gz"
"12868"	"we"	"conclude"	" Our inquiry is not at an end, however, for even though the employer has violated the Act, we must consider how the after-acquired evidence of the employee's wrongdoing bears on the specific remedy to be ordered. Equity's maxim that a suitor who engaged in his own reprehensible conduct in the course of the transaction at issue must be denied equitable relief because of unclean hands, a rule which in conventional formulation operated in limine to bar the suitor from invoking the aid of the equity court, 2 S. Symons, Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence s397, pp. 90-92 (5th ed. 1941), has not been applied where Congress authorizes broad equitable relief to serve important national policies. We have rejected the unclean hands defense ``where a private suit serves important public purposes.'' Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., 392 U. S. 134, 138 (1968) (Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts). That does not mean, however, the employee's own misconduct is irrelevant to all the remedies otherwise available under the statute. The statute controlling this case provides that ``the court shall have jurisdiction to grant such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate to effectuate the purposes of this chapter, including without limitation judgments compelling employment, reinstatement or promotion, or enforcing the liability for (amounts owing to a person as a result of a violation of this chapter).'' 29 U. S. C. s626(b); see also s216(b). In giving effect to the ADEA, we must recognize the duality between the legitimate interests of the employer and the important claims of the employee who invokes the national employment policy mandated by the Act. The employee's wrongdoing must be taken into account, we conclude, lest the employer's legitimate concerns be ignored. The ADEA, like Title VII, is not a general regulation of the workplace but a law which prohibits discrimination. The statute does not constrain employers from exercising significant other prerogatives and discretions in the course of the hiring, promoting, and discharging of their employees. See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, supra, at 239 (``Title VII eliminates certain bases for distinguishing among employees while otherwise preserving employers' freedom of choice''). In determining appropriate remedial action, the employee's wrongdoing becomes relevant not to punish the employee, or out of concern ``for the relative moral worth of the parties,'' Perma Mufflers v. International Parts Corp., supra, at 139, but to take due account of the lawful prerogatives of the employer in the usual course of its business and the corresponding equities that it has arising from the employee's wrongdoing. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"
"13615"	"they"	"conclude"	" That restrained increase in the government's most comprehensive measure of labor costs gives strong statistical support to an impression among some economists that a fundamental change may be taking place.

"15694"	"we"	"conclude"	" Although s10 does not define what a prospectus is, it does instruct us what a prospectus cannot be if the Act is to be interpreted as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme, one in which the operative words have a consistent meaning throughout. There is no dispute that the contract in this case was not required to contain the information contained in a registration statement and that no statutory exemption was required to take the document out of s10's coverage. Cf. 15 U. S. C. s77c. It follows that the contract is not a prospectus under s10. That does not mean that a document ceases to be a prospectus whenever it omits a required piece of information. It does mean that a document is not a prospectus within the meaning of that section if, absent an exemption, it need not comply with s10's requirements in the first place.An examination of s10 reveals that, whatever else ``prospectus'' may mean, the term is confined to a document that, absent an overriding exemption, must include the ``information contained in the registration statement.'' By and large, only public offerings by an issuer of a security, or by controlling shareholders of an issuer, require the preparation and filing of registration statements. See 15 U. S. C. ss77d, 77e, 77b(11). It follows, we conclude, that a prospectus under s10 is confined to documents related to public offerings by an issuer or its controlling shareholders. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199502.gz"
"24866"	"we"	"conclude"	" We now consider the appealability of a portion of a district court's summary judgment order that, though entered in a ``qualified immunity'' case, determines only a question of ``evidence sufficiency,'' i.e., which facts a party may, or may not, be able to prove at trial. This kind of order, we conclude, is not appealable. That is, the District Court's determination that the summary judgment record in this case raised a genuine issue of fact concerning petitioners' involvement in the alleged beating of respondent was not a ``final decision'' within the meaning of the relevant statute. We so decide essentially for three reasons. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"41850"	"I"	"conclude"	" In sum, a ``strong congressional policy against review of remand orders,'' Sykes, 834 F. 2d, at 490, underlies ss1447(d) and 1452(b). Courts serve the legislature's purpose best by reading s1452(b) to make sense and avoid nonsense, and to fit harmoniously within a set of provisions composing a coherent chapter of the Judicial Procedure part of the U. S. Code. Cf. United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988) (statutory term ``that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme,'' for example, when ``only one of the permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law'') (internal citations omitted). Thus the Sixth Circuit, I conclude, correctly ruled that neither s1452(b) nor s1447(d) permits the assertion of appellate jurisdiction in this case. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199512.gz"

"96016"	"they"	"conclude"	" Two scientists from the University of Padua and one from the National Geophysical Data Center in Boulder, Colo., have just published the first atlas of artificial brightness in the night sky _ a set of maps covering the globe and showing how much human-made light is thrown upward at night. The maps are vivid _ bright continental metastases of light set against the constant blackness of the world's oceans. But what is really remarkable are the numbers those maps illustrate. The authors note that, given normal eyesight, ``about one-fifth of the world population, more than two-thirds of the U.S. population and more than one-half of the E.U. population have already lost naked eye visibility of the Milky Way.'' Another way to say this is that to most of us the sky at night is nearly always as bright as it would be at a good, dark astronomical site during a full moon. We live, as the authors put it, ``in perennial moonlight,'' except that the moonlight is of our own making. As a result, they conclude, ``the night sky appears more seriously endangered than commonly believed.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200108.gz"

"137401"	"they"	"conclude"	" And as one moves away from Palestine geographically, the reductive nature of the analysis becomes more apparent, so that by the time one reaches the shores of the Persian Gulf, it no longer corresponds to reality. The peoples of the gulf evaluate America primarily according to the effect of Washington's policies on the conflicts closest to home. Thus the ambivalence toward America of Iraqi Shiites results from their bitter disappointment over past American policies _ toward them, not the Palestinians. As for the Kurds and Kuwaitis, Saddam was a greater evil than the Great Satan. Whatever it was that caused the recent upset in U.S.-Turkish relations, it certainl};09monstrates that when it comes to feelings about America, all politics is local. Pro-American feeling is growing rapidly in the homeland of Khomeini, to the extent tha6 many young people even welcomed the war against Saddam. ``It will be a good thing to have American troops in Iraq,'' one student said a few weeks ago. ``Perhaps that will bring change to Iran.''
