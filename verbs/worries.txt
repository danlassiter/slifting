"39136"	"he"	"worries"	" At Stanford University's Medical Center, chief executive Peter Van Etten faces the need to replace as much as $150 million in Medicare funds over the next seven years, money needed to sustain its teaching and research programs. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., the world's largest and fastest-growing for-profit hospital company, could be a source of that funding. ``We're very interested in working with Stanford,'' Columbia/HCA Chief Executive Rick Scott said. Van Etten fears, though, that a linkup with an investor-owned company, while providing a way out of the coming funding squeeze, could forever change the nature of the teaching hospital. Being accountable to investors in the health care business, he worries, will conflict with teaching and research priorities. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"

"141130"	"he"	"worries"	" Since May 25, when the letter of closure arrived from the archdiocese, Coyne has been a perpetual motion machine, trying to find homes for the athletic teams and color guard, the health-care ministry, and the Voice of the Faithful chapter. He has rearranged 15 weddings that were scheduled for the fall. He has sent letters to the other four priests in Weymouth, with a list of everyone involved in the various parish programs. He included the names of every child in the religious education program so they'll know who the families are. He has sent a letter to every family listing all four parishes and their religious education directors. Next week, he will meet with chancery officials to seek permission for parishioners to remove the 55 stained glass windows of the saints for which some parishioners paid $3,000 each in 2000. And who, he worries, will pick up the caseload of the St. Vincent de Paul Society, which provides emergency food, bedding, clothes, and electricity for the poor in the parish? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
