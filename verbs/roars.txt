"169718"	"she"	"roars"	" But I digress, and I delay, because I don't like what I have to say about the new Lifetime movie The Fantasia Barrino Story: Life Is Not a Fairy Tale. A fan of Fantasia since she won season three of American Idol, I still feel she's among the worthiest singers that series has launched. She delivers soft Macy Gray-like tones, with hints of Tina Turner, but then she can muster the fiery spiritualism of pre-burnt-era Whitney Houston. On stage, all lips and body shakes, she roars, she whispers, and she never seems phony. The night she performed Summertime on Idol, she fully earned the overused adjective riveting. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
