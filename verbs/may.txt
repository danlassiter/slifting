"19869"	"it"	"may"	" In my opinion, the Government's asserted interest, that consumers should be misled or uninformed for their own protection, does not suffice to justify restrictions on protected speech in any context, whether under ``exacting scrutiny'' or some other standard. If Congress is concerned about the potential for increases in the alcohol content of malt beverages, it may, of course, take other steps to combat the problem without running afoul of the First Amendment for example, Congress may limit directly the alcoholic content of malt beverages. But Congress may not seek to accomplish the same purpose through a policy of consumer ignorance, at the expense of the free-speech rights of the sellers and purchasers. See Virginia Pharmacy, 425 U. S., at 756-757. If varying alcohol strengths are lawful, I see no reason why brewers may not advise customers that their beverages are stronger or weaker than competing products. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"35341"	"you"	"may"	" Fortunately you can edit the data. As you move through it, a feature called Smartzoom enlarges the relevant part of the image. That can be handy, but it can also get in the way, since the software often puts things in the wrong place. Editing is no picnic. Because the data appear in a sans-serif font, you may, as I did, accept ``Poleffl'' for ``Poletti'' or miss the error in ``IBM Personal Cornputer Company.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"

"56747"	"he"	"may"	" Levy: ``There are several bases for that. One is identifying with the aggressor, which is a defense mechanism. If a child has been terrorized and made to feel helpless, he may, in turn, do that to another weak individual. He may torture animals _ or children. That's an effort to master the trauma and the sense of insecurity and fear.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"
"60190"	"it"	"may"	" ``That's a genuinely high rate of return,'' said Louis T. Wells, the Herbert F. Johnson Professor of International Management at the Harvard Business School. While the high rate may reflect the risky history of private infrastructure projects in Latin America, it may, ironically, create even further risk, Mr. Wells contends. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"
