They will move in the ``e'' entertainment news file. For questions, contact Stuart Levine at the Daily News, (818) 713-3696.  JADE-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ With ``Jade,'' ``Showgirls'' writer Joe Eszterhas tosses us a fancier bucket of sleaze. Prurient, dehumanized and unoriginal as Eszterhas' stripper expose, ``Jade'' is, at least, better dressed. Of course, so is a Victoria's Secret catalog. Director William Friedkin has reportedly slipped subliminal clues _ quick cuts of a few frames that the conscious mind doesn't register but that supposedly influence the subconscious _ throughout ``Jade'' to help us sort out the mystery. Earth to Bill: When was the last time anybody needed help figuring out one of Eszterhas' predictable suspense plots? Two stars. By Bob Strauss.  STRANGE-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``Strange Days'' sets a new standard for cinematic intensity. That's not all this intelligent, uncompromising and deeply disturbing movie does, and it's not even the film's most impressive accomplishment. But I'm warning you now: Watching ``Strange Days'' can easily leave you limp. Deeper states of neural devastation are a definite possibility. And some will experience a state of exhilaration no Hollywood action movie has ever quite produced before. Four stars. By Bob Strauss.  SCARLETT-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ That classic study of Puritan repression, ``The Scarlet Letter'' has been rendered, ah, relevant to the '90s in its latest movie version. That means a little nudity, some ``artistic'' sexuality, an attempted rape, a psycho killing or two and a P.C. rescue cavalry (it's made up of American Indians) all make appearances before the new, improved happy ending. Two stars. By Bob Strauss.  SON-VOLT (Los Angeles) _ The widely acclaimed debut album from country-rock quartet Son Volt has the surreal feel of midnight drives along rural highways. And one of the disc's most affecting tunes, ``Ten Second News,'' was sparked by the remains of a 1983 environmental disaster. ``There was this town called Times Beach in Missouri where the streets were poisoned by dioxin-tainted oil and the river flooded and they had to evacuate the place _ 800 families,'' said Son Volt singer-songwriter Jay Farrar. ``You see it as you drive by on Interstate 44.'' By Fred Shuster.  TVCOLUMN-RICHMOND (Los Angeles) _ Adam Small says he isn't normally one to attack the competition. But the executive producer of the new Fox sketch comedy series ``MAD TV'' that premieres at 11 p.m. Saturday on KTTV (Channel 11) simply can't help himself. ``Our competition is horrible, they suck,'' said Small, who along with partner Fax Bahr worked on Fox's ``In Living Color'' for two seasons and created such memorable recurring bits as Jim Carrey's warped Fire Marshal Bill character. By Ray Richmond.  THEATER-BEAT (Los Angeles) _ By Janet Weeks.  ART-BEAT (Los Angeles) _ By Lori Moody.  KIDS-BEAT (Los Angeles) _ By Barbara Wood.  POP-BEAT (Los Angeles) _ By Fred Shuster. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19951012.0325 type=story > <HEADLINE> FLOW OF FUNDS: PILGRIM BAXTER ENTERS AS OTHERS PLAN ESCAPE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> Wayne, Pennsylvania, Oct. 12 (Bloomberg) (BC-FLOW-OF-FUNDS-BLOOM) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
