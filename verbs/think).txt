"44921"	"I"	"think)"	" In ``Night Falls on Manhattan,'' there's a scene in which Andy Garcia makes a phone call to his girlfriend after a horrendous night of walking the streets of the city alone and in distress. In the frame of the shot (we used a very long lens, 150-millimeter, I think), all you see is Garcia leaning his head on the phone, and behind him, the columns of the United States Court House. What Garcia's character is wrestling with is a moral question about the justice system. It's subtle. I don't want it to jump out at anybody, but there it is. It reminds you, on an unconscious level, what is causing his pain. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"

After a frantic call to my mother, I ran to the grocery store for a product called Gravy Master _ artificial color that's already in the stuff in the jar. There are several similar products on the shelves. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
