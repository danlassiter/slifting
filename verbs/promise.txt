There's a bad joke about a vacation that features breakfast in Boston, lunch in London, dinner in Paris and luggage in Rio. It's funny only if it happens to somebody else.  Simple, common-sense packing can help prevent losing your luggage _ and help you enjoy your flight _ during hectic holiday travel.  The first step is to put name tags on every bag. Besides protecting you from loss, name tags identify lookalike luggage, so another traveler doesn't mistakenly walk away from the baggage carousel with your bags.  If you are concerned that putting your name and address on a bag will alert thieves to an empty home or apartment, use your business address instead. A second tag or sticker with the same information should be placed inside each bag, in case the outside one gets lost. Always include your destination hotel on the tags _ that will speed up locating you.  If you use an airline's curbside baggage service, be sure you hand your valuables only to a uniformed employee, then wait until you see your bags disappear onto the conveyor belt. That extra time can prevent your bags from winding up in the hands of a nimble-fingered non-employee. (The same rule applies when giving the keys to your car to a valet at a hotel or restaurant.)  Know the three-letter airport code for your destination. That way you'll be able to point out to the check-in clerk that you're going to the Portland, Ore. and not to Portland, Maine. Be sure the destination code gets attached securely to your bag.  Be aware that a new favorite spot for thieves is at the airport X-ray security checkpoint. The crooks work in teams. One thief goes through the checkpoint and hangs around, as if waiting for baggage to come off the conveyor belt, but he or she is really waiting for your valuables.  When you put your camera bag or laptop computer case on the conveyor belt, the accomplice pushes in front of you and sets off the metal detector. While you are distracted and delayed, the first thief walks off with your valuables.  Do not overpack your luggage. The stress could cause the bag to burst at the seams and spill its contents in the baggage hold. When transporting heavy or bulky items, such as a bicycle helmet, use a soft-sided bag or backpack and invest in a small luggage lock to ensure the zipper doesn't get opened _ accidentally or otherwise.  After all this, if your bags still don't show up with the others on your flight, or they arrive damaged, notify airline personnel immediately, before leaving the baggage claim area. WHAT TO CARRY IN A CARRY-ON  Federal regulations require that carry-on luggage fit under the seat or in the overhead bins, but even if your bags are within the limit, they still could be the wrong size or shape for a particular aircraft. Airlines now provide boxes at ticketing areas that simulate under-seat storage space. If your bag doesn't fit into the box, it must be checked.  Never check anything you'll need immediately after landing, or something that cannot be replaced easily. That includes such items as a bathing suit, the tuxedo or gown you're wearing to Cousin Lisa's wedding that evening or the slide carousel for that all-important business presentation tomorrow morning. If your destination is a cruise ship or large resort, it could be several hours before your bags are delivered to your room or cabin.  Also take with you as carry-on items essentials such as medications, prescription eyeglasses, itineraries, keys and maps, and valuables such as jewelry, a laptop computer and a camera.  Another helpful item to keep with you is the list of what you've packed _ it becomes an indispensable aid to making a claim if your bags get lost. PACKING TIPS  _ Never leave home without emergency rations, such as a plastic container of dried fruit and nuts, candy bar and a bottle of water or juice. If the plane or the in-flight meal service is delayed, or the railroad dining car is at the other end of the train, you and the kids won't be imprisoned by hunger.  _ An inexpensive immersion heater and packets of powdered coffee and instant soups can turn a strange hotel or motel room into an instant mini-kitchen.  _ Pack last what you'll need first. If you're arriving at your destination close to bedtime, having your pajamas or nightie at arm's reach will avoid needing to dig through the entire suitcase.  _ To avoid spills en route, use plastic bottles for toiletries, and squeeze a tiny bit of air out of each to create a mini-vacuum. That keeps the lid on extra tight.

Many parents feel a need to purchase an encyclopedia for their school-age kids. The question is, should it be in book form or on a CD-ROM?  Electronic encyclopedias are different from their leatherbound predecessors. They're easier to use, take up a lot less space (most are contained on a single CD-ROM) and are fun to use, so kids will be more likely to spend time absorbing an education.  True, these newfangled encyclopedias sparkle with interactive, multimedia fanfare, but they frequently contain fewer words than their paper-based cousins. And despite their promise of bright, shining paths to higher education, some electronic encyclopedias are what computer snobs call ``shovelware,'' merely dumping old-fashioned text and line-art from books straight onto CDs and hyping the result as the latest milepost along the information superhighway.  Having said that, I still contend that even the most egregious examples of computer-based encyclopedias have advantages over their tree-derived brethren. The reduction in bulk, for example, is most often _ but not always _ reflected in a commensurate lower cost than the hefty price tags of multivolume encyclopedias.  Another advantage: Even the meanest computer encyclopedia incorporates a ``search engine,'' a software routing that allows for an almost instantaneous search of the entire work for key words or phrases.  Instead of a tedious physical search through thousands of pages for instances of the word ``Lincoln,'' for example, a computer search can pop up references to the 16th president of the United States, the capital of Nebraska, the automobile, even the bizarre end of the American Nazi George Lincoln Rockwell (assassinated on his way to the laundromat).  You can also narrow the focus of your search by adding Boolean parameters such as ``and,'' ``nand'' (not and), ``or,'' and ``nor.'' Example: If you're pursuing information about the Protestant Reformation and want to exclude superfluous information about the American civil rights movement, you would add ``not `King''' to a ``Martin Luther'' search.  For the idly curious as well as the driven researcher, computer encyclopedias allow you to chase threads with or without any particular destination in mind. Starting with chain mail, for example, you could follow ``armor'' from medieval times to the modern Abrams M1 tank.  Most computer encyclopedias share these features and others. Most have around 30,000 entries, and although the vast majority of the entries are simple text, there may be hundreds of video clips, sound bites, animations (such as the four cycles of an automobile engine, something that can be repeated ad infinitum) and thousands of simple illustrations.  Most have hypertext ``links,'' where clicking the computer's mouse on a highlighted word will whisk you to a related article or topic. Most keep track of where you've been or allow you to place electronic ``bookmarks'' at places you'd like to return to later.  Most allow you to cut and paste text from the encyclopedia to a clipboard, notepad or your word processor for inclusion in a report you may be writing. Most have a ``timeline'' so you can zoom in on what else was happening in the time frame you're exploring.  And many CD-based encyclopedias are extensions of online databases, which may be accessed for timely updates or for casting a wider net for more information than can be stored on a single disk.  What separates the best from the rest is how these features are presented and used. The ``graphical interface'' (what you see on-screen), for example. To get to where you want to go, you shouldn't have to read the owner's manual; what to do should be obvious. Is it inviting? Is its use rewarding? Is it fun, or is it confusing, frustrating and daunting? Do you feel your needs are served, or does it leave you feeling shortchanged?  In the five years or so of computer encyclopedias' existence, three programs have emerged head and shoulders above the rest as the best general-interest titles: Microsoft, Compton and Grolier. There are others, of course, that are aimed at narrower audiences (mainly grouped by age range).  _ Microsoft Encarta 96; (Microsoft, 800-426-9400, less than $60 retail)  Simply put, a must-have. Beautifully designed, with stunning multimedia features _ 100 video clips (more than any other), 83 animations, nine and a half hours of sound _ Encarta will appeal to a wider audience than any other.  The tone of the written text is just right, neither condescending nor academic. The interface is elegant and intuitive (if a little breathless) and the choices intelligent and inspired (listen to the samples of jazz and folk music, or the spoken pronunciations of unfamiliar words).  While Encarta falls a little short on the sheer number of entries (26,000), it makes up with 8,000 well-chosen illustrations.  _ Compton's Interactive Encyclopedia 1996; (Compton's New Media, 800-862-2206, less than $80 retail)  The appeal here is to a younger, narrower audience, say sixth grade through high school.  Within the program, you can call up Patrick Stewart, star of ``Star Trek: The Next Generation,'' for a guided tour of many topics. Compton's also includes ``Small Blue Planet,'' a terrific collection of satellite photography, although you can't move around the world with quite the fluidity of Encarta's three-dimensional atlas.  Compton's search engine allows you to pose queries in plain English (``Why was Copernicus persecuted?'') as opposed to the stricter operands in other encyclopedias.  I wasn't much impressed with Compton's thin, reedy MIDI sound, and the ``Info Pilot'' seemed more like auto pilot for intellectual slackers _ although ``thread browsing,'' in the hope that serendipity will strike, could just work for you.  _ The 1996 Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia; (Grolier, 800-285-4534, less than $90 retail)  This is a little more adult than Compton's, but still centered on a junior high age range _ despite the fact that the interface is the most difficult to master of the top three. Neither as flashy as Encarta nor as kid-friendly as Compton's, Grolier is still a podium finisher.  Its best feature: ``Pathmakers,'' a cluster of grainy video commentaries by various luminaries, such as Buzz Aldrin on what it's like to be an astronaut and Kurt Vonnegut on what it's like to live through World War II.  Grolier and Compton's both have more than 30,000 entries apiece, and they (along with Microsoft) offer on-line access; the Grolier to CompuServe, Compton's to America Online and Encarta to either The Microsoft Network or to Microsoft's Web page.  _ The Learning Company's Student Writing &AMP; Research Center (TLC, 800-852-2255, $100 suggested retail)  This integrates Compton's Concise Encyclopedia with a simple but efficient word processor-cum-desktop publishing package (available separately as the Student Writing Center), with modules for writing reports or letters, publishing a newsletter and keeping a journal or diary.  It's easy to cut and paste not only text but also any of the 8,000 illustrations (there are also 75 video clips), so this should appeal to children from 10 to 18 or so.  The interface is plain-Jane and the multimedia stuff lacks pizzazz but, all told, this is a great idea, adequately executed.  _ Encyclopaedia Britannica (Britannica, 800-323-1229, $995 direct)/Encyclopedia Americana (Grolier, 800-285-4534, $595)  Neither of these will have much appeal to children unless they're bookworms with the IQ of John Stuart Mill. The Britannica is aimed at Joe College and up; the Americana might be useful to exceptionally bright high-schoolers.  Indeed, you can leap straight from the disk to Britannica's home page on the Internet. However, its mile-high price tag is too rich, and it requires that an irritating copy-protection ``dongle'' be plugged into your printer port. The Americana is slightly warmer, but only just.  Still, if you value content above all else, the Britannica offers 45 million words and the Americana 25 million.  _ Microsoft's Explorapedia series/Random House Encyclopedia for Kids  The former is meaningful to children as young as 3 or 4, while the latter's appeal doesn't reach much above the age of 6. Random House's version has only a couple of thousand entries, but the entire text is available on a soundtrack. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS  Multimedia applications, along with computer games, make heavier demands on your computer's resources than you might think. You'll need faster chips, more memory, bigger hard disks, higher-performance CD-ROM drives and powerful video accelerators to make these encyclopedias look smooth and easy.  A minimum recommendation for a PC is a 66-MHz 486 with 8 megabytes of RAM, local-bus video, quadspeed CD-ROM and a high- resolution (.28-inch dot pitch or finer) monitor to make the multimedia presentations come alive.  The optimum system would have at least a 75-MHz Pentium, 16 megabytes of RAM, 2 megabytes of local-bus video (you need more video RAM to display a full palette of colors) and a .26-inch dot pitch SVGA monitor _ not to mention a 16-bit sound card, amplifier and a great set of speakers for maximum effect. But the result, I promise, will be worth it.  (Smartkid magazine has gone online.

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Neve Campbell in a scene from ``Scream.'' By IAN SPELLING (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  ``I can't watch horror films,'' Neve Campbell says with an embarrassed giggle.  ``I get nightmares. I saw one of the `Nightmare on Elm Street' films, but only a half-hour of it, and I saw it through a pillow because I was so scared!''  Funny thing, then, that Campbell, who stars as the angst-ridden Julia on TV's ``Party of Five,'' scored her first film hit with last year's horror-thriller, ``The Craft,'' in which she played a wannabe witch.  Funnier thing, then, that her second stab at big-screen success is ``Scream,'' an intense horror film from Wes Craven, who directed the original, oft-imitated ``Elm Street'' (1984).  ``Horror is not something I've decided to commit myself to,'' the soft-spoken, 23-year-old actress says by telephone from her home in Vancouver, British Columbia.  She denies any intention to follow in the footsteps of Jamie Lee Curtis, who began her screen career as the ``Scream Queen'' of 1970s horror films.  ``I just found the scripts for `The Craft' and `Scream' very interesting,'' she says.  ``Scream,'' which Miramax will unleash on Dec. 20, offers some neat twists on the horror genre. The film centers on Sidney (Campbell), a virginal high-school student whose boyfriend, Billy (Skeet Ulrich), desperately wants to have sex with her. But Sidney is still dealing with the emotional fallout from her mother's rape and murder almost a year earlier.  The plot takes off when a fellow student (Drew Barrymore) is brutally slain by a psychotic killer, who then begins to stalk and torment Sidney. As the body count grows, so too does Sidney's sense of panic.  For her pals, however, all the hullabaloo simply adds up to days off from school and hours to kill watching videos of 1970s slasher flicks such as ``Halloween'' (1978).  But the films are more than mere escapism. Apparently, the killer is following the ``rules'' of the slasher-movie genre. In other words, virgins survive the carnage, bodies turn up in the strangest places and the killer always lurks much, much closer than one might think.  ``Sidney doesn't know who to trust anymore,'' Campbell says. ``The most interesting thing about the film, and one of the reasons I took it, is that kids today have become so desensitized to violence because of horror films.  ``You see my character talking about horror films and how she hates them because of that, but she doesn't realize that she's basically in one and that knowing about them might save her life. So it's an interesting twist.''  Campbell credits Craven with finding the right mix of humor and shock value to lift ``Scream'' a cut above the usual genre fare. She also waxes enthusiastic about the film's talented young cast.  In addition to herself, Barrymore and Ulrich, ``Scream'' features Rose McGowan of ``The Doom Generation'' (1996) as Sidney's friend, David Arquette of ``Beautiful Girls'' (1996) as a local cop, Matthew Lillard of ``Hackers'' (1995) as McGowan's boyfriend and Courtney Cox of ``Friends'' fame as an ambitious news reporter who digs a bit too deep.  ``We were all completely different people, but we got along fantastically,'' Campbell says. ``Drew is definitely a wild child, but a sweetheart and very intelligent.  ``Courtney was very caring and giving and generous, and the guys were great.  ``I had a blast doing the movie. You're covered in blood and you're holding a gun and you're fighting and doing stunts!''  Jamie Lee herself couldn't have said it better. Are we sure this isn't a Scream Queen for the 1990s?  Don't count on it, advises a bemused Campbell.  ``It wouldn't be a bad thing to have a career like Jamie Lee's, but horror is definitely not something I want to do forever,'' she says. ``I don't think my next film will be a horror film.  ``That would be a bad decision. No matter how much fun I had on `The Craft' and `Scream' _ and I did _ I don't want to become a horror actress.''  Week in and week out, Campbell faces a milder brand of crisis on ``Party of Five.'' The Fox drama, about siblings who stick together after their parents' untimely demise, has built a modest but devoted following over the past three years.  Campbell's alter-ego, 18-year-old Julia Salinger, has dealt with boyfriends and family squabbles, as well as virginity and abortion issues.  ``The great thing about the show is that people can relate to it and to the characters,'' she says. ``It's not about people being perfect, but about our staying together no matter what, about us learning from our mistakes and from one another.  ``I think it's a very down-to-earth and realistic show. We're not even allowed to wear nail polish.''  ``Down-to-earth'' is a good way of describing Campbell herself, who was born in Toronto and reared there by her father, a drama teacher named Gerry Campbell, and her actress-mother, Marnie Neve.  Prior to ``Party of Five,'' Campbell's resume consisted of Canadian stage plays, films and the series ``Catwalk,'' which was filmed in Toronto and let Campbell exercise her talents as a singer and dancer. She then landed ``Party,'' and subsequently has had to handle the joys and frustrations of fame and sex-symbol status  ``I don't really think of myself as a sex symbol,'' she says doubtfully. ``Most of my characters, actually, have been awkward. I'm trying my hardest not to be a sex symbol.  ``As for fame, it's interesting, wonderful and terrifying all at once,'' she adds. ``The hardest thing about it is losing private moments. If I'm having dinner with my husband (Canadian actor Jeff Colt) or having an in-depth conversation in a public place with whomever, it's tough when someone comes over and interrupts that.  ``It's part of my job. I understand that, and I try to be nice.''  Of course, if Neve Campbell becomes the star that many predict she will, such hassles could be a part of her life for a long time to come.  ``That's OK,'' she says instantly. ``I enjoy what I do and I'll worry about the other stuff as it happens.'' c.1996 Ian Spelling  (Ian Spelling is a New York-based free-lance writer.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Jack Lemmon in a scene from ``My Fellow Americans.'' By JEANNE WOLF (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Jack Lemmon's hat is not in the ring. If nominated, he will not run. If elected, he will not serve.  Count him out.  ``I don't think I could run for anything,'' Lemmon says with a shrug. ``I've been asked by various people. I thought about it and had a little chat with the fair Felicia, my wife.  ``We both agreed that I'm too honest to ever make it,'' he says. ``I would never be elected.''  Besides, as Lemmon learned in making his latest film, ``My Fellow Americans,'' which opens nationwide Dec. 20, being president isn't half as much fun as being a former president.  His character, a Republican ex-president named Russell Kramer, dashes through the film's daffy plot trading insults with a Democratic ex-president named Matt Douglas. They're on the run from a corrupt current president, played by Dan Aykroyd, who seems to be having no fun at all.  The biggest twist of the movie may be its casting, however. Given Lemmon as Kramer, who could be more natural as Douglas than Walter Matthau, with whom he's made seven previous films? Call it ``Grumpy Old Ex-Presidents.''  Instead, James Garner got the part.  ``I hope Walter is jealous when he sees us together,'' Lemmon says with a sly smile. ``Jim and I really did hit it off. He's actually quicker on the draw than Matthau _ not necessarily funnier, but very fast. The most relaxed I've ever been working with other actors is with Walter and Jim.''  Lemmon has played many challenging roles in a long and honored career, but he notes that he found it hard to play the conservative GOP leader Kramer. Lemmon himself is a liberal Democrat.  ``It's not easy for me to play a Republican, I can tell you that,'' he admits, ``but it was fun. Sometimes, the farther characters are removed from the actor himself, I think, the more the actor enjoys it.''  Lemmon says he didn't model his performance on any actual chief executive.  ``I know Clinton,'' he says. ``In fact, I know a lot of the living presidents, but I didn't call up any of them for advice. The role came very easily to me.''  At 71, Lemmon is still making it look easy after a career in which his talent earned him the distinction of being the first actor ever to win Academy Awards as both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.  The unexpected box-office success of ``Grumpy Old Men'' (1993) and ``Grumpier Old Men'' (1996) is simply icing on the cake for an actor whose resume includes such memorable films as ``Days of Wine and Roses'' (1962), his Best Actor Oscar-winning ``Save the Tiger'' (1973) and ``Glengarry Glen Ross'' (1992).  Still, he remains curiously ambivalent about his own gift.  ``Acting has never been an easy process for me,'' Lemmon says. ``I'm delighted that it looks easy. It should _ it should look like it's just happening and people shouldn't know the work that goes into it.  ``As a matter of fact, I'm not so sure that we should have all of these damn behind-the-scenes shows that tell how everything is done,'' he adds. ``I think that takes part of the mystery and enjoyment out of a film.''  In the best theatrical tradition, Lemmon is his own toughest critic.  ``I find it pretty hard to please myself, but that's probably good,'' he says. ``I always seem to find something that didn't work. Why did I give that look? Why are my hands doing that in the shot? I always find something.''  On the other hand, Lemmon seems almost in awe of his buddy and frequent co-star, Matthau.  ``Walter is one of the funniest men I've ever known in my life,'' he says. ``We were very, very close from the first film we did together. Our wives immediately hit it off, just as we did. The working relationship was heaven because we were on the same wavelength, and we've never gotten off it.  ``So it's just sort of like sitting down and chatting with each other when we rehearse _ there's nothing to it,'' he says. ``We just run the lines a couple of times and say, `Let's go.'''  The depth of their collaboration was particularly clear in their second film together, ``The Odd Couple'' (1968).  ``The irony is that Walter wanted to play Felix,'' Lemmon recalls. ``He never wanted to play Oscar. To this day, he still thinks I should have played Felix. The paradox is that his performance as Oscar was the greatest comedy performance I've ever seen in my life, bar none.''  The success of ``Grumpy Old Men,'' which earned more than $100 million, astounded both men, Lemmon says.  ``We didn't think the script was any good and we didn't think the film was that good,'' he says. ``Walter was concerned that anybody under the age of 40 wasn't gonna be able to relate to it or give a damn.''  Lemmon stresses that, despite popular misconceptions, there's nothing autobiographical in the cantankerous relationship that the pair share in the ``Grumpy'' movies.  ``That's just acting,'' he says. ``Walter and I kid each other all the time. But we don't pull tricks on each other. And I don't think I've had a big serious argument with him or a fight.''  They save that for onscreen _ most notably in their next film, ``Out to Sea,'' directed by Martha Coolidge. The comedy, set aboard a cruise ship, is due for release next year.  Meanwhile, the always-prolific Lemmon will reappear this month as one of an impressive roster of American actors appearing in Kenneth Branagh's ``Hamlet.''  For Lemmon, it was very much a new experience.  ``I had never done any Shakespeare,'' he says. ``A lot of the particular words and phrases, I didn't understand. I didn't get the real meaning.  ``But I had Kenneth Branagh directing, who is close to a genius and has incredible fire and energy. So I'd say, `Kenny, what in the hell is Willy the Shake talking about here _ what does he mean?'  ``And he'd explain it, usually with a few four-letter words thrown in for fun. And away we'd go,'' he says with a smile. ``I think the complete film, which I saw recently, is a monumental work.''  If so, it will be one of many in a career which shows no signs of winding down.  ``Being run over by a truck or a critic is possible, but not retirement,'' the actor says, ``purely and simply because I love what I do.  ``It really is all I've wanted to do from the time I was 8,'' he recalls. ``That was when I substituted for a kid doing a monologue.  ``I couldn't remember it. After every line, I had to walk to the wings and get a cue from my teacher and then walk all the way back to center stage.  ``Well, the audience started to laugh,'' Lemmon says. ``And instead of getting turned off, I thought, `They're laughing. I like that.'  ``From that day on I was accepted by the kids as a performer. That started me going,'' he says. ``It was all I wanted to do. And I still love it.''  Which means no White House run.

There's a bad joke about a vacation that features breakfast in Boston, lunch in London, dinner in Paris and luggage in Rio. It's funny only if it happens to somebody else.  Simple, common-sense packing can help prevent losing your luggage _ and help you enjoy your flight _ during hectic holiday travel.  The first step is to put name tags on every bag. Besides protecting you from loss, name tags identify lookalike luggage, so another traveler doesn't mistakenly walk away from the baggage carousel with your bags.  If you are concerned that putting your name and address on a bag will alert thieves to an empty home or apartment, use your business address instead. A second tag or sticker with the same information should be placed inside each bag, in case the outside one gets lost. Always include your destination hotel on the tags _ that will speed up locating you.  If you use an airline's curbside baggage service, be sure you hand your valuables only to a uniformed employee, then wait until you see your bags disappear onto the conveyor belt. That extra time can prevent your bags from winding up in the hands of a nimble-fingered non-employee. (The same rule applies when giving the keys to your car to a valet at a hotel or restaurant.)  Know the three-letter airport code for your destination. That way you'll be able to point out to the check-in clerk that you're going to the Portland, Ore. and not to Portland, Maine. Be sure the destination code gets attached securely to your bag.  Be aware that a new favorite spot for thieves is at the airport X-ray security checkpoint. The crooks work in teams. One thief goes through the checkpoint and hangs around, as if waiting for baggage to come off the conveyor belt, but he or she is really waiting for your valuables.  When you put your camera bag or laptop computer case on the conveyor belt, the accomplice pushes in front of you and sets off the metal detector. While you are distracted and delayed, the first thief walks off with your valuables.  Do not overpack your luggage. The stress could cause the bag to burst at the seams and spill its contents in the baggage hold. When transporting heavy or bulky items, such as a bicycle helmet, use a soft-sided bag or backpack and invest in a small luggage lock to ensure the zipper doesn't get opened _ accidentally or otherwise.  After all this, if your bags still don't show up with the others on your flight, or they arrive damaged, notify airline personnel immediately, before leaving the baggage claim area. WHAT TO CARRY IN A CARRY-ON  Federal regulations require that carry-on luggage fit under the seat or in the overhead bins, but even if your bags are within the limit, they still could be the wrong size or shape for a particular aircraft. Airlines now provide boxes at ticketing areas that simulate under-seat storage space. If your bag doesn't fit into the box, it must be checked.  Never check anything you'll need immediately after landing, or something that cannot be replaced easily. That includes such items as a bathing suit, the tuxedo or gown you're wearing to Cousin Lisa's wedding that evening or the slide carousel for that all-important business presentation tomorrow morning. If your destination is a cruise ship or large resort, it could be several hours before your bags are delivered to your room or cabin.  Also take with you as carry-on items essentials such as medications, prescription eyeglasses, itineraries, keys and maps, and valuables such as jewelry, a laptop computer and a camera.  Another helpful item to keep with you is the list of what you've packed _ it becomes an indispensable aid to making a claim if your bags get lost. PACKING TIPS  _ Never leave home without emergency rations, such as a plastic container of dried fruit and nuts, candy bar and a bottle of water or juice. If the plane or the in-flight meal service is delayed, or the railroad dining car is at the other end of the train, you and the kids won't be imprisoned by hunger.  _ An inexpensive immersion heater and packets of powdered coffee and instant soups can turn a strange hotel or motel room into an instant mini-kitchen.  _ Pack last what you'll need first. If you're arriving at your destination close to bedtime, having your pajamas or nightie at arm's reach will avoid needing to dig through the entire suitcase.  _ To avoid spills en route, use plastic bottles for toiletries, and squeeze a tiny bit of air out of each to create a mini-vacuum. That keeps the lid on extra tight.

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Meryl Streep with Diane Keaton in a scene from ``Marvin's Room.'' By CINDY PEARLMAN World rights except Chicago (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  The Queen of Accents has met her match.  Ask Meryl Streep to play any character, any class, any country, any historical era, and before you know it, she'll be speaking the language like a native.  Unless it's 1990s American Young Person.  In ``Marvin's Room,'' her new film opening Dec. 18, she plays the mother of Leonardo DiCaprio, Hollywood's Romeo du Jour and card-carrying Young Person. But though they represent different generations of movie stardom, the two got on famously.  Well, except when they talked.  ``Leo was going, `You rule! Meryl rules! Meryl is the bomb!'  ```The bomb?''' She pauses. ``That's a good thing, I guess.''  It is a good thing, one of many plaudits that have been directed toward her generation's most honored actress, winner of two Oscars _ for Best Supporting Actress in ``Kramer vs. Kramer'' (1979) and for Best Actress in ``Sophie's Choice'' (1982) _ along with seven other nominations.  But despite the acclaim, the 47-year-old Streep has resolutely resisted the Hollywood lifestyle. She lives with her husband, sculptor Donald Gummer, their 17-year-old son and three daughters, ages 13, 10 and 5, in Connecticut, far from the glitz of Los Angeles.  The actress is so insistent on being there for her kids that during the filming of ``Marvin's Room'' a helicopter constantly stood by to whisk her home from New York as soon as her work day was over.  And no, she doesn't necessarily understand her kids any better than she understood DiCaprio.  ``My son plays this God-awful acoustic-guitar music night and day,'' she gripes good-naturedly. ``Is this stuff art?''  ``Marvin's Room,'' based on Scott McPherson's 1991 Off-Broadway play, casts Streep in a role with many resonances for her, both personal and parental.  She plays Lee, a blond, tough-as-nails hairdresser who returns home with her sons (DiCaprio and Hal Scardino) when her spinster sister Bessie (Diane Keaton) is diagnosed with leukemia. Bessie has spent her entire life caring for their stroke-victim father (Hume Cronyn) and senile aunt (Gwen Verdon), while Lee has always run from any sense of familial responsibility.  Streep has been involved in the film ever since she first saw McPherson's screenplay, completed shortly before the 33-year-old playwright died of AIDS complications in 1992.  ``Originally, the ideas was for me to play Bessie and Anjelica Huston to play Lee,'' Streep says. But the producers had trouble finding a director whom Streep trusted, and for a time the project stalled.  Then Broadway veteran Jerry Zaks came aboard, and Streep wanted to go forward. But she wasn't interested in Bessie anymore.  ``I was just at a different point in my life,'' she says. ``I had played enough good people. I think of myself as a caregiver and the selfless one, and I wanted to get away from that and be the nasty one.  ``I wanted to chew rocks,'' Streep says.  Nevertheless, Streep identified with Lee in certain ways.  ``I know a bit about her feeling of dissatisfaction,'' she says. ``I know about thinking, `Oh, my life is over there somewhere and I'm stuck here.'''  There is also a personal connection with the role of caregiver, through her ill-starred romance with actor John Cazale, who won praise in ``The Godfather'' (1972) and ``Dog Day Afternoon'' (1975).  ``Yes, in 1977 I had a boyfriend who got sick,'' she says. ``He was sick for two years with cancer and he died.  ``That isn't so much what drew me to the material in `Marvin's Room.'''  Then she pauses, thinking it over.  ``Maybe in a way that's what made me not want to play Bessie,'' she says, finally. ``I guess I wanted for once to be the person who ran away from something bad, because in my real life I was the person who didn't walk. I cared. I filled the spaces.  ``For once I just wanted to do the other thing and say, `I'm outta here.'''  Born as Mary Louise Streep, the actress grew up in Summit, N.J., as the older sister to two brothers. Her father was a pharmaceutical executive with Merck &AMP; Co., while her mother was a commercial artist.  Despite having lived an apparently charmed life _ homecoming queen, cheerleader, star of the high-school plays _ Streep says that she was actually painfully insecure. It was a school production of ``The Music Man'' that changed all that. Streep, at age 15, was cast as Marian the Librarian, and earned resounding applause.  ``Everybody stood up. I can never forget that feeling. My mother says it ruined me,'' she says, laughing. ``But when you're 15 and you feel dorky and stupid, it meant everything. There I was, this geek who was bleaching my hair and trying so hard to be fabulous.''  Still, she didn't envision herself as a movie star.  ``I didn't think I was pretty enough,'' she says. ``When I was in drama school, it was the era of Faye Dunaway and Jane Fonda. They were va-va-va-voom women. I thought, `Okay, I'll just stay in the theater and eat tuna-fish sandwiches every night, because I'll never get a movie role.'''  She arrived in New York in 1975, and worked at the New York Shakespeare Festival between waitressing gigs. Her big break was a small role in the 1977 film ``Julia.'' A year later, she had an Academy Award nomination for ``The Deer Hunter'' and an Emmy for her harrowing performance in the NBC miniseries ``Holocaust.''  Since then, Streep's career choices have been wildly eclectic, ranging from the grim ``Ironweed'' (1987) to the slapstick comedy ``Death Becomes Her'' (1992), from the action movie ``The River Wild'' (1994) to the lushly romantic ``The Bridges of Madison County'' (1995).  ``I never set out to do anything,'' Streep says. ``All I ever set out to do is get another job. After this one is over, get another one.  ``I guess now, with the work, it's just about trying to keep your values and your integrity,'' she concludes.  And, of course, it's about trying to keep a family going while sustaining a movie career.  ``I get very pissy at the end of the day if people are not hustling their butts to finish the day's work so I can get on that helicopter and fly home,'' she says.  This can lead to conflicts with actors such as Robert De Niro, a noted method actor and perfectionist who appears in ``Marvin's Room,'' and who also shared the screen with Streep in ``The Deer Hunter'' (1978) and ``Falling in Love'' (1984).  ``He always goes and does so many takes. I'm always thinking, `Oh, come on, Bob! God _ I was done on take five and now I'm ready to go home!'''  Further complicating the situation is that one of her daughters _ she won't say which _ shows signs of wanting to follow in her mother's footsteps.  ``Isn't that awful?'' Streep says with a half-laugh.  ``One daughter is very interested in art. The other just wants to be famous,'' she says. ``She hates that I'm famous because it intrudes on her life.  ``So I say to her, `If you become an actress this will happen to your kids. They'll be interrupted and shoved to the side by people wanting to get to you. How will that make your kids feel?'''  But even the great Streep can't put that one over on a 1990s American Young Person.  ``She yells, `I don't care, Mother!''' Streep says, laughing. ```I want to be famous. I just don't like it that you are!''' c.1996 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.)

By CINDY PEARLMAN  Meryl Streep can master any language, any accent _ except that of the 1990s American Young Person, she laughingly admits. From Leonardo DiCaprio, her co-star in ``Marvin's Room'' _ opening Dec. 13 _ to her own children, the two-time-Oscar-winning actress confesses herself as helpless as the rest of us. In a cheerful interview with Chicago-based free-lance writer Cindy Pearlman, Streep talks about the new film, her struggles to balance her lives as a Hollywood star and as a Connecticut wife and mother, and how a personal tragedy in her own life helped her with ``Marvin's'' bittersweet tale of death and reconciliation.

But Canadian actress Neve Campbell denies any ambitions to the throne of Jamie Lee Curtis, the ``Scream Queen'' of 1970s horror movies. Instead, the star of Fox-TV's ``Party of Five'' sees her first two films as intriguing scripts despite their genre _ because, she admits, she herself can't bear to watch horror films. Campbell talks with New York-based free-lance writer Ian Spelling about the new movie, her unexpected enjoyment of blood-and-guts roles and why she doesn't want to be a Jamie Lee Curtis for the 1990s.

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Neve Campbell in a scene from ``Scream.'' By IAN SPELLING (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  ``I can't watch horror films,'' Neve Campbell says with an embarrassed giggle.  ``I get nightmares. I saw one of the `Nightmare on Elm Street' films, but only a half-hour of it, and I saw it through a pillow because I was so scared!''  Funny thing, then, that Campbell, who stars as the angst-ridden Julia on TV's ``Party of Five,'' scored her first film hit with last year's horror-thriller, ``The Craft,'' in which she played a wannabe witch.  Funnier thing, then, that her second stab at big-screen success is ``Scream,'' an intense horror film from Wes Craven, who directed the original, oft-imitated ``Elm Street'' (1984).  ``Horror is not something I've decided to commit myself to,'' the soft-spoken, 23-year-old actress says by telephone from her home in Vancouver, British Columbia.  She denies any intention to follow in the footsteps of Jamie Lee Curtis, who began her screen career as the ``Scream Queen'' of 1970s horror films.  ``I just found the scripts for `The Craft' and `Scream' very interesting,'' she says.  ``Scream,'' which Miramax will unleash on Dec. 20, offers some neat twists on the horror genre. The film centers on Sidney (Campbell), a virginal high-school student whose boyfriend, Billy (Skeet Ulrich), desperately wants to have sex with her. But Sidney is still dealing with the emotional fallout from her mother's rape and murder almost a year earlier.  The plot takes off when a fellow student (Drew Barrymore) is brutally slain by a psychotic killer, who then begins to stalk and torment Sidney. As the body count grows, so too does Sidney's sense of panic.  For her pals, however, all the hullabaloo simply adds up to days off from school and hours to kill watching videos of 1970s slasher flicks such as ``Halloween'' (1978).  But the films are more than mere escapism. Apparently, the killer is following the ``rules'' of the slasher-movie genre. In other words, virgins survive the carnage, bodies turn up in the strangest places and the killer always lurks much, much closer than one might think.  ``Sidney doesn't know who to trust anymore,'' Campbell says. ``The most interesting thing about the film, and one of the reasons I took it, is that kids today have become so desensitized to violence because of horror films.  ``You see my character talking about horror films and how she hates them because of that, but she doesn't realize that she's basically in one and that knowing about them might save her life. So it's an interesting twist.''  Campbell credits Craven with finding the right mix of humor and shock value to lift ``Scream'' a cut above the usual genre fare. She also waxes enthusiastic about the film's talented young cast.  In addition to herself, Barrymore and Ulrich, ``Scream'' features Rose McGowan of ``The Doom Generation'' (1996) as Sidney's friend, David Arquette of ``Beautiful Girls'' (1996) as a local cop, Matthew Lillard of ``Hackers'' (1995) as McGowan's boyfriend and Courtney Cox of ``Friends'' fame as an ambitious news reporter who digs a bit too deep.  ``We were all completely different people, but we got along fantastically,'' Campbell says. ``Drew is definitely a wild child, but a sweetheart and very intelligent.  ``Courtney was very caring and giving and generous, and the guys were great.  ``I had a blast doing the movie. You're covered in blood and you're holding a gun and you're fighting and doing stunts!''  Jamie Lee herself couldn't have said it better. Are we sure this isn't a Scream Queen for the 1990s?  Don't count on it, advises a bemused Campbell.  ``It wouldn't be a bad thing to have a career like Jamie Lee's, but horror is definitely not something I want to do forever,'' she says. ``I don't think my next film will be a horror film.  ``That would be a bad decision. No matter how much fun I had on `The Craft' and `Scream' _ and I did _ I don't want to become a horror actress.''  Week in and week out, Campbell faces a milder brand of crisis on ``Party of Five.'' The Fox drama, about siblings who stick together after their parents' untimely demise, has built a modest but devoted following over the past three years.  Campbell's alter-ego, 18-year-old Julia Salinger, has dealt with boyfriends and family squabbles, as well as virginity and abortion issues.  ``The great thing about the show is that people can relate to it and to the characters,'' she says. ``It's not about people being perfect, but about our staying together no matter what, about us learning from our mistakes and from one another.  ``I think it's a very down-to-earth and realistic show. We're not even allowed to wear nail polish.''  ``Down-to-earth'' is a good way of describing Campbell herself, who was born in Toronto and reared there by her father, a drama teacher named Gerry Campbell, and her actress-mother, Marnie Neve.  Prior to ``Party of Five,'' Campbell's resume consisted of Canadian stage plays, films and the series ``Catwalk,'' which was filmed in Toronto and let Campbell exercise her talents as a singer and dancer. She then landed ``Party,'' and subsequently has had to handle the joys and frustrations of fame and sex-symbol status  ``I don't really think of myself as a sex symbol,'' she says doubtfully. ``Most of my characters, actually, have been awkward. I'm trying my hardest not to be a sex symbol.  ``As for fame, it's interesting, wonderful and terrifying all at once,'' she adds. ``The hardest thing about it is losing private moments. If I'm having dinner with my husband (Canadian actor Jeff Colt) or having an in-depth conversation in a public place with whomever, it's tough when someone comes over and interrupts that.  ``It's part of my job. I understand that, and I try to be nice.''  Of course, if Neve Campbell becomes the star that many predict she will, such hassles could be a part of her life for a long time to come.  ``That's OK,'' she says instantly. ``I enjoy what I do and I'll worry about the other stuff as it happens.'' c.1996 Ian Spelling  (Ian Spelling is a New York-based free-lance writer.)

By CINDY PEARLMAN  Meryl Streep can master any language, any accent _ except that of the 1990s American Young Person, she laughingly admits. From Leonardo DiCaprio, her co-star in ``Marvin's Room'' _ opening Dec. 13 _ to her own children, the two-time-Oscar-winning actress confesses herself as helpless as the rest of us. In a cheerful interview with Chicago-based free-lance writer Cindy Pearlman, Streep talks about the new film, her struggles to balance her lives as a Hollywood star and as a Connecticut wife and mother, and how a personal tragedy in her own life helped her with ``Marvin's'' bittersweet tale of death and reconciliation.

By IAN SPELLING  She was a wannabe teenage witch in last year's surprise horror hit, ``The Craft,'' and she plays a teen-ager menaced by a psycho killer in Wes Craven's horror/comedy ``Scream,'' opening Dec. 20. But Canadian actress Neve Campbell denies any ambitions to the throne of Jamie Lee Curtis, the ``Scream Queen'' of 1970s horror movies. Instead, the star of Fox-TV's ``Party of Five'' sees her first two films as intriguing scripts despite their genre _ because, she admits, she herself can't bear to watch horror films. Campbell talks with New York-based free-lance writer Ian Spelling about the new movie, her unexpected enjoyment of blood-and-guts roles and why she doesn't want to be a Jamie Lee Curtis for the 1990s.

Blanchard talks with San Francisco-based free-lance writer Erika Milvy about the new series, those frustrating comparisons with Silverstone (one critic wrote that she was so much like Silverstone that ``she seems to have replicated her DNA'') and how she's handling being almost the only newcomer on a unique movie-into-television project which includes the original writer, director, producers and costumer, as well as most of the original cast.

In a relaxed interview, Lemmon talks with Los Angeles-based free-lance writer Jeanne Wolf about ``My Fellow Americans,'' new co-star James Garner and veteran partner Walter Matthau, and how his performing career was made possible by repeated memory lapses.

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Jack Lemmon in a scene from ``My Fellow Americans.'' By JEANNE WOLF (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Jack Lemmon's hat is not in the ring. If nominated, he will not run. If elected, he will not serve.  Count him out.  ``I don't think I could run for anything,'' Lemmon says with a shrug. ``I've been asked by various people. I thought about it and had a little chat with the fair Felicia, my wife.  ``We both agreed that I'm too honest to ever make it,'' he says. ``I would never be elected.''  Besides, as Lemmon learned in making his latest film, ``My Fellow Americans,'' which opens nationwide Dec. 20, being president isn't half as much fun as being a former president.  His character, a Republican ex-president named Russell Kramer, dashes through the film's daffy plot trading insults with a Democratic ex-president named Matt Douglas. They're on the run from a corrupt current president, played by Dan Aykroyd, who seems to be having no fun at all.  The biggest twist of the movie may be its casting, however. Given Lemmon as Kramer, who could be more natural as Douglas than Walter Matthau, with whom he's made seven previous films? Call it ``Grumpy Old Ex-Presidents.''  Instead, James Garner got the part.  ``I hope Walter is jealous when he sees us together,'' Lemmon says with a sly smile. ``Jim and I really did hit it off. He's actually quicker on the draw than Matthau _ not necessarily funnier, but very fast. The most relaxed I've ever been working with other actors is with Walter and Jim.''  Lemmon has played many challenging roles in a long and honored career, but he notes that he found it hard to play the conservative GOP leader Kramer. Lemmon himself is a liberal Democrat.  ``It's not easy for me to play a Republican, I can tell you that,'' he admits, ``but it was fun. Sometimes, the farther characters are removed from the actor himself, I think, the more the actor enjoys it.''  Lemmon says he didn't model his performance on any actual chief executive.  ``I know Clinton,'' he says. ``In fact, I know a lot of the living presidents, but I didn't call up any of them for advice. The role came very easily to me.''  At 71, Lemmon is still making it look easy after a career in which his talent earned him the distinction of being the first actor ever to win Academy Awards as both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.  The unexpected box-office success of ``Grumpy Old Men'' (1993) and ``Grumpier Old Men'' (1996) is simply icing on the cake for an actor whose resume includes such memorable films as ``Days of Wine and Roses'' (1962), his Best Actor Oscar-winning ``Save the Tiger'' (1973) and ``Glengarry Glen Ross'' (1992).  Still, he remains curiously ambivalent about his own gift.  ``Acting has never been an easy process for me,'' Lemmon says. ``I'm delighted that it looks easy. It should _ it should look like it's just happening and people shouldn't know the work that goes into it.  ``As a matter of fact, I'm not so sure that we should have all of these damn behind-the-scenes shows that tell how everything is done,'' he adds. ``I think that takes part of the mystery and enjoyment out of a film.''  In the best theatrical tradition, Lemmon is his own toughest critic.  ``I find it pretty hard to please myself, but that's probably good,'' he says. ``I always seem to find something that didn't work. Why did I give that look? Why are my hands doing that in the shot? I always find something.''  On the other hand, Lemmon seems almost in awe of his buddy and frequent co-star, Matthau.  ``Walter is one of the funniest men I've ever known in my life,'' he says. ``We were very, very close from the first film we did together. Our wives immediately hit it off, just as we did. The working relationship was heaven because we were on the same wavelength, and we've never gotten off it.  ``So it's just sort of like sitting down and chatting with each other when we rehearse _ there's nothing to it,'' he says. ``We just run the lines a couple of times and say, `Let's go.'''  The depth of their collaboration was particularly clear in their second film together, ``The Odd Couple'' (1968).  ``The irony is that Walter wanted to play Felix,'' Lemmon recalls. ``He never wanted to play Oscar. To this day, he still thinks I should have played Felix. The paradox is that his performance as Oscar was the greatest comedy performance I've ever seen in my life, bar none.''  The success of ``Grumpy Old Men,'' which earned more than $100 million, astounded both men, Lemmon says.  ``We didn't think the script was any good and we didn't think the film was that good,'' he says. ``Walter was concerned that anybody under the age of 40 wasn't gonna be able to relate to it or give a damn.''  Lemmon stresses that, despite popular misconceptions, there's nothing autobiographical in the cantankerous relationship that the pair share in the ``Grumpy'' movies.  ``That's just acting,'' he says. ``Walter and I kid each other all the time. But we don't pull tricks on each other. And I don't think I've had a big serious argument with him or a fight.''  They save that for onscreen _ most notably in their next film, ``Out to Sea,'' directed by Martha Coolidge. The comedy, set aboard a cruise ship, is due for release next year.  Meanwhile, the always-prolific Lemmon will reappear this month as one of an impressive roster of American actors appearing in Kenneth Branagh's ``Hamlet.''  For Lemmon, it was very much a new experience.  ``I had never done any Shakespeare,'' he says. ``A lot of the particular words and phrases, I didn't understand. I didn't get the real meaning.  ``But I had Kenneth Branagh directing, who is close to a genius and has incredible fire and energy. So I'd say, `Kenny, what in the hell is Willy the Shake talking about here _ what does he mean?'  ``And he'd explain it, usually with a few four-letter words thrown in for fun. And away we'd go,'' he says with a smile. ``I think the complete film, which I saw recently, is a monumental work.''  If so, it will be one of many in a career which shows no signs of winding down.  ``Being run over by a truck or a critic is possible, but not retirement,'' the actor says, ``purely and simply because I love what I do.  ``It really is all I've wanted to do from the time I was 8,'' he recalls. ``That was when I substituted for a kid doing a monologue.  ``I couldn't remember it. After every line, I had to walk to the wings and get a cue from my teacher and then walk all the way back to center stage.  ``Well, the audience started to laugh,'' Lemmon says. ``And instead of getting turned off, I thought, `They're laughing. I like that.'  ``From that day on I was accepted by the kids as a performer. That started me going,'' he says. ``It was all I wanted to do. And I still love it.''  Which means no White House run.  But if you could be elected an ex-president ... c.1996 Pentacom Productions  (Jeanne Wolf, who is based in Hollywood, reports on the entertainment industry for television, radio and print outlets.)
