"129301"	"it"	"cautions"	" This slim children's book quotes the likes of Voltaire and Thomas a Kempis as it introduces young readers to the joys and rigors of the bookish life. Don't crack the spines, it cautions, hold on with both hands and lose yourself in a book that you love.

"153093"	"he"	"cautions"	" There is a part of us that is attracted to violence, Schechter argues. The whole history of art and entertainment is proof; the 11th-century Bayreuth Tapestry was the Saving Private Ryan of its day, depicting soldiers with their guts spilling out of their bellies. What changes is the technology. But remember, he cautions, that whatever medium that earlier populace was experiencing -- a painting, a novel, a comic book -- to them it was as immediate as it could be. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200505.gz"
