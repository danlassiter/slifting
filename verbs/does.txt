While 7-9 can hardly be dubbed euphoric, it does, nevertheless, represent a higher standard of living, even when one narrows it down to the one final yard that made it possible. It was a yard not negotiated by an obscure running back wearing the apparel of the Arizona Cardinals, Ronald Moore by name.

(l)  COOKIE-DESSERTS-2takes _ WACO, Texas _ Chefs create opulent desserts using Girl Scout cookies. (d)  ARNOLD-NEWMAN _ undated _ It's nice to be called honest. It's just as nice to have your pictures called honest. Especially when you're an insecure, 23-year-old photographer whose claim to fame is managing a commercial portrait studio in West Palm Beach, Fla. Especially when the praise comes from Alfred Stieglitz, the great man of modern American photography. (l)  ONE-MINUTE-THERAPIST _ undated _ What is family dysfunction?

MOVING TO BOTH SPORTS (S) AND NATIONAL (A) QUEUES  Business  BANKRUPT _ NASHVILLE _ The Bankruptcy Court building is just four blocks from Lower Broadway, where country music crooners sing about heartaches and hard times. Hard times are all in a day's work in the Middle Tennessee District of U.S. Bankruptcy Court. It's one of the busiest in the nation and over the past decade has accommodated the richest real estate tycoons and the poorest hourly workers. Almost 9,500 people filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection last year _ one of them was still in elementary school. (f)  Sports  DAVEGEORGE-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Sweet, sappy and shamelessly sentimental, we present today's feature presentation _ ``Romancing the Jaw.'' It's an old-fashioned tale of love among the ruins, of fresh spackle applied to an ancient institution, of hurting and flirting and, yes, the warm flush that only happy endings bring. This is the story of Don Shula. (s)  BISHER-COLUMN _ undated _ FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH: Don't tell me that for one moment anybody expected Don Shula to think once about leaving Miami for the Baltimore Whatzis. Here's a man with his retirement plotted and an interest in the Dolphins to dispose of. Looked more like an Art Modell fling at headlining and restoring some of his lost credibility.

The pairings had barely been determined for the Olympic basketball tournament, and here was the Lakers' center conceding the gold medal to the millionaires of Team U$A. (s)  OLY-MARATHON _ CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ As usual, Arturo Barrios is pounding the pavement, racking up miles at a gluttonous pace as he trains for another run in the Olympic Games _ his third in as many tries. Only in this modern sports age of free agency, where players and teams constantly change allegiance, Barrios finds himself hoping to wear the red, white and blue of his new country.

"49173"	"he"	"does"	" Dole may limp to victory up here, but Buchanan and Alexander have clearly defined the contest. They are a pair worth studying. Buchanan, looking ahead to the Sun Belt primaries, keeps reminding people about his dead Confederate ancestors.

"51946"	"it"	"does"	" ``It's frustrating, and it can get you down,'' Mullin said, waving his heavily-wrapped hand. ``But that's the time when you have to be a little stronger than that. Your first reaction is probably, `I should retire, this stinks.' Well, yeah, it does, but what are you going to do about it?

"89155"	"she"	"does"	" Rosenberg cites the case of a home-health-care administrator in Boston who yelled constantly at her co-workers, fobbed off work on colleagues and treated clients disrespectfully. Over eight months, 10 co-workers complained to her supervisor, but he refused to reprimand her, much less fire her. ``He kept saying: `It's a hard labor market.

"93457"	"he"	"does"	" Well, he does, and I'm sure he has a few flaws. Spouse Christiane might very well report that Ray leaves wet towels on the bathroom floor or refuses to put the cap back on the toothpaste. There may be a few stray instances of Bourque going 37 in a 35 mile-per-hour zone. He might even have removed the tag from a mattress.

"95199"	"it"	"does"	" ``Yes, it does,'' the female officer replies. ``If your commander says, `You'd better write these summonses,' you don't want to hear people say, `I just had to park and go buy Pampers.' I just start writing. I don't care about the people.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"
"95614"	"he"	"does"	" In it, Cusack's Lloyd Dobler is an amiable, aimless high school graduate whose best friends are girls and who is obsessed with kickboxing and Ione Skye, the school's beautiful brain. When she, inevitably, drops him, he doesn't sulk or stalk her _ well, OK, yes, he does, but in a charming way. In a scene that his fans can describe faultlessly from memory, he stands in the darkness outside his ex-girlfriend's bedroom window, wearing a trench coat and wordlessly holding a boombox over his head, playing Peter Gabriel's ``In Your Eyes,'' his expression equal parts longing, love and determination. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"

"103798"	"it"	"does"	" Indeed, it does, and all an angler has to do to see what the lake can offer in habitat needs to look only as far as a nearby shoreline. Acres upon acres of salt cedars line the banks in almost forest-like settings, bordered also by dead mesquites and junipers, along with an assortment of cacti and other thorny vegetation typical of West Texas. Earl Burleson rates Ivie as `one of the best bass fishing lakes in Texas, and in the nation,'' adding ``5, 6 and 7 pounds are common with 8-, 9- and 10-pounders a real possibility'' on any fishing trip. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"

"154167"	"he"	"does"	" In a lot of ways, he does, Randolph said when asked if Beltran reminded him of Williams, who has spent 15 years occupying center field, the Yankees' glamour position, while treading softly in and around his corner clubhouse sanctuary, and about town. Fitting in, like a ball in a well-worn glove, primarily because there were so many other lightning rods in the room. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"154787"	"it"	"does"	" The basic narrative of The Beautiful Country is powerful and timely. Relations between the United States and Vietnam may have evolved in the last 15 years, but the global traffic in human labor is, if anything, a more acute and pervasive problem today, and the middle section of the movie presents some of its cruelties without blinking. While Sabina Murray's screenplay is hardly immune to sentimental excess, it does, like Binh himself, succeed through a kind of clumsy stubbornness. At first, Binh does not seem especially resourceful. He is quiet and slow-moving, and the height he has inherited from his Texas father makes him look especially awkward next to his smaller Vietnamese countrymen. Nguyen is an actor of more determination than range, and he is forced to say some pretty corny lines in halting, heavily accented English. After a while, though, a patient charisma emerges, and his performance overcomes some of the obstacles placed in its path by the script. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"156648"	"it"	"does"	" A: Yes, it does, because it is the word of a grieving widow and also a woman who really stood by Garang.

"166266"	"it"	"does"	" What, you didn't know that VW owns Bentley? Yes, it does, and apart from ruffling a few feathers along the shore in Greenwich, this is not a bad thing. While VW has striven manfully and womanfully to retain the British tone of this very big, very fast sedan, the Flying Spur benefits from the best German engineering. Just look under the hood. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"

"167784"	"he"	"does"	" My dad said you can marry anyone you want as long as he speaks Vietnamese, says Ann, whose two older sisters followed the rule. The captain finds it harder to bond with a son-in-law he can't talk to, but Ann says he's trying with Dale. When I force him to speak English, he does, Ann says of her dad. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
