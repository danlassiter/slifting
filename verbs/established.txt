"133031"	"we"	"established"	" In this hemisphere, we established, I think in 1986, a council of presidents and prime ministers, all of whom were elected democratically. And the council is part of the Carter Center. I've always been chairman so far. We now have 35 members. These are men and women all the way from Canada to Chile and Argentina who have been president or prime minister of their countries. So they are distinguished and respected. And when I can't go to help monitor an election, I can call on maybe five of them to go sequentially to a country to take my place. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
