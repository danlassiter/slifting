"22886"	"we"	"turned"	" Our little tour group _ seven grown-ups, Nate and Mona _ had a 3 a.m. wake-up call and then two short plane rides to get to Abu Simbel. Travel in Egypt, if you mean to see as much as possible, is strenuous. It was late morning by the time we were hiking through the sand toward the blank backside of a hill near the Nile. Once around the hill, we turned, and Nate nearly fell over backward from the shock of seeing the four colossal statues of Ramses the Great that flank the temple door. Even more astonishing than this vision, though, is the fact that the colossi were actually moved in the 1960s, when the building of the Aswan Dam flooded their original site. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"75524"	"he"	"turned"	" Off to the theater's left side, Taylor sat, smoking, in front of a stand that held three monitors. After watching them intently for a minute, he turned, smiled and said in his soothingly hoarse voice, ``I have enough trouble with plain old right and left.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"
"153938"	"it"	"turned"	" The legal battle over the compensation of Richard A. Grasso, the former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, has been a noisy one. On Tuesday, it turned, if briefly, to silence. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"169196"	"I"	"turned"	" After pedaling 40 or so miles in formation with my bike mates, I turned, alone, up a steep incline to Lutsen Resort on the North Shore of Lake Superior. I had managed to stay with the group until now, but the road was under construction and my front wheel bogged in gravel, as did my resolve. It was 94 degrees, and I was confronted by an enormous hill. Sand flies, miniature Satans that they are, snacked on my ankle flesh now that I had slowed enough to be overtaken. I was covered in sweat but out of water. As I wondered if this was the official low point of my trip, a huge road grader trundled by, kicking up a cloud of dirt that quickly adhered to every inch of my skin. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"169957"	"he"	"turned"	" He said nothing. In fact, for a moment I thought I'd willed myself invisible like Wade Boggs. I felt a little like Patrick Swayze standing over Demi Moore in Ghost. I hadn't experienced this kind of abject diss since trying to talk to Albert Belle back in the 1990s. After a few seconds, during which Manny continued to inspect the lumber and ignore me, he turned, smiled slightly, put his hand on my right shoulder and walked away. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
