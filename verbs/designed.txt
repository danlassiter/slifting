"102349"	"he"	"designed"	" If you think the super scooter Segway (or Ginger) is unusual, wait until you read about the invention's creator in this week's Time ($3.95). A 50-year-old multimillionaire bachelor and college dropout, Dean Kamen lives in a 32,000-square-foot house near Manchester, N.H., he designed, commutes to work in a helicopter he designed, and owns an island, which he considers a sovereign state, off the coast of Connecticut. He became wealthy from medical inventions such as the portable insulin pump and the first portable dialysis machine. ``If you ask Dean the time,'' one friend says, ``he'll first explain the theory of general relativity, then how to build an atomic clock, and then, maybe, he'll tell you what time it is.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"119804"	"he"	"designed"	" Although he made a name for himself in the early 1970s with ephemeral sculptures made of bamboo and jute set in glades and woods, Singer has tackled larger, more permanent projects in recent years.
