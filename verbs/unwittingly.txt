"148393"	"she"	"unwittingly"	" POINT PLEASANT (Fox; 9 tonight and Thursday, thereafter 9 p.m. Thursdays) Logline: Doesn't the air feel weird? hot teen Paula (Cameron Richardson) asks hunky boyfriend Jesse (Sam Page) before disrobing and hopping in a pool for a romantic tryst rendered in a curiously ominous fashion. Oh, here's why: As if New Jersey needed more grief, now the daughter of the devil himself washes up in a quaint little town that goes by the soon-to-be-inaccurate moniker of Point Pleasant. To make matters worse, she's a hot teen (Elisabeth Harnois) unaware of her paternal lineage (the blemish in her eye symbolizing 666 would be a good clue, though, or the fact that bees swarm over a guy who tries to kill her in a church, leaving his arms splayed as if on a crucifix). She's also blissfully unaware of the hellacious powers she possesses: Tonight, she unwittingly, psychotronically incinerates a gas station, nearly torching Paula in the bargain -- she's sweet on Jesse, see; he did, after all, rescue her from the briny Atlantic. Just to stick it to The Man, her name's Christina, and she decides to remain in Point Pleasant to search for her birth mother. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
