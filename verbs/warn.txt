"138549"	"they"	"warn"	" But researchers are now warning that the world is in danger of loving cone snails to death. In a letter to the journal Science, three scientists say that collection practices for ornamental trade and medical research, coupled with habitat destruction through pollution and global climate change, pose an extinction threat to these animals.

"143975"	"they"	"warn"	" No one denies the need for extraordinarily tight security in Afghanistan, especially for Karzai, who has escaped at least two assassination attempts. But allies in Kabul say that America would do well to act a little gentler, particularly as it presses the same NATO allies to come up with men, money and materiel for the tedious reconstruction work needed to stabilize Iraq and keep Afghanistan from unraveling into a dangerous narco-state.

"146259"	"they"	"warn"	" New York City's version of the Big Dig is motivated by a threat like those made by professional sports teams seeking a plush new stadium. Either dig a deeper harbor, the world's biggest ship lines and terminal operators have bluntly told the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, or the $100 billion a year in goods that move through New York Harbor will start shifting to other, deeper ports in North America.
