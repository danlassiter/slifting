"2397"	"he"	"found"	" Dr. Dan Gill, a senior geologist with the Geological Survey of Israel, first reported the discovery three years ago in the journal Science. Underlying the City of David, he found, is a well-developed karst system, a geological term for a region of irregular sinks, caverns and channels caused by ground water seeping through underground rock, mainly limestone and dolomite. Similar processes account for the many caves under the limestone of Kentucky. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199408.gz"
"2399"	"he"	"found"	" Beneath the City of David, he found, lie two layers of rock, highly porous limestone on top of more impervious dolomite. Warren's Shaft is a natural sinkhole that developed along a joint in the limestone. Its bottom narrows into a funnel-like shape, typical of a karstic sinkhole, and carbon dating of the calcium crust on its walls indicates an age of more than 40,000 years. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199408.gz"

"16471"	"it"	"found"	" The new study, based on a federally funded research project on fractures caused by osteoporosis, looked at nearly 10,000 white women. Overall, it found, women using the hormone at the time of the study had nearly a 30 percent lower risk of dying from all causes than women who had never used estrogen, a statistically significant difference. The estrogen users' risk of dying from heart disease was 48 percent lower overall, barely missing the strict standards for statistical significance. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"
"16815"	"they"	"found"	" And that's before the cases were appealed. The researchers discovered that it cost North Carolina about $15,500 for the average appeal of a non-death penalty case, and nearly $22,500 for one involving capital punishment. In all but about 10 percent of those cases, they found, the convicted murderer is never executed. When they factored in the costs of incarcerating someone on death row and subtracted the expense of what it would have cost to keep that peson in prison for 40 years, the Duke researchers reached the following conclusion: ``The extra cost per execution of prosecuting a case capitally is more than $2.16 million.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"

It carried Kasper out of one life and into another, from player to future coach. ``My wife might disagree with this, but I think my going away, I became a lighter person,'' says Kasper, who has now resettled in North Andover with Kathy and their two young sons. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"

Dried seahorses are highly prized in some Asian countries as raw material for traditional medicine, and a booming international trade has grown up to supply the skyrocketing demand, according to a recent study by Dr. Amanda Vincent, a zoologist at the University of Oxford in England.

The multipage spread consists of photographs of local children, provided free to the paper by an Iowa photography studio that has been sending itinerant photographers to little towns across the rural Midwest since 1932. (Terry Gydesen/New York Times Photo)  (NYT3) FERTILE, Minn. -- Nov. 18, 1996 -- CHILD-PORNOGRAPHER-1-CLR, 11-18 -- Small towns like Fertile, Minn., are being made part of the new information age, sometimes in ways they would prefer to avoid. Officials say a list of thousands of childrens' names found in a computer, used by a convicted pedophile, included many from Fertile.

McKillip, right, has given thousands of books to small libraries around the country through the Libri Foundation, based in her home in Portland, Ore. She gave out books at the library in Las Animas, Colo. ``I try not to disappoint with false hopes, but I can only fund 25 percent of the libraries that apply,'' McKillip says. ``For a lot of libraries these are the only new children's books they ever get.''

Fresh faces are the foundation of the business, and ``fresh'' means any actor a casting director has not seen before, regardless of age. But matching up actors to parts is only half the battle. The next hurdle is convincing them they want to do it, fast. ``People seem to think we walk around with these actors in our pockets, but there's a lot of pushing, nagging, manipulating, and begging,'' says Telsey. It's always a sell.'' (Sara Krulwich/New York Times Photo)  N.Y.

"79195"	"they"	"found"	" Mitochondrial DNA is different from the DNA in cells' nucleuses in that it passes only from mother to offspring. It also mutates more rapidly than nuclear DNA. By tracking the mutations found in certain parts of the mitochondrial DNA, and knowing how fast or slow mutations are likely to arise in those regions, Waits and Dr. Ward were able to construct an evolutionary tree of bear species, determining how many millions of years ago each species diverged from its ancestors. Grizzly bears, they found, emerged as a separate species about two million years ago. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"

Sharon Bailey, program director of the National Conference on Peacemaking and Conflict Resolution in Philadelphia, has held focus groups around the country over the last two years to develop programs for African-Americans, and she plans to hold similar groups for Latinos and American Indians. Schools with largely nonwhite student populations often find mainstream programs irrelevant and they are perceived as a way to keep children passive about social injustices. Further, she found, while young children were more pliable, teen-agers did not translate the skills learned in conflict resolution to their outside world. ``When talking to people of a dominant culture, we talk differently than within our own culture,'' Bailey said. ``We need to look at how we do resolve conflicts in our communities and use those tools.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"

Our palates were not primed for wine, we found, at 9:30 in the morning. We satisfied ourselves with a copy of the tasting list, then slipped behind a massive wood door to tour the Wolf Blass Wine Heritage Museum, a dark, timbered warren of low-ceilinged rooms that holds a trove of historic photographs and 19th-century winemaking equipment.

Fred Alford, a government professor at the University of Maryland and author of ``Whistleblowers: Broken Lives and Organizational Power'' (Cornell University Press, 2001), says that even though retaliation is illegal, it is easy for organizations to punish troublemakers by firing them long enough afterward to obscure the connection between the whistle-blowing and the termination. He found that many whistle-blowers lost their families and homes as well as their jobs and often turned to alcohol for solace.

Yet pound for pound, the sturdiest spider silks are stronger than steel and stretchier than nylon.  With such remarkable properties, it's no wonder that researchers have made numerous attempts to synthesize spider silk for industrial and medical applications. (Efforts to farm the arachnids have failed as a result of their territorial nature.)  Indeed, in the words of one scientist, this goal has long stood as the ``Holy Grail of material science.''  To that end, findings published in the journal Science represent a big step toward making that dream an ironclad reality. According to the report, a team led by investigators at the Canadian company Nexia Biotechnologies has coaxed mammalian cells into producing spinnable proteins by equipping them with spider silk genes. After harvesting the proteins, the scientists spun them from a water-based solution into fine, silken threads.  The synthetic strands possess the strength and toughness _ although not quite the tenacity _ of spider-made dragline silks, the ones the creatures use in their web frames and safety lines.  Looking forward, Nexia hopes to produce large quantities of the recombinant spider silk, trade-named BioSteelR, using goats engineered to produce the spider silk proteins in their milk. If successful, future applications of harvested silk could include medical sutures, high-strength composites and soft body armor. USE OF TANNING LAMPS LINKED TO INCREASED RISK OF SKIN CANCER By KATE WONG  Each year millions of Americans visit tanning salons in search of that ``healthy glow.'' But if you think tanning beds are a safe alternative to sunbathing, think again.  The results of a new study, detailed in a report published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, suggest that people who use these devices may have an increased risk of developing skin cancers.  The findings shouldn't come as a surprise, according to Dartmouth Medical School epidemiologist Margaret R. Karagas, the lead author of the report.  ``We know that ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure that comes from the sun is a major cause of skin cancer,'' she says. ``Tanning lamps mimic sunlight and provide such an intense, concentrated dose of UVR, we would predict that people who use these devices may get skin cancers.  ``Also, tanning-lamp users often get a burn like a sunburn, and sunburns are linked to the risk of all three skin cancers _ basal cell, squamous cell and melanoma.''  Karagas and her colleagues focused on the association between tanning devices and the more prevalent basal cell and squamous cell cancers, which together constitute the most common malignancy in the United States.  The team interviewed 603 basal cell carcinoma patients, 293 squamous cell carcinoma patients and 540 skin cancer-free individuals to obtain information about their tanning device use, sun exposure history, sun sensitivity and other skin cancer risk factors.  Participants who reported any use of tanning devices, they found, were 2.5 times more likely to develop squamous cell carcinoma and 1.5 times more likely to develop basal cell carcinoma than those who didn't. Factors such as previous sun exposure, sunbathing and sunburns did not account for these increased risks. CLONED MICE DIE EARLY, STUDY SHOWS By SARAH GRAHAM  Ethical considerations aside, a major issue in cloning is whether or not clones are as healthy as normally conceived animals. The evidence so far has been mixed. Some cloned cows have received clean bills of health, but Dolly (the cloned sheep) suffers from premature arthritis, and many cloned animals are obese.  According to a report published online by the journal Nature Genetics, mice cloned from somatic cells fare particularly poorly. Indeed, the study found that cloned mice had significantly shorter life spans than did their naturally born counterparts.  Atsuo Ogura of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Tokyo, Japan, and colleagues cloned a dozen male mice and compared their development with that of animals with the same genetic background born through either natural mating or in vitro fertilization (IVF).  The first cloned mouse died after 311 days, and 10 passed away within 800 days. In contrast, only one out of seven naturally conceived mice died within 800 days. The IVF mice also lived longer on average than did the cloned animals.  The researchers determined that the clones suffered from severe pneumonia and liver failure, ailments that did not affect the control mice. In a second group of cloned mice, they found reduced antibody production, suggesting that the immune systems of the cloned animals are less adept at fighting off infections than are those of regular animals.  But because two of the clones are still alive and may achieve normal life spans, the scientists caution that clone longevity may depend on a multitude of factors, including genetic background and the type of cell utilized as a donor. -0-  For more information on the topics covered in the Scientific American News Service, visit www.sciam.com.

The evidence so far has been mixed. Some cloned cows have received clean bills of health, but Dolly (the cloned sheep) suffers from premature arthritis, and many cloned animals are obese.  According to a report published online by the journal Nature Genetics, mice cloned from somatic cells fare particularly poorly. Indeed, the study found that cloned mice had significantly shorter life spans than did their naturally born counterparts.  Atsuo Ogura of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Tokyo, Japan, and colleagues cloned a dozen male mice and compared their development with that of animals with the same genetic background born through either natural mating or in vitro fertilization (IVF).  The first cloned mouse died after 311 days, and 10 passed away within 800 days. In contrast, only one out of seven naturally conceived mice died within 800 days. The IVF mice also lived longer on average than did the cloned animals.  The researchers determined that the clones suffered from severe pneumonia and liver failure, ailments that did not affect the control mice. In a second group of cloned mice, they found reduced antibody production, suggesting that the immune systems of the cloned animals are less adept at fighting off infections than are those of regular animals.  But because two of the clones are still alive and may achieve normal life spans, the scientists caution that clone longevity may depend on a multitude of factors, including genetic background and the type of cell utilized as a donor. -0-  For more information on the topics covered in the Scientific American News Service, visit www.sciam.com.

Yet pound for pound, the sturdiest spider silks are stronger than steel and stretchier than nylon.  With such remarkable properties, it's no wonder that researchers have made numerous attempts to synthesize spider silk for industrial and medical applications. (Efforts to farm the arachnids have failed as a result of their territorial nature.)  Indeed, in the words of one scientist, this goal has long stood as the ``Holy Grail of material science.''  To that end, findings published in the journal Science represent a big step toward making that dream an ironclad reality. According to the report, a team led by investigators at the Canadian company Nexia Biotechnologies has coaxed mammalian cells into producing spinnable proteins by equipping them with spider silk genes. After harvesting the proteins, the scientists spun them from a water-based solution into fine, silken threads.  The synthetic strands possess the strength and toughness _ although not quite the tenacity _ of spider-made dragline silks, the ones the creatures use in their web frames and safety lines.  Looking forward, Nexia hopes to produce large quantities of the recombinant spider silk, trade-named BioSteelR, using goats engineered to produce the spider silk proteins in their milk. If successful, future applications of harvested silk could include medical sutures, high-strength composites and soft body armor. USE OF TANNING LAMPS LINKED TO INCREASED RISK OF SKIN CANCER By KATE WONG  Each year millions of Americans visit tanning salons in search of that ``healthy glow.'' But if you think tanning beds are a safe alternative to sunbathing, think again.  The results of a new study, detailed in a report published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, suggest that people who use these devices may have an increased risk of developing skin cancers.  The findings shouldn't come as a surprise, according to Dartmouth Medical School epidemiologist Margaret R. Karagas, the lead author of the report.  ``We know that ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure that comes from the sun is a major cause of skin cancer,'' she says. ``Tanning lamps mimic sunlight and provide such an intense, concentrated dose of UVR, we would predict that people who use these devices may get skin cancers.  ``Also, tanning-lamp users often get a burn like a sunburn, and sunburns are linked to the risk of all three skin cancers _ basal cell, squamous cell and melanoma.''  Karagas and her colleagues focused on the association between tanning devices and the more prevalent basal cell and squamous cell cancers, which together constitute the most common malignancy in the United States.  The team interviewed 603 basal cell carcinoma patients, 293 squamous cell carcinoma patients and 540 skin cancer-free individuals to obtain information about their tanning device use, sun exposure history, sun sensitivity and other skin cancer risk factors.  Participants who reported any use of tanning devices, they found, were 2.5 times more likely to develop squamous cell carcinoma and 1.5 times more likely to develop basal cell carcinoma than those who didn't. Factors such as previous sun exposure, sunbathing and sunburns did not account for these increased risks.

Though this subset of bettors is relatively small, the results of a study published in Psychology and Addictive Behaviors, a journal of the American Psychological Association, suggests that they have more serious habits than do other gamblers.  The findings come from an analysis of the gambling behaviors of 389 individuals who sought free or reduced-cost dental or health care at the University of Connecticut's health clinics.  George T. Ladd and Nancy M. Petry of the university's health center, who conducted the research, obtained their data from questionnaires. They found that all respondents had gambled at some point in their lives, and some 70 percent had tempted fortune in the past two months.  Nearly 11 percent, the researchers found, met the criteria for problem gamblers; more than 15 percent for pathological gamblers. Only 8 percent reported gambling online, but of these, three-fourths exhibited problematic or pathological habits.  Among the non-Internet bettors, in contrast, only 22 percent showed indications of such serious gambling problems.  Overall, the Internet gamblers were more often single and younger than other gamblers. Surprisingly, though, they also tended to have lower education and income levels. (Internet access is usually associated with higher education and income levels.)  Exactly what that means is unclear, but the researchers posit that ``the availability of Internet gambling may draw individuals who seek out isolated and anonymous contexts for their gambling behaviors.'' STUDY LAYS BARE THE PHYSIOLOGY OF ERECTION By KATE WONG  The physical and psychological triggers underlying penile erection are fairly obvious. What happens at the physiological level, however, has proved harder to discern.  To that end, study results published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences will no doubt prove insightful.  According to the report, the same chemical compound that causes an erection also maintains it over time. The findings could aid efforts to develop treatments for erectile dysfunction.  Building on previous work indicating that the release of the neurotransmitter nitric oxide from nerve endings in the penis produces erection, a team of Johns Hopkins University researchers led by Arthur Burnett focused on the role of the compound over time.  Their research on rats and mice indicates that nitric oxide released at the onset of erection dilates the blood vessels, which enables blood to flow to the penis. That increased blood flow, the team discovered, slightly stresses the blood vessel wall, which prompts the release of more nitric oxide from the cells lining that wall, relaxing more tissue and allowing more blood to enter.  The process repeats, sustaining erection.  The investigators conclude that drugs that prevent the inhibition of nitric oxide production might alleviate impotence.  ``The physiology of erection is like driving a car,'' Burnett says. ``You can't just turn the key and expect to go anywhere. You also need to hit and hold the accelerator.'' FISH IN ALGAE-RICH LAKES MAY ABSORB LESS MERCURY By SARAH GRAHAM  Recently, the Food and Drug Administration decided to revisit its recommendations regarding fish consumption for pregnant women because of mercury's harmful effects on developing fetuses.  It seems that determining advisories is as complicated as understanding the metal's path through the environment. Now scientists have elucidated one element of its distribution.  According to a study published online by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the amount of algae present in a lake may affect how much mercury makes its way up the local food chain. The findings could clarify why concentrations of the element in the water don't always indicate corresponding levels in fish.  Paul C. Pickhardt of Dartmouth College and colleagues set up and monitored a dozen 450-liter tanks containing varying levels of nutrients and algae as well as precise amounts of traceable mercury and methylmecury (the form that bioaccumulates in the fatty tissue of fish). They found that the algae incorporated mercury within 24 hours.  The researchers next added to the tanks zooplankton that feeds on algae; they measured their uptake of mercury.  Zooplankton in tanks with low levels of algae, they found, had methylmercury levels two to three times those found in zooplankton from tanks containing higher levels of algae.  According to the report, in systems with less algae, each individual cell has a higher concentration of the compound and the zooplankton (which fish feed on) eat more mercury with each meal.  ``These results tell us that over the season in a lake, changes that cause the algae to increase or decrease can also quickly produce changes in the amount of mercury that moves through the ecosystem,'' study co-author Carol Folt says.  The authors caution that their data contain ``a substantial amount of unexplained variation.''  To better understand why fish in similar lakes can have differing levels of mercury, the team plans to study four bodies of water that contain both high and low levels of algae. -0-  For more information on the topics covered in the Scientific American News Service, visit www.sciam.com.

Though this subset of bettors is relatively small, the results of a study published in Psychology and Addictive Behaviors, a journal of the American Psychological Association, suggests that they have more serious habits than do other gamblers.  The findings come from an analysis of the gambling behaviors of 389 individuals who sought free or reduced-cost dental or health care at the University of Connecticut's health clinics.  George T. Ladd and Nancy M. Petry of the university's health center, who conducted the research, obtained their data from questionnaires. They found that all respondents had gambled at some point in their lives, and some 70 percent had tempted fortune in the past two months.  Nearly 11 percent, the researchers found, met the criteria for problem gamblers; more than 15 percent for pathological gamblers. Only 8 percent reported gambling online, but of these, three-fourths exhibited problematic or pathological habits.  Among the non-Internet bettors, in contrast, only 22 percent showed indications of such serious gambling problems.  Overall, the Internet gamblers were more often single and younger than other gamblers. Surprisingly, though, they also tended to have lower education and income levels. (Internet access is usually associated with higher education and income levels.)  Exactly what that means is unclear, but the researchers posit that ``the availability of Internet gambling may draw individuals who seek out isolated and anonymous contexts for their gambling behaviors.'' STUDY LAYS BARE THE PHYSIOLOGY OF ERECTION By KATE WONG  The physical and psychological triggers underlying penile erection are fairly obvious. What happens at the physiological level, however, has proved harder to discern.  To that end, study results published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences will no doubt prove insightful.  According to the report, the same chemical compound that causes an erection also maintains it over time. The findings could aid efforts to develop treatments for erectile dysfunction.  Building on previous work indicating that the release of the neurotransmitter nitric oxide from nerve endings in the penis produces erection, a team of Johns Hopkins University researchers led by Arthur Burnett focused on the role of the compound over time.  Their research on rats and mice indicates that nitric oxide released at the onset of erection dilates the blood vessels, which enables blood to flow to the penis. That increased blood flow, the team discovered, slightly stresses the blood vessel wall, which prompts the release of more nitric oxide from the cells lining that wall, relaxing more tissue and allowing more blood to enter.  The process repeats, sustaining erection.  The investigators conclude that drugs that prevent the inhibition of nitric oxide production might alleviate impotence.  ``The physiology of erection is like driving a car,'' Burnett says. ``You can't just turn the key and expect to go anywhere. You also need to hit and hold the accelerator.'' FISH IN ALGAE-RICH LAKES MAY ABSORB LESS MERCURY By SARAH GRAHAM  Recently, the Food and Drug Administration decided to revisit its recommendations regarding fish consumption for pregnant women because of mercury's harmful effects on developing fetuses.  It seems that determining advisories is as complicated as understanding the metal's path through the environment. Now scientists have elucidated one element of its distribution.  According to a study published online by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the amount of algae present in a lake may affect how much mercury makes its way up the local food chain. The findings could clarify why concentrations of the element in the water don't always indicate corresponding levels in fish.  Paul C. Pickhardt of Dartmouth College and colleagues set up and monitored a dozen 450-liter tanks containing varying levels of nutrients and algae as well as precise amounts of traceable mercury and methylmecury (the form that bioaccumulates in the fatty tissue of fish). They found that the algae incorporated mercury within 24 hours.  The researchers next added to the tanks zooplankton that feeds on algae; they measured their uptake of mercury.  Zooplankton in tanks with low levels of algae, they found, had methylmercury levels two to three times those found in zooplankton from tanks containing higher levels of algae.  According to the report, in systems with less algae, each individual cell has a higher concentration of the compound and the zooplankton (which fish feed on) eat more mercury with each meal.  ``These results tell us that over the season in a lake, changes that cause the algae to increase or decrease can also quickly produce changes in the amount of mercury that moves through the ecosystem,'' study co-author Carol Folt says.  The authors caution that their data contain ``a substantial amount of unexplained variation.''  To better understand why fish in similar lakes can have differing levels of mercury, the team plans to study four bodies of water that contain both high and low levels of algae. -0-  For more information on the topics covered in the Scientific American News Service, visit www.sciam.com.

But Breslau says this is a short-lived effect of withdrawal which masks the reality that, in general, smokers have higher anxiety levels than nonsmokers or ex-smokers.

"113476"	"I"	"found"	" Sparkling wines other than champagne are often not worth the trouble it takes to open the bottle. South Africa's, the few sampled at least, turn out to be an unexpected treat. I especially liked Graham Beck's Brut, which is a 50-50 chardonnay/pinot noir blend, and two sparklers from Cabriere Estate: the Cuvee Belle Rose, a rose from pinot noir grapes, and the all-chardonnay blanc de blancs, which, I found, goes extremely well with Namibian oysters. None of these wines are going to knock Krug's Clos du Mesnil off its well-deserved pedestal, but they will give lots of lesser champagnes serious competition. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"

(Ballantine, $14.95.) The author's 15th novel focuses on the coming of age of Rebecca Davitch, a Baltimore party planner, widow and family matriarch who finds at the age of 53 that she has ``turned into the wrong person'' and sets out to reclaim her ``original self.'' ``Maybe there's something glorious to be said, after all, for companionship, common cause and sanctuary,'' John Leonard wrote here in 2001. ``And what there is to say, Anne Tyler has been saying for decades, with gravity and grace.''  NOW DIG THIS: THE UNSPEAKABLE WRITINGS OF TERRY SOUTHERN, 1950-1995. Edited by Nile Southern and Josh Alan Friedman. (Grove, $13.) Satirical novelist (``The Magic Christian''), screenplay writer (a co-author of ``Dr. Strangelove'') and inveterate party animal, Southern may have been the hippest guy on the planet in the 1960s, before his baffling decline. This ragbag of work reveals an author ``of great force and wit'' who was ``defined by his generosity, by the pursuit of fun and by an insatiable hunger,'' Claire Dederer said here last year.  GABRIEL'S STORY, by David Anthony Durham. (Anchor, $13.) The hero of this first novel is a 15-year-old black youth who is unwittingly drawn into a violent, lawless world when he takes off from his family's Kansas homestead for Texas cowboy country after the Civil War. `` `Gabriel's Story' is both artistically impressive and emotionally satisfying, a serious work that heads off in exhilarating directions,'' Maria Russo wrote in these pages last year.  PARADISE PARK, by Allegra Goodman. (Delta, $12.95.) Sharon Spiegelman, this novel's exasperating narrator, is a supreme flake who drives everyone nuts with her nonstop spiritual questing and questioning, but in looking back on two decades of searching for ecstasy (much of the time in Hawaii), she comes off as funny and weirdly lovable. In ``Goodman's ebullient, bittersweet, plaintive Song of Sharon, the heroine's true achievement is finding poetry in the prosaic business of becoming who she's been all along,'' Jennifer Schuessler said here in 2001.  FACING THE WIND: A TRUE STORY OF TRAGEDY AND RECONCILIATION, by Julie Salamon. (Random House, $13.95.) This chilling account tells of a lawyer who murdered his wife and children (among them a son born blind, deaf and brain-damaged), was found insane and began a new life when he was released from custody two years later. The book, whose author is now a television critic for The Times, ``raises profound questions: of guilt, retribution, justice, redemption and absolution,'' James B. Stewart said here last year. ``It is a rare combination of superb reporting and narrative skill.''  THE OLD AMERICAN, by Ernest Hebert. (University Press of New England, $15.95.) Inspired by a true story, this novel is about a New Hampshire man who is captured by an Indian raiding party during the French and Indian War and spirited off to Canada, where he builds a deep relationship with his captor, an aging chief. Last year our reviewer, William Ferguson, admired the tale's ``fine historical sensibility and sympathetic imagination.''  NICKEL AND DIMED: ON (NOT) GETTING BY IN AMERICA, by Barbara Ehrenreich. (Metropolitan/Owl/Holt, $13.) In 1998, to gauge how much prosperity was trickling down to the working poor, the author spent three months as an unskilled worker in Key West, Fla., Minneapolis and Portland, Me., doing everything from housecleaning to waitressing. Life is harsh in low-wage America, she found, with survival difficult even for those holding down two jobs. In 2001 in these pages, Dorothy Gallagher found this ``a valuable and illuminating book'' by ``our premier reporter of the underside of capitalism.''  LOST LAKE: STORIES, by Mark Slouka. (Vintage Contemporaries, $13.) This first collection of short fiction about fishermen and Czech refugees in a New York summer community is imbued with a sense that life and death cannot be separated. In 1998 our reviewer, Gary Amdahl, found these tales ``beautiful and mysterious.''  THE PIANO SHOP ON THE LEFT BANK: DISCOVERING A FORGOTTEN PASSION IN A PARIS ATELIER, by Thad Carhart. (Random House, $13.95.) Though this book records an expatriate American's obsession with pianos _ their history and playing _ its deeper subject is his engagement with France. ``He conveys the French character in the darting and unexpected flight of its mind,'' Richard Eder said in The Times last year. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020427.0211 type=story > <HEADLINE> BEST SELLERS: CHILDREN'S PAPERBACK BOOKS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-BESTSELLERS-CHILDREN-$ADV05-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"114275"	"he"	"found"	" He investigated the artifacts of households and public works to open a new window on a society of long ago.

"115936"	"he"	"found"	" Neumark's study also found that living-wage laws were a boon to municipal labor unions, which have lobbied for these laws. By raising the wage that contractors must pay, he found, these laws make it less tempting for cities to seek to save money by privatizing services. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"116806"	"I"	"found"	" Our tasting, I found, was a rather forceful indication that none of us were carried away by the group and that there is clearly room for improvement in this price range. Who will do for whites what the exciting wines from southern Italy are doing for red wine? I would put my money on the racy sauvignon blancs from the Loire, from New Zealand, from just about everywhere. For the moment, it seems that inexpensive chardonnay isn't going anywhere. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"117327"	"they"	"found"	" Obesity, they found, ranked behind AIDS, cancer, heart disease and diabetes as a ``very serious concern'' for those surveyed, even though obesity kills more people than AIDS and often underlies heart disease and diabetes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"118098"	"he"	"found"	" Damon met with Liman and, excited by screenwriter Tony Gilroy's emphasis on character over explosions, agreed to make the movie. Damon then spent the next few months learning all about boxing, martial arts and weapons. When he arrived in Paris to begin filming, he found, much to his surprise and dismay, that Gilroy's script had been completely rewritten. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"118343"	"she"	"found"	" Barish was an art history major in college. Garber, she found, is surprisingly well versed in the classics. ``Her technique is really old-fashioned,'' she said. Titian, Giotto and van Eyck all worked in grisaille. Through Garber, Barish thought she had found an alternative to the stuffy society portrait. Garber asked her to gather her favorite things about her _ statues of squirrels, family photographs, a pair of handcuffs (her husband produced ``9{ Weeks,'' the erotic thriller). The two considered having the objects appear in a convex mirror, as in Jan van Eyck's ``Arnolfini Marriage'' of 1434, but decided instead to place them around Barish, almost pushing her into the background. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"

She was not wheezing much, they found, but seemed unwilling to answer their questions. They looked through the folder. Sure enough, she had a psychiatric history that could account for her odd behavior. They decided she had mild asthma, possible tuberculosis and psychosis.

"122675"	"he"	"found"	" Siegel provided me with the month-by-month performance of a Nifty Fifty list issued by Morgan Guaranty Trust in the early 1970s. It shows that a portfolio of these stocks bought near the market top would break even by July 1980, then keep climbing over the years. From December 1972 through November 2001, he found, the portfolio produced an annualized gain of 11.8 percent, including dividends. That is barely behind the 12.1 percent annualized total return of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"123096"	"he"	"found"	" Lott analyzed 18 years of crime data from every US county. With each additional person carrying a handgun, he found, murder rates declined.

"125347"	"they"	"found"	" The researchers next searched for correlations between these companies' exclusions and the performance of their stocks over the next three years.

"126264"	"she"	"found"	" What it takes, she found, is longer and faster workouts. Her distance workouts now last 2 hours 40 minutes, rather than the previous 1:30 or 1:45, and probably cover 24 miles. Her shorter workouts in a park may consist of four 5,000-meter repeats, each in 16 minutes 30 seconds, a frightening prospect for most men, let alone women. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"

(Back Bay/Little, Brown, $13.95.) An American businessman takes his wife and four sons to the island of Elba in the 1950s to search for gems and a fresh start. Nearly 50 years later, his youngest son returns to extract the truth of his family's troubling experiences there, reconstructing the past through village gossip and the residue of marital distrust. This philosophically probing novel ``once again shows Joanna Scott to be a writer who takes different directions from book to book,'' a quest that ``separates the genuine artist from the fake,'' Jeffrey Eugenides wrote in The New York Times Book Review last year.  BY THE SWORD: A History of Gladiators, Musketeers, Samurai, Swashbucklers, and Olympic Champions, by Richard Cohen. (Modern Library, $15.95.) This idiosyncratic history of swordplay in combat and sport ranges from ancient Greece to the contemporary Olympics. (The author is a five-time British saber champion and a four-time Olympian.) Cohen rendeps(a`that most iconic of weapons as both mythic and accessible,'' Robert S. Boynton said earlier this year, leaving one ``with the sense that the sword is an integba,(artifact for understanding everyday life.''  WHEN EVE WAS NAKED: Stories of a Life's Journey, by Josef Skvorecky. (Picador, $15.) Written over a period of 50 years and arranged chronologically, this collection of short fiction by the Czech novelist depicts ordinary lives in the shadow of totalitarianism and exile; much of it is narrated by Danny Smiricky, the melancholy protagonist of many of the author's novels, who is forever in pursuit of teenage girls. The result is ``a delight only Skvorecky could write,'' Laura Secor wrote in2402.  I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT: The Life of Kate Reddy, Working Mother, by Allison Pearson. (Anchor, $13.95.) The heroine of this first novel is a 35-year-old hedge-fund manager in London trying desperately to be supermom, loving wife and business whiz while compiling endless ``must remember'' lists, fending off guilt and teetering on the edge of exhaustion. Her travails make for ``a sharply observed, sometimes painfully sad story about the sordid disparity between the ideal and the reality of having it all,' '' Kate Betts said last year. ``You root for Kate the whole length of her roller coaster ride.''  THE GATEKEEPERS: Inside the Admissions Process of a Premier College, by Jacques Steinberg. (Penguin, $15.) In 1999, the author, a reporter for The New York Times$ Gkt permission from Wesleyan University to observe its admissions procedures for a year and see how the process really works for both the applicants and those well-meaning adults who sit in judgment on them. The gatekeepers, he found, are dedicated but under2.  NEAR A THOUSAND TABLES: A History of Food, by Felipe Fernandez-Armesto. (Free Press, $14.) A skilled historian unafraid of big subjects (he has recently tackled civilization and truth) turns to the history of eating, which he sees as a testament to mankind's powers of invention. He documents eight revolutions in our attempt to improve on mere survival, beginning with the harnessing of fire, which transformed solitary eaters into communal ones. Fernandez-Armesto ``is a polymath who writes with the ease of a genial host at an enormous buffet,'' Betty Fussell said last year. He ``brings a humanity, civility and excitement to serious food writing that may not have been seen since Brillat-Savarin.''  THE RINGER, by Bill Scheft. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $12.95.) This first novel by a humorist and monologue writer for David Letterman revolves around a New York neurotic called College Boy, who supports his gambling habit by toiling as a hired gun for 13 softball teams. Though the results are mixed, ``the jokes are plentiful and very high in quality,'' Joe Queenan wrote in 2002.  A WORLD TURNED OVER: A Killer Tornado and the Lives It Changed Forever, by Lorian Hemingway. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $12.) The author, a granddaughter of Ernest Hemingway, tells of a tornado that swept through Mississippi in 1966, killing 57 people and ravaging her hometown of South Jackson. Years later, she returns to pay homage to the scarred place she left behind. ``Hemingway's prose, recalling this universe, is lush and evocative,'' Michelle Maisto said last year. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20030823.0028 type=advis > <HEADLINE> ADVISORY: COX </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 08-23-03 20:38:00EDT (BC-COX-ADVISORY-FBC-FROS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> ATTN.

, I know,	 Cox News Service ATLANTA -- Joakim Noah doesn't get it when people say basketball is just a game. Maybe for some it is, he quickly rationalizes. Not for him. For Noah, the Florida star who teeters between energetic and flamboyant, it's everything. Maybe that's why he's the crowd favorite at every home game. Of course, it could be his chest-pumping, crowd-engaging antics, his relentless hustle or the way he throws his body around the court like a rag doll. Then again, maybe it's the hair bun. Whatever it is, basketball is a lot of fun for Noah, and he has made it a lot of fun for people to watch. Fans love him; opposing crowds love to get on him - hard sometimes. Where's your dress? was a loud one last weekend at the SEC tournament. Get a haircut, you big sissy, another fan yelled. Haters, Noah said, mostly kidding. They get on me, opposing fans, maybe occasionally coaches. I heard it a lot at Rupp [Arena]. That's not going to make me change anything, though. I've always been that way, even last year when I was only playing five minutes a game. It doesn't matter if it's Savannah State or LSU in the tournament. What he's talking about mostly is not his long, wild hair. It's his on-the-court, playing-to-the-crowd style. At home games, particularly, he likes to get the crowd involved. He's David Pollack without cleats, always interacting. I need to put my passion to the team and not the crowd sometimes, I know, he said. But when the crowd gets into it, it helps the team. If my teammates say something to me about it, I listen to it. But not when others say things. Noah's warm, friendly style has made him an accessible celebrity on campus. After Sunday's SEC final, while most were still celebrating on the court, Noah was high-fiving fellow students and signing a T-shirt that read I love Noah (with a red heart in place of the word love). And, oh, yeah, the co-ed was wearing the shirt while he was signing it. I love campus, love everything about it. I can't wait to get back and get some lovin'. Celebrity? I don't know about that, he said with a laugh. But Noah gets serious, almost emotional, when he talks about the game he loves. No longer is he beating on his chest. He's closer to fighting back tears. I think most people understand that I love this game, Noah said, talking softly now. It's not just a game for me. It's my life. If it weren't for basketball, I wouldn't be at this tournament. I wouldn't be in school at Florida. I might not even have ever gone to New York. This is my life, way more than a game. As has been well-chronicled, Noah is the son of French Open tennis champion Yannick Noah, who earned his fame while playing a flashy style of tennis and wearing long dreadlocks. Yannick lives in France, but keeps in constant touch with his son and has seen several games this year. He taught me all about work ethic, and he's my best friend, Noah said. We can and do talk about anything. I'm so happy he's my father, and I respect him so much for all he does for charities and his family. Noah was born in New York but moved to France for much of his childhood. It was there that he fell in love with basketball. He was 11 or 12 years old, and he was pretty good. It was just a hobby at the time, but my mom knew, Noah said. She knew how much I enjoyed it, and she knew that if I was going to take basketball to the next level, what better place than New York? It might not have been the only reason we moved back, but it was certainly the main reason, and I love her for it. When Noah came to Florida last year, he had no idea what to expect. He knew Florida was a football school, but he had no interest in football. (He does now, by the way.) He just wanted to play basketball. And play he did. For those five minutes a game. Florida coach Billy Donovan has no problem saying those five minutes were all Noah earned last year. He wanted to rely on his energy, passion and enthusiasm, and he had to learn from his mistakes, Donovan said. He learned, for one, to have that passion and energy and commitment during the low points, which last year was for him. Last year, he didn't know how to be an effective player. He was physically weak and didn't know how to handle the double-teams in the post, or the transition. He was exposed in practice every day by David Lee, who was a first-round NBA pick. But he came to practice every day and worked hard, and I never doubted he'd be one the guys who learned from it. Even now, after earning all-SEC honors and leading Florida (27-6) to a No. 3 NCAA tournament seed, Noah still is getting his basketball education. I'm learning a lot from this experience, said Noah, who averages 13.8 points and 6.7 rebounds. Learning about clutch play, how you have to have extra focus in the last five minutes of a game. You just don't get those experiences when you're playing five minutes a game. This year has been drastically different. Florida lost almost all of its points and rebounds from last year's team and was in need of some leaders. No one's been more of one than Noah, who's convinced that he and the team have been successful for two reasons: passion and hard work. My skills are not better than a lot of guys in this league, Noah said. Even our team, talent-wise, is not one of the best, but we're the hardest working team. Noah's teammate, Chris Richard, said that work ethic extends from the court to the pool table. He's emotional on and off the court, Richard said. We get into heated battles all the time. No matter what he's doing, it's all out. And there's no reason to think those battles won't go on for at least one more season. Although it's been speculated that he might test the NBA waters this summer, Noah said no way. I'm having too much fun in college, he said, and I have lots of work to do on my game. Even the parts that are my strengths need to get better. You never stop needing to get better or stronger. Everyone here wants to be in the NBA at some point. But now? Why would I leave? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
