Bush.  Now Nader is trying to walk a fine line between supporting Green Party candidates for Congress and helping Democrats in tight races that could decide control of Congress.  ``I certainly don't want Republicans controlling Congress,'' he said.  To that end, Nader is giving Democrats credit for their stances on issues important to his consumer advocacy group, Public Citizen, though he is not exactly endorsing them. He has released statements praising 13 House Democrats in states including Florida, Connecticut, Iowa, Minnesota and New Hampshire. Most had no Green Party opponent.  Nader has also gone on talk radio to support some Senate candidates, including Jean Carnahan in Missouri, Tim Johnson in South Dakota and Tom Strickland in Colorado. He had been giving special attention to Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, who was killed in an airplane crash on Friday.  ``I support Greens, but they are not in office yet in Congress, and there are differences in the records between the individual candidates,'' Nader said. He added that he met with the House Democratic leader, Dick Gephardt of Missouri, and told him that ``if your people stand firm on our issues, we are going to let people know.''  Nader denied he was trying to have his politics both ways and insisted again that he had no regrets about his 2000 run.  A TWO-CANDIDATE COUPLE IN ARKANSAS  Arkansas is used to political families. Consider Bill and Hillary Clinton or even Tim and Asa Hutchinson. But the state is breaking new ground with the Republican governor, Mike Huckabee, on the ballot for re-election while his wife, Janet, is the Republican nominee for secretary of state.  ``From what we can tell, it is unprecedented for a sitting governor and spouse to be their party's nominees for major constitutional office,'' said Janine Parry, a political science professor at the University of Arkansas.  Parry said the matrimonial tie had evoked considerable discussion and could have interesting consequences. Should Janet Huckabee win and her husband later seek a Senate seat, as has been mentioned, she would oversee the state's election as secretary of state.  ``She would be in charge of counting ballots for her spouse,'' said Parry, noting that this would be an even closer connection than in Florida, where Jeb Bush was governor and a Republican, Katherine Harris, supervised the presidential balloting for the governor's brother.  Mike Huckabee is ahead in a tightening race, while his wife is trailing in the polls, Parry said.  GEPHARDT FOR PRESIDENT? MCAULIFFE SAYS SO   Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, is concentrating on helping his party try to win enough House seats so that Dick Gephardt will become speaker. But speculation is rampant on Capitol Hill that Gephardt will step aside if Democrats fail to win a majority on Nov. 5.  McAuliffe has another take. He said over lunch recently at the Washington bureau of The New York Times that he believed Gephardt had other plans for the next election.  ``My best guesstimate is that Dick is running for president,'' McAuliffe said. ``Either way.''  He did demur, saying, ``It's my personal opinion.'' For emphasis, he repeated, ``I think Dick is going to run for president.'' Then he added, ``These, in fairness, are all questions for Dick.''  Mr. Gephardt, want to have lunch?  FEWER `OINKS' ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL  The budget impasse in Congress did more than stall most of the annual spending bills; it deprived incumbent lawmakers of a traditional campaign weapon: the announcement.  Typically, spending bills that clear Congress in the early fall are full of local projects that incumbents announce with much fanfare, taking credit for winning such things as a road, an office building, a grant, a park, an airport runway, a sewage treatment plant and beach erosion repair.  Democrats traditionally excel at this approach, but Republicans, while often deriding such projects as pork, are not above a little bragging on the home front themselves.  But this year, with most spending bills stalled, there were not nearly as many announcements as in the past.  ``There would have been much more of that,'' said Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., the leader of his party's campaign effort. Few candidates were able to play the pork game effectively this year, he added.  The only spending bills to pass have been defense measures, and Republicans trumpeted them when President Bush signed them last week.  CONSULTANTS, KNOW THY AUDIENCE  Critics have long viewed ``The West Wing'' as the liberal's dream of a presidency that might have been. Now it has become a prime vehicle for Democratic political consultants who want to place advertisements to reach a sympathetic audience, a Democratic consultant, Rachel Gorlin, says. ``It's become part of the base buy for Democrats,'' Gorlin said, just as other consultants buy ``Oprah'' to reach women. Jed Bartlet would be pleased. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20021026.0129 type=story > <HEADLINE> 12 AMERICANS STAGE A PROTEST THAT SADDAM IS HAPPY TO ALLOW </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> BAGHDAD, Iraq  (BC-IRAQ-PROTESTS-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
