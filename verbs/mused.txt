Roitman, 68, and his wife, Leonore, 65, at the Metropolitan Opera. They have traveled to New York each month from their home in Merion Station, Pa., to see opera for the last 15 years. The ``graying'' of America has been acknowledged for years, but new federal studies have just begun to focus on the adverse effects that this demographic fact of life is likely to have on audiences for the arts, particularly the ``high culture'' performing arts.

She attributes the decision to a more motherly instinct - a way of protecting potential investors from themselves. ``I know I'm a role model to some younger women,'' she says. ``But I don't want people jumping up to buy this stock thinking that I'm going to do for the stock what I've done for myself.''

The unrivaled collection, donated to the library by Ms. Barzel, also includes films she shot, mostly during the 1940s, but she admits that ``All the still pictures in the world can't tell you how Nijinsky danced.''

In 1989, Nanci Donnellan was working at a Tampa, Fla., station when she injured her back playing golf and was confined to bed. Broadcasting from her home one day, she invited listeners to ``Come spend the afternoon in bed with a fabulous sports babe.'' And an image was born.

"139300"	"I"	"mused"	" Perfect, I mused, to set off the gorgeous pinky-orange-reddish flesh of the arctic char _ one of my favorite fish _ I spied in the fresh-seafood display. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200402.gz"
"140674"	"she"	"mused"	" Once Scottoline got the files, she scoured them for details to create a character for her book. Favored Italian internees had been permitted to work unguarded in the sugar beet fields, she found. When it was time to invent a character who would die there, she mused, In the beet fields there would be hoes. Ropes. Trees. Thus was created Amadeo Brandolini, an immigrant living in Philadelphia who was interned at Fort Missoula and found dead, hanging from a tree. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
"144444"	"he"	"mused"	" Given what we know about the genetic code and about organisms, is it possible to do experiments on real organisms and make quantitative predictions? In particular, Gross asked, Can one tell the shape of an organism by its genome? This, he mused, to much laughter, could be homework in biology classes: Give out a chart of the genome and have the student draw the picture. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"149332"	"he"	"mused"	" A wise fella once told me that he hated Father's Day because he believed it was for people who weren't close to their dads and somehow figured that buying the old man a golf shirt would make up for it. A loving family, he mused, didn't have to wait for an appointed day to express affection. Valentine's Day is the same deal -- it's depressing (and really lame) to have a single, designated day for romance. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"
"156743"	"she"	"mused"	" Grannan says she thinks that her models volunteered as a way to assert their individuality against their seemingly bland surroundings and circumstances. The portrait sessions required a leap of faith, trust and risk by the subjects; what motivated them, she mused, could be a longing for new experience and for transformation, combined with naivete and a streak of exhibitionism. Many of her models opted to pose naked, as in the portrait of one young woman in the Poughkeepsie Journal series who stands like Venus on the half shell in her living room. She was posing nude in defiance of the wishes of her boyfriend, who was not present. She began posing in a way that came too close to imitating Playboy poses, Grannan said. I asked her just to stand in front of me and walk toward the camera. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"156827"	"she"	"mused"	" Bell is not surprised that some girls hesitate to call themselves feminists. Watching a young band rehearse onstage, she mused, They used to call us third wave feminists, but these girls are like, the fourth or fifth wave. She added that some campers had come to her for advice about activism: They just need to know they have options. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"
"162895"	"she"	"mused"	" Ever since she first turned up at the 1993 nationals as a ponytailed 12-year-old, Kwan has been in the spotlight. She won her first world title in 1996, performing as a 15-year-old Salome. After that, she mused, winning the Olympics would be the cherry on top of a perfect sundae. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"163964"	"I"	"mused"	" Back in college, as a young obnoxious columnist, I once addressed the issue of accoutrements for the incarcerated. Wouldn't we save money on the prison system, I mused, if inmates ate 10-for-a-dollar ramen noodles three times a day, perhaps punctuated by the occasional baked potato or bowl of cereal? In other words, live like college students? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"167826"	"he"	"mused"	" His mood switched again. In a way, he mused, it did not matter. Palestinians will believe Israel did it even if it didn't, he said. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060616.0137 type=story > <HEADLINE> EVOLUTION CONTINUES FOR ARCTIC MONKEYS  EVOLUTION CONTINUES FOR ARCTIC MONKEYS </HEADLINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"173877"	"he"	"mused"	" Chief Justice John Roberts, another appointee of President Bush's, wondered if the EPA had leeway to prioritize its regulatory decisions. Doesn't the agency have the discretion to postpone a decision on regulating carbon dioxide emissions, he mused, so that in the meantime it can focus on threats it views as more pressing? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
