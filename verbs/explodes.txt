"115709"	"he"	"explodes"	" Although the film is not meant to be a full-blown portrait, it nods to the nonpolitical aspects of Johnson's overbearing character. Ranting to his wife about his dilemma in Vietnam, he explodes, ``Don't you know anything?,'' when she offers a comment. It only looked as if he was talking to her, when he was really thinking out loud. The strong but docile Lady Bird functions as a convenient sounding board in the film as well, and Felicity Huffman seems too young to play a character then in her '50s. Adding another small distraction, Huffman is conspicuously pregnant under her Empire-waisted gowns and loosely belted bathrobes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
