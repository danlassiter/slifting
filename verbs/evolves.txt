"39961"	"it"	"evolves"	" When a wealthy matron takes a fatal tumble down a flight of stairs, her tough-talking housekeeper, Dolores (Kathy Bates), is suspected of murder. In fact, the whole town has had it in for the supremely unfortunate Dolores since the days when she was suspected of murdering her husband. Even her daughter, Selena (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a magazine editor in New York, thinks Dolores killed her father, who, it evolves, was an abusive thief who stole his wife's money and beat her with the firewood. Under Taylor Hackford's direction, a horror-free Stephen King story becomes, as Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ``a vivid film that revolves around Ms. Bates's powerhouse of a performance.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"
"63979"	"it"	"evolves"	" The computer has no answer, but during millions of years, it evolves, absorbs the life around it, and finally seems to contain the entire cosmos. Only then, as the universe descends into entropic chaos, does the computer give an answer. It proclaims, ``Let there be light.'' </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960707.0106 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-BC-KAN-BUDGET-KAN) </DATELINE> <TEXT> (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  The Kansas City Star plans to move the following stories for use by clients of the NYTimes News Service for AMs and PMs of Monday, July 8.

BABIES-INCINERATE (Kansas City, Mo.) _ A funeral home that received the bodies of stillborn infants from a hospital to be cremated in February apparently bagged them as medical waste and carted them off to be incinerated with refuse. An additional seven infant bodies were taken last week to the funeral home, where they once again reportedly were handled as medical waste and left in the funeral home's sweltering garage. By ALAN BAVLEY. 2 takes. Story will move in the ``a'' category.  NAVY-PILOT (Kansas City, Mo.) _ When Navy Lt. Cmdr. Will Royster felt his attack bomber shudder last month, he didn't know bullets had just shattered its engines. He didn't yet know that he was about to become the first U.S. pilot shot down by a Japanese destroyer in 50 years. On vacation at his home, he tells what happened. By JOE LAMBE.

Fireman remains an important part of Bob Dole's team. At least that's what it says in a ``confidential memorandum'' bearing Dole's name that Fireman is circulating around the nation.But there's a problem: Dole's presidential campaign calls the memo a fake, cobbled together by the Republican National Committee.

"98956"	"it"	"evolves"	" ``In any relationship, it evolves,'' said Kwan, whose first solo test will come when she competes this weekend at Skate America in Colorado Springs. ``When I was younger, the coach was the skater. You did whatever he said. As I've gotten older, I've grown independent. You should think for yourself. You have differences along the way as to how you should go about things. And that's what Frank and I ran into.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"131004"	"it"	"evolves"	" No one will fail to notice Robinson, however. An officious if ultimately well-meaning public spectacle, he will serve as a distraction and cover. The boxer comes with his own private airliner and is so hyperactive that he defends his title every few days. His next bout is scheduled for Budapest. Gundars, it evolves, is a boxing fan himself and stages exhibition bouts for his guests at the party. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"145897"	"it"	"evolves"	" Guillaume, it evolves, suffers from a tendency that also afflicts his employers (on both sides), his colleagues, his countries (East and West) and, as Frayn has it, democracy itself: He is hopelessly, confoundingly divided. So, of course, is Brandt, in ways that assume the monumental proportions of classic tragedy. As befits a play that zestfully trafficks in parodox, Democracy turns out to be a wholehearted study of the mysteries of the divided human heart. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
