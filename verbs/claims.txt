"3020"	"he"	"claims"	" The problem with reform as its proposed, he claims, is that expanding private insurance will increase competition for medical care to the detriment of those insured by government. Since the plan calls for savings from Medicare and Medicaid to help finance universal coverage, health-care providers will be encouraged to shift service, not cost. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199408.gz"

"3824"	"he"	"claims"	" In Kirnan's view, sales have slowed from their earlier breakneck pace because showrooms are pretty empty. Demand, he claims, is still strong.

This would make it a perfect putter for the new Wilson Ultra, a 500-dimple golf ball that will be introduced this month. It took Wilson seven months of research and development and nearly $1.8 million to come up with a ball that exceeds the previous maximum industry standard of 432 dimples and, it claims, delivers ``measurably better'' distance and accuracy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199410.gz"

"20977"	"he"	"claims"	" Local real estate records, he claims, show Fleet purchased 2,700 mortgages between 1991 and 1993 in and around Detroit from three Michigan firms who made loans to some borrowers now voicing complaints: Mortgage America of Bay City; Birmingham Bancorp Mortgage Corp. of West Bloomfield; and Sterling Mortgage &AMP; Investment Co. of Farmington Hills.

"22205"	"she"	"claims"	" Hyde tries to answer this question by pointing to other cases in which, she claims, this Court has allowed state courts effectively to avoid retroactive application of federal law by denying a particular remedy for violation of that law or by refusing to provide any remedy at all. She argues that these cases are similar enough to her own to permit a ``remedial'' exception to the retroactive application of Bendix.

John Markoff.  CORPORATE-RESTRUCTURE (Undated) _ Corporate America can't seem to make up its mind these days: Is it better to put companies together or pull them apart? The two opposing schools of thought were on display as never before last week. In the largest voluntary corporate breakup in history, the AT&AMP;T Corp. announced that it was splitting up into three companies and dropping out of the personal computer business. Then last Friday, in the latest big media merger, Time Warner Inc. agreed to acquire the Turner Broadcasting System. The two deals are very different, but they share a common theme _ the quest to gain competitive advantage by recasting the corporate structure of a business. Steve Lohr.  TIME-WARNER-EXECS (Hollywood) _ Time-Warner's planned merger with the Turner Broadcasting System was especially sweet for Robert Daly and Terry Semel. ``A terrific fit!'' observed Daly, the chairman and co-chief executive officer at Warner Brothers, and the more outgoing of Hollywood's most successful business partnership. Semel, his co-chairman, said: ``These companies complement each other on a world-wide basis and, ultimately, it's a very positive purchase for the shareholders of both companies.'' Behind the comments, made shortly after the planned merger was announced on Friday, was the realization by both men that they are now ascendant and dominant figures in what could be the largest entertainment company in the world. Bernard Weinraub.  BUSYBOX-COMPUTE (Undated) _ Ever ready to play on the anxieties of parents, software manufacturers are now making a `keyboard` to entice 12-month-olds to bang their spoons interactively on a computer. `The world's most expensive busy box' costs $130.

INTERNET-SHOPPING (Undated) _ After waiting nearly 20 years for the on-line information industry to catch up with his original vision of computer-based electronic shopping, Walter A. Forbes's dream is finally coming true. And if the analysts are right, the sleepy world of electronic commerce on the Internet is about to wake up. Forbes's membership-based shopping service, Shoppers Advantage, opened for business last week on the Internet's World Wide Web with a data base of more than 250,000 brand-name, discount-price products ranging from toothbrushes to televisions, all of which can be researched and purchased with a few clicks of a computer mouse.

TV-LATENIGHT-MEDIA (New York) _ The late-night television war, once considered a laugher in favor of David Letterman on CBS, has become a deadly serious competition again, with Letterman now in an intense ratings struggle against Jay Leno and the ``Tonight Show'' on NBC, and Ted Koppel and ``Nightline'' on ABC. Bill Carter.  MEDIA-ON-MEDIA (Undated) _ According to the experts, the media are now in a race for content. The media don't know it yet, but recent events have shown that they have discovered the perfect content for the new-media future. You read it here first: They will cover themselves. Only themselves. In this fantasy future, there will be no need for coverage of government, economics, sports, business, or law _ except for the O.J. Simpson case, of course. William Glaberson.  TV-GENERATIONX-MEDIA (Los Angeles) _ Network television has discovered Generation X. Every other new series this season, from ``Dweebs'' to ``Too Something'' to ``Almost Perfect'' to ``Central Park West,'' seems to be about lovable, and/or achingly vulnerable, young urban professionals. They laugh. They cry. They live. They love. Contributing greatly to the network's stranglehold on the 18- to 34-year-old audience _ the viewers most sought after by advertisers _ is a reorganization that last year placed unprecedented creative power in the hands of three programmers young enough to be right at home on the set of one of their sitcom hits.

Forbes's membership-based shopping service, Shoppers Advantage, opened for business last week on the Internet's World Wide Web with a data base of more than 250,000 brand-name, discount-price products ranging from toothbrushes to televisions, all of which can be researched and purchased with a few clicks of a computer mouse. Peter H. Lewis.  ARGENTINA-MINISTER (Buenos Aires) _ After weeks of mounting speculation that Argentina's trusted finance minister was about to be fired, it now appears that Domingo Cavallo, architect of this country's economic stability, is keeping his job, at least for now.

Next, Libretti declares that a Rule 11(f) inquiry will protect against government overreaching. And lastly, Libretti insists that a factual basis inquiry is necessary to ensure that the rights of third-party claimants are fully protected.

LIFE AFTER DEATH FOR LIBERACE  ``Liberace Unplugged!'' is a new Foundation album from the pianist who died eight years ago, released on the occasion of the anniversary of his 60th year in show business.  The commemorative aspect of the occasion is a bit rocky, because whether he's been in show business for the eight years since his death is debatable. Maybe that's what the ``Unplugged'' means, but who's going to quibble?  The album includes such favorites as ``I Want a Girl Just Like the Girl Who Married Dear Old Dad,'' and ``Start the Day With a Smile'' (you'll remember that one as a standard from the old ``Liberace Show'').  The liner notes include tributes from fellow shrinking-violet musicians Doc Severinsen and Boy George.  P.S. Liberace's 4,000-square-foot house in Sherman Oaks is on the market, listed at $695,000. Amenities include a mirrored fireplace with glass mantel and piano-shaped swimming pool. The house was built in 1953.

This, he claims, reflects an alarming rise in the number of people hooked on cannabis. But common sense and the government's own statistics suggest an alternative explanation: If you're caught with pot, enrolling in a treatment program is the price of avoiding jail. And marijuana arrests have doubled in less than a decade, to 700,000 a year, even as use of the drug has remained static. In other words, the stampede of pot smokers into treatment is probably not a sign of more dependency, but of more aggressive enforcement. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"

One confesses that her dream is to one day own a dishwasher: I want something in my life I just get it started and then it takes care of itself. The title story is set in a nursing home loaded with former movie stuntmen and bit players, none of whom could even qualify as a has-been. Suddenly, one of them announces that he is none other than famed gangster John Dillinger; it was a stand-in, he claims, who was shot to death by police outside the Biograph Theater.

The payments, it claims, were actually bonuses designed to take advantage of a 1996 Canadian tax court ruling that such fees are nontaxable. Hollinger Inc. was in turn controlled by Ravelston, which ultimately benefited. As a result of this scheme, defendants and their co-schemers fraudulently diverted over $32 million from International, and fraudulently deprived ((Hollinger)) International of its right to receive their honest services. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200508.gz"

"164123"	"he"	"claims"	" Top o' the morning to ya. So, me and the boys visiting your lovely town on holiday from Dublin get a craving for some shepherd's pie and soda bread. Not to mention a pint or two. (Or three.) Well, faith and begorrah, we stumble across this pub in the village of Duluth, Ga., that almost reminds us of home. The genuine Irish handcrafted touches and the authentic partition dividing the bar. The whiskey barrel table and the framed results of Irish hurling - the sport, not the price one pays for overimbibing. What a grand place, indeed, other than the dodgy green beer, the tellys showing baseball and the menu item bangers and mash - which you Americans should know originated in bloody England, not the Emerald Isle. Cheers to ya, lads. How do you conjure up the aura of the olde country in the land of grits and gnats? Step one is simple: Order an Irish pub in a box. No need to journey 4,000 miles for painstaking research of the real deals. A smattering of firms delivers credible facsimiles so St. Patrick's Day revelers can get a true taste of the experience as they sip their Guinness. One such supplier is Irish Pub Co. Early last year, its headquarters in Ireland sent two large crates overseas to Duluth, crammed with everything from the mahogany wood bar and brass railing to stained glass and Gaelic bric-a-brac. It took all of a month before finishing touches were applied to the pub's interior, and the Loafing Leprechaun blew out the candle last week at its first birthday bash. It is truly Irish, said general manager Vince Meegan, who is not. Tourists from the homeland, he claims, are impressed by the faithful recreation. They wouldn't change a thing. The company offers five designs, based on case studies its representatives compiled while pub crawling from Donegal to the Ring of Kerry and all whistle-whetting points in between. Clients can mix and match within their orders; the Leprechaun blended three styles. Standard architectural and construction fees range from $150 to $270 per square foot, so the tab on a typical 3,000-square-foot establishment can push $800,000, including assembly. The company also will advise on food and drink selection, recorded and live music, and the wait staff - even what they say, company marketer Noel Derby noted. Explaining the firm's raison d'etre, Derby said, You've probably seen as many bad Irish bars as good ones. The average [owner] is inclined to throw shamrocks around a fairly boring interior. The company's reach extends globally, to places where an Irish pub would seem a mirage. Can you believe Kazakhstan? Just inside the Arctic Circle in Norway? About a hundred of its nearly 500 projects sprouted in Italy, two dozen more in Japan. U.S. soil holds 30, notably a building in Buckhead that Meegan admiringly calls the gold standard. In the mid-'90s, Irish Pub Co. explored expansion to America - in a city not named New York or Boston, both already approaching saturation. Thus was born Fad?, whose complexities (melding all five styles) and attention to detail (heavy cobblestones imported from Ireland) drove up the price of design and construction to $2 million. Kieran McGill - Irish Pub employee then, chairman/CEO of Atlanta-based Fad? Pubs Inc. today - recalls the doubters in the tavern/restaurant industry. The company couldn't convince anybody here that this was a good idea, said McGill, whose Fad? Pubs Inc., which originated with the Buckhead establishment, now owns 11 U.S. pubs. They just doubted a place that wasn't big and open, see-and-be-seen, lots of TVs, serving [primarily] Budweiser. Straight from the company's drawing board came a layout with partially walled-off sections, one of which approximates a small store. The few televisions often are hidden under blankets when not airing rugby or soccer. Guinness rules the premises. McGill - whose company has a business relationship with Irish Pub but no ownership ties - maintains that the goal of carbon-copying elements of Irish pubs, with all of the expense and challenges, is worthwhile. Even for the metro Atlanta customer who may never set foot in Ireland, much less a pub there. He may not recognize it here, but he'll feel it, McGill said. It's an emotive experience. In its inaugural year, coinciding with the Atlanta Olympics, Fad? became a hangout for the Irish contingent and was boosted by constant TV exposure in Ireland. McGill says more Guinness was poured there than in any U.S. establishment that claimed an Irish connection. Fad?'s customers have included prime ministers of the root country (Bertie Ahern, John Bruton) and of rock 'n' roll (Bono and U2). The cast of Riverdance has broken out in impromptu performance. Ciaran Morris, a marketing vice president in Atlanta for an Irish government agency that recruits U.S. business to locate there, never fails to escort visiting countrymen to Fad?. I can really vouch for its authenticity, said Morris, who moved stateside 10 years ago. It [mirrors] the ambience of a traditional Irish bar. The most often-heard commendations deal less with sights than with taste - of palate-pleasing Guinness on tap, no small concern to Morris' guests. That's something the Irish people are particularly sensitive about, he said. In a slight bow to local culture, Fad? hosts a poker night. It provides Wi-Fi for patrons inseparable from their laptops. It will turn on a Falcons game. Got to roll with the times. Fad? translates from Gaelic to long ago, which aptly describes its time of origin in restaurant years. Now, six weeks into Fad?'s second decade, McGill intends soon to open a second franchise at an undisclosed metro location. At Irish Pub Co.'s home base, a couple of crates are ready for loading, its contents to be assembled here in two shakes of a lamb's tail. And that's no blarney, lads. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"166108"	"he"	"claims"	" Kinzer's main explanation for these recurrent misadventures is greed. The prime villains are United Fruit, ITT, Aramco, Halliburton and other corporations and plutocrats operating through like-minded officials. He proceeds from the classic theory first advanced by the British economist J.A. Hobson, and most prominently in Lenin's Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism, that overproduction causes a scramble for new markets and a policy of forcing foreign nations to buy American products. This may be convincing for the early cases, but Kinzer underestimates the relative force of geopolitical concerns during the Cold War, when, he claims, economic motives played just as strong a role as ever. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
