Reportedly, Red Wings defenseman Paul Coffey also was going to take part in the campaign to bring Bourque aboard. Call it hockey's version of the full-court press. Or is it more a not-so-neutral zone trap? ... Word out of Detroit is that Keith Primeau and Dino Ciccarelli could be headed to Tampa Bay for Chris Gratton and Brian Bradley. Reportedly, Petr (Triple OT) Klima's departure from the Lightning to Los Angeles paves the way for that deal. Primeau made no secret of his unhappiness with the Red Wings' six-year offer that would've paid him an average of $1.6 million a year ... If you're waiting for Detroit to deal for right wing Brendan Shanahan,who is universally coveted (well, except for Mike Keenan), forget it. Reportedly, Wings owner Mike Ilitch doesn't want to do business with Hartford owner Peter Karmanos. The two were rivals in junior hockey but their alleged falling-out came during the lockout, when Ilitch took a hard line and Karmanos not so hard ... Red Wings captain Steve Yzerman has signed his option papers and will make $4.025 million this year. He and agent Larry Kelly are scheduled to begin negotiations Sept. 1 with the club on a deal that would keep Yzerman, who has been the subject of a record number of bogus trade rumors, a Red Wing for life ... Wings center Kris Draper,whose face was rearranged for free by Avalanche right wing Claude Lemieux during the playoffs, is back skating and reports his fractured jaw, broken nose and 40 stitches are completely healed. He recently signed a four-year deal ... Sergei Fedorov,who is playing on the Russian World Cup team, was asked if he thinks the squad as constituted will be the '98 Olympic team. ``No, I don't,'' he said. ``We have too many problems there. They don't know how to work with the players who have been in the NHL.'' Does that mean Fedorov would take a pass on representing his country? ``I'm not saying that. I don't want to make waves.'' ...

NEW YORK _  Dear Diary:  On Halloween afternoon, I sat across the aisle of a subway car from a young mother and her son, who looked about 4. The boy finished a lime lollipop and looked around the car where there were several other children in Halloween costumes. Ready to cry, he said to his mother, ``I don't have a costume!''  ``Yes you do,'' she said.  ``Noooo, I don't,'' was the almost tearful reply.  At this the mother pulled her compact out of her purse and held the mirror in front of her son, saying: ``Yes you do. You have a green tongue!''  The boy stuck out his tongue and looked in the mirror, delightedly murmuring, ``A green tongue.''  ``And that makes you an imp, an imp of mischief,'' the mother went on. The imp continued to look in the mirror, enchanted.  Everyone around them smiled. They seemed to feel, as I did, that there's nothing quite like a savvy mom at the top of her game.  _ GENE C. GILL  Dear Diary:  My wife and I, native New Yorkers, moved to St. Louis a few years ago. Shortly after our arrival, we went to a restaurant. After we gave our orders, the waiter said to us, ``You're from New York, aren't you?''  In my best and most exaggerated Noo Yawk accent, I answered: ``Yeah. Howdja know?''  ``No problem,'' he replied. ``I lived in L.A. for eight years.''  _ MURRAY H. WARSCHAUER  Sandi Schiffman was walking on Avenue of the Americas in Greenwich Village when she saw a woman walking her dachshund puppy. A man passing by stopped and said to the woman, ``You have one handsome son.''  ``Thanks,'' the woman replied, ``but she's my daughter.''  Overheard by Jane Seskin on the West Side:  A woman leaving a veterinarian's office asked her limping dog, ``Want to try and walk for a while?''  A friend holding the door pleaded: ``Have a heart. Let him take a taxi.''  Dear Diary:  We are usually able to park our car in front of our apartment building because of our handicapped parking permit, but when we arrived home late one Sunday night, no spaces were available.  I had to park several blocks away on First Avenue and did not notice the tiny sign advising me not to park because of road work. Overnight, our car was relocated.  Where was our car relocated to? We found it parked Monday morning right in front of our apartment building.  _ ANN NEWMAN  Dear Diary:  Back in the '70s when I lived in the West Village, the usual summer Sunday treat was to hang out at the pier at the end of Jane Street. On one particular Sunday a group of five of us, all strangers, were chatting casually and sharing some cranberry juice one fellow had brought.  A small fishing boat piloted by a man and his son came very close to the end of the pier. As a lark, the five of us put out our thumbs to ``hitch'' a ride on the boat.  Surprisingly, the father pulled his boat to the pier and motioned for us to get on. We all clambered on board and were treated to a short but delightful tour of the lower Hudson River.  After being returned to the pier, we were so thrilled to have shared such an unusual experience that we all went for pizza at La Marionetta on Greenwich Avenue.  After the meal we left the restaurant, said goodbye and never saw one another again.  _ JUDY NOBLE SPEREGEN  Dear Diary:  During a recent spate of unemployment, I became a regular at the cafe near my apartment in Brooklyn.  One morning, after I ordered my usual coffee, I noticed a small brown roach skittering its way across the counter.  When she returned with my coffee, the barista looked at the roach, looked at the coffee and then looked up at me.  ``It'll be 50 cents extra if you want the roach in it,'' she said calmly. _ HUGH RYAN  Dear Diary:  I had just settled into a booth at a pizzeria with my wife and a friend when a young man approached us and asked if we had just been in his taxi.  While startled, I did recall his bright red turban, and said that we had.  ``Are you sure?'' he asked. I was quite certain.  ``You gave me a lot of money,'' he said. With that, he handed over a wad of bills totaling nearly $100 and left.  It hit me: I had had two handfuls of money as we pulled up to the pizzeria, one with $6 for the fare and the rest intended for dinner and a movie.  It was obvious that in the rush to get out of the taxi, and in the darkness of the back seat, I'd handed him the wrong wad.  How fortunate that this young man so honestly recognized my mistake, drove back to the restaurant, parked and walked in, finding us among the crowd.  Recovering from the surprise, I followed him outside and gave him $30 for his good deed. While grateful, the taxi driver gave me a brief lecture on taking better care of my money.  When I went back inside the restaurant, embarrassed over the whole incident, my wife and my friend proceeded to do the same.  It reminded me that while New York is a wonderful place, and New Yorkers are wonderful people, this city doesn't suffer fools. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20021201.0161 type=advis > <HEADLINE> Here is a listing of the New York Times News Service Macintosh </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 12-01-02 22:59:00EST (BC-GRAPHIC-FILES-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Here is a listing of the New York Times News Service Macintosh graphics files that moved Sunday, 12/01/02.

"163826"	"they"	"don't"	" Cox News Service ATLANTA -- Just when we thought we were out, they pull us back in. The Sopranos returns from its nearly two-year hiatus in spectacular fashion tonight, deftly blending melancholy and mayhem in an episode that ends with a sucker-punch almost nobody but creator David Chase could have seen coming. Cut, print, endlessly discuss and dissect among yourselves for the next 6 1/2 days, until Episode 2 comes along to offer up some even bigger shocks: Confusion. Even a few yawns. And -- let's be totally honest about it -- a certain amount of disappointment. As bone-rattlingly good as the Season 6 opener is, that's how much of a letdown the followup installment feels like. Worse, this odd sense of viewer betrayal persists in Episode 3, when many an intensely loyal Made Fan doubtless will yearn for a hit on a certain milquetoasty character named Kevin Finnerty. Who is this guy, and why is he getting so much of what should be Tony Soprano's (James Gandolfini) screen time, you'll wonder? Has the combination of too much downtime and unrealistically high expectations turned Chase into the Uncle Junior of TV showrunners, a man now wandering lost and confused in his own creative kitchen? All due respect -- No. I've seen the first four episodes of Season 6. But I also subscribe to the critic's code of omert? when it comes to spilling The Sopranos secrets. So you're just going to have to trust me on this, same as I'm trusting Chase, et al., to bring this deeply personal mob morality play to a satisfying, enlightening conclusion. Something bigger is afoot here, something inherently risky and therefore most worthy of a groundbreaking show that's technically in its final season (12 new episodes now; eight new bonus episodes next January), and determined to go out the way few TV series or Mafia dons ever get a chance to: on their own terms, no apologies necessary. If that means we have to wait until about halfway through Episode 4 to begin to appreciate what this all is leading to, so be it. Some sitdowns take longer to arrange. By the time we come to understand the significance of this one -- Tony Soprano going one-on-one with himself in the ultimate turf battle for his own soul -- they've pulled us back in and set the stage for whatever's coming in the final act. Even amid the comparative tedium of the middle two episodes, there's enough that's potentially significant or just plain entertaining to hold all but the most casual fan's interest. Outside the family, rival gang boss Johnny Sack (Vince Curatola) is in prison and fuming; inside it, Sopranos soldier Vito Spatafore (Joseph Gannsascoli) has lost half his body weight and, along with the ever-more combustible Paulie Walnuts (Tony Sirico), begun eating away at Tony's aura of invincibility. Meanwhile, for sheer laughs, not much can compare with Episode 3's Who's on First-worthy pitch meeting between aspiring slasher filmmaker Christopher (Michael Imperioli) and his mobbed-up crew of potential investors. They call him 'The Butcher!' Christopher enthuses about the movie's lead character. No, they don't, Sopranos' consigliere Silvio Dante (Steven Van Zandt) interrupts in his best All due respect, Mr. DeMille tone. Need I remind you of a certain 'Butcher' out of A.C [Atlantic City, N.J.]? That Christopher, who's Tony's nephew and a family man in every sense of the word, is restlessly exploring his options seems less surprising given the pensive, somewhat wistful tone of tonight's episode. Nearly two years have elapsed both on and off screen, time enough for Janice (Aida Turturro) to have had a baby, A.J. (Robert Iler) to have begun college (whether he'll finish is another matter), and for Adriana (Drea DeMatteo) to have faded mostly to a memory in the place where people tuck away their I wonder's and If only's. Having ended their marital separation at the end of Season 5, Tony and Carmela (Edie Falco) are settled into a comfortable empty-nesting existence, regularly indulging their newfound passion for sushi (no, that's not a euphemism), taking care of their respective business ventures and only occasionally erupting. A sense of their own mortality hovers over all these characters like never before, the who's whacking who concerns of previous seasons at least temporarily taking a back seat to talk of retirement property in Florida, assisted living facilities, roads not taken and the point of it all really, ultimately. Let me tell you something A.J., Tony lectures his obviously uninterested son tonight, in between fulfilling obligations to one of his families (attending a business associate's wake), and the other (paying a call on disoriented old Uncle Junior). I don't care how close you are. In the end, your friends are gonna let you down. Family, they're the only ones you can depend on. Until you can't. Let the final sitdown begin. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"

, I suppose,	 I don't know which is worse at that stage -- the physical or the mental stress, Roddick said. Both equally, I suppose, because everything is made worse by the tension of the occasion. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz
, he said,	 A 10-1 record is possible going into the game against the Trojans, even for this inconsistent team that has allowed 84 points in the past two weeks. We've been outscored, 44-10, in the first quarter, Weis said, referring to all four games. Speaking of the game against Purdue, he said, If we get off to another slow start, they might walk out of here 5-0. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz

, he admits,	 The ex-cop, who spent his career on the University of Washington police force, is 6 foot 4, with a dented scar where a bullet once grazed his knuckle, and a wheezy ex-smoker's laugh. He is inelegant and occasionally profane. He rides a motorcycle and cheats at cribbage. A self-described big hunkin' loud kind of thing, he's a passionate talker and an intense listener. Sometimes, he admits, he says the wrong thing. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz
, he said,	 Marchetti also defended the educational offerings at the centers. Across the agency's facilities in general, two-thirds of the young people score below grade level in reading and math upon entering. While at the institutions, he said, they improve on average by two grade levels. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz
, she said,	 China's influence on the global flower industry may also emerge in a tactile way: The roses here are usually sold without thorns, a practice that could spread to other flower-exporting countries. At a flower farm in Si Jie, 70 miles south of Kunming, Shi Yin, 22, takes her clippers into a greenhouse, walks down the long rows of flowerbeds and selects the roses that will wind up in the gift boxes in Los Angeles. In choosing a long-stemmed gift rose, she said, I look at how open it is, how straight and how tall. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz
, he says,	 Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch, who took command in June, says Army headquarters asks him every month how ready his division is to handle a crisis in Korea. The answer, he says, is: he is getting there. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz
, he says,	 Rice has argued that exchange programs contribute to a cycle of social and economic inertia for minorities and the poor. A better use of state money, he says, would be to create more programs providing drug education and treatment. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz
, I guess,	 It's not easy, five minutes after you've gotten your [derrieres] kicked .... it's not a good thing to say when your emotions are still running, Francona said. You have to sit back, I guess, and take a look at the whole year and then make that decision. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz

SCI-HYSTERIA (Undated) -- although the brain mechanisms behind hysterical illness are still not fully understood, new studies have started to identify the physical correlates of one of the most elusive, controversial, and enduring illnesses.  SCI-MEDICINE-NOBEL (Undated) -- When Alfred Nobel, the Swedish inventor of dynamite and more powerful explosives, died in 1896, he bequeathed the bulk of his fortune to create five prizes honoring ingenuity. Yet in a little known story, the Nobel prizes, the first of which will be announced on Monday, almost never came to be, largely because of the unsophisticated way Nobel drew up his will. By Lawrence K. Altman.  (EDS: This is third in the series Medicine, Then and Now.)  SCI-SKUNKS (Edgartown, Mass.) -- This is Luanne Johnson's third year of studying skunks on Martha's Vineyard. She hopes the data will turn into a doctoral dissertation and help settle an argument over whether it is skunks or vehicles that are more dangerous to nesting shorebirds protected by law. But if skunks are not a problem for birds, they do cause problems for people, with their midnight rambles into yards, under decks and even into boats stored on land. More than once, she says, she has left a note warning an unsuspecting boat owner that there may be a skunk under the tarp. By Cornelia Dean.  SCI-ENDANGERED-ASPENS (Denver) -- The aspen, an emblematic tree of the West and the most widely distributed tree in North America, is rapidly and mysteriously dying. By Katie Kelley.  SCI-BRAIN-GENOME (Undated) -- The Microsoft billionaire Paul Allen will finance a new genomic atlas of the human brain. By Nicholas Wade.  SCI-Q&amp;A (Undated) -- What is vitamin K good for, and where can it be found? By C. Claiborne Ray.  SCI-WATCH (Undated) -- Hawaiian crickets adapt to a parasitic infection by losing their chirpiness; Scottish study shows that when it comes to grazing, two species can be better than one; Japan launches solar weather satellite. A short by Henry Fountain.  SCI-REALLY (Undated) -- The claim: Chlorine in drinking water can increase the risk of cancer. The facts: By Anahad O'Connor.  SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) -- News and notes on health and medicine. Byline TK.  SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) -- Hearing loss is the third most common chronic condition among older Americans, after hypertension and arthritis. Hearing difficulties in older people can have serious consequences, including social isolation, functional decline and depression. Hearing loss can also impair memory and cognitive function. By Jane E. Brody.  In addition to stories from Science Times, this story will be listed in the AM-BUDGET:  SCI-ANTHRAX (Undated) -- New findings suggest that the anthrax used in the 2001 attacks was probably garden-variety, widely available material, not weaponized by a government insider.

, he said,	 Still, Flynn said a Patrick victory is possible, because voters he knows are ambivalent about voting Republican. They do it, said Flynn, because That's all they've got. They still worry about a one party state, said Flynn. But, he said, they are looking for reasons to vote for someone, not against someone, and that gives Patrick an opening. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz
, we hear,	 Part of the public is understandably bored by the endless repetition of core masterpieces that weren't meant to be heard as often as they are, weren't intended to lapse into routine. Another part of the public is resolutely opposed to anything new in music, no matter how much they welcome or even seek out innovation and change in the other arts. And the whole mess, we hear, is the fault of the schools, which are not educating new audiences, and of the media, which are more interested in sensation than in substance. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz
, he says,	 For Hodgman, the experience of going from unknown author to television star has been like being teleported to another planet. He's been a successful freelance writer since 2000, contributing to The New York Times Magazine, McSweeney's, and public radio's This American Life, but being a TV personality was never part of the plan. On his first day working on the Daily Show set, he says, he kept thinking: This is a fun adventure that will end soon. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz
, he says,	 Hodgman is very much a straight man, which makes the things that come out of his mouth all the more surprising. When talking about his wife, he says, She's always building those robots, without so much as cracking a smile - and moves on. His dry, intellectual delivery of even the most bizarre information is so convincing that it's hard not to believe everything he's saying - all of which plays perfectly into his resident expert role on The Daily Show. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz
, he predicted,	 In a segment about race that aired in April, Hodgman, who has dark-rimmed eyeglasses and an affinity for cream-colored suits, brought paint samples to the set. He held one up to host Jon Stewart's face and determined that Stewart wasn't white but Windham cream, or actually more of a fresh butter. Hodgman found that his own skin was pale straw. Tiger Woods's was copper mountain russet. Ted Kennedy's, Hodgman said, was waxy drunken pink. By the year 5500, he predicted, we'll all be one color: soft pumpkin. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz
, I think,	 These controversies open Shakespeare up to people who've read him but maybe don't go back to him a lot. There's an excitement there you don't get from your usual regional theater productions or through just trying to plow your way through the works once again. But if you hear these directors and actors and scholars arguing about something like this, it's a way to reconnect, I think, with some excitement that's there that you may have lost or never experienced. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz

, he predicted,	 Sharon argued that once Israel pulled out of Gaza, Palestinian extremists would no longer have legitimacy to attack Israel. Moderates would gain strength and be able to engage in meaningful negotiations based on the US-backed road map for peace. As a bonus, he predicted, everyday life for the roughly 1.4 million Palestinians in Gaza would improve dramatically with the removal of the 21 settlements in their midst. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz
, he said,	 Israel cannot act unilaterally, Gillon said, as it did when it pulled out of Lebanon in 2000 and Gaza in 2006, and then expect an effective peace partner to emerge in the evacuated territory. Instead, he said, Israel should take small steps in the West Bank, drawing down its posture gradually and assessing the Palestinian reaction. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz
, he said,	 Instead, he said, the growing potency of attacks from Gaza, coupled with the deadly example set by well-armed Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon, has heightened Israel's concern that Palestinian militants will try to smuggle ever-more lethal weaponry into Gaza. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz
, he said,	 The risk, he said, is amplified by the propensity of Americans to guzzle antacids for their stomach woes. Those medicines might ease reflux, but they also tamp down the acid that helps keep bacteria in check. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz
, he said,	 In a utopian dream world it would be possible to grow a whole village from seeds, Joachim said, but subdivisions won't turn into forests overnight. First, he said, people would have to accept arboreal abodes - and even then it would take years to weave and shape growing tree branches into a house. The first step, he said, could be green garages that would help offset a small part of the emissions of cars parked inside. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz
, you can,	 If you want to work in Lake Charles, you can, said Steve James, senior pastor at Trinity Baptist Church, which coordinated debris removal and food distribution and housed 125 National Guard troops for months. There are signs all over the city for companies hiring. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz
, he said,	 This merger will haunt the consumer, Mark Cooper, research director at the Consumers Federation of America, said in a conference call with reporters. When the combined companies strengthen their grip on the marketplace, he said, they will use it against the public. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz
, I assume,	 Camp Arrowhead sought to open minds through healthy activities. Boys were encouraged to believe in themselves and their own strengths. Odious comparisons to Ms. Fischer's boot camp, I assume, would be redundant here. </P> 	nyt_eng_200609.gz
, you know,	 Phil Angelides found that ou big time the other day. Surely, the brains behind the Angelides gubernatorial campaign tought they had the Governator cold with the taped conversation in which he talked about Assemblywoman Bonnie Garcia's penchant for fiery talk by saying this of Latinos: 'They are all very hot. They have the, you know, part of the black blood in them and par of the Latino blood in them that together makes it. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
