"26758"	"he"	"laughs"	" Norman is so famous in his homeland, he laughs, that ``some newspapers have called me an Australian. Maybe thought I was related to the golfer. Well, I quit tennis for a while because my knees gave way. Grew too fast. I had operations and decided to enroll in university. Then the knees felt better, and I started playing again. In small tournaments. Bad food, good times with the guys. I began to improve.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"77443"	"he"	"laughs"	" Lane was no different. Before he set off for architecture studies at the University of Michigan, he discovered Savile Row, Loeb shoes and Turnbull &AMP; Asser (CQ) shirts (``which came packed in marvelous little wooden crates,'' he notes). And, he laughs, ``I discovered the fact that English gentlemen do not pay their bills.'' Of course, his bills arrived soon after the cunning little crates, to be opened and paid for by an indulgent father. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"
"92073"	"he"	"laughs"	" The mayor and his dinner companions then head over to Koeppel's apartment to watch the show, and perhaps understandably, given the marital strife at Gracie Mansion. ``Rudy applauds, he laughs, he really gets into it,'' Koeppel said. ``You know, when he was a prosecutor, he had to listen to 5,000 hours of wiretaps, which is why he can talk like those wiseguys.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"
"95387"	"she"	"laughs"	" But that ignorance turned out to be a blessing, allowing her to plunge forward when experts balked. Her experimental approach bore fruit in a piece called ``Glass Balls.'' ``I had these glass balls stretched across the table,'' she recalls. ``The scientists said: `You'll never get a hologram out of that. You're supposed to make a hologram within a 12-inch cube.' And I had eight feet of depth.'' When asked what led her to defy the technical advice, she laughs, replying. ``How else are you going to do anything original?'' Her boldness paid off, and the gleaming spheres with their multiple reflections plunging deep into space became one of her, and holography's, signature images. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"

"99577"	"she"	"laughs"	" In the past 1 1/2 years, the foundation has put together a list of referrals, including doctors and community resources. Sometimes, she laughs, doctors run when they see her coming. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"104525"	"she"	"laughs"	" Now, she laughs, do you understand why she says she has had a happy life? </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020122.0143 type=story > <HEADLINE> TEST KITCHEN: A HALF-MOON THAT BRIGHTENS KITCHEN LABORS </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-KITCHEN-WARES-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"120149"	"she"	"laughs"	" Swain isn't one to hold back, whether among friends or during an interview at a still-crowded Woodland Hills food court. She lives, she laughs, she whoops, and she goes for it, whether the target is Lolita, a soul-searching sorority sister, or an abused Appalachian wife in search of her true love (in the upcoming ``Briar Patch''). </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"
"133598"	"she"	"laughs"	" Gawain lies abed. The lady sits on the bed. She banters, she laughs, she teases. She tells him, ``You who are so courtly, with such winning ways,/Ought to offer a little instruction to a young thing/And teach her some token of the art of true love.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"160753"	"she"	"laughs"	" By Judy's account, he's not an easy man to live with. He's tough when she needs him to be tender, indifferent when she needs him to be attentive. And lately his sex drive is down. Talking to Maggie, she laughs, cries, then wonders aloud, I wonder if I shouldn't find another life. This sounds like the start of a particularly confessional Cassavetes picture. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
