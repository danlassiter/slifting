"88488"	"he"	"realized"	" Because no one knew whether cloning was even possible, it was hard to speculate about what the hurdles might be. But Campbell had what turned out to be the crucial insight. It could be, he realized, that an egg will not take up and use the genetic material from an adult cell because the cell cycles of the egg and the adult cell might be out of synchrony. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199703.gz"
"91022"	"he"	"realized"	" TV, he realized, was stealing not only hours of his time but also his mind. When the troops and correspondents came home, ``there was a void there. And I said, `Man, this is crazy.' '' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"

"95134"	"I"	"realized"	" Keeping her eyes on me, she backed away, then blurted out, ``That's what I want!'' What she wanted, I realized, was to put my coaxing gesture into the piece. Or, more generically, she wanted to capture the informal activity of creating the piece, and put that into a performance. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"
"95998"	"he"	"realized"	" After his father died in 1962 Goldblatt sold his family business to become a photographer full time, supporting himself through commercial work. There weren't many photojournalists in South Africa, and magazines in Europe and the United States weren't yet too interested in stories from there. But someone, he realized, ought to be recording what was happening. So he documented the Defiance Campaign against apartheid in 1952 and the first apartheid signs to be posted in Johannesburg. Gradually he realized that photographs weren't going to change the world. But they were still necessary, and he had a talent. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200108.gz"

"96844"	"I"	"realized"	" ``I mean, the golf was just a lark,'' said Nazro. ``But what blew me backwards was how passionate he was about it. He was telling me, `OK, Steve, I want you in bed early . . . get a good sleep . . . have a solid breakfast.' Once more, I realized, that's the essence of this guy, finding a way, no matter how small the circumstance, to make you feel like you're the most important one around.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"
"97639"	"he"	"realized"	" Montreuil, a claims adjustor for the Hartford, one of the biggest insurance companies, lifted his hand and saw a coating of fine gray dust, fine enough to penetrate the machine's delicate workings. He also saw big dollar signs. For the whole office, he realized, this was going to be a major claim, possibly running to several million dollars. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"98012"	"he"	"realized"	" It happened in the second quarter. A hurried pass launched over the middle for Stingley, who was slanting into the secondary. It was high and too far in front of him. Leaving his feet, Stingley was prone in the air, arms outstretched, as the ball sailed past him. In my memory, there he hangs. For his part, Tatum seemed fooled. Having started back to his right, he pulled up as the ball was released. The receiver, he realized, was coming from the opposite direction. Jack turned but managed only three or four strides before the action was upon him. He crouched over as Stingley drifted toward him. They collided. Stingley, in an awkward position, fell to the turf. There was no explosive hit. No flying helmet. Yet Stingley was down. He wasn't moving. He wasn't getting up. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"100879"	"they"	"realized"	" Anthony Field and Murray Cook were studying to become preschool teachers in Australia in the late 1980s when they stumbled on a gaping hole in the music industry. No one in Australia, they realized, had recorded a pop or rock album with lyrics clear and simple enough for a 3-year-old to follow but with a beat that was so jazzy, it would hook their parents, too. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"101575"	"she"	"realized"	" Late last month, Giulia Melucci, a publicist at Scribner, found herself in a checkout line at a Banana Republic store holding a pair of black pants and a black sweater that, she realized, were minutely different from black pants and a black sweater that she already owned. ``It was clearly not a matter of need,'' Melucci said. ``I thought to myself, `This is wrong.' That `these are old and I don't like them anymore' idea is something I would have done in the old world, but not in the new world.'' Two feet shy of the register, she ditched the clothes. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"102271"	"he"	"realized"	" The hesitant tone in their voices, Richmond recalls, was a message in itself. The doctors, he realized, were pretty much making up his treatment as they went along. Richmond is one of 11 people who have come down with inhalation anthrax since late September, and one of six who survived. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"102359"	"I"	"realized"	" I found her on the porch, alone. She had discarded the Santa cap and had pulled the collar of her turtleneck up over her chin. The college kids who'd actually been invited, I realized, had never showed, not even her boyfriend. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"

"108828"	"he"	"realized"	" And that, he realized, has important consequences. If you're not concerned about the weight or size of a sub, it could be made of much thicker, stiffer material than conventional craft are built from. With a thick, strong hull, a sub could withstand far greater pressure and dive deeper than ever before. And if you throw out any limits on size and weight, you could pack it full of freight or fuel, turning it into a long-range, heavyweight cargo shifter. The vessel could cut journey times and transportation costs by taking short cuts deep beneath the Arctic ice. ROCK SOLID </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"

Textbooks emphasize the rapid initial failure of the settlement, established in 1607 on an island in Virginia's James River.  ``By the second winter, only 60 of the original 215 settlers had survived the Indian attacks, famine, and disease,'' says Bill Kelso, director of archaeology for the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities. ``But we're finding these guys weren't quite gentleman dandies who sat around waiting to get killed.''  After the initial losses, the remaining settlers quickly learned to jettison their European manners and armor, judging from Kelso's recent excavation.  His team found an assortment of body armor, swords, and a helmet that had evidently been discarded.  ``The natives wouldn't have fought in nice orderly marching lines, so the settlers would have adapted similar guerrilla tactics that made the heavy traditional European armor more hindrance than help,'' says Kelso.  Archaeologists have also recovered lightweight, arrow-proof vests constructed by chopping armor into pieces and threading it back together.  Such innovations helped the colonists survive repeated attacks until supply ships arrived.  ``The Jamestown colonists arrived in stiff armor and then adapted it to suit their needs, much as they did with government and with the language. It's a little insight into how and when Englishmen became Americans,'' says Kelso.  _ Jocelyn Selim  ASTRONOMERS SEARCH FOR DIMENSION X  Jonathan Feng of the University of California at Irvine has put a bizarre spin on recent cosmological models.  He and his collaborators propose that much of the universe's mass consists of hidden particles that travel outside the familiar three dimensions.  The idea is not just idle speculation: Feng has shown that some experiments could soon put his theory to the test. ``It's mind-boggling if it's true _ that would change everything,'' he says.  Feng's group had been trying to understand dark matter, the unseen stuff inferred from its effects on visible galaxies.  One possibility, they realized, is that dark matter consists of Kaluza-Klein particles, named for two physicists who postulated the existence of extra dimensions curled up tightly outside of the three we experience.  ``These extra dimensions are very small, so you can't see the particles zinging around in that direction. But that extra energy would manifest itself to us like a large mass,'' says Feng.  The result would be heavier-than-normal versions of ordinary particles that make up most atoms. These overweight particles would tend to collect in places with large gravitational pulls, like the center of the sun.  There they would occasionally crash into each other and spew out unusually energetic neutrinos, which physicists could observe.  ``There have been various wild ideas about dark matter in extra dimensions, none of them very testable,'' Feng says.  But he calculates that the newest neutrino detectors, like AMANDA near the South Pole, have a ``reasonable shot'' at identifying a flow of energetic neutrinos from the sun.  The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, a detector scheduled to fly on the International Space Station in 2005, should be able to detect antimatter particles created when Kaluza-Klein particles annihilate each other.  ``This is not just a mathematical thing,'' Feng says. ``We could verify it in two or five years.''  _ Fenella Saunders  RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP  Environmental scientists have only a sketchy picture of the oceans that cover the majority of Earth's surface. So they're excited about a new crop of autonomous vehicles that can cheaply venture into little-studied realms by drawing most of their power from the sea.  The Slocum Glider, designed by Webb Research Corporation in East Falmouth, Mass., incorporates an experimental thermal engine driven by the temperature difference between warm surface water and cooler layers below.  At depth, an onboard reservoir of hydrocarbon freezes and contracts, making the craft more buoyant. Up top, the glider fixes its position using a Global Positioning System locator and transmits its environmental report to a satellite.  Then the hydrocarbon re-expands, sending the Slocum Glider on its next voyage _ as far as 4,000 feet down.  The University of Washington's new research vehicle, called Seaglider, takes a more active approach. It uses a battery-powered pump to shunt oil out of a bladder to increase buoyancy, causing the vehicle to rise when it reaches the bottom of its dive cycle.  Seaglider also has wings that send it zigzagging to a maximum depth of 3,300 feet. ``We can operate Seaglider for an entire year for $20,000, the cost of one day's time in a research vessel. That will let us measure temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, currents, and chlorophyll fluorescence much more cheaply,'' says oceanographer Charles Eriksen.  A newer model, which should be ready in a couple of years, will voyage nearly 20,000 feet below, bringing most of the world's ocean volume within reach.  _ Kathy A. Svitil  A GENDER GAP FOR ORGAN DONORS  Men who receive transplanted kidneys from women are more likely to lose or reject them than they would organs from other men.  Physician Martin Zeier of the University of Heidelberg in Germany uncovered this pattern by scouring a giant database called the Collaborative Transplant Study, which collects records of organ donation from patients in 49 countries.  After analyzing records of nearly 167,000 kidney, heart, and liver transplants, he found that men had a 22 percent higher risk of rejecting or losing a donated kidney from a woman than one from a man within one year of transplant.  Men were also 13 percent more likely to lose a woman's heart. No parallel effect was seen in women who received kidney or heart transplants from men.  This pattern hints at a fundamental, still-unknown difference between the immune systems of men and women.  The presence or absence of estrogen, or a gender-related difference in the distribution of chemical receptors on the surface of cells, might influence immune reactions that can lead to organ acceptance or rejection.  Nonetheless, Zeier would never advise a man to turn down a female kidney, especially since rejection can often be reversed with the proper drug regimen.  ``The organ shortage is so heavy in Western countries that it would screw up our allocation system. And there are other factors _ the age and health of the donor, for example _ that are much more important than the gender difference,'' he says.  _ Josie Glausiusz  ----  EDITOR: Visit The New York Times Syndicate Web site at http://www.nytimes.com/syndicate for more information on DISCOVER NEWS SERVICE and other features.

His proposal, which he called the negative income tax, was to replace the multiplicity of existing welfare programs with a single cash transfer -- say, $6,000 -- to every citizen. A family of four with no market income would thus receive an annual payment from the IRS of $24,000. For each dollar the family then earned, this payment would be reduced by some fraction -- perhaps 50 percent.
