Although the boys on the boat never really transcend their types, they grow, over the course of the voyage, vivid enough to make the loss of those killed, as well as the agony of the survivors, truly wrenching. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"

INTERNATIONAL  COX-MEXICO-INDIGENOUS _ RANCHO NUEVO, Mexico _ The smoke of an open fire and the lilting notes of Mixteco wafted into the black sky as the women, barefoot and silent, boiled coffee and listened to the men talk of rebellion. They spoke of the biggest act of defiance in their lives _ a seven-month armed occupation of the municipal hall last year by the region's indigenous people. ``Our eyes are opening,'' Ignacio de la Cruz said, staring into the dancing flames. ``Look at this place.'' He swept a hand toward Rancho Nuevo, a remote village of 700 people that lacks electricity, running water and working telephones. ``We don't have anything.'' The defiance in Rancho Nuevo in the Pacific state of Guerrero reflects a growing assertiveness among Mexico's 12 million indigenous people. All over Mexico, indigenous villages _ for centuries among the country's most backward and downtrodden _ are staging protests demanding greater rights. (Nusser 750&AMP;Add)  With COX-MEXICO-INDIGENOUS-PEOPLE _ MEXICO CITY _ In Mexico's urban slums and poor villages, in its southern jungles and harsh central mountains, a vast indigenous Indian population clings to cultures and languages from another millennium. Mexico's 12 million indigenous people speak more than 60 languages and live scattered throughout the country. What unites them, besides a shared history, is a position at the bottom of Mexican society that they have occupied since the Spanish Conquest.

Will there be an independent Palestinian state? What to do about fervent Jewish settlers living in the West Bank? Israeli and Palestinian negotiators begin their final phase of talks in Taba, Egypt, on Sunday, negotiations which could change the political landscape of the Middle East. (Holmes)  With COX-ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN-BOX _ The major issues on the agenda.  Eds: To move Friday.  COX-SCOTLAND-ARMY _ BLAIR ATHOLL, Scotland _ The Atholl Highlanders, the only private army left in Europe, was formed in 1778 to fight for the Red Coats against the American colonists, but went to Ireland instead and never reached America. Although the Highlanders were primed to meet an intended invasion of Ireland by French and Spanish troops, and were later ordered to India but mutinied instead and stayed home. Indeed, the Duke of Atholl's private army has never looked anyone in the eye and fired a musket. It's a good thing, too. If the 80-man army had ever fired a shot in anger instead of parading spit and polished in full regalia, its members would never have been able to live up to their oath, which is: ``To drink whiskey and hold it and know when to stop without going over the top.'' (Salome)  Eds: MOVED Thursday.  WASHINGTON  COX-DRUGS-$ADV05 _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton last week turned the spotlight back on the war on drugs. Republicans say his policy to devote most of the federal drug effort to treatment of hard-core addicts rather than drug interdiction, prosecution and prevention has been a failure resulting in increased usage of illegal drugs among young people. For Sunday (Lipman 1200).  COX-DRUGS-DATA-$ADV05 _ Data for a chart on trends in drug use and antidrug enforcement.  COX-CLINTON-CONSULTANT _ WASHINGTON _ After nearly three roller coaster years, President Clinton has suddenly broken through to his highest approvals yet. To what degree can this be attributed to the guidance of the mystery man of politics, Dick Morris? Some say Morris deserves much of the credit. Who is this shadowy figure, who came out of hiding briefly at the Gridiron dinner last month to poke fun at himself? (Malone).  Eds: To move Friday.  POLITICS  COX-GINGRICH-FUNDS-$ADV05 _ DALLAS _ With disapproval ratings that range around 50 percent, House Speaker Newt Gingrich is easily the country's most unpopular national official today. But when he's out on the stump, it's clear that Gingrich touches the Republican core like no other. (Cummings 950).  MOVED Thursday in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.

NATIONAL  COX-SHENANDOAH-$ADV05 _ MIDDLETOWN, Va. _ I found the world headquarters and manufacturing facilities of Route 11 Chips in a converted feed store half a block off Route 11, which also serves as Main Street in this Shenandoah Valley community. Owner Sarah Cohen moved here after she was mugged and a friend was murdered on the streets of Washington, D.C. There is peace in the valley _ but also much more. Bounded by the Blue Ridge Mountains on the east and by the Allegheny Mountains to the west, the valley begins where the headwaters of the Shenandoah River form near the historic college town of Lexington, Va. (Dart 1500).  COX-HOMESTEAD-$ADV05 _ HOT SPRINGS, Va. _ Bubbling at 96 degrees Fahrenheit inside a white clapboard bathhouse built in 1761, the pool of mineral waters has soothed and invigorated Americans from Thomas Jefferson to Willard Scott. Some folks still come to The Homestead to ``take the cure'' of rejuvenating spring waters that have drawn travelers to the Allegheny Mountains resort for two centuries. However, visitors are now as likely to book a stay in the venerable hotel for the golf, skiing, gourmet food or flat-out pampering as for the historic spa treatments. (Dart 1320).  Eds: Both MOVED Monday in advance for Sunday, May 5.  COX-IMMIGRATION-BORDER _ SAN LUIS, Ariz. _ As U.S. Border Patrol Agent Robert Roll drives slowly along the Arizona-Mexico border, his eyes scan the dusty road for fresh footprints that could lead him to an illegal alien. He slows to a stop, backs up and gets out of the car. He kneels down and carefully inspects the two-way footprints left on the road. ``It looks like someone was headed across the border, but turned and ran back across when they saw us coming,'' Roll said. Adding to the Border Patrol has been one of the few areas that both Democrats and Republicans have agreed as the Congress continues to debate U.S. immigration reform. But despite the presence of Border Patrol agents in the area, San Luis has become a ``hot spot'' for illegal aliens crossing the Mexico border, according to Mike Leyva, a patrol spokesman in Yuma, Ariz. (Jackson 850).  EDs: Story MOVED Wednesday.  COX-CONGRESS-RETIRE _ AUSTIN, Texas _ When Charlie Wilson, the flamboyant lawmaker from East Texas, leaves Congress this summer, he'll stay in Washington and start a potentially lucrative lobbying career. Wilson, a 24-year old veteran of Capitol Hill, also will contribute to the perception that most members of Congress don't go home when their tour is up, but stay in Washington to trade on their experience and contacts to become high- paid influence peddlers. Despite the stereotype, Wilson's post-congressional career choice is the exception, not the rule. Of the eight Texans _ a record number _ who have quit or lost their re-election bids this year, Wilson is the only one not planning to come home. And of the 353 members who left the U.S. House between 1984 and 1993, only about a quarter stayed in Washington; the others all went home, according to a survey by the Center for Public Integrity.

SPORTS  COX-OLY-RUSSIA-MAIN _ VOLGOGRAD, Russia _ From just one swim club in this poor smoke stack city, Russia is about to send three odds-on gold medalists to the '96 Olympics in Atlanta. Volgograd doesn't have enough orders for its helicopter factories. Most of the downtown bread stores have been driven out of business by stagflation. But Volgograd does have Viktor Avdeyenko, a miracle-worker of a swim coach. Here and throughout Russia, little remains of the old Moscow-run, Moscow-financed sports juggernaut. The old network of neighborhood sports clubs and Komsomol youth teams that turned the country into one vast Olympic farm system has eroded into history. Yet despite all of Russia's maladies _ from mafia-controlled business to unstable leadership to civil war in Chechnya _ this country still has found a way to nourish several planeloads of top-drawer Olympic athletes. (Albright/Kunstel 850)  Eds: MOVED Tuesday.  COX-OLY-RUSSIA-KARELIN _ PODOLSK SPORTS BASE, Russia _ Alexander Karelin, king of the beasts in what may be the nastiest, most bone-crunching Olympic sport, lounges near the mat like a lion in the shade. ``I am very fond of Pavarotti,'' says Karelin, reflecting on what he likes to do for fun besides gut-wrenching yet another terrified 275-pound beefcake into submission. ``I like various arias Pavarotti performs because there is soul in his voice,'' expounds the world's champion Greco-Roman superheavyweight wrestler. (Albright 700&AMP;ADD)  Eds: MOVED Tuesday.  COX-OLY-RUSSIA-PRIVALOVA _ MOSCOW _ At 3, Irina Privalova was a figure skater. At 9, her father steered her into speed skating because she accelerated like a rocket. Privalova soon won a girls national speed-skating competition. But she hated having to compete when it was cold. It was too much like those winters when her father Anatoly, an athletic coach, kept nagging her to dive though a hole he'd chopped in the ice. By the time Privalova abandoned skating, she was a relentless athlete in search of the right sport. In high school she swam and ran cross-country. Then she became a high-jumper, clearing a respectable five-foot-seven-and-a-half. At 16 it was on to broad jumping, hurdling javelin throwing. It was only at Moscow State University that a track coach challenged 17-year-old Privalova to pour her talents into sprinting. Now, a decade later, Privalova is getting ready for a mighty try to prove there isn't a faster woman on the planet. (Albright 500)  Eds: MOVED Tuesday.
