"27919"	"we"	"tried"	" ``The people who would choose to watch the competition in the first place are probably not offended by the swimsuit competition. If they're asking that audience, I doubt it will be voted out,'' said Deborah Watkins, president of the Tarrant County chapter of the National Organization for Women. ``That's sort of a cop-out way to say, `Well, we tried, but the public wanted it.''' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"33193"	"they"	"tried"	" Chief Charles G. Reuther said that the two men bound and gagged the 20-year-old woman, threw her in the trunk of her white 1994 Honda Accord and took her to a vacant house at 78-08 86th Avenue in Woodhaven, where they tied her to a chair and left her for three days. Then, police said, they tried, without success, to contact her father, Thomas, to demand money for the release of his daughter. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199509.gz"

"46060"	"I"	"tried"	" I'll also be going to a contest sponsored by a local radio station that will award a pair of game tickets to the person who does the craziest thing to earn them. A word of warning: A similar contest was held last year in Miami. And while the constraints of a decent, family newspaper won't allow me to tell you what the winner did to earn his ticket (actually, I tried, but editors cut it out), at least keep this in mind: The guy who brought a dog, two bowls and two cans of dog food to the contest and proceeded to race the dog to see who could finish a can first didn't win. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"

"106595"	"he"	"tried"	" In 1996, a triple-murder suspect awaiting trial in an Oregon jail delivered a confession to a Catholic priest in which he denied killing the victims. When the priest learned that the confession had been taped and that the suspect hoped to use it as evidence in his trial, he tried, through a petition and eventually a lawsuit, to have the tape deemed inadmissible. But only on appeal did he prevail. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"118104"	"I"	"tried"	" By the end of the song, Eminem reiterates what we already figured out: ``I told you I can't sing, oh well, I tried,'' but maintains he wants to ``(expletive) sing 'cuz I'm happy.'' Whew! If that dreadful sound trying to pass as singing means Eminem is happy, then someone needs to page the misanthropic Slim Shady right away. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020611.0095 type=story > <HEADLINE> 21, WITH A CD ON EPIC.

"142195"	"they"	"tried"	" Oh, they tried, and even looked a little desperate in their efforts to steal a game here. Down a run in the ninth and facing Boston closer Keith Foulke, designated hitter Troy Glaus led off with a ringing single into the left-field corner. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"143294"	"it"	"tried"	" It has done well with features that are done with NFL Films, such as wiring players for sound, or as it did last week, following Minnesota Vikings coach Mike Tice in the seven days leading to Monday Night. Last year, it tried, with uneven results, a musical competition between NFL players. But at least they didn't stuff each other's heads into tubas. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"

"157933"	"he"	"tried"	" But his ability to wear stardom as a loose garment -- People magazine might as well forgo the suspense over its Sexiest Man Alive feature until Clooney starts to grow ear hair -- obscures a serious film wonk within. His 2002 directorial debut, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, a movie that took the game-show host Chuck Barris at his word that he was also once a CIA hit man, left many scratching their heads, but little doubt that Clooney, who has a reputation as a prankster, is plenty serious behind the camera. And when he first got started on Good Night, in search of an urgent, documentary feel, he tried, without success, to hunt down the exact lenses Godard used in his 16 mm films. In conversation, he riffs about film stocks, the documentary aesthetic and the exigencies of contemporary moviemaking. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
