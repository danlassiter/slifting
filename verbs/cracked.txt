"8439"	"he"	"cracked"	" Dole is to be the next majority leader. He said he saw no conflict between serving in that position and running for the presidency.

"20342"	"he"	"cracked"	" By the end of last season, Grant didn't want to take it anymore. He was incensed when Jackson and the Bulls questioned his willingness to play hurt, a charge that surfaced again this season when Orlando and Chicago were set to tap off and Grant's status was murky because of an injury. When Jackson was asked about the matchup with Grant, he cracked, ``Let's see if he shows up first.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"35894"	"he"	"cracked"	" The two friends played golf after Majerle was informed of the trade. Majerle said he won the match and some money from Kleine and, showing that he had kept his sense of humor, he cracked, ``But I'll probably never see it, like usual.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"
"48022"	"he"	"cracked"	" Despite the inability to pass the bill, Gramm's absence clearly delighted Dole. When asked what his plans were, he cracked, ``Maybe I'll go to Louisiana.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199602.gz"
"61686"	"he"	"cracked"	" Incidentally, we didn't have to do completely without Andrews last night. The producers wryly slipped in a clip of her from ``Camelot,'' and the show's host, Nathan Lane, had a ball at the wounded diva's expense, coming out as Andrews to the strains of ``The Sound of Music'' in double drag (a man impersonating a woman impersonating a man). Andrews was off, he cracked, ``hosting a telethon for the egregiously overlooked. ... I used to be their poster boy.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199606.gz"
"99861"	"he"	"cracked"	" McGinest invariably takes his time after a game, refusing to talk until he is completely put together. Turning around to see a small media army ready to record his insights, he cracked, ``Man, a couple of weeks ago, I couldn't find you all.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"

BLAME THE OSCAR HOST  BC-ROEPER-OSCARS-COLUMN _ Believe it or not there was a time when Chevy Chase was a logical choice to host the Academy Awards, and that time was 1988. It may not have been the most exemplary hosting job, as Chevy Chase's biggest fan has always been Chevy Chase, and smug nonchalance doesn't play well on Hollywood's biggest night _ just ask David Letterman. But Chase did deliver the most hilarious opening line in Oscar telecast history:  ``Good evening, Hollywood phonies.''  The joke drew uproarious laughter _ because it was funny, and because the audience was indeed packed with the usual pantheon of Hollywood phonies. By Richard Roeper.

It may not have been the most exemplary hosting job, as Chevy Chase's biggest fan has always been Chevy Chase, and smug nonchalance doesn't play well on Hollywood's biggest night _ just ask David Letterman. But Chase did deliver the most hilarious opening line in Oscar telecast history:  ``Good evening, Hollywood phonies.''
