"1156"	"you"	"are"	" ``The larger you are, the more capable, presumably, you are,'' Nisbet said Wednesday. ``It certainly gives you increased recognition as a primary source for defense products.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199407.gz"

"3641"	"they"	"are"	" These signs have returned with the start of school. If I took better care of my yard, I'd know the students are messing it up. As it is, I can't always be sure. As it is, the part of the yard through which they pass is in the process of returning to nature. I believe the schoolkids may be speeding up the process. If so, they are, as I suspected all along, allied with the possums. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199408.gz"
"4627"	"they"	"are"	" ``Obviously, they are, but they're not playing nine-man fronts all the time,'' Graber said. ``We can't continue to win unless we control the ball on the offensive side and on the defensive side.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199409.gz"
"4824"	"they"	"are"	" If nothing else, they are, as Limbaugh notes, a well-dressed group. The tickets -- available by calling (212) 397-7367 Monday through Thursday from 7 to 10 a.m. Pacific time -- request jacket and tie, a provision unheard of since the days of Jack Paar's ``Tonight Show,'' which much of this crowd looks old enough to remember. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199409.gz"

"6982"	"they"	"are"	" Yeltsin has increasingly surrounded himself with loyalists from Yekaterinburg and his early Moscow days, rather the way an American president does. And these officials, with all the perks of office, know that once Yeltsin is gone, they are, too. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199410.gz"
"13273"	"you"	"are"	" Hawke is a passionate fan of the classic Bob Dylan documentary ``Don't Look Back,'' in which a ferocious Dylan can be seen stomping on an interviewer who is trying to label him. ``The writer asks, `How do you feel as a folk singer?' And Dylan's, like, `I'm not a folk singer.' `Well, yes, you are, you sing folk songs.' And Dylan says, `I also go to sleep, but I'm not a sleeper. I do lots of things.' It's just that even the littlest labels end up stopping your head.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"

"21591"	"they"	"are"	" But this is a working port. While tourists may think that Eugenia Moran, E.F. Moran and Nancy Moran, the red and black tugboats tied up at the Ceres Street dock, add a charming ambiance, especially when veiwed from the waterfront restaurants along Ceres and Bow Streets, they are, in fact, workboats. The tugs are used to dock and undock ships on the Piscataqua River, notorious for its swift currents (averaging 3 to 4 knots) and tidal changes (a 9-foot rise and fall). </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"22589"	"you"	"are"	" I hear what you're saying. You're saying, ``Dave, you are, once again, an idiot. A horn is an important safety feature. It sounds a warning to other motorists or pedestrians or animals and alerts them to your presence. Horn honking prevents accidents.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"22728"	"they"	"are"	" That's hardly a safer alternative. Christine and her classmates now find themselves in a legal no man's land. At 18, they're considered adults. Yet when they want to enjoy a drink like other adults, they are, as they put it, ``disenfranchised.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"

"23000"	"you"	"are"	" But if your pecs jiggle and your belly wobbles, you are, as Foreman discovered during his comeback, derided for not caring, being a travesty to heavyweight boxing history, as if the sport does not damage itself fine on its own. And if you come back after you've spent a decade chopping trees, shaving your hair off and preaching on Texas street corners, you are quite the porcine oddity. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"23478"	"they"	"are"	" In Dyson's view, it is the CIGs, among them the Metropolitan Museum and Carnegie Hall, that bring in those big tourist bucks. About that, Dyson is clearly accurate. As for the program groups, whose fate he would leave mostly to challenge grants, they are, he said once, simply recipients of ``clubhouse type political handouts.'' About that, he is not right. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"25710"	"we"	"are"	" ``There are some items in this budget which the Legislature considers priorities in the local level,'' he said. ``We can't forget that the Legislature is closer to the local spending needs than, perhaps, we are, but we are going to look at those items on a case-by-case basis.'' </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950619.0739 type=story > <HEADLINE> CIGAR, CONCERN COULD MEAN $1 MILLION PURSE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-RAC-GOLDCUP-LADN) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

"66181"	"we"	"are"	" Starting last Saturday morning, we are, too, in Belfast and Mindanao and Beirut and Saudi Arabia and in all the other places where terror has become potluck. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"
"71216"	"they"	"are"	" You'll wonder how Ballard and cinematographer Caleb Deschanel photographed the geese in flight _ the film's most breathtaking and memorable sequences. The images of the wildfowl against sunsets, clouds, electric blue skies and autumn foliage are glorious. And before they reach the flying stage, they are, of course, adorable little squawking fuzzballs with short wings and long legs. After Paquin's sad, balky teen discovers and hatches the nest full of eggs in a tree felled by developers, she finds she has taken on more responsibility than she foresaw. She didn't realize she would be the one to imprint on the geese as their parent figure, the one they follow everywhere. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"
"76333"	"they"	"are"	" On the day before the girls are to attend their first group signing for ``The Magnificent Seven'' (Bantam), the recently published book thrown together to cash in on their new fame, they are, as usual, stretching on the mat. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"
"76335"	"they"	"are"	" On the day before the girls are to attend their first group signing for ``The Magnificent Seven'' (Bantam), the recently published book thrown together to cash in on their new fame, they are, as usual, stretching on the mat. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"

"80393"	"they"	"are"	" ``If you ask the Lakers, they are,'' Grant said. ``If you ask us, we are. If you ask the fans here, they are. If you ask the fans in Orlando, we are.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"
"84806"	"they"	"are"	" If the Ramseys had anything to do with their little girl's murder, they are, needless to say, very, very sick human beings. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"90624"	"they"	"are"	" But amidst all the hoopla, many of the show's fans me included) conveniently lost track of the plain truth that while ``The Sopranos'' characters may seem just like us, they are, in fact, monsters. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"91206"	"they"	"are"	" As I have repeatedly maintained, the Texas judiciary is by and large filled with good people who are serious about their responsibilities. But let's get real. As long as judges have to pick a party and run for office, they are, by definition, politicians. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"91296"	"they"	"are"	" But if what fashion insiders buy and wear themselves is another measure of influence, Galliano's clothes and accessories for Dior haven't been as popular as those by Gucci or Prada. Editors choose, and by picking one brand over another, they are, in effect, casting crucial votes. But things are changing at Dior, in part because of the perception that fashion has become thoughtlessly uniform, and in part because of real strategies imposed by Toledano over the last three years. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
"94782"	"they"	"are"	" ``They can't possibly be praised highly enough _ secular civic saints, they are,'' said Wallace, co-author of the ``Gotham'' history. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"
"96344"	"they"	"are"	" ``I think it does seem free lyrically,'' she told ``Jet'' magazine. ``Musically I'd say, as far as the melodies go, they are, too. Musically, I think it is freeing. It sounds very liberating.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"
"98409"	"we"	"are"	" Yes, we are, he was told. It was the best game we saw in Boston all  year and perhaps the best game anybody saw anywhere. What he and David  Cone did that night made the little hairs at the back of everyone's neck  snap to attention. That brought a smile to his face and a ``thank you''  to his lips. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"100036"	"they"	"are"	" Hit them where they live, the saying goes. Well, they are hitting us where we work. ID cards where there weren't any before are but one most visible sign. All over the city, people go racing by with images of themselves around their necks. The cards all look like dog tags. In a way, they are, in that dog tags are necklaces worn in war. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"100757"	"they"	"are"	" While consumer confidence measures pretend to be scientific and statistical, they are, in reality, simply measurements of consumer perceptions. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"101541"	"we"	"are"	" ``Yes, we are,'' she says, barely above a whisper. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"102302"	"they"	"are"	" Why are stuffed animals considered appropriate? Well, they are, Black said. ``All types of things that record feelings and emotions,'' she said, even the stilled timepiece someone left with no explanation. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"113612"	"they"	"are"	" Murcutt is that rare species in top-flight architecture: a sole practitioner. He works without a computer at home in Sydney in a 13-square-foot office that he shares with his wife, Wendy Lewin, also an architect. He is passionate in his distaste for the computer, now the compulsory tool of virtually every architect. ``Stupid things, they are,'' he said. ``They are not truly logical: click on this, click on that.'' Further, he says, the computer destroys the eye-hand connection that he considers vital to good architecture.

, he said,	 Certainly, the 1972 Dolphins winning 17 consecutive games in one season would be a greater feat than the Patriots breaking the record over a two-year span. But if the Patriots do it, it would be an important record for the team, the coach, and the NFL, which scheduled the Dolphins as New England's potential record-breaking opponent. This past week, members of that '72 team downplayed the Patriots' quest to Armando Salguero of the Miami Herald. When Salguero asked Hall of Fame linebacker Nick Buoniconti (a former Patriot and Dolphin) about it, he said, You don't really want me to dignify that by answering the question do you? Don Shula was asked if he thought the Patriots would be considered in the same company with his '72 Dolphins if their streak reached 17. Sure, when the Patriots get all their wins in one year, Shula said. If they start out 17-0 next year, then ask me that question. </P> 	nyt_eng_200409.gz

The funny part is that Dorsey happens to be Chase Haslett's favorite player. Chase's father is Saints coach Jim Haslett, who recalls getting a call from his son prior to the second day of the 2003 draft asking him to select Dorsey, who went in the seventh round to San Francisco. I get an earful about it all the time about how good he is, said Haslett. When Chase learned that Dorsey would start, Haslett said, He was just ripping me about it. When Dorsey heard of Chase's adulation, he said, I didn't know that. We need to throw him in the front office. But it's funny; I imagine it's more from college than the pros. Hopefully his son will be at the game. </P> 	nyt_eng_200409.gz

Lynch was called for unnecessary roughness. Hall has been in a lot of pain since the hit. How much did he get fined? Hall asked the media. When told, he said, That's not enough. That won't even cover my pain and suffering. I haven't been able to eat for three days, strictly ice cream and milkshakes. I tried to eat meat and, oh my goodness. I've been in a lot of pain the last couple of days. It goes to show you that Lynch can still hit with the best of them. Upon getting the letter informing him of his fine, Lynch said, They called it a head-to-chest, which is a new one to me. We'll appeal and see where it goes from there. The hit was all over ESPN and I'm sure it will be on the greatest hits at the end of the season. They'll sell it and yet they'll try to fine me. The hypocrisy is terrible. </P> 	nyt_eng_200409.gz
, you know,	 Jerry Rice and Raiders coach Norv Turner met last week to clear the air about Rice not playing against Pittsburgh as the Raiders were coming back from a 21-10 deficit only to lose, 24-21. The 41-year-old Rice has known that he won't be the headliner in the offense, though he made two receptions against Pittsburgh to extend his streak to 274 games with a catch. But he was taken aback when Turner didn't tell him he wasn't going to be used late in the game. Turner agreed that Rice deserves an explanation on how he'll be used. I think he had five balls thrown to him, Turner said. That's not a lot by some standards. But, you know, it's certainly not no balls thrown to him. Rice said he doesn't have to be the center of attention. For so many years, people's perception of me was that I was selfish, he said. I told people Bill Walsh created this monster. He did it to me. He put a lot of pressure on me. He let it be known that I make plays for the team to win and to carry the load.
