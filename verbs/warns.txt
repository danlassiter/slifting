Times News Service  CLINTON CHALLENGES CONGRESS ON AIR-SAFETY  WASHINGTON (NYT) _ President Clinton challenged Congress on Monday to find more than $1 billion to finance a catch-all collection of anti-terrorism measures, including sweeping new airline security equipment and procedures and stepped-up protection at federal offices, museums and monuments around the nation and the world.  ``We know we can't make the world risk-free, but we can reduce the risks we face and we have to take the fight to the terrorists,'' Clinton said in an Oval Office ceremony accepting the recommendations of an airline safety commission headed by Vice President Al Gore. ``If we have the will, we can find the way.''  Senior administration officials acknowledged that the measures, taken together, would commit the government to permanently expanding its financial and operational role in assuring airline and airport safety, in the name of overall national security. They said it would also mean new costs for the commercial airline industry, but said they could not estimate how much.  STATE OFFICIALS MEET ON WELFARE  WASHINGTON (NYT) _ After 15 years of pushing to win more authority over welfare policy, state officials gathered here Monday for meetings on the new welfare law spent much of the day complaining that they were in need of more federal guidance.  Many state officials said they expected to reap financial windfalls from the new law, signed by President Clinton 18 days ago, because the number of welfare recipients had dropped far below the 1992-94 level, used in computing federal payments for most states.  But the officials said they were frustrated by their inability to get authoritative interpretations of the new law from President Clinton's top domestic policy adviser, Carol H. Rasco, or from Mary Jo Bane, the assistant secretary of health and human services for children and families.  State and federal officials seemed to be feeling their way toward a new relationship as more than 500 state officials met behind closed doors to try to understand the intricacies of the law, which Congress passed at their behest.  3-STRIKE POLICY RARELY USED  (NYT) _ The popular ``Three Strikes and You're Out'' policy, passed by more than half the states over the past three years, have been rarely used, with the major exception of California, and they have had little impact on crime rates, according to two new studies and interviews with prison officials.  In at least six states no one has yet been convicted under the three strikes statutes, and in five others there have been three or fewer convictions. Similarly, to date only nine criminals have been sentenced under a federal version of the three strikes law.  California has the most stringent of the new statutes, which calls for doubling a criminal's sentence for a second felony and a mandatory 25 years to life sentence for a lengthy list of third felony convictions. So far 16,707 people have been sentenced under California's law, the vast majority for so-called second strikes. But the studies indicate that even in California far fewer criminals have been convicted than originally anticipated and that the rate of criminals tried under the law is slowing down.  GEPHARDT TELLS IOWANS ABOUT GOP `PLAN'  DES MOINES, Iowa (NYT) _ On a hot, hazy morning at a senior citizen center here, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, is giving 30 elderly Iowans his chilling rendition of what will happen to their Medicare insurance if the Republicans keep control of Congress in this November's elections.  House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, last year unsuccessfully sought to slash $270 billion over seven years from the program to pay mostly for tax cuts for the wealthy, Gephardt thunders. Unless Democrats regain control, he warns, Medicare will be threatened again.  ``Do we want a Congress that will protect Medicare, improve it and make it secure, or do we want a Congress that will continue to tear at it to pay for tax cuts for the rich?'' says Gephardt.  The partisan Democratic crowd, here to listen to Gephardt and two Democratic House candidates, leaves no doubt where its sentiments lie. ``Yeah, Gephardt's using some scare tactics, but there's also good reason to be concerned,'' said Jerry Ryan, 60, a retired John Deere repairman. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960909.0613 type=story > <HEADLINE> NEW REPORT ON DRUG ABUSE ADDS FUEL TO ELECTION YEAR DEBATE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WASHINGTON (BC-KIDS-DRUGS-HNS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"
