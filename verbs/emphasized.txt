WARNER LeROY RESISTS TEMPTATION  c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  NEW YORK _ Although there were plenty of parties in the Hamptons last weekend, the only one on everyone's lips was the screening and celebration on Saturday for the HBO production of ``Truman.''  Michael Fuchs, chairman of HBO who was the evening's host, gives a party with a screening every year, one of the most celebrity-studded events of the season. The topic of conversation was who was on the guest list and who had been excised from it. The list had been pared down from last year's 700 to 100 by Peggy Siegal, the publicist.  The person who garnered the most attention for not being on the list was Jerry Della Femina, the advertising executive and restaurateur. So peeved was he to be cut that he wrote his column ``Jerry's Ink'' in the East Hampton Independent about the omission, noting, ``This year I decided once and for all that we would definitely not attend this event,'' citing the traffic and the crowd pushing to the food. ``But I couldn't wait for the invitation to arrive so that I could reject it.''  In the column that appeared on July 26, he announced that he was removing Ms. Siegal's caricature from the wall of his Della Femina restaurant in East Hampton.  ``We must have had 50 calls from people asking for reservations for Saturday night and asking if I were removing her from the wall then,'' he said Monday. ``Actually she came down the day I wrote the column.''  So where, one might ask, was Della Femina that night?  ``I did go to a party, at Nick and Bonnie Virbitsky's and then had dinner at East Hampton Point,'' he said, referring to the other restaurant he owns in the resort town.  c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  NEW YORK _ Some celebrities, it was rumored, chose not to venture out at all in the Hamptons rather than publicly acknowledge that they were not on the Michael Fuchs list.  Or so it was said at a benefit for the Family Service League of Suffolk County that did attract more than 500 people to the Bridgehampton estate of Walter and Molly Channing. Some 35 chefs from Long Island and Manhattan (including Pat Trama from Della Femina) put up tables laden with offerings ranging from barbecued loin of Australian venison to Southwestern sushi rolls to sarsparilla.  Warner LeRoy, owner of Tavern on the Green, turned up there, but not for long, and not, he emphasized, to taste anything or to gather any ideas for the Russian Tea Room, which he recently bought and will start running in January.  ``I stayed just enough time to say hello to some of my friends,'' LeRoy said after the party. ``I've been on a diet and have lost 45 pounds in the past 9 weeks. I have about another 85 pounds to go.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950814.0776 type=story > <HEADLINE> MILLIONAIRE'S WIDOW, FAMILY AGREE TO DIVIDE HIS ASHES </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> HOUSTON (BC-MILLIONAIRE-ASHES-HNS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"

Times News Service  U.S., JAPAN REACH AIR CARGO AGREEMENT  TOKYO (NYT) _ The United States and Japan have essentially reached an agreement on air cargo service between the two nations, erasing one dispute that threatened to mar next month's summit meeting between President Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.  The agreement will expand the routes between and beyond the two countries available to two Japanese airlines and to several American companies, particularly the United Parcel Service, according to officials from both governments. A formal accord will be drafted in Washington next month.  Ryosei Akazawa, deputy director of the civil aviation bureau at Japan's ministry of transportation, said the agreement would right the imbalance in favor of American carriers that Japan claims has existed since the two nations signed a civil aviation treaty in 1952. ``We've practically realized equality for the first time in 43 years,'' he said.  __  U.S., ALLIES AT ODDS FOLLOWING ANTI-TERRORIST SUMMIT  PARIS (NYT) _ Differences between the United States and its European allies have emerged over the follow-up to the recent anti-terrorism summit meeting in Egypt, diplomats in Paris say.  France, hoping for backing from Germany, Italy and Britain, wants to spearhead a European initiative on the stalled Middle East peace process at a working-group meeting in Washington on Thursday that American officials want to focus on anti-terrorist measures in the wake of the recent Palestinian bombings in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, European and American officials say.  Urged on by Egypt and other Arab countries that participated in the 27-nation gathering in Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt, the Europeans want Israel to ease back on retaliation against Palestinians for the recent terrorist bombings and to resume peace negotiations with Syria, according to the diplomats.  ``We think that the peace process is in real danger, for the first time since it began,'' a French official said. ``We believe the followup should treat the causes of terrorism, not just the effects. Repressive policies will not help the peace process in the long run.''  __  MEETING BETWEEN BOSNIAN MUSLIM AND CROAT LEADERS CANCELED  BONN, Germany (NYT) _ In a sign of the deepening Bosnian disarray that is threatening the peace accords reached in Dayton, Ohio, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel canceled a meeting Wednesday that was to bring Bosnian Muslim and Croat leaders together in Bonn on Thursday to help strengthen their nebulous federation.  A foreign ministry statement said the two wings of the Muslim-Croat Federation were too far apart for the meeting, set for the Petersberg guest-house overlooking the Rhine, to take place.  The supposed alliance of Muslims and Croats is a central element of U.S. and European strategy to mold peace in Bosnia by forging the two ethnic groups into a unit to counter-balance Serb power.  But the persistent inability of the two sides to overcome territorial and political differences is creating a mood of growing frustration within the so-called contact group _ the U.S., Russia, France, Britain and Germany _ charged with nurturing the peace accords.  __  ISRAEL POLITICAL PARTIES CHOOSE SLATES  JERUSALEM (NYT) _ Israel's major political parties this week chose their slates for the May 29 elections, both pushing former military men to the fore for a campaign likely to focus sharply on security issues.  The primary elections _ the ruling Labor party's on Monday and the opposition Likud's on Tuesday _ also cleared the last formality before the start of a campaign that many Israelis consider one of the most important in their history.  The party balloting did not affect either Prime Minister Shimon Peres or Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu, since under rules in force for the first time this year they will compete directly for the prime ministry.  But when voting for the 120-seat legislature, the Knesset, voters will cast ballots for a party, not an individual. The parties will then divide up the seats in proportion to the votes they receives.  __  EUROPEAN COMMISSION IMPOSES SIX-WEEK WORLDWIDE BAN ON BRITISH BEEF  (NYT) _ Reacting to fears that a deadly disease may have entered the human food chain, the European Commission on Wednesday imposed a six-week worldwide ban on British beef and a host of British beef products ranging from medicine to cosmetics.  Even though coupled with an offer of financial aid, the move was a rebuff to Britain by its European partners and a serious blow to its $6.5-billion beef industry.  It made it virtually certain that the government, already under fire for its handling of the beef crisis, will be forced to order at least a partial slaughter of older cattle among the nation's 11-million herd.  The government made it clear Wednesday that it was considering various proposals for a culling of the animals but merely, it emphasized, as a measure to win back consumer confidence and not because it considers the beef itself unsafe to eat.  ``The argument has moved on. The issue is no longer the question of the safety of British beef,'' said Stephen Dorrell, the health secretary. ``The question now is consumer confidence.''  __  RABIN ASSASSIN SENTENCED TO LIFE  TEL AVIV, Israel (NYT) _ Yigal Amir, the man who shattered Israel when he assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, was sentenced to life imprisonment Wednesday after being found guilty of murder.  In a judgement laced with poetry and soaring prose, Presiding Judge Edmond Levy brought two months of often technical proceedings at the Tel Aviv District Court to an emotional conclusion, grieving for the loss of a national leader and condemning Amir as someone who had ``lost his human image.''  Wearing a white shirt and the black skullcap of an Orthodox Jew, Amir, 25, stood in the dock and listened to the sentence with downcast eyes, gazing up occasionally to look at the judge.  Unrepentant to the end, Amir asserted that he had served his people and his country when he shot and killed Rabin after a peace rally in Tel Aviv on Nov. 4. Amir has repeatedly argued that his objective was to stop Rabin from endangering Israel by handing over land to Palestinian rule under an accord with the Palestine Liberation Organization. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960327.0576 type=story > <HEADLINE> U.S. BONDS DECLINE AMID SPECULATION OF PIMCO SELLING </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> New York, March 27 (Bloomberg) (BC-US-BONDS-CLOSE-BLOOM) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199603.gz"

Both characters break the fourth wall and present the audience with their sides of the story, thus putting the spectators in the position of adjudicating an impassioned debate between a Jewish mother and a pope. While it is easy to see how people could identify with a mother's struggle to reclaim her child, Uhry said, he hoped to make the pope an equally compelling character. Pius IX, he emphasized, was following the dictates of his faith, even though he knew his decision to keep Edgardo from his family would weaken the church's temporal power in the political landscape of 19th-century Italy, which was on the verge of unification. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
