The Adventures of Priscilla,   Queen of the Desert R   The boys on the bus would rather be thought of as the girls on the bus in this spirited Aussie froth about two drag queens (Hugo Weaving and Guy Pearce) and a transsexual ('60s stud Terence Stamp) on a cross-country jaunt through the Outback. Rated R for sex-related situations and language.   Barcelona PG-13   Set in Spain, Whit Stillman's literate, witty romantic comedy takes place within the socio-political context of ``the last decade of the Cold War.'' Starring Taylor Nichols and Chris Eigemann. Rated PG- 13 for language and violence.   Blankman PG-13   Damon Wayans stars as a nerdy inventor who becomes a bargain-basement superhero. The movie has a few humorous moments, at least enough to fill a five-minute ``In Living Color'' sketch, but stretched out to feature-film length, the joke wears more than a bit thin. Directed by Mike Binder. Rated   PG-13 for profanity, some violence, and some sexual situations.   Bullets Over Broadway R   It's as if Woody Allen decided to make a movie like the movie-within-the-movie in ``The Purple Rose of Cairo.'' Working in his Runyon-esque ``Broadway Danny Rose'' mode, he takes us back to the Great White Way of the Roaring '20s, for a theater-centric farce that ends up debating the artist vs. the man (something Woody's probably heard a lot of recently). John Cusack is the ardent young playwright who believes in art and Jennifer Tilly is the no-talent moll whose gangster-boyfriend bankrolls his play so she can go onstage. Rated R for language, adult themes.   Clear and Present Danger PG-13   Even when this new installment in the Tom Clancy film- adaptation franchise is far from clear, it's dangerously entertaining. Reteaming director Phillip Noyce and star Harrison Ford as CIA analyst Jack Ryan, it's more convoluted than ``Patriot Games.'' But also more gripping. Rated PG-13 for some intense action, violence and language. -- Steve Murray, staff writer   Clerks R   Quirky, irreverent and about as off-the-cuff casual as a movie can be (even a $27,000 movie), this black-and-white no-budget-er about a day in the life of two twentysomething Jersey guys named Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson) is grunge cinema at its best.   The Client PG-13   Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones are wonderful together in yet another John Grisham story. Unfortunately, they play supporting roles to a kid actor who's very impressive, but can't outshine them. Directed by Joel Schumacher. Rated PG-13 for violence and language.   Corrina, Corrina PG   In this beautifully acted, wonderfully perceptive comedy-drama, Whoopi Goldberg plays a '50s housekeeper who makes Mrs. Doubtfire look like W.C. Fields. Directed by Jessie Nelson. Rated PG for adult themes.   Forrest Gump PG-13   Tom Hanks is clueless in America in Robert Zemeckis' half-baked fable about an idiot-savant of sorts, skimming through the last half of the 20th century and colliding ``Zelig''-like with history. Rated PG-13 for adult themes.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941202.0030 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(2ndtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Fresh NR   The boy in this 'hood really is a boy -- a 12-year-old named Fresh (Sean Nelson) who divides his time between junior high and running drugs. The most important person in his life, however, is his near-derelict dad (Samuel L. Jackson) who passes along his passion for chess and, in doing so, teaches Fresh the strategy and mental agility he needs to pull off a revenge- scenario that Michael Corleone would envy. Not rated, but there is drug use, violence, profanity and adult themes.   Heavenly Creatures R   The nasty girls. Based on the true story of New Zealand's most sensational murder case, Peter Jackson's stunning film suggests a collision of Lizzie Borden, ``The World of Henry Orient,'' and the Leopold and Loeb case. Set in the early '50s, this is a tale of make-believe gone mad, of fantasy turned fatal. Two schoolgirls -- Pauline (Melanie Lynskey), a chubby, sullen misfit from a working-class family, and Juliet (Kate Winslet), a brash, worldly transplant from England -- discover a mutual passion for Mario Lanza and a mutual disdain for the rest of the world. Soon they've concocted a complicated fantasy world with giant butterflies, princesses and knights. Their parents think the friendship is ``unhealthy'' (i.e., lesbian overtones). But Jackson and his talented co-writer Frances Walsh are far more interested in a deliriously imaginative portrait of overheated adolescence run amok. Together, Pauline and Juliet create a kind of co-dependent hysteria; if they'd lived in 16th-century Salem, they'd be fingering witches. Both actresses are extraordinary, capturing the highly charged romanticism and the tentative eroticism of the relationship. And Jackson provides the perfect setting: a movie as swooningly self-intoxicated as its schoolgirl protagonists. See it.   Hoop Dreams PG-13   Three hours of basketball may sound like 21/2 hours too many for most moviegoers, but this extraordinary documentary is about so much more than backboards and rebounds. It's a richly observed, superbly nuanced look at the American Dream through the eyes of two teenage NBA hopefuls. Directed by Steve James. Rated PG-13 for profanity and drug use.   Interview With the Vampire R   As richly textured as a dark brocade, threaded with existential dread and drenched in plasma, Neil Jordan's film will disturb more viewers than just Oprah. It's filled with snapping necks, slit throats, rats and wrists draining crimson into goblets, and other bloody bits of necro-fun. But it's likely to thrill Anne Rice fans and seduce those unfamiliar with her books. Starring Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. Rated R for violence, gore, nudity and sexuality. -- Steve Murray   It Could Happen to You PG   This sweet nothing of a film pairs Nicolas Cage and Bridget Fonda in an appealing romantic fairy tale of love and the New York lottery. The film is too slight to be a grand romance, but it's definitely a winning one. Rated   PG for mild language, adult situations.   Jason's Lyric R   It starts with the promise of something invigorating and fresh. It's the story of an African-American family living outside the usual inner-city setting of gangsta flicks. But director Doug McHenry carries urban cliches with him into the suburbs: drugs, guns and a whore-madonna view of women that's not very different from a rap video. Rated R for violence, sex, language and drug use. -- Steve Murray, staff writer   Junior PG-13   The Terminator becomes The Incubator in this lighthearted, affectionate look at maternity. Or rather, paternity. Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as a dedicated scientist who, with his partner Danny DeVito, has invented a new drug to help difficult pregnancies reach term. When the FDA refuses to let them test it, they do what all movie doctors do -- go ahead in secret on their own. Rated PG-13 for mild language and adult themes.   Lassie PG   Lassie comes home to the big screen in an engaging family film directed by Daniel Petrie. Set in rural Virginia, this savvily updated version (by ``Paper House's'' Matthew Jacob) has a lot more in common with the TV series than the novel or the 1943 movie. But even after 50 years, it's still the same old story: a boy and his wonder-dog. The boy is Matt (Thomas Guiry), an angry adolescent who resents his new stepmom (Helen Slater) almost as much as he resents his dad's (Jon Tenney) moving the family from Baltimore to a sheep farm. The wonder-dog, of course, is Lassie who latches onto Matt when her owner is killed. Rated PG for mild violence.   The Last Seduction R   Probably the sleeper of the year. In the tradition of ``Double Indemnity'' and ``Body Heat,'' director John Dahl (``Red Rock West'') pairs a smart, sexy, no-good dame with a hunky sucker who's not half as smart as he thinks he is. Linda Fiorentino is a one-woman wrecking crew as a tough cookie with a lotta leg and even more nerve who easily gets nice-guy Peter Berg in her thrall. Rated R for sex, violence, language, nudity and adult themes.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941202.0031 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(3rdtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> Little Rascals PG   Rent the originals. The idea of turning Hal Roach's famed ``Our Gang'' shorts into a feature for '90s audiences is a dubious one at best. And it's been done in the worst possible way. Director Penelope Spheeris has found a remarkable cast of look-alikes who seem to have been cloned from some hidden source of Little Rascals DNA. But as well-trained and well-made-up as these kids are, they are pod-Rascals -- an artful semblance of the real thing but totally devoid of freshness, naturalness or spontaneity. Rated PG for smutty language.   Love Affair PG-13   If this timeless tale of true romance worked for Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne in 1939 (``Love Affair'') and for Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr in 1957 (``An Affair to Remember''), then why shouldn't it work in 1994 for Warren Beatty and Annette Bening? Well, it does. To a point. This is a first- class effort and while it isn't quite the heartbreaker one hopes for, it still manages to jerk a few tears.   A Low Down Dirty Shame R   Racist, sexist, homophobic, rude -- Keenen Ivory Wayan's new one is also shamelessly entertaining. It's a glass-smashing, car-cracking, action comedy that turns genre cliches into a romp. Wayans plays Andre Shame, your standard-issue private eye who gets in over his head investigating a standard-issue Hispanic drug lord (Andrew Divoff). Shame is aided by the hilarious Jada Pinkett (who walks away with the movie) as Peaches, his Girl Friday and Christie Love wannabe (``If you need backup,'' she says, ``I've got my stun gun and my .22''). The plot is the least interesting thing about ``Shame.'' Like some of the stuff in Wayan's old show, ``In Living Color,'' the best moments are throwaway riffs (Shame calming a pack of guard dogs by singing James Brown songs, or explaining away a black eye with, ``I went partying with Rodney King and Reginald Denny''). Even the questionable touches (the late Corwin Hawkins' over-the-top turn as a gay roomie; Salli Richardson's one-dimensional role as a lethal diva in the black bra) are offset by the high spirits. Rated R for violence, strong language and sex.-- Steve Murray   Mary Shelley's Frankenstein R   In Mary Shelley's classic 19th-century novel, medical student Victor Frankenstein learns that some things are better left to God. In this opulent, fever-pitched movie, director-star Kenneth Branagh learns that some things are better left to James Whale, the man who made the 1931 Karloff version. Not that Branagh's version is a total dud. But in its own way, it's as deliriously misguided as Shelley's mad-scientist protagonist. Rated R for violence, nudity and adult themes.   The Mask PG-13   Forget the superhero plot of this live-action cartoon and focus on the Looney-Tunes special effects, the immensely likable Jim Carrey and Milo the mighty Jack Russell terrier. Directed by Chuck Russell. Rated PG- 13 for mild violence.   Miracle on 34th Street PG   It would be a miracle indeed if a John Hughes remake could come anywhere close to replicating the whimsical magic of the 1947 original starring Edmund Gwenn and Natalie Wood. Alas, miracles don't happen every day and one certainly hasn't happened here. Despite a twinkly-eyed performance by Sir Richard Attenborough as The Man Who Would Be Santa and the gravelly voiced charm of little Mara Wilson as a non-believer ripe for conversion, this movie is staler than week-old fruitcake. Rated PG for mild adult themes.   Natural Born Killers R   Oliver Stone is a natural born moviemaker and a natural born troublemaker and this anarchic, almost surreal film shows both sides at their best. As emblematic of the disaffected, media- overload '90s as ``Bonnie and Clyde'' was of the '60s, ``Killers'' celebrates sex, violence and celebrity with a vengeance that's both visual and visceral. Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory (Juliette Lewis) are young, in love and they kill people. About 52 people before they're put in Tommy Lee Jones' jail. Rated R for extreme violence, gore, language, nudity and sexuality.   Only You PG   If only Hollywood would make more movies like this fanciful Roman holiday, starring Marisa Tomei as a bride-to-be on a quixotic romantic quest in Italy and Robert Downey Jr. as a gallant suitor who may or may not be her only one. Rated PG for mild sexual themes.   The Pagemaster G   Convincing proof that Team Disney aren't the only Masters of the Animation Universe. Several years in the making, this terrifically imaginative feature mixes live-action and animation. Then-10-year-old Macaulay Culkin stars as a timid kid who won't even eat a tuna-fish sandwich (``He's afraid of the mercury in the tuna,'' explains mom, played by Mel Harris). When Culkin takes cover from a storm in an old library run by a mysterious Christopher Lloyd, he's turned into a 'toon. Like a certain girl from Kansas, all he wants to do is get home. To do so, he must jump in and out of several literary classics, accompanied by a trio of talking tomes: peg-legged Adventure (voice by Patrick Stewart), feisty Fantasy (Whoopi Goldberg) and slobberingly harmless Horror (Frank Welken). Joe Johnston (``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'') did the live-action scenes and former Disney illustrator Maurice Hunt supervised the animation. A celebration of the power of imagination and how easily it can be tapped by curling up with a good book, ``The Pagemaster'' has visual panache and great throwaway humor. It may not be up there with ``Beauty and the Beast'' or ``Bambi,'' but it's in the ballpark. Besides, you've already seen ``The Lion King.''  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941202.0032 type=multi > <DATELINE>  (BC-MINI-REVIEWS-(4thtake)-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> The Professional R   French director Luc Besson (``La Femme Nikita'') goes American and his movie goes down the drain. Again the stylish Frenchman dazzles us with explosions and massacres, killer babes and their world-weary mentors. But this time, the babe really is a babe -- a precocious 12-year-old (Natalie Portman) who takes up with a professional hitman (Jean Reno) after her family is wiped out by a crooked DEA agent (a hilariously hammy Gary Oldman). Besson opts for a superfluous titillation factor, letting Portman walk around in budding- adolescent undershirts and do Madonna impersonations for Reno. He, in turn, stands around with his mouth hanging open, looking slightly stunned. Rated R for violence, language and adult themes.   Pulp Fiction R   Pop goes the pulp in this smashing sophomore effort by Quentin ``Reservoir Dogs'' Tarantino. Winner of the Golden Palm at Cannes and already subject to Oscar-time whispers, the picture is a gleefully lurid mix of hardboiled gangster-movie conventions and hip post-Warhol irony. Starring Joh Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. Rated R for violence, language, nudity and drug use.   Quiz Show PG-13   Robert Redford's dazzlingly entertaining movie is set in the late '50s, when Americans were as hooked on quiz shows as later generations would be on Watergate or O.J.'s white Bronco. When the sponsor tires of ``Twenty-One's'' current wonder-boy, Herb Stempel (John Turturro), a schlemiel from Queens, he's replaced by Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), the handsome scion of an aristocratic, academic family. Van Doren becomes the nation's most adored egghead and Stempel spills the beans -- that the game is rigged -- to a congressional investigator (Rob Morrow). Rated PG-13 for adult themes.   The River Wild PG-13   Meryl Streep is a former white-water river guide, who views a rafting excursion in her old splashing grounds as more than a family vacation. It's a chance to spend quality time and heal rifts with workaholic husband Tom (David Strathairn) and son Roarke (Joseph Mazzello). Slithering into the family's domestic Eden, Kevin Bacon is a fellow rafter who turns vacation into hell, taking the family hostage and forcing Streep to pilot him safely down the river. The trip is worth it. Rated PG-13 for violence. -- Steve Murray, staff writer   The Road to Wellville R   Paved with good intentions. Like that other road. Alan Parker's health-craze comedy is an art-design folly with little more going for it than spectacle: Edwardian clothes, Anthony Hopkins with buckteeth, and cruel spa machines Jules Verne might have forged. Playing cereal czar and health nut John Harvey Kellogg, Hopkins creates a grand, blustery caricature. Rated R for nudity, sexual situations. -- Steve Murray   The Santa Clause PG   The movie's moral is a peculiar one, even by Hollywood standards: The best way for a father to gain his son's respect is to pack on 50 pounds, grow a white beard and consort with elves. Thus it goes with Scott Calvin (Tim Allen), a divorced dad whose 8-year-old, Charlie (Eric Lloyd), would rather spend Christmas Eve with Mom (Wendy Crewson) and her new therapist hubby (Judge Reinhold). That is, until Santa tumbles off the roof, Scott straps on St. Nick's suit, and goes across the globe popping in and out of chimneys (aided by some computer effects that aren't as special as you'd hope). Amiable Allen wisecracks his way past snarling mutts and spying moppets (``Do you want this doll or not?'' he asks one recalcitrant tot). Then, at the North Pole, he finds out from the rainbow- coalition elves that -- gulp -- once you put on Santa's suit, you're Santa. For good. From here, the movie unreels as a cross between ``Miracle on 34th Street'' and a paranoid delusion. As the new year unfolds, Scott bloats up and goes white-haired and bewhiskered. Call it Clausitis: Santa overcomes his nervous system like an incurable disease. Allen's normal-guy shtick is terrific, but once he disappears inside the fat-suit, the movie's personality goes with him. Cuteness happens, magic doesn't. And if you have kids, be prepared to tell them something the movie never explains: What the heck happened to the original Santa, who evaporates into thin air? Ho ho huh? -- Steve Murray, staff writer   The Shawshank Redemption R   There are two excellent reasons to see this involving movie and their names are Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. Based on a Stephen King novella, this is a stone-walls- do-not-a-prison-make story, in which hope flourishes in horrifying surroundings and a unique friendship is forged inside a human purgatory.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941202.0033 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-PHOTO-LITE-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> ATTENTION EDITORS: The following photos are part of this morning's New York Times Photo LITE picture package.

Unfortunately, the boy is autistic, which prompts the local sheriff and the boy's protective older sister (model Liv Tyler) to bring in a once- prominent child shrink (Richard Dreyfuss), who quit treating kids after a tragedy befell a patient. While this solid suspense drama goes to great lengths to stress that autism isn't an easily understandable condition, it also uses the boy's state as a plot contrivance to get Dreyfuss involved. Rated R for violence, language and adult themes.   The Specialist R   Sylvester Stallone's specialty has been to turn a one-note act into a multimillion-dollar career. But the specialist specified here is a former CIA explosives expert hired by a rich lovely (Sharon Stone) to wipe out the bad guys who killed her parents when she was just a kid. That means taking on Miami mobsters led by patriarch Rod Steiger (doing an embarrassing Jose Jimenez accent), his sleazy son (Eric Roberts) and his equally sleazy consigliere (James Woods, who used to be in the CIA with Sly until they had a falling out over innocent bystanders). At its best, the film is like ``Death Wish'' warmed-over, with hints of ``The Bodyguard.'' However, the expected sparks between Stallone and Stone never ignite.   Speed R   The perfect movie rush. The gimmick is simple: A wacko (Dennis Hopper) has put a bomb on a city bus. When the bus hits 50 mph, the bomb goes on; if it slows below 50, the bomb goes off. And so the chase is on -- with a busload of terrified passengers, a hurt driver, a spunky civilian at the wheel (Sandra Bullock) and a very determined cop (Keanu Reeves) in pursuit. Directed by Jan De Bont. Rated R for violence and language.   Stargate PG-13   An engaging sci-fi yarn with a flying pyramid, three moons and Jaye Davidson in a dress. Again. We start on Earth, where a linguist named Daniel (James Spader) deciphers Egyptian hieroglyphics on a circular mechanism unearthed near the Pyramids. It's the Stargate, a thingamajig that, when uncoded, becomes a portal to a twin gate on a sandy planet across the universe. Daniel gets enlisted for a space-jumping expedition, led by gruff Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell), since he's the only one who can crack the code on that second Stargate. But first they have to face the sun god Ra, (Davidson), a cosmic vampire. Like a Tintin adventure set in the cosmos, the movie has an enjoyable retro feel. But it's harder to get revved up by it. Director Roland Emmerich turns out serviceable action scenes, but it's Spielberg minus Spielberg. Rated PG-13 for violence. -- Steve Murray   Star Trek Generations PG   This franchise boldly keeps going and going and going. In this incarnation, the torch is smoothly passed from one cast to the next as the aging members of the orginal '60s show are replaced by the ``Next Generation'' ensemble. Captains Picard (Patrick Stewart) and Kirk (William Shatner) join forces to defeat a mad scientist ('60s bad boy, Malcolm McDowell) who's willing to destroy whole galaxies in his frantic attempt to reach the Nexus, a place of illusionary contentment. Rated PG for mild violence.   The Swan Princess G   It's not Disney, but it's pretty decent. An animated musical from Richard Rich, who once worked for the Mouse, ``The Swan Princess'' tells of a true love that overcomes all obstacles. Prince Derek and Princess Odette, heirs to separate kingdoms, are brought together every summer by their parents, who hope the children's scrappy friendship will someday blossom into love. The movie's pleasures come through amusing supporting characters (a turtle and frog, with voices by Steven Wright and John Cleese), some adult-friendly humor and songs propelled by clever lyrics that touch on everything from true love to political correctness. -- Steve Murray, staff writer   Terminal Velocity PG-13   A free fall into silliness, this sky-diving thriller plays like Hitchcock Lite. It's preposterous. And a lot of fun. Charlie Sheen stars as Arizona sky- diver Ditch Brodie whose latest student, a blonde airhead named Chris (Nastassja Kinski), takes an early tumble out the plane door, and makes like a pancake. Then again, is that really her body on the desert floor? Rated PG-13 for violence, language.   Timecop R   A good rule of thumb: The less sense a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie makes, the more fun it is. Happily, this futuristic actioner is a welcome return to the sci-fi silliness of his most successful film to date, ``Universal Soldier.'' Van Damme plays a time-traveling cop who tries to stop a corrupt senator from changing history. Rated R for violence, language, brief sex and nudity.   Trapped in Paradise PG-13   Like being trapped in holiday-movie purgatory -- with popcorn. A wan attempt at a Capra-esque Christmas fable, the movie sends three brothers -- Nicolas Cage as the responsible one, trying to go straight; Jon Lovitz as the lovable schemer; and Dana Carvey as a childlike kleptomaniac -- into the small Pennsylvania town of Paradise on Christmas Eve. Their mission: to rob the local bank. Writer/director George Gallo takes forever to set up the robbery, then forever and a half to allow his heroes to be won over by the unerring goodness of the people of Paradise (not knowing these stranded strangers are the ones who knocked over their bank, they shower them with Christmas dinner, Christmas presents, Christmas cheer, etc.). Lovitz sticks to his one-note smarmy act, while Carvey attempts a Mickey Rourke impersonation with a touch of Harpo Marx. But Cage's sweetly gallant performance is a small saving grace. As a kind of ``How Christmas Stole Into the Hearts of Three Grinches,'' the movie does get better as it goes along; the last 15 minutes are actually rather good. But that may not be enough of a recommendation to keep you there for the preceding hour and a half.   True Lies R   True trash. Too long, too loud and too expensive, this action farce is a pointless exercise in abuse of power, Hollywood-style. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis. Directed by James Cameron. Rated R for violence and language.   The War PG-13   A big- hearted bore from the maker of ``Fried Green Tomatoes.'' Director Jon Avnet returns to the South of a few years past, in this case small-town Mississippi, 1970. (It was mostly shot in Georgia.) Kevin Costner plays Stephen Simmons, a vet trying to hold a job while haunted by memories of 'Nam. We see him through the eyes of his kids, Stu (Elijah Wood) and Lidia (Lexi Randall), who spend the summer months building a treehouse -- and trying to avoid the white-trash Lipnicki clan. Unlike the plot-driven ``Tomatoes,'' ``War'' ambles with the humid sleepiness of one of its summer days. Somebody's always a-sittin' on a porch, talkin' about love and family and duty and dreams. Late in the movie, when a turf battle turns the kids' treehouse into an obvious anti-war allegory, you might have already tuned out due to the platitudes and melodrama. -- Steve Murray .  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19941202.0036 type=story > <HEADLINE> TV: NETWORK TURNS FINE SHORT STORY OF JACOB INTO TWO-HOUR FLOP </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-JACOB-TV-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"

IRAQ (Baghdad, Iraq) -- Insurgents strike in northern and central Iraq in a series of bloody bombing attacks that killed at least 60 people in three cities, an Interior Ministry official said. The attacks appeared to mark an intensification of attempts by Sunni Arab militants to disrupt Iraq's newly formed Shiite majority government. In the deadliest single attack, at least 30 people were killed and 60 were wounded when a suicide bomber detonated his vehicle in the main street of Tikrit, the hometown of Saddam Hussein, about 100 miles north of Baghdad.

Expected to cost around $30, the lipstick will be easier on the wallet than the $36,000 cabinet made of plum-black lacquer lashed with gilt bronze that is standing in Van der Straeten's Paris showroom. Guerlain declined to release a photograph of the case, describing its design as top secret. But Olivier Echaudemaison, the artistic director of the company's cosmetics division, insisted that the lipstick, which will appear in stores around Aug. 15, was a perfect Van der Straeten commission.

In his office stands a Parsons-style console table made of bronze and surfaced with a panel of pony hide; its legs are braced with a stretcher made of a stout length of chain.

He didn't, and it doesn't, but, he admitted, the table still hasn't sold. Maybe she was right? Van der Straeten said ruefully. I don't know.
