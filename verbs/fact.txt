INTERNATIONAL  (Coded i)  CAMBODIA-KHMERROUGE (Trapaeng Sva) _ In thousands of villages, men and women who worked for the Khmer Rouge have returned to farming their fields and raising their children side by side with the families of people they abused. Seth Mydans.  INDIA-POLITICS (New Delhi) _ The new Hindu nationalist government appears headed for defeat in Parliament this week. John F. Burns.  ISRAEL-POLITICS (Jerusalem) _ Prime Minister Shimon Peres and his Likud challenger Benjamin Netanyahu both claimed victory in their only debate, three days before national elections. Serge Schmemann.  ISRAEL-POLITICS-REACT (Jerusalem) _ Voters respond to the candidates' debate.  CENTRAL-AFRICA-UNREST (Bangui, Central African Republic) _ Two countries in Africa, Liberia and the Central African Republic, have quite different relationships to their U.S. and French affiliates. Howard W. French.  YUGO-BOSNIA (Zvornik, Bosnia) _ It has been two weeks since American peacekeeping troops heard bursts of automatic weapons fire, then saw seven men running up to surrender to them. But the passing days have only deepened the mystery about who the men are.  ITALY-MASSTOURISM (Florence) _ The city of Florence is proposing new ways to cope with the smothering embrace of mass tourism. (Foreign Journal.) Celestine Bohlen.  NATIONAL  (Coded a)  VALUJET-CRASH (Miami) _ Developments concerning the NTSB news conference on the Valujet crash.  BREAKUP-LOSANGELES (Los Angeles) _ There has always been a nagging suspicion that Los Angeles is more a state of mind than a proper city, a place too scattered to hang together as a metropolitan whole. The freeways often seem to separate the region's far-flung neighborhoods and communities more than tie them together. The kaleidoscopic ethnic diversity often ends up being a balkanizing barrier to urban cohesiveness. And when it comes to civic pride, well, Angelenos simply don't boast about being from Los Angeles. So now comes, perhaps inevitably, a proposal to break up Los Angeles into what, it fact, it already seems to be: a group of separate cities. B. Drummond Ayres Jr.  MCVEIGH-IMAGE (Denver) _ A look at the selling of Timothy McVeigh. McVeigh's defense team is putting forth a carefully controlled, benign image of McVeigh. James Brooke.  TEX-SCHOOLBUS (Study Butte, Texas) _ For years, high-school students in southern Brewster County, a vast West Texas outback of desert and mountain along the Mexican border, have laid claim to an odd and generally unwelcome title: commuters on the longest school bus ride in the United States. But now the students' daily, exhausting ordeal, a 179.6-mile round-trip on bus, plus as much as 35 miles more by car to get to their homes off dirt roads, seems to be coming to an end. The hamlets of Study Butte, Terlingua, Lajitas, and Panther Junction are getting their own high school. Sam Howe Verhovek.  POLITICS  (Coded p)  OHIO-POLITICS-POLL (Canton, Ohio) _ A special poll The New York Times collaborated on shows that voters in Canton aren't enamored of Bob Dole. And given that they are in one of the nation's truly bellwether counties, his problems here explain why he faces a tough challenge nationally. Michael Winerip.  REPUBS-ECON (Washington) _ They no longer call themselves supply-siders, prefering the designation ``pro-growth.'' But the tax-cutting wing of the Republican Party, having spent the past six years in the political wilderness while deficit reduction dominated Washington, is getting a new hearing from Bob Dole. Seeking to avoid being tarred by the ``voodoo economics'' charge, supply-siders no longer argue that tax cuts pay for themselves. But they argue that Clinton is more vulnerable on the economy than the Dole campaign realizes, and that a tax-cutting approach not only has obvious political appeal, but makes good economic sense as well. Richard W. Stevenson.  CLINTON-SWITCH (Washington) _ As November draws near, Clinton has abandoned some of his most liberal supporters on issues like homosexual marriages, welfare, and affirmative action. David E. Rosenbaum.  COLUMNS  (Coded k)  Bob Herbert, William Safire, and Anthony Lewis; details later. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960526.0430 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (AM-ADD-NYT-BUDGET) </DATELINE> <TEXT> (HLW)  Add N.Y.

DRUGWAR-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Christopher Lehmann-Haupt reviews `Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure', by Dan Baum.  HARRIS-INTERVIEW (Undated) _ An interview with Rosemary Harris, of `A Delicate Balance'. Mel Gussow.  TV-EASTWOOD-REVIEW (Undated) _ John J. O'Connor reviews `AFI Salute to Clint Eastwood', on ABC.  TV-DIVAS-REVIEW (Undated) _ John J. O'Connor reviews `Great Performances: Divas', on PBS.  FINANCIAL  (Coded f)  Eds., fyi:  All financial and commodity markets and banks in the United States will be closed on Monday in observance of Memorial Day. A number of European markets, including those in Germany and Great Britain, will also be closed for local holidays.  THEME-PARKS (Valencia, Calif.) _ The entertainment industry's decision to marry itself to the stomach-churning carnival world of roller coasters, spinning rides, and kewpie dolls is paying off big. Theme parks like Universal Studios or Six Flags keep up Batman's profile (as the next movie is getting ready for production) and Batman and other staples of the movie industry keep customers rolling in. James Sterngold.  TOWER-SCRAMBLE (Fairfax, Va.) _ After bidding $30 billion to get licenses to deliver voice and data over high-frequency airwaves, a cluster of firms are now scrambling to find places to put 100,000 new transmitters. Localities are balking, so the firms are putting transmitters in the light towers on municipal swimming pools or in roadside motel signs. A secondary industry has also emerged, tying up roof rights on high-rises or local post offices. Mike Allen.  PERUNET (Lima, Peru) _ In a poor country like Peru, where the average income is less than $300 a month and few people have a telephone _ let alone a computer with modem _ many figured that they could not afford access to the information superhighway. That was until people started joining the Peruvian Scientific Network, a not-for-profit cooperative. For $15 a month the organization provides public access not only to the Internet but also to a bank of computers and classes on how to navigate the network. Calvin Sims.

BIZGLANCE (Undated) _ Major financial stories at a glance.  PATENTS (Undated) _ The weekly patents column. Teresa Riordan.  MEDIA-BUSINESS  (Coding varies.)  TV-NETWORK-MEDIA (Undated) _ The 1995-96 television season was so thoroughly dominated by NBC that even rival network executives resorted to comparing the network to the Chicago Bulls. But behind NBC's robust winning performance _ and the booming profits of up to $700 million that went with it _ the network television story is far from sunny. In fact, it's much more like a special effects scene from ``Twister.'' Several tornadoes have already blown through TV town, chopping up network property in their wake, and the sky is still dark and ominous. The twister in this case is cable television, which has been tearing up little pieces of network television for more than a decade. This season, however, the damage totals mounted even higher than usual. Bill Carter. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960526.0431 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (AM-FINANCIAL-NYT-BUDGET) </DATELINE> <TEXT> (HLW)  Add N.Y.
