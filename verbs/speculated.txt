"20316"	"he"	"speculated"	" In addition to direct warming of the surface, he proposed that hot plumes might alter deep currents to affect surface temperatures. Another indirect mechanism was that the nutrient value of the minerals in hot plumes might prompt prolific growths of microscopic sea creatures that would rise to the surface or whose body parts would rise.

In four rounds, he speculated, depending on the conditions, he expects the 72-hole score to be a maximum of four shots higher. Last year's winning score by Tiger Woods was 16-under-par 272. Fazio said there was no target score for the reconstruction, but more a return to the type of clubs that formerly were required into the greens. ``The whole goal,'' he said, ``was protecting the integrity of the original design.'' ... Two-time champion Jose Maria Olazabal expects a single-digit under-par score for the 2002 champion. That would be a seven-shot difference from last year. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"113351"	"he"	"speculated"	" All of today's hybrids appear descended from animals created by those ranchers early in the 20th century, Derr said.
