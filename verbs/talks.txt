Entertainment/Lifestyle  MINI-REVIEWS-COX _ UNDATED _ Capsule reviews of current films. (Ringel, 3 Takes) (e)  HEALTH-WATCH-COX _ ATLANTA _ So many of us are gearing up to start the new year, resolving that we will exercise regularly. Those of us trying to go it alone at home often turn to exercise videos, for perspiration and inspiration. But how to choose? Cindy Crawford or Jane Fonda? In this case, Jane is older and wiser, but there may be better choices. That's the opinion of Consumer Reports magazine, which rates exercise videos in its January issue. (Husted). (l)  LANIER-COX _ FARGO, Ga. _ When award-winning mystery writer Virginia Lanier got the call telling her she'd sold her first book, she hurried to tell ``Hoss,'' as folks here call her husband, Robert. Lanier, 66, enjoys teasing Hoss, 70, by telling the story every chance she gets. Telling stories is something Virginia Lanier does well. Until she wrote and sold her first book a few years ago, however, she didn't believe anybody like her could be a writer. (Davis, 2 Takes) (e)  BOOKS-BERSTEIN-COX _ UNDATED _ Walter Bernstein was a Communist. This is one of the things that makes his new memoir, ``Inside Out'' (Knopf, $24), so refreshing. Most literature of the blacklist era would have you believe that the people who were persecuted did nothing more dangerous than vote for Franklin Roosevelt. (Eyman) (e)  Business  NETWATCH-COX _ UNDATED _ The revolution may not be televised but, if 1996 is a guide, it will certainly be cybercast. Almost everything appeared on the network of networks in the year winding down: war and repression, news and rumor, sport, chat, humor and gossip. (Kramer, 2 Takes) (f)  Sports  GEORGE-COLUMN-COX _ NEW ORLEANS _ Donnie Young, 315 pounds and rising like a great loaf of bread dough under a bank of hot television lights, is not easily ignored during Sugar Bowl media sessions. But just to make absolutely certain, he talks, and not just about hog hunting in the scrubland near his Venice home. Who else, for instance, on the Florida roster could say ``I think Danny Wuerffel is full of crap,'' or even think of a reason to say it?

They move weekly to clients of the New York Times News Service.  G: General audiences. Nothing that would offend parents if viewed by children.  PG: Parental guidance suggested. May contain some material parents consider inappropriate for young children.  PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for preteens.  R: Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking children.  NC-17: No one under 17 admitted. Replaces the X rating.  NR: Not rated.  The Evening Star PG-13  About half as good as ``Terms of Endearment''... which isn't such a bad thing when you think about it. For those who care to catch up with Aurora Greenway 15 years later, it'll feel like old home week. But if you thought James L. Brooks' Oscar-sweeping laugh-and-cry fest was a unique, complete experience, you can skip the sequel. 2 hours, 9 minutes.  The Garden of the Finzi-Continis R  Hauntingly powerful. Spruced up with a new print and improved sound in honor of its 25th anniversary, Vittorio De Sica's late-in-life masterpiece won an Oscar in 1971 for best foreign-language film. A wealthy, aristocratic Jewish family living in Italy in the '30s refuses to hear _ or perhaps, cannot hear _ the ominous approach of Hitler's Holocaust. Dominique Sanda plays their lovely, imperious daughter. Rated R for nudity and adult themes. In Italian with English subtitles. 1 hour, 35 minutes.  Michael PG  An uneven winged victory. In Nora Ephron's appealing fantasy romance, John Travolta plays an unusual angel who changes the lives of two journalists (William Hurt and Andie MacDowell). It's a wildly uneven film and gooey as all get-out. But it's good goo, the kind that puts you in a goodwill-toward- everyone mood. 1 hour, 45 minutes.  The People vs. Larry Flynt R  Milos Forman's riveting sideshow/biopic reminds us that the First Amendment may well be the single most important thing that makes our country great _ and that the right to self-expression belongs to everybody, not just the polite. Larry Flynt is not polite. Larry (Woody Harrelson) combines a bottom-line business sense with a nose for the lowest common denominator. Thus is Hustler magazine born, a publication that doesn't pretend to be something people pick up for the articles. It's an audacious film that's as smart as it is funny, equal parts political satire, Rabelaisian romp and love story. While scoring points about our most fundamental right, it's also one hell of an entertaining ride. 2 hours, 10 minutes.  Shine PG-13  Shines. This tender, comic and uplifting Australian movie is based on the true story of musical prodigy David Helfgott, who recovered from a nervous breakdown to become a world-renowned concert pianist. Geoffrey Rush is marvelous as the adult Helfgott, as is Armin Mueller-Stahl as his domineering dad. An offbeat, upbeat film about someone who finally finds his light at the end of a very long tunnel. Rated PG-13 for adult themes. 1 hour, 47 minutes.  Mars Attacks! PG-13  Close encounters of the Tim Burton kind. In this spacey sci-fi spoof, little green guys from the angry red planet attack an all-star cast ranging from Jack Nicholson as the president of the United States to Tom Jones as, well, Tom Jones. You'll never look at ``Independence Day'' in quite the same way. Rated PG-13 for violence. 1 hour, 43 minutes.  The Mirror Has Two Faces PG-13  Producer-director-star Barbra Streisand plays a frumpy English lit professor wooed by a mathematician (Jeff Bridges) who wants a relationship without the complications of sex. This interesting premise never becomes believable, and the film's attempts to critique the culture of beauty gets KO-ed by a big mixed message when Streisand hits the gym and gets a makeover. Overproduced and underthought, it's an old-fashioned vanity production, boosted by Bridges' comic performance and old-pro work by Lauren Bacall and George Segal. 2 hours, 6 minutes.  My Fellow Americans PG-13  The obvious blueprint for this adorable comedy is ``Grumpy Old Men,'' the 1993 hit that gave new life to the careers of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. Here, Lemmon's foil is James Garner _ the pair play former U.S. presidents who must put aside their longstanding rivalry when one is implicated in a scandal. The movie has some mawkish moments and corny dialogue, but the political jokes have real bite and Lemmon and Garner make a great, grumpy team. Rated PG-13 for language and mild violence. 1 hour, 42 minutes.

The Nutty Professor PG-13  Nuts to the naysayers, Eddie Murphy's back. The hottest comedian of the '80s manages to make an iffy idea _ remaking a Jerry Lewis classic _ work by giving his most engaging performance in years. With a little help from latex, he plays Sherman Klump, a painfully shy, 400-pound college professor who tests an experimental fat gene on himself. He is transformed into a svelte ladies' man who has a way with a one-liner and a mile-wide mean streak (in short, he becomes Eddie Murphy). The movie relies a bit too much on juvenile gags, but Murphy displays a newfound sweetness as Klump that suggests career possibilities as a date-movie lead. Rated PG-13 for strong language and sexual innuendo.  One Fine Day PG-13  During this very long and complicated day, so much happens that you begin to hate little Maggie (Mae Whitman) and Sammy (Alex D. Linz) for not making their class field trip. But then single mom Mel (Michelle Pfeiffer) and dad Jack (George Clooney) wouldn't have been pitted together so they could trade off the kids, accidentally swap cell phones and otherwise wreak havoc on all of Manhattan. Still, not even the considerable good looks of the actors or the use of every screwball gag imaginable can make this ``Pillow Talk'' update anything more than the predictable piece of work that it is. Rated PG-13 for mild profanity. 1 hour, 48 minutes.  101 Dalmatians G  Somebody call PETA. This live- action remake of the 1961 Disney animated feature is a frenetic mess. Glenn Close stars as Cruella De Vil, a fur-mad fashion plate who wants to turn Dalmatian pups into a coat. The doggies are adorable, but you've probably seen Alpo commercials that are more entertaining. 1 hour, 43 minutes.  Phenomenon PG  This phenomenally likable movie cuts across niche- marketing lines; it works as a family film, a tear-jerker and a date movie. John Travolta stars as an average Joe mechanic who's transformed by a blinding white light into a genius with telekinetic and psychic powers. Jon Turtletaub's movie starts out as a harmless, warmhearted fantasy but deepens into a more thoughtful, complex picture. The fine supporting cast _ Kyra Sedgwick, Forest Whitaker, Robert Duvall _ is a huge help, but the movie just wouldn't work without Travolta. He's radiantly charming as the bumpkin-turned-Einstein _ thrilled and energized by his newfound intellectual curiosity and his discovery of the interconnectedness of all living things. Rated PG for language and mild adult themes.  The Preacher's Wife PG  Makes a joyful noise. In this update of the 1947 movie, ``The Bishop's Wife,'' Denzel Washington plays an angel sent to Earth to help a troubled couple (Whitney Houston and Courtney B. Vance). Director Penny Marshall and her cast transform trite material into a sweet-natured, PG-rated (parents, please note) crowd pleaser. 2 hours, 5 minutes.  Ransom R  In this slickly gripping thriller, Mel Gibson plays a self-made millionaire who takes matters into his own hands when his son is kidnapped. Rene Russo is his gorgeous, worried wife; Delroy Lindo is the FBI agent on the case; and Gary Sinise and Lili Taylor are the masterminds of the kidnapping plot. Though the movie is loosely based on an old Glenn Ford film, director Ron Howard posits an interesting subtext. In many ways what ``Ransom'' is really about is the paranoia of the powerful _ how all the privilege and connections in the world can't protect you when life goes awry. On a pure action-movie level, though ``Ransom'' is often improbable, it delivers the goods. But on another weirder level, it's a subversive glimpse into the Nightmares of the Rich and Famous. Rated R for violence, language and adult situations. 2 hours, 1 minute.  Ridicule R  Knowing, nasty and wonderful to watch. In 1783, a compassionate but poor nobleman (Charles Berling) travels to Versailles to plead with King Louis XVI for funds to drain his plague-ridden swamps. He encounters a world where ``vices are without consequence but ridicule can kill.'' A sardonic, elegant, scathingly adept film from Patrice Leconte (``Monsieur Hire''). Rated R for sex, nudity and adult themes. 1 hour, 42 minutes.  Scream R  Horror maven Wes Craven (``Nightmare on Elm Street'') camps it up in this self-aware sendup of scary movies. Someone is stalking and killing a group of jaded teens who live for horror flicks (played by a who's who of Hollywood's young elite, including Drew Barrymore and Neve Campbell). ``Scream'' suffers from too many inside jokes and not enough scares, but it does serve up a few frightfully funny characters (Courteny Cox is right-on as a tabloid-TV journalist). Rated R for violence, language and sex. 1 hour, 50 minutes.  Set It Off R  While inner-city living's effect on young black women is a story told too little on the big screen, ``Set It Off'' is as unforgettable as it is necessary. The second film from video-movie director F. Gary Gray (``Friday'') finds its engaging co-stars Jada Pinkett, Queen Latifah, Vivica Fox and Kimberly Elise beaten down by ``the system,'' and they are ready to start swinging back. But their Los Angeles bank heists are only part of a whole and riveting story about the ends some desperate people will go to in the name of friendship and the actions even the moral-minded will take for the sake of survival.  Sleepers R  ``Mean Streets'' meets ``The Sting'' in this Big Credentials movie that offers an Oscar-winning director (Barry Levinson); a star-studded cast; and a hefty, serious-movie running time of almost 2 1/2 hours. The first half is about four kids from Hell's Kitchen who're sent to reform school. In the second half, the four, now grown up, finally take revenge on the guard (Kevin Bacon) who tortured and sexually abused them. Brad Pitt and Jason Patric are the leaders of the pack (one a lawyer, the other a reporter). Robert De Niro is a kindly priest and Dustin Hoffman steals scenes as a washed-up lawyer. The movie never tears you up the way it intends. Rather, it's a done-deal kind of film; you don't worry about what happens as much as you enjoy a bunch of Hollywood pros happening on screen.

Space Jam PG  This semi-animated extravaganza starring basketball great Michael Jordan and a plethora of Looney Tunes characters isn't so much a movie as it is an 87-minute commercial _ for Warner Bros. (which owns the 'toons), for McDonald's (which is peddling the tie-in toys), but most of all for Jordan himself. The negligible plot goes like this: Aliens kidnap Bugs Bunny and the gang to serve as attractions in an interstellar amusement park. To win their freedom, the 'toons challenge their space captors to a basketball game, enlisting the services of Jordan to ensure a victory. Between the blatant product placements and the loving, slow-motion shots of Jordan sailing into a layup, the Looney Tunes characters work their classic magic. Rated PG for mild language. 1 hour, 27 minutes.  Star Trek: First Contact PG  Keeps on Trekkin'. This eighth big-screen installment of the unstoppable TV series boldly goes where no ``Star Trek'' movie has gone before. Namely it enters theaters without a single member of the original crew on board. In their stead is the confident cast of ``Star Trek: The Next Generation.'' Their mission: to stop some cyber-zombies known as the Borg from taking over the universe, which mostly means following the Borg back to 21st- century Earth, so they can't alter history. The good news is, the new cast has much the same verve and chemistry as their predecessors. The bad news is, if your knowledge of the new group doesn't go much further than Patrick Stewart as Captain Picard and Brent Spiner as the android, Data, you may find yourself a bit lost in space. But as the Borg say, ``Resistance Is Futile.'' Enjoy the show. Rated PG-13 for violence. 1 hour, 50 minutes.  2 Days in the Valley R  A wicked little kick of a picture. Sort of a shorter ``Short Cuts' ' pumped up on post-``Pulp Fiction'' hip violence, the movie starts with a murder, then fans out to follow a dozen disparate characters. Ultimately, their stories dovetail into one another in a dark ensemble comedy that gets livelier and more surprising as it goes along.
