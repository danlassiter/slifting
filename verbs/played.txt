By JEANNE WOLF Distributed by New York Times Special Features  When he dons a bouffant wig, a skintight minidress and stiletto heels, RuPaul Andre Charles becomes RuPaul, drag queen extraordinaire.  In that mode, his behavior can be a bit, well, outrageous. But that hasn't stopped him from becoming a cross-dressing cross-over pop phenomenon.  ``I think the reason I've been accepted by the mainstream is that my character, the woman I become, is so Walt Disney,'' RuPaul says. ``It's not really threatening. I'm like a cartoon.''  RuPaul first made his mark on the mainstream world with his music. In 1993 his best-selling dance album ``Supermodel of the World'' spawned three hit singles.  Today he is also known for his high-strutting Vegas-like act and his burgeoning film career.  He had a small role in Spike Lee's ``Crooklyn'' (1994) and is the only drag queen in recent memory to have a co-starring role in a major family movie. In ``The Brady Bunch Movie'' (1994), he played, of all things, Jan's gorgeous guidance counselor.  RuPaul also appears in ``Wigstock,'' a newly released documentary about the annual drag-queen festival in New York's Greenwich Village, in ``A Mother's Prayer,'' which will air Aug. 2 on the USA network, and in the forthcoming ``To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything ... Julie Newmar.''  With so much exposure, one might expect RuPaul to be on an ego trip. Instead, he sounds quite down-to-earth about his success as a drag queen.  ``I think people recognize that there's a sweet person behind all the paint and powder,'' he says, smiling. ``We all play roles. You're born naked and the rest is drag. We all dress up, whether we're a nurse or doctor or an executive, but underneath we're all the same. We have a heart and soul.  ``I just dress a little differently.''  Now RuPaul is providing a glimpse of the man behind the glamourous make-up. The 34-year-old transvestite has written his autobiography, ``Lettin It All Hang Out,'' which was recently published by Hyperion.  In addition to chronicling his rise to stardom, the book presents an impressive assortment of beauty tips _ from how to wear a wig to how to look great in photos.  Yet today, as he settles into a seat in a trendy West Hollywood bar, RuPaul doesn't attract more than a casual glance from the cocktail-hour crowd. No wonder. He's out of drag and looks fairly ordinary.  Instead of a wig he's wearing a baseball cap. Those long false eyelashes are nowhere to be seen behind his dark sunglasses. And he's traded his dress for a denim shirt and khaki pants.  ``My energy isn't as high when I have on regular clothes,'' he says almost apologetically. ``I think the ritual of getting dolled up really psyches you.  ``It's like football players psyching themselves up before a game. My personality really pops out. I love the effect it has on people.''  RuPaul is hoping his autobiography will have a similar effect on his fans.  ``I got the idea to write it after receiving letters from teen-agers telling me how they feel disenfranchised from society, that there's no place for them,'' he says. ``I can identify with that because I felt that way when I was a kid.  ``When people are stepping over into young adulthood, they look at the world and go, `Oh my God, you mean I have to conform?'''  RuPaul's story is clearly not about conforming.  He grew up in a single-parent home in San Diego, where he always felt different. Eventually, he became something of a cause celebre in high school, known for his fancy dance moves and colorful personality.  From an early age, he dreamed of becoming a star.  ``I would go to the drugstore and read Photoplay with all the celebrity stories by Rona Barrett,'' he remembers. ``I would stand there, literally for hours, reading all the star magazines I could get my hands on. I just loved it.''  RuPaul credits his mother _ who reared him and his three sisters alone after divorcing their father _ with giving him the determination to dance to the beat of his own drummer.  ``She was a tough cookie,'' he says with a laugh. ``A real rebel. I admired her.''  When he was a teen-ager, RuPaul moved to Atlanta with his older sister Renetta and her husband. It was there that he had his first drag experience, donning a bridesmaid dress for a mock wedding on a cable variety show in 1981.  ``Would you believe I didn't know I had a great pair of legs until I got into that dress and put on a pair of heels?'' he says.  In the years that followed, RuPaul refined his feminine image _ but never felt that he was trying to become female.  ``I never tried to act like a woman,'' he says. ``When I'm a drag queen I don't really think I'm pretending to be a real woman because how many women dress that way? So I'm a drag queen but not a female impersonator.''  As he traveled the path to fame, RuPaul was inspired by a wide variety of people.  ``(I admire) anyone and everyone who has been successful in show business and is still something of an odd-man-out,'' he says.  ``I've always idolized people who were just basically odd, a little out of the mainstream _ Whoopi Goldberg, Diana Ross, Cher or maybe David Bowie. The people who wouldn't normally be categorized as star material in Hollywood, the ones who were underdogs and had to fight their way to the top.  ``Actually, I think stars and drag queens have something in common,'' he adds with a laugh. ``They both project an image that isn't really them.  ``There's the superstar you see in a performance and the person behind that image. Behind the facade, there's something different _ and you might not know what it is.''  RuPaul has rarely dropped his facade in public. That has afforded him a certain degree of anonymity.  ``When I'm out of drag, I often don't get recognized,'' he says. ``It can be a weird experience.  ``Once I did a big event for a cosmetics convention. I remember the day I was dressed in my khakis and baseball cap at a store and I overheard people talking about me at the event. It was a very eerie feeling because they had no idea that the person they were talking about was standing right next to them.  ``Part of me wanted to run away and the other part wanted to stay and hear what they were saying.''  People will probably have a lot to say about RuPaul when the film, ``To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything ... Julie Newmar,'' is released this fall. He joins heterosexual hunks Patrick Swayze and Wesley Snipes _ both in drag _ to play Rachel Tensions, the Queen of New York.  Though RuPaul is looking forward to ``Wong Foo's'' release, he is equally excited about a smaller film, ``Red-Ribbon Blues,'' in which he makes his first non-drag big-screen appearance.  The movie, which will probably be released early next year, is about three members of an HIV support group who rob a pharmaceutical company.  ```Red-Ribbon Blues' is a comedy, but there are some terrifically touching moments,'' RuPaul says. ``It was a challenge for me. But it was great to know that I could step out of drag and reach that place, because I've always been called upon to be very flamboyant.''  Does that mean he may eventually hang up his wig and minidress to become a serious actor?  Not a chance.  ``I don't think I'll ever give up drag as along as people enjoy it,'' he says. ``My whole being comes into focus when I'm in drag.'' c.1995 Jeanne Wolf  (Jeanne Wolf, who is based in Hollywood, reports on the entertainment industry for television, radio and print.) ------------------------------------------------- (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448; fax: 816-822-1444.)
