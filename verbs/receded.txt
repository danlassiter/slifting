Waterfalls were beginning to appear where they had never been charted. Islands vanished into the boiling stream. The water sometimes rose 15 to 20 feet, overflowing the banks; then just as suddenly, it receded, sucking down the river's banks and flinging fish up on the ground. The current began to flow backward. The world seemed upside-down. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200408.gz"
