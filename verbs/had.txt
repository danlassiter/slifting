"3233"	"I"	"had"	" ``Have you ever flown over the glaciers?'' Packard asked the next morning. Sure, I had, several times in fact, but I had an inkling that what was to follow was going to be different than anything I could have imagined. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199408.gz"
"13071"	"he"	"had"	" As we packed boxes, I found myself thinking especially of my late father, Allan, a Chicago furniture salesman. I thought about the car trunk loaded with fabric samples as he traveled to far-off places like Dubuque and Davenport, Iowa, in the early 1960s, when every self-respecting Main Street still had a furniture store. When I moved into my first New York apartment almost 20 years ago, he had, after some arm-twisting on my part, procured a company sofa, a clunky modular wedged number outfitted in brown velveteen. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"
"18757"	"he"	"had"	" Meanwhile, he continued as organist at St. Clothilde until 1987, purposely remaining on the post one year longer than his teacher, Tournemire, had. By the time he died in 1991, he had, as a composer, produced several of the classics of the organ repertoire. His output includes a chorale setting in honor of Smith, as well as an ``American Suite'' for organ, including the pieces ``Big Texas,'' inspired by his visits to Fort Worth, and ``Scherzo, Cats,'' inspired by the cats belonging to organist-musicologist Helen Hewitt of Denton, 35 miles north of Fort Worth. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"20527"	"she"	"had"	" My own mother brought me to work on many occasions. A concert violinist who achieved international success in the 1950s, she had, by the time I was born, trimmed her schedule to fit the demands of mothering two young girls. In the years that followed she performed less, taught more, eventually taking a job as chamber music coach at a private arts school in Connecticut. It was there that I spent countless after-school hours watching my mother teach her many teen-age charges. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"
"20894"	"they"	"had"	" After the Bruins broke a two-year, 12-game losing streak to the Pittsburgh Penguins with a 5-2 victory Sunday, among the biggest points of contention was whether the Penguins had degraded the Bruins with their comments following Friday night's game. According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, they had, along with an assist from the headline: ``Patsy Bruins.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"27112"	"he"	"had"	" Crock or timer, he had, yes, seen Grant perform on the silver screen. There had been an improbable story hung on sacramental plot gimmicks. Several weddings, a funeral. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"29309"	"it"	"had"	" Jackie Gleason invented the character for a series of sketches in Gleason's variety show, Cavalcade of Stars in 1951, when the concept of situation comedy hadn't yet been defined. But by 1955, it had, and the model was what was now titled The Honeymooners, which became its own free-standing show. It was one of the first shows to be shot on a single set, in front of a studio audience, with a stock cast and recurring punch lines, which entered the public lexicon. Baby, it was the greatest. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199507.gz"
"38353"	"she"	"had"	" Both even fell in love with the same dancer, Vera Zorina. Shortly before marrying Balanchine in 1938, she had, by her own account, been part of a menage a trois with Massine and his second wife, the dancer Eugenia Delarova. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199510.gz"

"56487"	"it"	"had"	" Our first-floor room included a full kitchen, whirlpool bath, king-size bed and a patio overlooking one of the facility's four pools. We had asked for and were given a room next to the ``quiet'' pool, the one with no slides and therefore fewer little ones running around. Not only was this pool quiet, it had, located right outside our door, a man-made waterfall that gave off a calming sound from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., when the pool closed and the waterfall was shut off. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"

"58088"	"he"	"had"	" That wouldn't be a bad idea (Barkley himself isn't against it) if you get what he's worth in return. Which is to say, a lot. Even at 33, he had, statistically, a season that rivaled his MVP year of 1993, when he had a better team around him and was less a focal point of opposing defenses. Unlike mere mortals, Barkley remains undeterred by age and injury. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199605.gz"
"66258"	"he"	"had"	" By the year of his death, he had collected 24 honorary doctorates, gold medals from most of the wildlife societies in America and Europe, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and major retrospectives of his bird paintings at museums. Like Audubon before him, he had, in the words of the poet Stephen Vincent Benet, ``lived to look at birds.'' More than anyone else, he let the rest of us in on the secret. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960729.0534 type=story > <HEADLINE> CLINTON, CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS TO PRESS FOR NEW TERRORISM </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WASHINGTON (BC-CLINTON-TERROR-500&AMP;ADD-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"
"66391"	"he"	"had"	" Although his father, who farmed and operated a real estate business, became prominent in Kenyan affairs, serving as one of the original members of the Nairobi legislative council, by the time his son was born in 1909, he had, in the parlance of the flanneled colonials sipping gin and tonics at the Muthaiga Club, gone distinctly native. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"
"70228"	"he"	"had"	" The questions showed that the prosecutors were still examining whether Clinton had been honest when he testified on behalf of his former business partners and what role, if any, he had, in obtaining a loan that was ultimately found to have been fraudulent. David Hale, another figure in the Whitewater investigation, has testified that Clinton asked him to make the fraudulent loan, an accusation that the president has denied. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199609.gz"
"77400"	"he"	"had"	" Although he had built a career embracing deficit reduction, he had, in the hope of political gain, subordinated that goal to a call for a 15 percent tax cut. Although he had worked diligently to broaden the Republican Party, he found in the end he could barely hold onto its core voters. And although he had spent decades trying to live down his reputation as a ``hatchet man,'' he finished his campaign on a note of bitterness. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"
"82618"	"they"	"had"	" For all the distance the men had supposedly traveled to get to the bank (actually a graceful old apartment building posing as a bank), they had, in the Manhattan I know, gone three blocks. They could have walked and been there sooner. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"
"85587"	"she"	"had"	" Born and reared in the Midwood section of Brooklyn with one younger brother, Adam, she had, she says, an idyllic childhood, a mixture of skateboarding in the cul-de-sac in front of her white clapboard home and spending dirt-road summers with her family at their Westchester County place. ``My parents let me be my own person,'' she says of her father, a trial lawyer, and her mother, a teacher. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

Texas' two-party political system is dead, and, for all practical purposes, so is the Democratic Party. Will move in ``p'' political category. Commentary by BUD KENNEDY  F O O D A N D D I N I N G  CUPS-COLUMN  UNDATED: This is it. This is the column I will tell you to look for on the Internet or in the public library when you call in June and want the recipe for the tomato basil soup served at La Madeleine restaurants. This column, with our most requested recipes, runs in January of every new year. Put it away now if you don't want to be spending time on the computer later this year. The weekly Cooking Up a Storm column. By BEVERLY BUNDY  FOOD-BUNDY-COLUMN  UNDATED: Every year 25,000 new products are introduced in American grocery stores. Every year, most of those introductions fail. Here's what we loved and what we loathed in 2001. Two takes. By BEVERLY BUNDY  T R A V E L  NORMAN-OKLAHOMA  UNDATED: It wasn't exactly with great anticipation that I boarded the 5:25 p.m. Amtrak train to Norman, Okla. First, it was a sort of a business trip. Second, between here and there are the Arbuckle Mountains, Chickasaw National Recreation Area and Lake Texoma _ all destinations with much to recommend them. And, just a few miles north of Norman is the more cosmopolitan Oklahoma City. So, other than the reservations we held for an art symposium at the University of Oklahoma, we had, frankly, middling expectations for the rest of the trip. As a foodie, I just couldn't get excited about visiting a college town that likely was rife with pizza parlors and burger joints. And Amtrak seemed like a slow, antiquated version of the sophisticated European system I'd used in the past. Boy, was I wrong.

"112019"	"I"	"had"	" ``What I said back then was the truth,'' Bloomberg said during a news conference at City Hall. ``In terms of, I had, certainly when I was younger, as I suppose most people in my generation, experimented.

"119189"	"she"	"had"	" A prolific and best-selling author, she had, after all, won the 1921 Pulitzer Prize for ``The Age of Innocence,'' with its evocative portrait of an anguished young man torn between love and marriage in old New York. When Newland Archer, who has fallen for the exotic Ellen Olenska, contemplates leaving the conventional social flower he has wed, the city's social sentries move in velvet conspiracy to thwart him. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"131315"	"we"	"had"	" ``In D.C., we had, like, 700 kids come out to audition, and it was so hard,'' says Allen. ``There was one little girl and she was so little and so cute and she almost did the dance step, not quite, but I couldn't let her go.

"145582"	"I"	"had"	" MODERN-LOVE (Undated) -- The regular feature: I am a blogger. On a daily basis I make my Dear Diary entries available online to the general public. A few years ago, I began writing my Web log to vent about a particularly difficult relationship. It was therapeutic, relatively safe and vastly preferable to, say, slashing my boyfriend's tires. I could express raw, sometimes grossly undignified aspects of my day-to-day life without fear of being judged, misunderstood or rejected. Love-scorned and willing to share every gory detail, albeit anonymously, I had, within my first year of blogging, effectively vilified my ex-boyfriend to the Web-surfing masses. Sex sells. Apparently, so does angst. But these days, while I am hardly shy about revealing juicy details of romantic encounters with foreign tourists, I have become much less inclined to tell the whole, sordid truth. I have learned the hard way that there can be such a thing as too much information. By Heather Hunter. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"

"173886"	"it"	"had"	" The city was formed centuries ago as pubs and inns grew up to serve traffic along the main road between London and Bath, Bristol and other parts of the west. It is today a crossroads of world culture.
