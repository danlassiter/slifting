"91017"	"he"	"snores"	" 3. Colby. Another character seemingly designed for our viewing pleasure, this Texan has it all. He's handsome, strong and smart _ a winner from the get-go. If that weren't enough, this tough guy cried over his mom's simple ``hibaby'' e-mail, so add ``sensitive'' to his list of positives. On the negative side, he snores, but even that's so manly. As his body gets lean and dirty and hairy, his eyes get bluer and his teeth get whiter, and he looks better and better. For a stud like Colby, losing isn't an option, but he's savvy enough to realize that his Immunity streak has a definite downside. Jealousy and resentment may be building, but Colby knows that as long as he keeps winning, there's not a thing anybody can do. Here's the question: Will this auto customizer actually ever be seen driving his new bumblebee-yellow Aztek? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"
