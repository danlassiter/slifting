"36452"	"we"	"must"	" Although the frontier is gone, we must, like pioneers, seek out new pathways for attaining the good life in our autumn years. If boomers feel a need to protest, maybe we should encourage more workplaces _ and not just fast food chains _ to offer seniors part-time jobs.

"51683"	"she"	"must"	" Four years ago, after the first season of ABC's ``Home Improvement,'' kids on the ``Roseanne'' show all threatened to quit unless they received raises. The demand lasted only as long as it took the producers to schedule open tryouts for replacements. That's how important the youngsters were considered to the show's success. But John Goodman is different and, no matter what some people will tell you, if he has a diminished role on ``Roseanne'' next season, as is likely, it will be a serious blow to the program. It is one thing to replace David Caruso on ``NYPD Blue,'' William Frawley on ``My Three Sons'' or nearly the entire cast of ``Law &AMP; Order.'' They were solid characters, but not integral to the shows they were on. They could be written around. There were two Darrens on ``Bewitched,'' two Chrises on ``The Partridge Family,'' two Lionels on ``The Jeffersons,'' and three public defenders and three bailiffs on ``Night Court.'' No one much cared.But Goodman is different. He is the show's emotional anchor. Unlike either of the two daughter Beckys (Lecy Goranson, then Sarah Chalke, then Goranson again) or two son D.J.s (Sal Barone for the series' first episode, then Michael Fishman), his character makes a tremendous difference in the way the show plays out. Laurie Metcalf, who plays Roseanne's sister, Jackie, is a wonderful actress, but it is Goodman's lovable Dan Conner takes the edge off Roseanne character. He enables viewers to see that if he loves her, she must, in fact, be lovable no matter how abrasive she might occasionally seem. It's the same role that Jean Stapleton's Edith Bunker character played for Carroll O'Connor's bigoted Archie Bunker on ``All in the Family.''

"91367"	"he"	"must"	" Elyot has the skill to make his audience laugh one moment and gasp at an instance of awful, intrusive intimacy the next. But when it comes to shocking the squeamish, he must, of course, give way to the Ibsen of ``Ghosts,'' once execrated in both Britain and America for its candor about the inherited syphilis that is destroying Oswald Alving. The problem for a modern director, though, is that the play has been institutionalized as a ``classic.'' But Robin Phillips has brought freshness to ``Ghosts'' by recentering its plot. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"
