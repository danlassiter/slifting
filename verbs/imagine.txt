DAVID-LETTERMAN LATE SHOW TOP TEN  Things on Clinton's Campaign `To Do' List  10. Promise the American people second term won't suck as bad as first.  9. Boating trip with Roger, make it look like an accident.  8. See if Paula Jones will drop charges if offered the vice presidency.  7. Sample as many flavors of cake as possible; eventually pick an official `campaign cake.'  6. Spend a couple weeks eatin' bugs in Bosnia.  5. Have ``Clinton/Batman in `96'' bumper stickers printed up.  4. Pray like hell that republicans nominate Sonny Bono.  3. Adopt Macaulay Culkin and rob the little monkey blind.  2. On July 4th, ``accidentally'' stick a roman candle up Newt's ass.  1. ``Do it'' with Lisa Marie.  CITY STREETS  The following scene was witnessed by Susan Sorenson on a corner of 46th Street and Lexington Avenue.  Cab pulls up beside hot-dog vendor; driver pokes head out of window.  Vendor: Yes?  Cabby: Two hot dogs and a Coke.  Vendor: To go?  The scene is an upscale Italian culinary emporium on the Upper East Side.  A middle-aged, very determined foodie, basket overflowing with enough greens for a small army, shops with her daughter, who nibbles on basil-infused buffalo cheese.  ``Ma, stop,'' the daughter says. ``Who's gonna eat all that?''  ``O.K.,'' the mother responds. ``But I've got to have that arugula. I can't live without arugula!''  Another middle-aged woman ceases poking at the porcini, turns and commiserates.  ``I know just what you mean,'' she says.  Donald I. Lester is rummaging around the Show Tunes section at the HMV Record Store on East 86th Street.  Customer: Do you have the original cast recording of ``Finian's Rainbow''?  Clerk: Blank look, no answer.  Customer, melodiously: /title &AMP; 1st line``How are things in Glocca Morra?''  Clerk: Blank look, no answer.  Customer, gesturing and attempting another hit from the same show: ``Oh, my heart is beating madly and I don't know what to do,/ When I'm not near the girl I love. ... ''  Clerk: There's a doctor's office next door. Shall I get him for you?  Overheard by Sue Freedman on the 7:32 a.m. from Scarsdale, N.Y., to Grand Central Terminal: Two working mothers conclude a conversation about their kids and begin a discussion of ``The Bridges of Madison County.'' Finally, one says: ``What a pathetic woman. She's in a dead-end marriage, so what does she do? She has an affair.''  ``What should she have done?''  ``She could have taken a class.''  BILL'S WORLD  By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star  Scientists want to exhume the body of Jesse James to resolve questions about his murder. OK, but $5 says O.J. Simpson is innocent.  Another Democrat in Congress, Rep. Greg Laughlin of Texas, has become a Republican. When did the Bull Moose Party last pick up any switchers?  The crown prince of Qatar has seized power from his father, it's reported. There's no better country in which to say, ``U are gone.''  Hillary Rodham Clinton plans to write a syndicated newspaper column. Do we who do that for a living, in turn, have to go live with Bill Clinton?  Mrs. Clinton will get no money for her new column. So she'll get a taste of what real journalism feels like.  GOP presidential hopeful Lamar Alexander plans to walk across New Hampshire. If he wins, can we expect him to travel on Nike One?  If Mr. Clinton wants to give his rebuffed surgeon general nominee a job having to do with children, why not put him in charge of Foster care?  The Clinton-Gore campaign has bought $2.4 million worth of TV ads that already are running in 11 states. When's the first primetimeary?  Comedian Pat Paulsen, running again for president, says he now can be reached on the Internet at www.amdest.com and through e-mail at Pat4pres(at)aol.com. Further proof he's too smart for the job.

Stories are moving in category shown at end of each budget item.  Lifestyle, Entertainment  LEAN _ undated _ Do you think the same Americans who invented the Big Gulp, the 22-ounce T-bone and the Double Stuffed Oreo would be content for long with puny diet fare? No way, as evidenced by the beefier diet entrees showing up in gro cery stores, including larger low-cal offerings by Lean Cuisine and Healthy Choice. (d)  POLITICIANS-SIDE2 _ undated _ If there's anything worse than a politician in a sex scandal, it's a politician writing about sex and romance. (e)  POLITICIANS-SIDE1 _ undated _ There are politicians who would be novelists. Then there are novelists who would be politicians. (e)  POLITICIANS-WRITERS-2takes _ undated _ What do Newt Gingrich and Niccolo Machiavelli have in common? Not just hard-nosed politics. Both stooped to grubbing at fiction. (e)  CLARENCE-BROWN _ undated _ MOVIE REMEMBRANCE: Director's films range from erotic to sentimental. (e)  JOHN-MORTIMER _ undated _ BOOKS: Thanks to John Mortimer's utterly delightful new volume of memoirs, we now know Laurence Olivier's favorite theater anecdote. It seems there was a particular production of ``Richard III'' in which Gloucest er staggered on stage to be greeted by an angry howl from the balcony: ``You're drunk!'' ``You think I'm drunk,'' snarled the actor, breaking not only iambic pentameter but character, ``Wait till you've seen the Duke of Buckingham!'' (e)  EYMAN-ON-BOOKS _ undated _ BOOKS COMMENTARY: Old house revives solid list of titles; new houses open. (e)  VIDEO-REVIEWS _ undated _ VIDEOVIEWS: `Ready to Wear' is ready for video. (e)  National  PARASITE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A diarrhea-triggering parasite that has sickened 17 residents of southern Palm Beach County and New York state since the end of May has now been detected in a West Palm Beach man, health officials said Wednesday. (a)  JAXSHERIFF _ JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Jacksonville gets first black sheriff. Career cop's victory surprised many in city dogged by racial incidents. (a)  Business  TIMBERLAND _ undated _ Mike Hensley of Mountain City, Tenn., hoped that Timberland Co.'s commitment to high quality would protect his job from the onslaught of cheaper foreign-made boots and shoes. But as Timberland closed its plants in Mountain City and Boone, N.C., Wednesday _ its last factories on the U.S. mainland _ Hensley learned a lesson in global economics. (f)  BUSINESS-MAGAZINES _ undated _ If you can't take it with you, for goodness' sake don't leave it behind for somebody else to enjoy, Worth (July/August) advises. Go ahead and have a good time on the money you've earned and let the next generation make its own fortune. (f)  Sports  BISHER-COLUMN _ ATLANTA or undated _ I'm doing my darnedest to like, or rather, be tolerant of the baseball season we have upon us. It isn't the same, and don't let any feather merchant try to convince you it is. It's not the same, from clubhouse to field manners. Players are treading softly. Fans are viewing warily. They aren't softening up. If anything, what comes through the mail and over the air tells me that they're as bitter as ever. (s)  TUCKER-COLUMN _ undated _ Time to deal with the Phillies. They've led the NL East all season, have kept their distance through even the Braves' hottest streaks. Yet there's been a sense, at least in Atlanta, that all the Braves have to do  is get their own act together and keep it there, and the division will be theirs. (s)  OLY-BIKER _ undated _ Bike may put youth on road to better life. (s)  WIMBLEDONNOTEBOOK _ WIMBLEDON, England _ It's not easy to get into the record books at Wimbledon, but Chanda Rubin and Patricia Hy-Boulais made it Wednesday with the longest women's match in Grand Slam history. (s)  EUROPEANNOTEBOOK _ ATHENS, Greece _ The pro career of former Atlanta Hawks forward Alexander Volkov, also a member of the Soviet Union's 1988 gold medal Olympic team, continues to be interrupted by recurring injury problems. (s)  Commentary  LATHAM-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ The most gripping exhibit in the U.S. Holocaust Museum has no special effects, or even lights. It is not a multi-media presentation and does not, so far as I could see, even have a simple placard of explanatio n on its side. It does not need one.

Times News Service  COURT UPHOLDS POWER OF GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT ENDANGERED SPECIES  WASHINGTON (NYT) _ In a victory for environmentalists, the Supreme Court Thursday upheld the power of the federal government to protect endangered species on private land. It prohibited owners from damaging the habitat of plants or animals threatened with extinction.  The court rejected arguments brought by business groups that the Endangered Species Act applied only narrowly to private land, prohibiting direct harm like shooting and trapping but not actions like cutting timber that only indirectly affect wildlife.  For the time being, the 6-3 ruling saved one of the government's most trenchant environmental tools from a legal challenge that would have severely dulled its edge. But it is a shaky victory for environmentalists, because conservatives in Congress are already moving to rewrite the law in ways that would overrule the court's decision.  HOUSE BANKING COMMITTEE APPROVES BILL TO REPEAL CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS  WASHINGTON (NYT) _ The House Banking Committee approved Thursday a broad bill to repeal decades of consumer protection laws, but Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin quickly threatened to recommend that President Clinton veto it.  The committee's Republican majority passed the bill on a party-line vote of 27 to 23. Republicans contended that the bill would eliminate unnecessary red tape, allowing banks to operate safely and more efficiently and ultimately pass on some of their savings to consumers.  But House Democrats and Rubin objected that the bill would undermine protections that many depositors have come to take for granted, would allow bank executives to engage in reckless activities that could endanger the solvency of their institutions.  DIVIDED COURT RULES ON CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTING  WASHINGTON (NYT) _ In a sweeping, bitterly contested decision that could erase a portion of the recent electoral gains made by blacks in Congress and state legislatures, the Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the use of race as a ``predominant factor'' in drawing district lines is presumably unconstitutional.  The 5-to-4 decision declared unconstitutional Georgia's 11th Congressional District, now represented by a black Democrat, Cynthia McKinney. The Georgia legislature drew the district in 1992 to satisfy the Justice Department's insistence that a third majority-black district be created for the state's 11-member congressional delegation.  Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's majority decision left many important questions unanswered about how the new standard should be applied in other cases. Implicitly acknowledging that fact, the court announced that it would hear two other redistricting cases, from Texas and North Carolina, after its next term begins in October. Thursday was the final day of the 1994-95 term.  ERIE CANAL TO BE TURNED INTO RECREATIONAL AREA  (NYT) _ The Erie Canal, whose mule-drawn barges opened the nation's heartland to the Atlantic 170 years ago, is to be turned into a major recreational waterway for boaters, hikers, cyclists and tourists by the New York State Thruway Authority.  The Erie and three linked canals stretch for 524 miles from Buffalo to Albany and up to Lake Champlain but last year carried less than 68,000 tons of cargo, a tiny fraction of the 5.2 million tons in the modern peak year of 1951. To revive the canal, the authority drew its inspiration from the lively traffic of pleasure boats on sleepy canals in France and Britain and conceived of the Erie Canal as a serpentine playground.  RUSSIAN, U.S. SPACE PROGRAMS COME TOGETHER  HOUSTON (NYT) _ A winged American spaceship Thursday docked with a Russian space station for the first time, doing it so flawlessly and seemingly effortlessly that the feat seems bound to aid the joint ambitions of the Russian and American space programs.  Ten astronauts greeted one another with hugs, handshakes and kisses on the cheek, chattering away in Russian and English while speeding around the Earth at nearly five miles a second in the biggest craft ever assembled to probe the heavens.  It was the first union in space between Americans and Russians in two decades.  ``Let them leave their cameras behind, for heaven sake,'' a bemused Russian commander said as his outpost filled with shuttle astronauts eager to record the event for posterity.  The historic linkup some 245 miles above central Asia came after a tense orbital chase in which the space shuttle Atlantis slowly approached the Mir space station, each craft representing some 100 tons of potentially deadly momentum. Finally, after hours of edgy preparations, the two docking mechanisms touched in a metallic kiss.  COURT RULES 5-4 ON FINANCING STUDENT RELIGIOUS MAGAZINE  WASHINGTON (NYT) _ A sharply divided Supreme Court opened the door Thursday to greater government financial support for religious organizations, ruling 5 to 4 that the University of Virginia was constitutionally required to subsidize a student religious magazine on the same basis as any other student publication.  The majority rejected the university's argument that it would violate the constitutional separation of church and state to use university funds to help pay the printing costs for the explicitly Christian magazine.  To the contrary, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said in the majority opinion, once a state-supported university decides to underwrite the private speech any group of students, it ``may not silence the expression of selected viewpoints'' on the ground that the expression is religious in content. ``Vital First Amendment speech principles are at stake here,'' Justice Kennedy said.  To the dissenters, led by Justice David H. Souter, another important First Amendment principle was at stake and was compromised by the decision Thursday: the principle against direct government financing of religious activity. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950629.0368 type=story > <HEADLINE> THURSDAY'S U.S. MARKETS: BONDS PLUNGE; DOLLAR, STOCKS FALL </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> New York, June 29 (Bloomberg) (BC-THURSDAY'S-US-MARKETS-REPEAT-BLOOM) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

"129254"	"I"	"imagine"	" Had H.L. Mencken, an obstreperous polemicist against American Puritanism, ever met George Orwell, a left-wing anti-Communist who fought the Fascists in Spain, the result, I imagine, would have been mutual disgust. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"129276"	"I"	"imagine"	" ORWELL-MENCKEN-IDEOLOGY (Undated) _ Had H.L. Mencken, an obstreperous polemicist against American Puritanism, ever met George Orwell, a left-wing anti-communist who fought the fascists in Spain, the result, I imagine, would have been mutual disgust. But there are similarities in how these two bourgeois writers approached their craft. Both excelled at deadline journalism. Both were pioneers in cultural criticism. Mencken wrote about political conventions, the unhappiness of Rudolph Valentino and the nature of chiropractors. The latest Orwell collection includes his famous essays on Dickens, boys magazines, British patriotism and the making of tea. And oddly enough, given their ideological incompatibilities, they shared attitudes about their roles. By Edward Rothstein. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"

Moet &amp; Chandon came out with the Mini Moet, a four-pack of splits of White Star that comes complete with little clear plastic flutes. These flute/straws look like the top part of a regular champagne flute but have no stem and are hollow at the bottom so you can insert them into the bottle's neck and sip directly from them -- clever, but, we imagine, kind of awkward. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"147896"	"we"	"imagine"	" G4techTV is presenting a virtual pageant called Girls Gone Wired, a competition that puts 75 pneumonic, barely clad women from 40 video games into competition with one another. (Brought to us, we imagine, by Jergens.) </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"148705"	"I"	"imagine"	" Over the next couple .MDRV/of .MDNM/weeks, my ache grew into an obsession.

"149878"	"I"	"imagine"	" Framed as a lesson for film students (or, more truly, students of digital video), 10 on Ten is certainly not without glints of ideas. Kiarostami is an intellectual as well as an artist and has obviously given thought to the phenomenology of cinema. It might, I imagine, be fascinating to listen to him deliver a truly considered discourse on the subject. But 10 on Ten, with its Kant-for-dummies vibe and unacknowledged riffing on Andre Bazin (spinning in his grave like a top), is too simplistic to take seriously. This is a self-serving bit of rhetoric from an artist who has given the world the gift of superb works, including the features Where Is the Friend's House (1987) and Life, and Nothing More{hellip} (1992), both shot on celluloid. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"

"157098"	"I"	"imagine"	" I guess that's the strongest recommendation I could give the North Shore. Its allure is hypnotic, right through a crisis. My wife loves it unconditionally, and we have a 6-year-old daughter who plays on the shoreline as if born to the assignment.

And Heitzler is clearly aware that his show keeps one foot in the commercial world at the same time that it is trying to feel out firm ground in an alternative sphere.

But, he said, he and others -- including young mothers, gay couples and members of rugby teams -- were still subject to strict screening rules that slowed the process and wasted resources.

"174057"	"I"	"imagine"	" The director Nancy Meyers gets a kick out of romantic love, but she also grooves to its agonies, particularly those of the more prolix kind. In her neo-screwball world of dizzy dames and the heartbreakers who do and done them wrong, love is a drug, an escape, an ordeal and a ready excuse for a lot of chatter. The men and women in a Nancy Meyers film don't just fall in love; they talk about falling in love, about falling out of love, about needing, fearing and surrendering to love. They would, I imagine, have driven Raymond Carver crazy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
