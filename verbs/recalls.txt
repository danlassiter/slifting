By the early 1980s, he recalls, ``We couldn't sell wooden boats. In 1983, we put a beautiful wooden boat on the water and nobody wanted to talk to us about anything but composites.'' As is his custom, he became an expert in composites by using them.

Working with MacLaine, she recalls, ``was loving and competitive at the same time. We could trust the other person to be there. But there was some staking out of our territory.

As a boy, he recalls, he would play in the basement, fashioning a little hideaway room of his own from corrugated cardboard, with a tin-can telephone. ``I had already decided to be an actor when I was 10 years old. I was always very shy and it took me a long time, but that was always my dream. My mother, for whatever reason, encouraged me, although she couldn't get me to go to the community theaters for auditions because I was too shy. She was musical. She played the piano a bit. She was a very sensitive woman and I don't know why she felt that I could become an actor, but what I'm doing now is because, for whatever reason, she wanted me to.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"

Not until much later did he learn that the day he left Ireland _ Aug. 12, 1964 _ was the day Ian Fleming, Bond's creator, died. ``I don't know,'' Brosnan says, perched on a hotel sofa, darkly handsome features scrunched in perplexity. ``Numerology?

Times News Service  It took only eight moves Thursday for Gata Kamsky to steer the adjournment session of Game 11 in his world championship match with Anatoly Karpov smoothly to a draw. He once again showed what a tough defender he is.  With each side gaining a half-point, Karpov holds a 7-to-4 lead in the match, which is under way in Elista, Russia. Karpov needs 3{ more points to win the $937,500 prize.  Throughout the first session of the game Wednesday, Kamsky was badgered unswervingly by Karpov, who enjoyed three positional advantages: his rooks controlled the only infiltration file, his bishop was slightly better than Kamsky's knight, and his queenside pawns presented the latent threat of creating a new queen. Kamsky suffered, but at the sealed move, 59 Ra5, he still had not cracked.  And when he came in to play Thursday, Kamsky was a model of logical efficiency. He immediately sacrificed a pawn with 59 ... Rb7! 60 Ra6 Ke7 61 Kg5 so that after 61 ... Rb3!, he could tie up the enemy king in defense of the f3 and g3 pawns. After 62 Kg4 Kf7, Karpov was prevented from advancing his pawns; any such attempt as 63 f4 lets Black exchange a pawn with 63 ... ef 64 gf and reach a well-known theoretical draw.  After 65 ... Ke6, there was no value in playing 66 Rf8 because 66 ... Ke7 would drive the rook from the protection of the f3 pawn, so that the white king still could not advance to clear the way for the g4 pawn. The actual 66 Kg5 was Karpov's admission that his task was impossible. He knew that 66 ... e4! virtually forces a draw at once by way of 67 fe Rg3 (67 Rf6 Ke7 is no better) and shook hands on it.

By STACEY COLINO From Women's Sports &AMP; Fitness magazine c.1996 Stacey Colino (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  Unless you've just arrived from a distant galaxy, you've undoubtedly heard experts quoting chapter and verse about the health benefits of antioxidants.  Yes, they're still important, but the latest buzz in nutrition circles is that another dietary powerhouse is emerging as a potent disease-prevention weapon: phytochemicals.  Phytochemicals aren't vitamins or minerals, nor are they nutrients in the classic sense of the word. Rather, they're compounds that exist naturally _ and abundantly _ in edible plants, including fruits and vegetables, grains, legumes, herbs and seeds.  Some experts believe that consuming more of these plant compounds may be one of the best things we can do to ward off cancer, heart disease and even conditions such as osteoporosis.  And now several manufacturers even claim to have packaged the healthful essence of broccoli, spinach and other phytochemical-filled foods in pill form. HOW HEALTHY?  It turns out that there are hundreds, even thousands, of phytochemicals, and they're categorized into classes with tongue-twisting names such as carotenoids, isothiocyanates and indoles (see sidebar). Yet at this point, scientists have only a sketchy picture of their health-promoting properties.  What the researchers do know is that according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), approximately 35 percent of all cancer cases may be attributable to poor diet.  Conversely, close to 200 epidemiological studies have found that there's a low-risk of many types of cancers among those who eat relatively large quantities of fruits and vegetables.  ``Some interesting evidence from animal studies suggests that all sorts of phytochemicals that may protect against cancer are lurking about in plant foods,'' notes Dr. John Potter, head of the cancer-prevention research program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.  ``But we don't know exactly what they are, let alone what they do in humans.''  The NCI, though, is intrigued enough to try and find out. It's currently sponsoring a major effort to identify the biological activity of various phytochemicals in the hope that detailed dietary guidelines designed to achieve specific disease-prevention goals can eventually be established.  ``The idea is to have food tables for phytochemicals, just as we do for vitamin B6 or vitamin A,'' says Phyllis Bowen, an associate professor in the department of human nutrition and dietetics and a co-director of the Functional Foods for Health Research Program at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  The research is still in its infancy, and the presence of the more than 600 carotenoids _ and around 1,700 members of another variety of compounds, bioflavonoids _ that have been identified makes research difficult. HOW THEY WORK  Some phytochemicals have antioxidant properties that keep the unstable molecules known as free radicals from wreaking cellular damage.  And many have additional disease-fighting powers as well. Some compounds, for instance, seem to prevent the formation of carcinogens, block them from reaching their targets or boost the production of enzymes that have a detoxifying effect on them.  But these anticancer effects are just the tip of the iceberg. Compounds found in garlic and onions, for example, appear to lower blood cholesterol and bolster immune function.  Carotenoids, found in carrots, sweet potatoes and other deeply colored fruits and vegetables, may enhance immune function and help prevent _ or possibly reverse _ osteoporosis as well.  The task of figuring out exactly which compounds in these foods are responsible for which health-enhancing effects won't be easy, though. Nor will that of pinpointing the optimal intake, the best ratios between individual phytochemicals and the amount of each one that's naturally absorbed by the body.  ``We have a lot of gaps to close,'' Potter says. Even so, some companies and researchers are considering the possibility of using genetic engineering to boost phytochemical levels in produce, or of fortifying the food supply with specific phytochemicals.  In the not-too-distant future, we may be snacking on energy bars laced with carotenoids. FROM THE PILL MILLS  If we care to, we can already nosh on the phytochemical supplements that have recently begun appearing on drugstore and health-food-store shelves. Billed (quite literally) as the best thing since sliced tomatoes, these promise all the benefits of eating loads of veggies without the need to really do so.  But can they deliver the goods? It's uncertain. For one thing, scientists don't know whether these plant chemicals are compromised when they're extracted from their sources, processed and stuck into a pill.  ``The problem with taking a compound out of a food source,'' Bowen points out, ``is that originally it was combined with 11 closely related brothers and sisters, and it may be that the combination is what makes for the overall beneficial effect.''  In other words, it's possible that phytochemicals work in concert rather than in isolation. In the opinion of Dr. Paul Lachance, chairman of the department of food science at Rutgers University, the marketing of phytochemical supplements is way ahead of the science.  ``In the long run, the supplements could prove beneficial, but at this point, there's no evidence that they contain the compounds the manufacturers claim they do,'' he says.  Still to be answered, too, is the question of whether taking large doses of phytochemicals carries any adverse effects. Although these elements may be safe when ingested in food, supplements could be another story, because no one knows how much of a particular phytochemical is too much.  ``It may be either that the amount in your food supply isn't so great that it will harm you or that your body has ways of handling it so it's not toxic,'' says Cheryl Rock, an assistant professor in human nutrition at the University of Michigan.  ``But when you isolate phytochemicals and concentrate them in a supplement, your body may not have the mechanisms to handle it.'' CONSCIENTIOUS CONSUMPTION  For the time being, at least, eating plenty of fruits and vegetables is the best prescription for good health, says Dr. Johanna Dwyer, director of the Frances Stern Nutrition Center at New England Medical Center in Boston.  Because there are currently no required daily allowances (RDAs) for specific phytochemicals, it's smart to aim for a minimum of five servings of a wide variety of fruits and vegetables each day.  ``Eating at least those five daily servings,'' Bowen says, ``will halve your chances of getting common cancers, including breast, lung and colon cancer.''  That's the lower limit, though. Because some research suggests that very intense exercise can cause oxidative stress, thus creating more of those freewheeling free radicals, athletic women may want to try for a higher intake of phytochemicals _ especially those with antioxidant properties, such as carotenoids and flavonoids.  ``Our research indicates that active people can get up to 12 servings a day and feel good,'' Potter says. ``If you spread them out during the day, you have a better chance of raising your intake.''  As for whether raw or cooked is better, the answer depends on the compound or vegetable. The carotenoids and indoles in broccoli, for example, seem to become more accessible as a result of cooking, but cooked garlic may lose some of its benefits.  Until more is known about how various preparation methods affect specific phytochemicals, the best advice is: Don't overcook your vegetables.  ``Phytochemicals often aren't very stable, so the more processing you do, the likelier you are to destroy the good stuff that's there,'' Rock explains.  Use cooking methods _ steaming, broiling, microwaving and the like _ that allow vegetables to retain most of their nutrients. That way you'll get those phytochemicals at their most potent, along with all the other nutrients fruits and vegetables have to offer. -0- SIDEBAR: SEVEN SUPER PHYTOCHEMICALS  1.

We're all bombarded by the ``musts'' in our financial lives _ the mutual funds we must buy, the tax shelters we mustn't overlook, the financial program we simply must put into place today, if not this very minute. And, say the pundits, once these money musts have been met, our financial lives will be in order.  That may be so, but beneath the surface of all those requirements lies another level of financial steps that can often make a difference in our financial well-being. These steps are simple, easy to implement and can further cement fiscal security.  Here, then, are nine frequently overlooked financial moves:  1. Polish Your Portfolio. This one should top everyone's list, particularly in 1996.  After the Wall Street bull stampede of 1995 and early '96, many investors have been tempted to simply stay the course, with nary a glance at their investments. Don't. Changing conditions mandate new strategies, no matter how well your investments performed in the past.  Take the time to review your portfolio to see if any updates or revisions are necessary. Certified financial planner Ron Roge suggests an annual asset-allocation overhaul.  ``We've sold many of our domestic equities because they did so well last year. Reviewing your investments is simply good discipline,'' he says.  2. Play the Percentages. People who earmark a specific amount of money for monthly deposit into a 401(k) or other employer-sponsored plan may assume they're doing all they can. Well, not quite.  Instead of a fixed sum, financial planner Glen Clemans suggests that you designate a percentage of your income for regular deposit. That way, if your income goes up, so do your savings.  For example, a flat $300 per month invested at 10 percent for 15 years grows to a respectable $125,300. However, the same $300, with a 5 percent annual salary adjustment, betters that by nearly $40,000 during the same period.  3. Ensure You're Secure. Social security slipups probably happen more than we'll ever know, so it's important to check your account to make sure everything's accurate.  Fill out Form SSA-7004 and send it in _ you'll receive a printout detailing the number of years you've worked, what you'd get in social security benefits at various retirement ages and other information.  Review your social security benefits every three years because mistakes can become permanent after that. To obtain this form, call your local social security office.  4. Get the Point. The common perception is that it's not worthwhile to refinance your home unless you can trim the interest rate by at least two percentage points. This isn't necessarily true; even dips of one point or so can add up to big savings.  To illustrate, if you have a $100,000, 30-year 8.25 percent mortgage, you're paying $746 a month. Refinancing at 7.25 percent not only drops your monthly payment to $677, but you'll also save more than $24,000 over the life of the loan.  One caveat: Because refinancing costs can be hefty, make sure your commitment to the house is long-term.  5. Flex to the Max. If your practice is incorporated, you should know all about flexible spending accounts (FSAs), yet many physicians ignore the outstanding benefits of these powerful programs.  With an FSA, a set amount is deducted from your paycheck every month on a pretax basis. You can then use the money to pay medical bills, insurance deductibles and copayments and childcare expenses.  Remember: While FSAs are common in large corporations, even the smallest incorporated business can enjoy their benefits.  6. Keep Your Overhead Up. You know that you should have disability insurance to protect your income in case you're sick or injured. If you're self-employed, this becomes an even greater necessity.  But for an additional level of protection, consider overhead expense insurance. As certified financial planner Jan Lambert explains, overhead expense insurance covers the salary that you pay to anyone who works to keep your office open while you're out on disability.  Lambert says the cost of the policy depends on the number of people to be covered and their salaries; the insurance can generally fund replacement salaries for up to a couple of years.  7. Make Nepotism Pay. This move can trim your taxes, better organize your office and help you put aside money for college: Put your kids to work.  If you need help handling basic office chores such as filing, typing or cleaning, hire your kids to do the job. Not only are their ``salaries'' tax deductible, but money paid out can be earmarked for long-term goals, such as college.  And, notes certified financial planner Virginia B. Gerhart, if your practice isn't incorporated, you don't have to pay social security taxes for any worker younger than 18.  There is one caveat, Gerhart warns: You must be able to prove that the kids really have worked and that they didn't just watch the plants grow, or the IRS will have a field day with your tax return.  8. Make Sure Junior's Got the Number. When it comes to birthdays, the days of laxity at the IRS are over. If your child is born this year and you intend to claim the baby as a dependent on your 1996 tax return, new IRS rules stipulate that he or she must have a social security number.  That's a change from the past, when parents had several years to obtain a social security card for their children. The only exceptions are children born in November or December; for them, writing ``11/96'' or ``12/96'' on the return is good enough.  Think the IRS doesn't intend to put the new rule to work? You may risk having your return returned.  9. Bypass Estate Taxes. Don't overlook one final step to make sure your money gets to your heirs as intact as possible.  Financial planner Mike Martin says he routinely sees wills without a bypass trust, in which a married couple can leave up to $1.2 million _ double the $600,000 standard exclusion _ without paying a cent in estate taxes.  A bypass trust shelters up to $600,000 from the estate when the first spouse dies. The second spouse can use the couple's one-time $600,000 exclusion to pass that much in assets on to their heirs without estate tax.  At the same time, the $600,000 in the trust also passes tax-free.  ``With just a couple of paragraphs in a will,'' Martin says, ``this saves a couple hundred thousand dollars in estate taxes.''

By CINDY PEARLMAN World rights except Chicago (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Danny DeVito always knew that he would be big.  ``The competition is pretty flimsy for roles around 5 feet tall,'' he jokes.  But DeVito has become big as a director and producer as well as an actor. In all three capacities, he is on a roll in Hollywood.  ``I feel like the Godfather these days,'' he says in a gravelly voice, perched in a large, black-leather chair in a lavish Los Angeles hotel suite.  But when he is called away moments later on ``family business,'' it isn't the Mob calling _ only his wife, actress Rhea Perlman, wondering if their kids had made it to school.  ``I make breakfast and drive them every morning,'' DeVito says of Lucy Chet, Gracie Fan and Jake Daniel Sebastian DeVito.  DeVito also serves as a father figure to the young filmmakers who work for his production company, Jersey Films, which gave the world ``Pulp Fiction'' (1994) and ``Get Shorty'' (1995).  ``They are like my children,'' DeVito says. ``I'm the one they call in the middle of the night to slay the dragons. Young filmmakers know that if there is trouble, my sword comes out. I give them that feeling of security.''  Even as a director, he plays the father _ literally and metaphorically in the case of ``Matilda,'' starring ``Miracle on 34th Street's'' Mara Wilson, due to be released Aug. 2. DeVito not only directs but also appears as Matilda's father, with Perlman as her mother.  ``You nurture, nurture, nurture and then the movie is like a kid. It must leave your house and be judged by outsiders,'' he says.  DeVito hasn't much time for acting these days, because of his production responsibilities. The next feature from Jersey Films is the Keanu Reeves love story, ``Feeling Minnesota,'' scheduled for August release and produced by DeVito.  ``My plate is very full, but I wouldn't have it any other way,'' DeVito says. ``What can I say? I love this business so much. I'm so pleased to be a part of any of it.''  As for ``Matilda,'' he says, ``I really did love making this film. I liked the story, which is about how your imagination can take you anywhere.  ``The best part of it is that my kids can see it and not get nightmares _ unlike some of my other projects.''  Such as playing The Penguin in ``Batman Returns'' (1992)?  ``They took one look at me in that outfit and couldn't sleep for days,'' DeVito recalls with a laugh. ``I actually have a video of their worried little faces.''  DeVito formed Jersey Films three years ago with a specific mission.  ``The idea of the company didn't have to do with my acting career or finding directing vehicles for myself,'' he says. ``I wanted to be able to use whatever guerrilla force I was acquiring in Hollywood and let filmmakers make their movies with my final-cut status. I wanted to give them assurances that I would be the middle man between them and a studio.''  He is quick to add, however, that he doesn't interfere with the filmmakers' work.  ``Once a project is launched and everyone is in casting and all the deals are made, it's really the artist's movie,'' he says. ``I have to say to myself, `Get outta here. Give it up.'''  Quentin Tarantino remembers that hands-off method when it came to ``Pulp Fiction.''  ``Danny calls me one day a few years ago and says, `Quentin, I've read 30 pages of this ``Reservoir Dogs'' thing and I let Rhea, my wife, read it, although she hated the ear part. Anyway, we gotta meet,''' Tarantino recalls in a separate interview.  ``At the meeting, Danny tells me we should be in business together and whatever I'm doing next to bring it to Jersey Films.''  DeVito picks up the story.  ``One day, I get a 159-page script. It said `Pulp Fiction by Quentin Tarantino. Final Draft.' I was like, `Perfect.' Then I said to Rhea, `This thing is a f---ing classic.'''  Tarantino says it was his vision all the way.  ``No one messed with me. Totally above-board. Danny told me I could do what I wanted and he didn't miss a step. He does not promise what he can't deliver.''  ``My motto with filmmakers is, `What do you desire? Let me get it for you,''' DeVito says.  Born in Neptune, N.J., on Nov. 17, 1944, the future filmmaker was the son of a small-time entrepreneur who at various times ran a candy store, a dry cleaner's shop and a pool hall. As a child, DeVito discovered acting. His first role, in a school play, was as St. Francis of Assisi.  But after graduating from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, the young man failed to make his mark in either New York or Los Angeles.  For a while, he worked in his sister's New Jersey hair salon as ``Mr. Danny.'' Even today he tells a visitor, ``Your hairdresser did a good job. (But) next time, I'm bringing my scissors.''  At night, he moonlighted as a makeup artist and valet.  Finally, in 1967, DeVito bought himself a one-way ticket from New Jersey to New York, where he finally found stage work and also struck up what were to be lasting friendships with two other struggling young actors, Michael Douglas and Rhea Perlman.  In 1974, DeVito had a small role in an Off-Broadway production of ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' which opened and closed in one night. But Douglas, beginning his own career as a producer, caught the show and cast DeVito as the diminutive Martini in the 1975 movie version of the play.  DeVito's real break came in 1978, when he was cast as the vain, dictatorial dispatcher Louie DePalma on the TV series ``Taxi,'' which lasted until 1983 and won him an Emmy in 1981.  His TV success led to increasingly prominent roles in films such as ``Terms of Endearment'' (1983), ``Romancing the Stone'' (1984), ``Johnny Dangerously'' (1984), ``Ruthless People'' (1986), ``Wise Guys'' (1986), ``Tin Men'' (1987), ``Twins'' (1988), ``Other People's Money'' (1991) and ``Batman Returns.''  He made his film-directing debut in ``Throw Momma From the Train'' (1987), which was made for $14 million and grossed $27 million. He has since directed the successful ``War of the Roses'' (1989) and the unsuccessful ``Hoffa'' (1992).  Not that DeVito considers ``Hoffa'' unsuccessful.  ``I enjoy `Hoffa,''' he says. ``I love it. I made it. Whether it did $30 million at the box office or $100 million is, like, moot to me. Sure, I feel bad if a movie tanks. It's upsetting, but it's not the only thing.''  Jersey Films met with mixed results initially. The Luke Perry rodeo film ``8 Seconds'' (1994) and the Generation X comedy ``Reality Bites'' (1994) didn't break out, though DeVito insists that both ultimately made money. The same can't be said for Perlman's basketball movie ``Sunset Park,'' which fouled out at the box office early this year.  On the other hand, both ``Pulp Fiction'' and ``Get Shorty'' topped the $100 million mark.  DeVito acknowledges some conflict between the artist and the businessman within him.  ``I'm both,'' DeVito says. ``I usually let the artist win because I go from my gut. I read all the scripts that come in and I make a choice based on an inner feeling, which is the artist speaking to me.  ``I know I'm a producer, but I just can't start thinking in terms of making money, because then every movie becomes this calculated numbers reason to do something.  ``You don't do a painting or sculpture, a piece of art, because you think it will make money. Why you make a movie is because you feel this is something you're passionate about. And if you're an artist that's what you should do _ you shouldn't try to second-guess it.  ``If somebody says it won't be mainstream, it can still go up on a screen, can't it? I heard from the start that `Pulp Fiction' wasn't mainstream enough.  ``I'll do the movies that I love,'' DeVito says firmly. ``That's what I dig.''  That could mean big movies or small movies, as his instincts dictate.  DeVito frowns at the word ``small.''  ``I don't like that word,'' the diminutive mogul says. ``Everything is big in its own way.'' c.1996 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Bob Costas against an Olympics-logo backdrop. By ALEXANDER WOHL c.1996 A&AMP;E Monthly (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  When the flame is extinguished at the close of this year's Olympic games, a good many people will experience not disappointment but relief. More than 100 hours of televised pole-vaulting, table tennis, synchronized swimming and so on can dampen anyone's enthusiasm.  But even as Americans begin to tire of this quadrennial sports epic, it's a safe bet that they won't turn against Bob Costas, the omnipresent and charismatic anchor of NBC's coverage of the Olympic games.  It's Costas' second time around as ``Anchor to the World,'' as Newsweek labeled him four years ago when he anchored the Barcelona games. This time, the sportscaster is less awestruck by the event and his assignment but still keenly aware of the power and impact that comes with his position.  He understands that even in a post-Cold War world, the Olympics involve more than athletics. Business, international politics and the specter of terrorism are all part of the picture.  ``The Olympics transcends sports,'' Costas says in the same crisp-yet-comforting voice he uses on the air. ``It is one of the few sporting events that draws about a 50-50 male-female audience.''  When he was in college and would tell people that he wanted to be a sports announcer, he recalls, ``Women especially would say, `You mean like Jim McKay?''' _ ABC's longtime anchor for the Olympics.  Today they might say ``You mean like Bob Costas?'' because the 44-year-old sportscaster has moved far beyond the traditional sports audience he reaches through the Olympics, his work as host of NBC's pro-basketball coverage or his position as lead play-by-play announcer for major-league baseball.  Instead, Costas has diversified his interests to include a number of nonsports endeavors. The most prominent was ``Later ... With Bob Costas,'' his 1989-1994 late-night interview show in which he talked with guests ranging from Elie Wiesel to Woody Allen.  Costas also does regular reports and interviews for several NBC news-magazine shows, including ``Dateline NBC.'' He appears frequently on ``Nightline,'' ``Meet the Press'' and ``Charlie Rose,'' and occasionally fills in as a substitute host for Bryant Gumbel on ``The Today Show.''  He also pops up occasionally on David Letterman's late-night show, participating in stunts such as ``calling'' elevator races.  Many people are surprised that a sportscaster can branch so ably into other disciplines, but Costas isn't.  ``The best sportscasters can report extemporaneously as well as the top 1 percent of all newscasters,'' he says. ``The subject matter may not be as weighty, but they have what it takes _ the innate ability to observe, to report, to craft words and phrases to fit into certain snippets of time, to be at ease in front of the camera, to decide instantly what's important and what isn't.''  Costas' reverence for his profession dates from his childhood on Long Island in New York. As a boy, he regularly attended New York Yankees games. When not at the stadium, he followed the team on the radio.  By the age of 8, he had learned to love baseball, in part because of the close relationship it helped him forge with his father. He also came to cherish what he calls ``the romance of the airwaves.''  Listening to great play-by-play announcers such as Red Barber, Mel Allen and Ernie Harwell, Costas realized these men ``weren't just dispensing information _ they were weaving stories and creating a certain mood and sensibility of their own. They had a relationship with their listeners.''  When it became clear that he was not going to be the next Mickey Mantle, Costas shifted his focus to sportscasting.  But he never merely aped his idols. There are echoes of Allen and Barber in his style, but he also brings a winning combination of humility and humor, along with disarming candor and a blend of youthful impertinence and respect. This is a guy who actually begins sentences with the word ``Gee.''  Humor in the broadcasting booth must be handled carefully, Costas says.  ``I try not to make a big deal out of the humor,'' he explains, ``because then you're almost saying to the audience, stop paying attention to this while I do this shtick.  ``I never do it to where what I'm doing is competing with the action or the information that people need.''  That same self-effacing quality is to be found in Costas' personal life, despite his having achieved stardom. He continues to live in St. Louis, commuting regularly to New York, because he believes it is the best lifestyle for him, his wife and their two children.  Costas hasn't escaped his share of criticism, of course. Some observers have accused him of lacking an edge, of being unwilling to take sides or criticize anyone.  To be sure, Costas isn't noted for the frantic tirades that characterize some sports broadcasters, but he feels that his reputation for avoiding controversy is a bad rap.  ``I won't say something just for the sake of being provocative,'' he says. ``There is a difference between being provocative and being thoughtful. And being thoughtful does not mean being equivocating or timid.''  On a number of recent issues concerning baseball _ the player strike, divisional realignment and the addition of wild-card teams to the playoffs _ Costas spoke out frequently, clearly, forcefully and usually on the traditionalist side.  ``I don't pretend to take a sharp edge on subjects where I don't have a strong opinion,'' he says. He contrasts himself in this regard with other broadcasters, such as the highly opinionated Howard Cosell.  Costas calls Cosell's impact ``overrated.'' He acknowledges some of Cosell's contributions, including his strong pro-civil-rights stand, but argues that Cosell ultimately was most interested in calling attention to himself.  Costas believes that some of Cosell's contemporaries in the broadcasting booth _ McKay, Vin Scully and Al Michaels, for instance _ are better models of what sports coverage can and should be: ``forceful in a thoughtful way.''  Surely Costas has achieved that goal in his own work, which begs another question: Having reached the peak of his profession, able to do virtually everything he wants to do, where does he go next?  It has been 16 years since Costas was labeled the ``boy wonder'' of TV sports when NBC selected him, at only 27, to do play-by-play for its national telecasts of football and basketball. By 1983, the 30-year-old was doing baseball's ``Game of the Week'' telecasts. Today, he is at the top, and can apparently stay there as long as he wants to. He is already booked to do the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia.  Costas shows no sign of losing interest in sports. And, since NBC, as he puts it, has all the good sports properties, he may simply slow down and concentrate more on sports alone, he says.  He has been mentioned as a permanent replacement for Gumbel, who is leaving ``The Today Show'' this year, but Costas is emphatic in denying those rumors.  ``NBC knows that I am not in any sense a candidate to host that show,'' he says flatly.  The general perception that sports is too small a field to retain his attention is untrue, Costas says.  ``I've never been one who feels that sports broadcasting is a lesser calling,'' he says. ``I would be happy to cover sports 100 percent of the time if I could cover it the way I'd like to cover it.''  Still, there are other challenges out there, and he readily admits that he does ``have broadcasting interests outside of sports.''  So it seems that, like the world-class athletes he covers, Costas will continue to push himself, testing his own limits and those of his job.  One would expect no less from the ``anchor to the world.''  (Alexander Wohl is a Washington, D.C.-based free-lance writer.)

By ALLISON SERRELL c.1996 McCall's (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  Bargaining at boutiques and department stores, or with your doctor or landlord, is typically considered taboo _ that is, until you discover how well it works. THE SAVVY SHOPPER'S SECRET: THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A NO-BARGAIN ZONE  While you may have thought haggling worked only at places such as flea markets and used-car dealerships, things have changed. Desperate to keep sales up and inventory moving along, even high-end merchants are frequently willing to grant 25 percent to 40 percent discounts.  You have absolutely nothing to lose by asking a store manager if she can ``do just a little better'' on a price or match a competitor's cost.  And don't draw your bargaining boundaries at retail shops, either.  ``Anything that is created by man is negotiable, from a heart transplant to a severance package,'' says Stephen Pollan, co-author of ``The Total Negotiator'' (Avon, 1994).  What does that mean for a consumer seeking a discount?  ``By negotiating, you'll find that you can often reduce the price of goods and services by 10 to 15 percent,'' Pollan contends.  Case in point: Most apartment dwellers wouldn't think of bargaining on their rent, especially not after they'd already signed a lease and moved in. But Ian Todreas, a consultant formerly based in Washington, D.C., managed to do just that after he spotted a sign advertising a comparable apartment in his building for significantly less money.  ``I saw no reason why I should be paying more, so I approached my landlady,'' he explains. ``When she asked me what I proposed, I bid low so that when we eventually reached a compromise, I was happy.'' GETTING RIGHT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM-LINE BARGAINING BASICS  Haggling really can work, but you must hone your technique. First, learn as much as you can about the product or service you're interested in buying, particularly what it sells for elsewhere.  ``By doing so, you're leveling the playing field,'' Pollan explains. ``The salesperson already knows all about his products, including their strong points and flaws, and their true value.  ``Show the shopkeeper that you've taken the time to learn about his merchandise too and he'll both treat you with respect and take your proposals more seriously.''  If you're gathering estimates on repair fees for a broken item, be sure to also investigate the cost of replacing it altogether _ and use that information to bargain for a lower repair bill.  A second winning way to encourage a merchant to give you a markdown is to offer to pay in cold, hard cash. Small, independent stores are particularly likely to give their customers a cash discount, Pollan explains, because that frees the owner from having to pay a credit-card fee.  This smart technique has worked numerous times for Michelle Diliberto of New York City, who recently negotiated a whopping 30 percent discount on her wedding band. She got a similarly impressive price concession from a housepainter she hired when she offered to hand over cash _ instead of plastic or a check _ after the job was finished.  Another persuasive tactic is to assure the seller that you'll continue to patronize him in the future, and perhaps even refer new customers if he meets your needs right now.  When Diliberto, who works as a producer at an online service based in Manhattan, needed a parking-garage space for her car last year, she comparison shopped diligently. After one garage manager quoted her a rate of $300 a month, Diliberto said she'd continue to look around.  A few days later, the manager called back and offered to lower the price to $250. Thinking she might do even better, Diliberto explained that she owned two vehicles she needed spaces for and mentioned that she was one of more than 500 employees of a new company in the neighborhood.  While the manager mulled over this information, Diliberto added, ``If you give me a good rate, I'll tell my coworkers about you.''  The chance to rent not one but two spots immediately _ and the prospect of gaining dozens of new customers _ was just too good for the manager to resist. He dropped the price to only $225 per car.  When a merchant can't see her way to giving you the discount you want, sometimes a little creativity is called for. If, for example, you're haggling over the price of a big-ticket item and the talk stalls, offer to buy the floor model.  Pollan tried it once while shopping for a refrigerator.  ``Sure, the unit had a small scuff on one side, but I covered it over with a bit of liquid whitener,'' he says _ and pocketed a savings of several hundred dollars.  Even doctors can sometimes be persuaded to grant discounts. Eric Lee, a community planner in New York City, was making twice-weekly visits to a kidney specialist last year, initially at a cost of $140 per visit. Lee compared the fee with his insurance coverage and realized he was spending a fortune making up the difference.  When he explained to the doctor that he couldn't afford the regular fee because his medical insurance reimbursed him for only $89 a visit, the practitioner lowered the price so Lee would be covered.  One final thought: If no specific bargaining tactic comes to mind, simply ask the seller for his help. Politely explain that you want to purchase the product from him but you didn't expect it to cost so much.  Who knows? Once the seller understands that you really want to make a deal, he may be willing to extend a better offer. Now that's a happy ending. -0- SIDEBAR: TIPS FOR HESITANT HAGGLERS  ``Simple fear prevents most people from bargaining,'' says Stephen Pollan, co-author of ``The Total Negotiator'' (Avon, 1994). Don't let jitters keep you from making a really great deal! Just follow this anxiety-reducing advice.  _ Negotiate up from the dealer's cost rather than down from the sticker price. The markup on small appliances is generally about 30 percent; larger appliances, such as refrigerators, are marked up about 15 percent. Most articles of clothing are priced at twice the store's cost.  If you don't know the markup on an item, aim for a discount of 15 percent off the price tag. This tactic is especially effective when dealing with contractors, painters and repairmen.  _ Talk directly to the person in charge. Don't waste your time haggling with a clerk if only the store manager or owner is authorized to make price adjustments.  _ Remember: Flattery works wonders. A retailer is almost always willing to accept a lower profit, but seldom at the expense of his pride.  Making a comment such as ``I've enjoyed shopping at your store for years'' before you begin to bargain can help smooth the way to bigger savings. A smile or a friendly tone of voice can be equally effective.  _ Steer clear of peak store hours.  ``The best time to strike a bargain is after lunch, when shopkeepers are relaxed and more likely to listen to your offer,'' Pollan recommends.  Never try to negotiate with a retailer on a busy Saturday afternoon.

By STACEY COLINO From Women's Sports &AMP; Fitness magazine c.1996 Stacey Colino (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  Unless you've just arrived from a distant galaxy, you've undoubtedly heard experts quoting chapter and verse about the health benefits of antioxidants.  Yes, they're still important, but the latest buzz in nutrition circles is that another dietary powerhouse is emerging as a potent disease-prevention weapon: phytochemicals.  Phytochemicals aren't vitamins or minerals, nor are they nutrients in the classic sense of the word. Rather, they're compounds that exist naturally _ and abundantly _ in edible plants, including fruits and vegetables, grains, legumes, herbs and seeds.  Some experts believe that consuming more of these plant compounds may be one of the best things we can do to ward off cancer, heart disease and even conditions such as osteoporosis.  And now several manufacturers even claim to have packaged the healthful essence of broccoli, spinach and other phytochemical-filled foods in pill form. HOW HEALTHY?  It turns out that there are hundreds, even thousands, of phytochemicals, and they're categorized into classes with tongue-twisting names such as carotenoids, isothiocyanates and indoles (see sidebar). Yet at this point, scientists have only a sketchy picture of their health-promoting properties.  What the researchers do know is that according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), approximately 35 percent of all cancer cases may be attributable to poor diet.  Conversely, close to 200 epidemiological studies have found that there's a low-risk of many types of cancers among those who eat relatively large quantities of fruits and vegetables.  ``Some interesting evidence from animal studies suggests that all sorts of phytochemicals that may protect against cancer are lurking about in plant foods,'' notes Dr. John Potter, head of the cancer-prevention research program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.  ``But we don't know exactly what they are, let alone what they do in humans.''  The NCI, though, is intrigued enough to try and find out. It's currently sponsoring a major effort to identify the biological activity of various phytochemicals in the hope that detailed dietary guidelines designed to achieve specific disease-prevention goals can eventually be established.  ``The idea is to have food tables for phytochemicals, just as we do for vitamin B6 or vitamin A,'' says Phyllis Bowen, an associate professor in the department of human nutrition and dietetics and a co-director of the Functional Foods for Health Research Program at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  The research is still in its infancy, and the presence of the more than 600 carotenoids _ and around 1,700 members of another variety of compounds, bioflavonoids _ that have been identified makes research difficult. HOW THEY WORK  Some phytochemicals have antioxidant properties that keep the unstable molecules known as free radicals from wreaking cellular damage.  And many have additional disease-fighting powers as well. Some compounds, for instance, seem to prevent the formation of carcinogens, block them from reaching their targets or boost the production of enzymes that have a detoxifying effect on them.  But these anticancer effects are just the tip of the iceberg. Compounds found in garlic and onions, for example, appear to lower blood cholesterol and bolster immune function.  Carotenoids, found in carrots, sweet potatoes and other deeply colored fruits and vegetables, may enhance immune function and help prevent _ or possibly reverse _ osteoporosis as well.  The task of figuring out exactly which compounds in these foods are responsible for which health-enhancing effects won't be easy, though. Nor will that of pinpointing the optimal intake, the best ratios between individual phytochemicals and the amount of each one that's naturally absorbed by the body.  ``We have a lot of gaps to close,'' Potter says. Even so, some companies and researchers are considering the possibility of using genetic engineering to boost phytochemical levels in produce, or of fortifying the food supply with specific phytochemicals.  In the not-too-distant future, we may be snacking on energy bars laced with carotenoids. FROM THE PILL MILLS  If we care to, we can already nosh on the phytochemical supplements that have recently begun appearing on drugstore and health-food-store shelves. Billed (quite literally) as the best thing since sliced tomatoes, these promise all the benefits of eating loads of veggies without the need to really do so.  But can they deliver the goods? It's uncertain. For one thing, scientists don't know whether these plant chemicals are compromised when they're extracted from their sources, processed and stuck into a pill.  ``The problem with taking a compound out of a food source,'' Bowen points out, ``is that originally it was combined with 11 closely related brothers and sisters, and it may be that the combination is what makes for the overall beneficial effect.''  In other words, it's possible that phytochemicals work in concert rather than in isolation. In the opinion of Dr. Paul Lachance, chairman of the department of food science at Rutgers University, the marketing of phytochemical supplements is way ahead of the science.  ``In the long run, the supplements could prove beneficial, but at this point, there's no evidence that they contain the compounds the manufacturers claim they do,'' he says.  Still to be answered, too, is the question of whether taking large doses of phytochemicals carries any adverse effects. Although these elements may be safe when ingested in food, supplements could be another story, because no one knows how much of a particular phytochemical is too much.  ``It may be either that the amount in your food supply isn't so great that it will harm you or that your body has ways of handling it so it's not toxic,'' says Cheryl Rock, an assistant professor in human nutrition at the University of Michigan.  ``But when you isolate phytochemicals and concentrate them in a supplement, your body may not have the mechanisms to handle it.'' CONSCIENTIOUS CONSUMPTION  For the time being, at least, eating plenty of fruits and vegetables is the best prescription for good health, says Dr. Johanna Dwyer, director of the Frances Stern Nutrition Center at New England Medical Center in Boston.  Because there are currently no required daily allowances (RDAs) for specific phytochemicals, it's smart to aim for a minimum of five servings of a wide variety of fruits and vegetables each day.  ``Eating at least those five daily servings,'' Bowen says, ``will halve your chances of getting common cancers, including breast, lung and colon cancer.''  That's the lower limit, though. Because some research suggests that very intense exercise can cause oxidative stress, thus creating more of those freewheeling free radicals, athletic women may want to try for a higher intake of phytochemicals _ especially those with antioxidant properties, such as carotenoids and flavonoids.  ``Our research indicates that active people can get up to 12 servings a day and feel good,'' Potter says. ``If you spread them out during the day, you have a better chance of raising your intake.''  As for whether raw or cooked is better, the answer depends on the compound or vegetable. The carotenoids and indoles in broccoli, for example, seem to become more accessible as a result of cooking, but cooked garlic may lose some of its benefits.  Until more is known about how various preparation methods affect specific phytochemicals, the best advice is: Don't overcook your vegetables.  ``Phytochemicals often aren't very stable, so the more processing you do, the likelier you are to destroy the good stuff that's there,'' Rock explains.  Use cooking methods _ steaming, broiling, microwaving and the like _ that allow vegetables to retain most of their nutrients. That way you'll get those phytochemicals at their most potent, along with all the other nutrients fruits and vegetables have to offer. -0- SIDEBAR: SEVEN SUPER PHYTOCHEMICALS  1.

We're all bombarded by the ``musts'' in our financial lives _ the mutual funds we must buy, the tax shelters we mustn't overlook, the financial program we simply must put into place today, if not this very minute. And, say the pundits, once these money musts have been met, our financial lives will be in order.  That may be so, but beneath the surface of all those requirements lies another level of financial steps that can often make a difference in our financial well-being. These steps are simple, easy to implement and can further cement fiscal security.  Here, then, are nine frequently overlooked financial moves:  1. Polish Your Portfolio. This one should top everyone's list, particularly in 1996.  After the Wall Street bull stampede of 1995 and early '96, many investors have been tempted to simply stay the course, with nary a glance at their investments. Don't. Changing conditions mandate new strategies, no matter how well your investments performed in the past.  Take the time to review your portfolio to see if any updates or revisions are necessary. Certified financial planner Ron Roge suggests an annual asset-allocation overhaul.  ``We've sold many of our domestic equities because they did so well last year. Reviewing your investments is simply good discipline,'' he says.  2. Play the Percentages. People who earmark a specific amount of money for monthly deposit into a 401(k) or other employer-sponsored plan may assume they're doing all they can. Well, not quite.  Instead of a fixed sum, financial planner Glen Clemans suggests that you designate a percentage of your income for regular deposit. That way, if your income goes up, so do your savings.  For example, a flat $300 per month invested at 10 percent for 15 years grows to a respectable $125,300. However, the same $300, with a 5 percent annual salary adjustment, betters that by nearly $40,000 during the same period.  3. Ensure You're Secure. Social security slipups probably happen more than we'll ever know, so it's important to check your account to make sure everything's accurate.  Fill out Form SSA-7004 and send it in _ you'll receive a printout detailing the number of years you've worked, what you'd get in social security benefits at various retirement ages and other information.  Review your social security benefits every three years because mistakes can become permanent after that. To obtain this form, call your local social security office.  4. Get the Point. The common perception is that it's not worthwhile to refinance your home unless you can trim the interest rate by at least two percentage points. This isn't necessarily true; even dips of one point or so can add up to big savings.  To illustrate, if you have a $100,000, 30-year 8.25 percent mortgage, you're paying $746 a month. Refinancing at 7.25 percent not only drops your monthly payment to $677, but you'll also save more than $24,000 over the life of the loan.  One caveat: Because refinancing costs can be hefty, make sure your commitment to the house is long-term.  5. Flex to the Max. If your practice is incorporated, you should know all about flexible spending accounts (FSAs), yet many physicians ignore the outstanding benefits of these powerful programs.  With an FSA, a set amount is deducted from your paycheck every month on a pretax basis. You can then use the money to pay medical bills, insurance deductibles and copayments and childcare expenses.  Remember: While FSAs are common in large corporations, even the smallest incorporated business can enjoy their benefits.  6. Keep Your Overhead Up. You know that you should have disability insurance to protect your income in case you're sick or injured. If you're self-employed, this becomes an even greater necessity.  But for an additional level of protection, consider overhead expense insurance. As certified financial planner Jan Lambert explains, overhead expense insurance covers the salary that you pay to anyone who works to keep your office open while you're out on disability.  Lambert says the cost of the policy depends on the number of people to be covered and their salaries; the insurance can generally fund replacement salaries for up to a couple of years.  7. Make Nepotism Pay. This move can trim your taxes, better organize your office and help you put aside money for college: Put your kids to work.  If you need help handling basic office chores such as filing, typing or cleaning, hire your kids to do the job. Not only are their ``salaries'' tax deductible, but money paid out can be earmarked for long-term goals, such as college.  And, notes certified financial planner Virginia B. Gerhart, if your practice isn't incorporated, you don't have to pay social security taxes for any worker younger than 18.  There is one caveat, Gerhart warns: You must be able to prove that the kids really have worked and that they didn't just watch the plants grow, or the IRS will have a field day with your tax return.  8. Make Sure Junior's Got the Number. When it comes to birthdays, the days of laxity at the IRS are over. If your child is born this year and you intend to claim the baby as a dependent on your 1996 tax return, new IRS rules stipulate that he or she must have a social security number.  That's a change from the past, when parents had several years to obtain a social security card for their children. The only exceptions are children born in November or December; for them, writing ``11/96'' or ``12/96'' on the return is good enough.  Think the IRS doesn't intend to put the new rule to work? You may risk having your return returned.  9. Bypass Estate Taxes. Don't overlook one final step to make sure your money gets to your heirs as intact as possible.  Financial planner Mike Martin says he routinely sees wills without a bypass trust, in which a married couple can leave up to $1.2 million _ double the $600,000 standard exclusion _ without paying a cent in estate taxes.  A bypass trust shelters up to $600,000 from the estate when the first spouse dies. The second spouse can use the couple's one-time $600,000 exclusion to pass that much in assets on to their heirs without estate tax.  At the same time, the $600,000 in the trust also passes tax-free.  ``With just a couple of paragraphs in a will,'' Martin says, ``this saves a couple hundred thousand dollars in estate taxes.''

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Danny DeVito in a scene from ``Matilda.'' By CINDY PEARLMAN World rights except Chicago (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  Danny DeVito always knew that he would be big.  ``The competition is pretty flimsy for roles around 5 feet tall,'' he jokes.  But DeVito has become big as a director and producer as well as an actor. In all three capacities, he is on a roll in Hollywood.  ``I feel like the Godfather these days,'' he says in a gravelly voice, perched in a large, black-leather chair in a lavish Los Angeles hotel suite.  But when he is called away moments later on ``family business,'' it isn't the Mob calling _ only his wife, actress Rhea Perlman, wondering if their kids had made it to school.  ``I make breakfast and drive them every morning,'' DeVito says of Lucy Chet, Gracie Fan and Jake Daniel Sebastian DeVito.  DeVito also serves as a father figure to the young filmmakers who work for his production company, Jersey Films, which gave the world ``Pulp Fiction'' (1994) and ``Get Shorty'' (1995).  ``They are like my children,'' DeVito says. ``I'm the one they call in the middle of the night to slay the dragons. Young filmmakers know that if there is trouble, my sword comes out. I give them that feeling of security.''  Even as a director, he plays the father _ literally and metaphorically in the case of ``Matilda,'' starring ``Miracle on 34th Street's'' Mara Wilson, due to be released Aug. 2. DeVito not only directs but also appears as Matilda's father, with Perlman as her mother.  ``You nurture, nurture, nurture and then the movie is like a kid. It must leave your house and be judged by outsiders,'' he says.  DeVito hasn't much time for acting these days, because of his production responsibilities. The next feature from Jersey Films is the Keanu Reeves love story, ``Feeling Minnesota,'' scheduled for August release and produced by DeVito.  ``My plate is very full, but I wouldn't have it any other way,'' DeVito says. ``What can I say? I love this business so much. I'm so pleased to be a part of any of it.''  As for ``Matilda,'' he says, ``I really did love making this film. I liked the story, which is about how your imagination can take you anywhere.  ``The best part of it is that my kids can see it and not get nightmares _ unlike some of my other projects.''  Such as playing The Penguin in ``Batman Returns'' (1992)?  ``They took one look at me in that outfit and couldn't sleep for days,'' DeVito recalls with a laugh. ``I actually have a video of their worried little faces.''  DeVito formed Jersey Films three years ago with a specific mission.  ``The idea of the company didn't have to do with my acting career or finding directing vehicles for myself,'' he says. ``I wanted to be able to use whatever guerrilla force I was acquiring in Hollywood and let filmmakers make their movies with my final-cut status. I wanted to give them assurances that I would be the middle man between them and a studio.''  He is quick to add, however, that he doesn't interfere with the filmmakers' work.  ``Once a project is launched and everyone is in casting and all the deals are made, it's really the artist's movie,'' he says. ``I have to say to myself, `Get outta here. Give it up.'''  Quentin Tarantino remembers that hands-off method when it came to ``Pulp Fiction.''  ``Danny calls me one day a few years ago and says, `Quentin, I've read 30 pages of this ``Reservoir Dogs'' thing and I let Rhea, my wife, read it, although she hated the ear part. Anyway, we gotta meet,''' Tarantino recalls in a separate interview.  ``At the meeting, Danny tells me we should be in business together and whatever I'm doing next to bring it to Jersey Films.''  DeVito picks up the story.  ``One day, I get a 159-page script. It said `Pulp Fiction by Quentin Tarantino. Final Draft.' I was like, `Perfect.' Then I said to Rhea, `This thing is a f---ing classic.'''  Tarantino says it was his vision all the way.  ``No one messed with me. Totally above-board. Danny told me I could do what I wanted and he didn't miss a step. He does not promise what he can't deliver.''  ``My motto with filmmakers is, `What do you desire? Let me get it for you,''' DeVito says.  Born in Neptune, N.J., on Nov. 17, 1944, the future filmmaker was the son of a small-time entrepreneur who at various times ran a candy store, a dry cleaner's shop and a pool hall. As a child, DeVito discovered acting. His first role, in a school play, was as St. Francis of Assisi.  But after graduating from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, the young man failed to make his mark in either New York or Los Angeles.  For a while, he worked in his sister's New Jersey hair salon as ``Mr. Danny.'' Even today he tells a visitor, ``Your hairdresser did a good job. (But) next time, I'm bringing my scissors.''  At night, he moonlighted as a makeup artist and valet.  Finally, in 1967, DeVito bought himself a one-way ticket from New Jersey to New York, where he finally found stage work and also struck up what were to be lasting friendships with two other struggling young actors, Michael Douglas and Rhea Perlman.  In 1974, DeVito had a small role in an Off-Broadway production of ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' which opened and closed in one night. But Douglas, beginning his own career as a producer, caught the show and cast DeVito as the diminutive Martini in the 1975 movie version of the play.  DeVito's real break came in 1978, when he was cast as the vain, dictatorial dispatcher Louie DePalma on the TV series ``Taxi,'' which lasted until 1983 and won him an Emmy in 1981.  His TV success led to increasingly prominent roles in films such as ``Terms of Endearment'' (1983), ``Romancing the Stone'' (1984), ``Johnny Dangerously'' (1984), ``Ruthless People'' (1986), ``Wise Guys'' (1986), ``Tin Men'' (1987), ``Twins'' (1988), ``Other People's Money'' (1991) and ``Batman Returns.''  He made his film-directing debut in ``Throw Momma From the Train'' (1987), which was made for $14 million and grossed $27 million. He has since directed the successful ``War of the Roses'' (1989) and the unsuccessful ``Hoffa'' (1992).  Not that DeVito considers ``Hoffa'' unsuccessful.  ``I enjoy `Hoffa,''' he says. ``I love it. I made it. Whether it did $30 million at the box office or $100 million is, like, moot to me. Sure, I feel bad if a movie tanks. It's upsetting, but it's not the only thing.''  Jersey Films met with mixed results initially. The Luke Perry rodeo film ``8 Seconds'' (1994) and the Generation X comedy ``Reality Bites'' (1994) didn't break out, though DeVito insists that both ultimately made money. The same can't be said for Perlman's basketball movie ``Sunset Park,'' which fouled out at the box office early this year.  On the other hand, both ``Pulp Fiction'' and ``Get Shorty'' topped the $100 million mark.  DeVito acknowledges some conflict between the artist and the businessman within him.  ``I'm both,'' DeVito says. ``I usually let the artist win because I go from my gut. I read all the scripts that come in and I make a choice based on an inner feeling, which is the artist speaking to me.  ``I know I'm a producer, but I just can't start thinking in terms of making money, because then every movie becomes this calculated numbers reason to do something.  ``You don't do a painting or sculpture, a piece of art, because you think it will make money. Why you make a movie is because you feel this is something you're passionate about. And if you're an artist that's what you should do _ you shouldn't try to second-guess it.  ``If somebody says it won't be mainstream, it can still go up on a screen, can't it? I heard from the start that `Pulp Fiction' wasn't mainstream enough.  ``I'll do the movies that I love,'' DeVito says firmly. ``That's what I dig.''  That could mean big movies or small movies, as his instincts dictate.  DeVito frowns at the word ``small.''  ``I don't like that word,'' the diminutive mogul says. ``Everything is big in its own way.'' c.1996 Cindy Pearlman  (Cindy Pearlman is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.)

(She also has information on how to subscribe to PageUp, a weekly package of eight intriguing articles with color art.) Includes a color slide of Bob Costas against an Olympics-logo backdrop. By ALEXANDER WOHL c.1996 A&AMP;E Monthly (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  When the flame is extinguished at the close of this year's Olympic games, a good many people will experience not disappointment but relief. More than 100 hours of televised pole-vaulting, table tennis, synchronized swimming and so on can dampen anyone's enthusiasm.  But even as Americans begin to tire of this quadrennial sports epic, it's a safe bet that they won't turn against Bob Costas, the omnipresent and charismatic anchor of NBC's coverage of the Olympic games.  It's Costas' second time around as ``Anchor to the World,'' as Newsweek labeled him four years ago when he anchored the Barcelona games. This time, the sportscaster is less awestruck by the event and his assignment but still keenly aware of the power and impact that comes with his position.  He understands that even in a post-Cold War world, the Olympics involve more than athletics. Business, international politics and the specter of terrorism are all part of the picture.  ``The Olympics transcends sports,'' Costas says in the same crisp-yet-comforting voice he uses on the air. ``It is one of the few sporting events that draws about a 50-50 male-female audience.''  When he was in college and would tell people that he wanted to be a sports announcer, he recalls, ``Women especially would say, `You mean like Jim McKay?''' _ ABC's longtime anchor for the Olympics.  Today they might say ``You mean like Bob Costas?'' because the 44-year-old sportscaster has moved far beyond the traditional sports audience he reaches through the Olympics, his work as host of NBC's pro-basketball coverage or his position as lead play-by-play announcer for major-league baseball.  Instead, Costas has diversified his interests to include a number of nonsports endeavors. The most prominent was ``Later ... With Bob Costas,'' his 1989-1994 late-night interview show in which he talked with guests ranging from Elie Wiesel to Woody Allen.  Costas also does regular reports and interviews for several NBC news-magazine shows, including ``Dateline NBC.'' He appears frequently on ``Nightline,'' ``Meet the Press'' and ``Charlie Rose,'' and occasionally fills in as a substitute host for Bryant Gumbel on ``The Today Show.''  He also pops up occasionally on David Letterman's late-night show, participating in stunts such as ``calling'' elevator races.  Many people are surprised that a sportscaster can branch so ably into other disciplines, but Costas isn't.  ``The best sportscasters can report extemporaneously as well as the top 1 percent of all newscasters,'' he says. ``The subject matter may not be as weighty, but they have what it takes _ the innate ability to observe, to report, to craft words and phrases to fit into certain snippets of time, to be at ease in front of the camera, to decide instantly what's important and what isn't.''  Costas' reverence for his profession dates from his childhood on Long Island in New York. As a boy, he regularly attended New York Yankees games. When not at the stadium, he followed the team on the radio.  By the age of 8, he had learned to love baseball, in part because of the close relationship it helped him forge with his father. He also came to cherish what he calls ``the romance of the airwaves.''  Listening to great play-by-play announcers such as Red Barber, Mel Allen and Ernie Harwell, Costas realized these men ``weren't just dispensing information _ they were weaving stories and creating a certain mood and sensibility of their own. They had a relationship with their listeners.''  When it became clear that he was not going to be the next Mickey Mantle, Costas shifted his focus to sportscasting.  But he never merely aped his idols. There are echoes of Allen and Barber in his style, but he also brings a winning combination of humility and humor, along with disarming candor and a blend of youthful impertinence and respect. This is a guy who actually begins sentences with the word ``Gee.''  Humor in the broadcasting booth must be handled carefully, Costas says.  ``I try not to make a big deal out of the humor,'' he explains, ``because then you're almost saying to the audience, stop paying attention to this while I do this shtick.  ``I never do it to where what I'm doing is competing with the action or the information that people need.''  That same self-effacing quality is to be found in Costas' personal life, despite his having achieved stardom. He continues to live in St. Louis, commuting regularly to New York, because he believes it is the best lifestyle for him, his wife and their two children.  Costas hasn't escaped his share of criticism, of course. Some observers have accused him of lacking an edge, of being unwilling to take sides or criticize anyone.  To be sure, Costas isn't noted for the frantic tirades that characterize some sports broadcasters, but he feels that his reputation for avoiding controversy is a bad rap.  ``I won't say something just for the sake of being provocative,'' he says. ``There is a difference between being provocative and being thoughtful. And being thoughtful does not mean being equivocating or timid.''  On a number of recent issues concerning baseball _ the player strike, divisional realignment and the addition of wild-card teams to the playoffs _ Costas spoke out frequently, clearly, forcefully and usually on the traditionalist side.  ``I don't pretend to take a sharp edge on subjects where I don't have a strong opinion,'' he says. He contrasts himself in this regard with other broadcasters, such as the highly opinionated Howard Cosell.  Costas calls Cosell's impact ``overrated.'' He acknowledges some of Cosell's contributions, including his strong pro-civil-rights stand, but argues that Cosell ultimately was most interested in calling attention to himself.  Costas believes that some of Cosell's contemporaries in the broadcasting booth _ McKay, Vin Scully and Al Michaels, for instance _ are better models of what sports coverage can and should be: ``forceful in a thoughtful way.''  Surely Costas has achieved that goal in his own work, which begs another question: Having reached the peak of his profession, able to do virtually everything he wants to do, where does he go next?  It has been 16 years since Costas was labeled the ``boy wonder'' of TV sports when NBC selected him, at only 27, to do play-by-play for its national telecasts of football and basketball. By 1983, the 30-year-old was doing baseball's ``Game of the Week'' telecasts. Today, he is at the top, and can apparently stay there as long as he wants to. He is already booked to do the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia.  Costas shows no sign of losing interest in sports. And, since NBC, as he puts it, has all the good sports properties, he may simply slow down and concentrate more on sports alone, he says.  He has been mentioned as a permanent replacement for Gumbel, who is leaving ``The Today Show'' this year, but Costas is emphatic in denying those rumors.  ``NBC knows that I am not in any sense a candidate to host that show,'' he says flatly.  The general perception that sports is too small a field to retain his attention is untrue, Costas says.  ``I've never been one who feels that sports broadcasting is a lesser calling,'' he says. ``I would be happy to cover sports 100 percent of the time if I could cover it the way I'd like to cover it.''  Still, there are other challenges out there, and he readily admits that he does ``have broadcasting interests outside of sports.''  So it seems that, like the world-class athletes he covers, Costas will continue to push himself, testing his own limits and those of his job.  One would expect no less from the ``anchor to the world.''  (Alexander Wohl is a Washington, D.C.-based free-lance writer.)

By ALLISON SERRELL c.1996 McCall's (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate.)  Bargaining at boutiques and department stores, or with your doctor or landlord, is typically considered taboo _ that is, until you discover how well it works. THE SAVVY SHOPPER'S SECRET: THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A NO-BARGAIN ZONE  While you may have thought haggling worked only at places such as flea markets and used-car dealerships, things have changed. Desperate to keep sales up and inventory moving along, even high-end merchants are frequently willing to grant 25 percent to 40 percent discounts.  You have absolutely nothing to lose by asking a store manager if she can ``do just a little better'' on a price or match a competitor's cost.  And don't draw your bargaining boundaries at retail shops, either.  ``Anything that is created by man is negotiable, from a heart transplant to a severance package,'' says Stephen Pollan, co-author of ``The Total Negotiator'' (Avon, 1994).  What does that mean for a consumer seeking a discount?  ``By negotiating, you'll find that you can often reduce the price of goods and services by 10 to 15 percent,'' Pollan contends.  Case in point: Most apartment dwellers wouldn't think of bargaining on their rent, especially not after they'd already signed a lease and moved in. But Ian Todreas, a consultant formerly based in Washington, D.C., managed to do just that after he spotted a sign advertising a comparable apartment in his building for significantly less money.  ``I saw no reason why I should be paying more, so I approached my landlady,'' he explains. ``When she asked me what I proposed, I bid low so that when we eventually reached a compromise, I was happy.'' GETTING RIGHT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM-LINE BARGAINING BASICS  Haggling really can work, but you must hone your technique. First, learn as much as you can about the product or service you're interested in buying, particularly what it sells for elsewhere.  ``By doing so, you're leveling the playing field,'' Pollan explains. ``The salesperson already knows all about his products, including their strong points and flaws, and their true value.  ``Show the shopkeeper that you've taken the time to learn about his merchandise too and he'll both treat you with respect and take your proposals more seriously.''  If you're gathering estimates on repair fees for a broken item, be sure to also investigate the cost of replacing it altogether _ and use that information to bargain for a lower repair bill.  A second winning way to encourage a merchant to give you a markdown is to offer to pay in cold, hard cash. Small, independent stores are particularly likely to give their customers a cash discount, Pollan explains, because that frees the owner from having to pay a credit-card fee.  This smart technique has worked numerous times for Michelle Diliberto of New York City, who recently negotiated a whopping 30 percent discount on her wedding band. She got a similarly impressive price concession from a housepainter she hired when she offered to hand over cash _ instead of plastic or a check _ after the job was finished.  Another persuasive tactic is to assure the seller that you'll continue to patronize him in the future, and perhaps even refer new customers if he meets your needs right now.  When Diliberto, who works as a producer at an online service based in Manhattan, needed a parking-garage space for her car last year, she comparison shopped diligently. After one garage manager quoted her a rate of $300 a month, Diliberto said she'd continue to look around.  A few days later, the manager called back and offered to lower the price to $250. Thinking she might do even better, Diliberto explained that she owned two vehicles she needed spaces for and mentioned that she was one of more than 500 employees of a new company in the neighborhood.  While the manager mulled over this information, Diliberto added, ``If you give me a good rate, I'll tell my coworkers about you.''  The chance to rent not one but two spots immediately _ and the prospect of gaining dozens of new customers _ was just too good for the manager to resist. He dropped the price to only $225 per car.  When a merchant can't see her way to giving you the discount you want, sometimes a little creativity is called for. If, for example, you're haggling over the price of a big-ticket item and the talk stalls, offer to buy the floor model.  Pollan tried it once while shopping for a refrigerator.  ``Sure, the unit had a small scuff on one side, but I covered it over with a bit of liquid whitener,'' he says _ and pocketed a savings of several hundred dollars.  Even doctors can sometimes be persuaded to grant discounts. Eric Lee, a community planner in New York City, was making twice-weekly visits to a kidney specialist last year, initially at a cost of $140 per visit. Lee compared the fee with his insurance coverage and realized he was spending a fortune making up the difference.  When he explained to the doctor that he couldn't afford the regular fee because his medical insurance reimbursed him for only $89 a visit, the practitioner lowered the price so Lee would be covered.  One final thought: If no specific bargaining tactic comes to mind, simply ask the seller for his help. Politely explain that you want to purchase the product from him but you didn't expect it to cost so much.  Who knows? Once the seller understands that you really want to make a deal, he may be willing to extend a better offer. Now that's a happy ending. -0- SIDEBAR: TIPS FOR HESITANT HAGGLERS  ``Simple fear prevents most people from bargaining,'' says Stephen Pollan, co-author of ``The Total Negotiator'' (Avon, 1994). Don't let jitters keep you from making a really great deal! Just follow this anxiety-reducing advice.  _ Negotiate up from the dealer's cost rather than down from the sticker price. The markup on small appliances is generally about 30 percent; larger appliances, such as refrigerators, are marked up about 15 percent. Most articles of clothing are priced at twice the store's cost.  If you don't know the markup on an item, aim for a discount of 15 percent off the price tag. This tactic is especially effective when dealing with contractors, painters and repairmen.  _ Talk directly to the person in charge. Don't waste your time haggling with a clerk if only the store manager or owner is authorized to make price adjustments.  _ Remember: Flattery works wonders. A retailer is almost always willing to accept a lower profit, but seldom at the expense of his pride.  Making a comment such as ``I've enjoyed shopping at your store for years'' before you begin to bargain can help smooth the way to bigger savings. A smile or a friendly tone of voice can be equally effective.  _ Steer clear of peak store hours.  ``The best time to strike a bargain is after lunch, when shopkeepers are relaxed and more likely to listen to your offer,'' Pollan recommends.  Never try to negotiate with a retailer on a busy Saturday afternoon.

After making a splash in his first role, as a boy in 1986's ``Stand By Me,'' O'Connell is on a roll now, starring in the Fox-TV series ``Sliders'' and co-starring in Tom Cruise's next movie, ``Jerry Maguire.'' O'Connell talks with New York-based free-lance writer Ian Spelling about his new movie, about the legacy of a child star who's outgrown his stardom and about a memorable ``Joe's Apartment'' scene in which he puts a spoonful of roaches into his mouth.

By FLETCHER ROBERTS From The New York Times  For six years, the late-night program ``ABC in Concert'' has quietly made itself one of the most influential forces on the pop-music scene. Stars from Frank Sinatra to Bruce Springsteen have appeared on the Friday-night show, as well as many of today's hottest new acts. Executive producer David Saltz talks with New York Times writer Fletcher Roberts about the series, its place on the pop-music scene and what has helped a very-late-night show draw 1.4 million viewers per week, three times more than an entire day's worth of MTV audiences.

It's not like that in Texas, she recalls, where fans are more focused on football's Dallas Cowboys than they are on the Rangers.

"71613"	"she"	"recalls"	" Writing for ``Thirtysomething,'' says Winnie Holzman, who went on to create the television show ``My So-Called Life,'' was the opposite of imagining ``what some mythical audience in some mythical city, based on poll results, wants.''

"75609"	"he"	"recalls"	" Devastated, Cardinal left school and ``headed as far south as I could get,'' to Mexico, where he discovered Art Nouveau and Spanish baroque. (To this day, he feels drawn to the ``more emotional, sensual style'' of Antonio Gaudi, Frank Lloyd Wright and the late work of Le Corbusier.) He eventually wound up in Austin, Tex., taking a job as a draftsman with a classical, Beaux-Arts-oriented architectural office. There, he recalls, ``all the work was done with ink on linen, with quill pens.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199610.gz"
"77098"	"he"	"recalls"	" A few days earlier, he recalls, he was the guest on a radio call-in show in Chicago. Only afterward, on the drive to the airport, did it hit him that he had misunderstood the last caller, answering a question she had not asked. For a few minutes, he felt very low. But then he relaxed, consoling himself that he had responded well to the other callers, a good enough ratio, he decided. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199611.gz"
"79967"	"she"	"recalls"	" But America had come to her much earlier _ in the shape of rock-and-roll.

"80791"	"she"	"recalls"	" Glendon occupies her own turf, and it's as if political and social thinkers at times do not know what to make of her. For openings on the federal bench, she's drawn interest from both parties. But she's never exactly been a neat fit. During the Carter administration, her interview went well, she recalls, but ``the most probable reason I did not get a federal judgeship was my pro-life view.'' During the Bush administration, the antiabortion view worked in her favor, but her more expansive view of construing the Constitution likely did not fit the Bush party line. ``There were all these questions that, for this particular Justice Department, mine were the wrong answers,'' says Glendon. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"

"82473"	"he"	"recalls"	" He married the former Barbara Haak in those years. (She is now a lawyer in Nyack, N.Y., where the Canes live; they have two grown children.) The newly married Canes moved to Henniker, N.H., where he taught math at New England College. It was so isolated, he recalls, that the high point of the day would be television shows like ``The Brady Bunch'' and ``The Odd Couple.'' Realizing that he ``wasn't cut out to be a country boy,'' he decided to ``go study with a great man.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"
"82474"	"he"	"recalls"	" Earlier researchers had discerned much about El Nino, but no one had yet put all the pieces together in a computer model simulating its workings. He and Zebiak, then a graduate student, succeeded in reproducing the self-sustaining oscillations in ocean temperature characteristic of El Nino. His interest in using the model to predict the comings and goings of El Nino was piqued by the phenomenon's appearance in 1982-83, the most destructive of the 20th century. At a scientific meeting in the fall of 1982, he recalls, an eminent researcher got up and ``said there is no El Nino and there will be no El Nino, and many experts agreed _ and we were essentially well into the biggest El Nino of the century.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199612.gz"

"82610"	"he"	"recalls"	" ``Cronkite Remembers'' offers many such reminders that he was a reporter before he became an anchorman.

"84097"	"she"	"recalls"	" ``Ellsworth Kelly, Robert Indiana and Jack Youngerman were there,'' she recalls. ``I had an old sailmaker's loft with two skylights. The building looked out on the river and was so old that it was against the law to live in it. I had to put in my own plumbing, and it was cold in the winter. I could see daylight at the end of the beams under my roof.'' The streets were crowded during the day, she recalls, ``but after 5:30, it was silent.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

"85571"	"he"	"recalls"	" So he did. It happened, he recalls, on a Friday night in October, two weeks before the election. He'd been commuting to Cambridge on weekends ever since his family had returned home after spending the first two years in Washington.

"89312"	"he"	"recalls"	" One executive, Gary Stern, director of market monitoring for Southern California Edison, wanted the agency to stop what he suspected were market abuses by power generators.

"92223"	"he"	"recalls"	" Access to ``high art,'' or maybe just a singular moving moment at the Cliburn, continues to motivate Rodzinski. Like the time, he recalls, a blind competitor in the amateur Cliburn competition performed Debussy's ``Clair de lune.'' This artist who had never even ``seen'' moonlight still managed to evoke its limpid beauty with her playing. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"
"92308"	"she"	"recalls"	" She has always been independent minded. At 14, she changed her name to Sigourney, after a character in ``The Great Gatsby,'' because she liked its ring. In her counterculture undergraduate years at Stanford, where she majored in English, she recalls, it felt only natural to wear an elf costume. And she briefly lived in a treehouse with a boyfriend. ``How can you explain the spirit of those days?'' she asks. ``There was a great merriment in the air.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"

"92525"	"she"	"recalls"	" The story, which Sheila narrates, begins as a soft-focus romantic idyll. When she married Sean Cloney (Liam Cunningham), a Catholic, in 1949, she recalls, they had three wedding ceremonies: one civil, one Protestant and one Catholic. For their marriage to be accepted by the Roman Catholic Church, they had to sign a pledge to send their children to Catholic schools. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"
"93113"	"he"	"recalls"	" At The Washington Post, where Carl Bernstein was covering the Virginia Legislature, the events of June 1971, he recalls, ``emboldened management. Having made the tough decision on the Pentagon Papers, not to do the right thing on Watergate would have been unthinkable.'' Bernstein, along with Bob Woodward, who joined the Post later that year, uncovered in 1972 Nixon's ``plumbers,'' one of whose lesser grotesqueries was the Watergate burglary. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"94677"	"he"	"recalls"	" In his 1997 autobiography, ``Bloomberg by Bloomberg,'' Bloomberg traces his belief in good works to his father, William, a bookkeeper at a dairy in Medford, Mass. Once a year, he recalls, his father ritually read aloud to his family the names of contributors to his favorite charities. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200106.gz"
"95966"	"he"	"recalls"	" Wiener credits his determination to prove that official wrong and return one day to kill him as being a key to his survival. Six years later, he recalls, he returned triumphantly to confront the same man. Hate had kept him alive. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200108.gz"
"96852"	"he"	"recalls"	" Wearing shorts and loafers, with one leg slung over the arm of a burgundy leather chair, Greene, 54, chain-smoked Marlboro Ultra-Lites, then Carltons, between gulps of Dunkin' Donuts coffee. He grew up in the Old Colony housing development in the time, he recalls, when it was heaven for kids. Greene may have a Boston College doctorate, but he still thinks of himself as a blue-collar guy, pleased with the incongruity of his history and his profession, and delighted when colleagues call him an ``undercover psychologist.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"
"98774"	"he"	"recalls"	" He had 2,000 loaves of bread in his truck, he recalls, and suddenly he didn't care. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"

"98811"	"he"	"recalls"	" Tim Sherman spotted the photograph near the end of his first day of digging, on the Friday after that Tuesday. The time of day, he recalls, was ``after dark.'' He had been on the move since dawn. A gang from his job at the Middlesex Water Co. had come to New York to help, with strong backs and water main know-how and willing spirits. In a way, there was nothing to do. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"100271"	"he"	"recalls"	" To get away, Naipaul studied relentlessly to qualify for a scholarship  to Oxford. The day he learned he'd won, he recalls, ``was a day of  blinding happiness.'' He spent four years there, earning a degree in  English, and meeting his first wife, Patricia Hale. (She died in 1996.  Later that year, he married Nadira Khannum Alvi, a Pakistani journalist.  Naipaul has no children.) After Oxford, he moved to London and did  freelance work for the BBC. His first novel, ``The Mystic Masseur,''  appeared in 1957. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"100422"	"he"	"recalls"	" As an ambitious young man growing up in Atlanta, he recalls, he wrestled with the choice of becoming a lawyer or a preacher. Ultimately, he explained, ``only half kidding,'' that he had ``discovered sin . . . and liked it.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"101343"	"he"	"recalls"	" Thirty-eight planes were told to land immediately, and for a couple of hours King barely had time to call his wife and say he would be bringing strangers home for the night. At some point, he recalls, he also registered a fleeting image of an Air France Boeing 747 ``bigger than the airport terminal.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"

"107676"	"he"	"recalls"	" Tom Douglas, the chef and owner of the Dahlia Lounge in Seattle, learned the hard way. He was busy cleaning the kitchen one night when one of his prize $1,000 fish-shaped lamps disappeared from the dining room.

It was only after the room cleared that they noticed the papier-mache and bamboo lamp on that table was gone. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"108869"	"he"	"recalls"	" When he wrote ``Braveheart,'' Randall Wallace, who directed ``We Were Soldiers,'' told a very different war story.

"110836"	"she"	"recalls"	" You may mist your houseplants, but wetting the leaves of outdoor plants serves no purpose, unless you are applying soapy water to smother aphids. When Sue Rushford of Sudbury gardened in London, she recalls, ``we'd use bath water. We'd tip it out with buckets and run downstairs. The soap killed aphids.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"114394"	"she"	"recalls"	" With her art career taking off, her academic career took a stumble. In 1985, Michigan decided not to give Piper tenure, stunning her peers. One colleague, she recalls, wondered, ``How could this have happened?'' The answer, she and her colleague believed, was that the university's philosophy department simply wasn't ready to provide a tenured home to a black woman. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"115023"	"he"	"recalls"	" It was during the Gulf War and the oil markets were, he recalls, ``going crazy. The guy offered me $45,000 if I'd quit school and start immediately.

At one point during a break, she recalls, a white lawyer on the other side said he needed a shoe shine, and his colleagues concurred. An elderly black man was brought in, in front of the opposing side, to tend to their needs.

"117163"	"she"	"recalls"	" Anne M. Mulcahy did some radical things on Memorial Day weekend. She saw her son Kevin in a track meet. She had a facial. She invited friends over for dinner. In between, she recalls, she ``just hung out.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"120147"	"she"	"recalls"	" Early in the show, Cho, who grew up in San Francisco's Tenderloin, claims to have learned everything she knows about sex from gay men. In high school, she recalls, her two best friends were drag queens who used to put on impromptu sex shows involving a novel use of ice cream cones before stunned patrons at a local Haagen-Dazs. Both friends have since died of AIDS, and today she still imagines them looking down from above like sassy, clucking guardian angels as she tries to teach sexual etiquette to her clueless and often resentful boyfriends. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"
"120572"	"he"	"recalls"	" It was a time of transition _ President-to-be Jimmy Carter was governor and segregationist restaurateur Lester Maddox was lieutenant governor.

"121866"	"she"	"recalls"	" She and Varnedoe, who are childless, married five years before he joined the Modern in 1988, a curator's hurrah, but difficult, she recalls, on the marital dynamics: ``For better or worse, there isn't a lot of overlap between artists who do works for public places and artists featured in museums, but whenever I was in an exhibition, it was always suspect.'' Varnedoe, after a recurrence of colon cancer, left the Modern this year. Zimmerman cries when she talks about him: ``What's keeping him alive is chemotherapy,'' she says. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"

"130934"	"she"	"recalls"	" The inventiveness of this piece, along with Edmier's comfort with self-exposure, appealed to Fawcett. While posing for her own portrait, she recalls, she fidgeted self-consciously; Edmier, by contrast, was a natural model: ``He went into some Zen-like place,'' Fawcett said. This is evident in the photographs that Fawcett and Edmier selected for ``Recasting Pygmalion,'' a book from Rizzoli that commemorates their partnership. Fawcett poses in a demure slip; Edmier parades around as if he's just out of the shower. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"

"133455"	"he"	"recalls"	" ``One of the things that has been wonderful for me, as an on-the-scene reporter, has been meeting these wonderful characters,'' he says. There was the police chief in Bolton, he recalls, who would come out as Coleman was wrapping up a day's painting ``with a great big glass of bourbon and a cigar, and we'd sit, sipping whiskey and smoking cigars, telling stories.'' There was another policeman, too, a sergeant who stopped to ask Coleman why he was sitting by the side of the road. He watched the painter at his easel for a while, then shook his head. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"133579"	"he"	"recalls"	" There was just one time, he recalls, when The Streak nearly snapped. In 1987, his son graduated from college in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., a 10-hour drive from Sugarloaf.

"133726"	"he"	"recalls"	" As they worked together, he recalls, ``it just sounded so right to both of us. It just seemed to fall together.'' It helps that Cook has never been in better voice, and that her interpretations of ``Happiness'' and ``Loving You'' (both from ``Passion''), ``Losing My Mind'' (from ``Follies''), ``Not a Day Goes By'' (from ``Merrily We Roll Along'') and numerous others are revelatory and heart-piercing. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"135180"	"she"	"recalls"	" Even Edwards' mother, Bobbie, has been stunned by the speedy ascension of the son she still calls Johnny.

That's all I could say.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"135332"	"he"	"recalls"	" Clooney's directing ``Confessions'' is the result of luck, circumstance and desperation. He read the script _ by screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, who later was nominated for an Oscar for ``Being John Malkovich'' _ six years ago, he recalls, then watched as it kicked around between such directors as David Fincher and Curtis Hanson, with Johnny Depp and Mike Myers attached to it at different times. The film would have died on the vine if Clooney and his partner, director Steven Soderbergh, hadn't stepped in as producers. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"135697"	"he"	"recalls"	" Phelan, a guard, played briefly for the NBA's Philadelphia Warriors after his discharge from the Marines. A 1951 graduate of La Salle University in Philadelphia, he was an assistant coach at his alma mater when it won the 1954 national title, which led to his hiring at Mount St. Mary's. Phelan rejected a three-year offer because he didn't expect to be there that long since he and his wife, Dottie, were both city people. At the time, he recalls, ``Emmitsburg had a population of about 1,200, including horses and cows.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"138219"	"she"	"recalls"	" With few young American men on the rise, and no standout among the Europeans, tennis fans are wondering where the next charismatic rivalry will come from. Pam Shriver, a Hall of Fame player on the women's side, predicts that men's tennis is in for a drought. Yet the same was true, she recalls, in the late 1980s, when Borg had retired and Connors and McEnroe had begun to run out of gas.

"140519"	"he"	"recalls"	" As Ronald Reagan and the Republicans convened in 1980, the contest was close, but From had a sinking sensation. With so much trouble on Carter's watch, he recalls, the incumbent's best hope was to keep Reagan from crossing the acceptability threshold. Although the race stayed tight until the final debate, Reagan's reassuring performance finally carried him over that hurdle. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200407.gz"
"142780"	"she"	"recalls"	" In 1980, the family returned to Italy for a visit and Maria reclaimed some of the family bread starter. Brought back to Oakland in her purse, this still-viable leavening launches Maria's superb homemade loaves. As a young woman, she recalls, she and her neighbors shared a starter. Each housewife made her weekly bread on a different day, so the starter would pass from one household to the next, getting refreshed along the way. If you had to take it to your neighbor's at night, you were supposed to carry the picture of a saint for protection. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"142827"	"she"	"recalls"	" We meet everyone from the Marx Brothers, with whom she co-starred in her best-known film, A Night at the Opera, to a number of the great American songwriters, including George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, Kurt Weill, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. Hart's stories are affectionate without being gushy or hyperbolic. Some of the spicier ones involve Gershwin, who, she recalls, pursued women by dedicating the same little waltz to all his dates, with a space left blank in the lyrics, to be filled by the name of the lady of the moment. When Gershwin traveled to France to study with Maurice Ravel, Ravel asked him how much he earned writing for Broadway. When Gershwin replied that it was about a thousand dollars a week, Ravel rejoined, I should be studying with you. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"

"143222"	"he"	"recalls"	" Prison is a very polite society, he explained. It's always, 'Excuse me, please pass the salt.' You don't want to offend anyone, because a simple offense can mean your death. During one of his first jobs after prison, as a bartender, he recalls, someone would say to me, 'Hey you!' I would say, 'Who me?' They'd say, 'Yeah you, get me a Bud.' I would start toward the guy, 'Don't hey-you me,' and I'd have to say to myself, 'Whoa, whoa, Rick!'  </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"
"144644"	"she"	"recalls"	" Ben Gazzara wanted to marry her, she recalls, but she threw him over because she was enamored of Rock Hudson. And, she says with hands on hips in the most understated of manners, we all know what a bum decision that turned out to be. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"

"145535"	"he"	"recalls"	" There was the time, he recalls, that a couple was turned down from buying an apartment at his prime Fifth Avenue address because they wore off-the-rack clothing. For some people, said Grodin, the actor and author, the power attached to serving on a board of often angry men and women goes to their head. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"
"147791"	"she"	"recalls"	" During her freshman year, as Fiora seeks to understand her new culture, she recalls, I was exhausted all the time by both my vigilance and my wish to be inconspicuous. At soccer practice, I worried that I would miss the ball, when we boarded the bus fo games at other schools, I worried that I would take a seat by someone who didn't want to sit next to me, in class I worried I would say a wrong or foolish thing -- I always worried someone would notice me, and then when no one did, I felt lonely. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"147909"	"she"	"recalls"	" He cooked at home for the sheer enjoyment of it, enriching his family's African American culinary heritage with global ideas. Saturday nights, she recalls, generally meant tacos or enchiladas, and at least once a month the large Anderson family sat down to tempura or Chinese dishes, what, back then, we called Oriental food. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200501.gz"
"149008"	"he"	"recalls"	" Uhtred recalls that he had been a Dane while Ragnar lived ... but Ragnar was dead and I had no other friends among the Danes. I had no friends among the English for that matter.

"149254"	"he"	"recalls"	" He says there are obvious trends in Oscarology that favor historical epics, the A-list productions and movies that have literary cachet. Like everyone else in the Oscar derby, he has ridden his share of both thoroughbreds and nags. He was on the jury when Training Day had its world premiere at the 2001 Venice International Film Festival, and Denzel Washington's performance blew him away. He started touting it for an Oscar immediately, even though, he recalls, people said, 'You're crazy,' because Denzel always plays heroic roles. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200502.gz"
"151349"	"he"	"recalls"	" In the opening story, Shades, the narrator remembers the thick heat of the August day when he saw his father for the first time. He was 14 but had known since age 10 about the passionless man who left with the rumble of the trains on the same morning he conceived his son. When his mother tells him the story, he recalls, I knew that I would never feel like I was ten for the rest of that year. It's a simple observation, but one wrought with the particular pain of a boy wrenched from his childhood by a shrill truth about the hard ways of some men. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"152078"	"she"	"recalls"	" Asked why they were so scarce, she recalls, dealers would say to me, 'I just can't sell women artists as well as males,' or 'I can't sell them for enough.' And sometimes these would be women saying that. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200504.gz"
"154865"	"she"	"recalls"	" Even so, Rehnquist was a 29-year-old lawyer and World War II veteran by the time he settled in Arizona. O'Connor's character, by contrast, was shaped from birth on a cattle ranch located in the high desert. Her very first memory, she recalls, was the vast silence surrounding her family's Lazy B Ranch. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"155517"	"she"	"recalls"	" If opportunity is the American dream, then race is the American dilemma. Something as simple as a family outing to buy a refrigerator can yield a perceived racial slight. While Morgan watched the boys, Mendez-Morgan approached sales clerks. In two stores, she recalls, she was steered to the least expensive model. When they size you up, what do they think they see? she asks. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"157742"	"she"	"recalls"	" About a week before the storm, she recalls, she had had a dream. She was in a room full of debris, and she kept trying to clean it up. But she could never finish. She thinks this was Katrina. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200509.gz"
"158350"	"she"	"recalls"	" Finally, deputies came out and arrested her. They were very nice. One of them, she recalls, was a handsome young cop. She had to surrender her jewelry, her possessions, her shoes, her eyeglasses. She was searched, fingerprinted, photographed and put in a holding cell by herself. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
"158513"	"he"	"recalls"	" Land graduated from Princeton magna cum laude before entering the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary, where he ministered out of the storefront church in the French Quarter. The runaways he encountered typically had no place else to go, he recalls, and faced sexual or physical abuse if they returned home, so Land's church became a refuge. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
"158782"	"she"	"recalls"	" While working part-time at a Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore, she recalls, she tried once more to apply, but her wages --less than $10,000 a year -- were too high for her to qualify. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
"160604"	"she"	"recalls"	" No, for Emily Chew, then an 18-year-old freshman at Simmons College, it was the solemn way in which the drugs were distributed. The tiny tabs of acid were passed about, she recalls, in a silver cigarette case. And for each guest who took one, another person stepped forward to be a sober companion, a sort of designated driver for the trip ahead. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"161137"	"she"	"recalls"	" However, these passages were not without some bumps. In the 1970s, it still required a bit of daring to plunge into an interracial relationship. When she and Henry first began dating in 1978, Claudette says, I didn't tell anybody for a long time. She got some flak from some black men who sharply questioned her decision to date Henry, suggesting, she recalls, that I should be dating them. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"161552"	"he"	"recalls"	" By Cheng's admission, he wasn't a particularly good business student. But the scientist in him prevailed, and he switched to engineering. He didn't shine academically, but he did achieve in unexpected areas. This scion of a well-to-do Hong Kong business family decided to educate himself in true American fashion. In one summer, he recalls, I canned beets, sold encyclopedias and washed dishes. I wanted to experience the hardest jobs. I was there to learn the most difficult selling job. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"162082"	"she"	"recalls"	" There were the trips organized just for assistants, including one to California to visit a new chain of hotels where they would be booking reservations for their bosses. There was the time she won a company drawing for seats behind the dugout at a Houston Astros baseball game in a stadium then known as Enron Field. And, she recalls, there were the American Express gift cards that were handed out frequently to those who answered a trivia question. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200601.gz"
"165364"	"she"	"recalls"	" De Laurentiis' memories of Easter also include giant Perugina chocolate eggs that her grandfather had custom-made and filled with prizes, including money. They were hidden, and the children had to search for them, she recalls, and the hunt remains a family tradition to this day (but they now buy ready-made giant Perugina eggs). </P> "	"nyt_eng_200604.gz"
"166225"	"he"	"recalls"	" It could have been worse. One reject, he recalls, was the Cod Card. Hong Kong, he notes, has the Octopus card and London has the Oyster card.

"167365"	"he"	"recalls"	" When the study ended, he recalls, he went back to heroin and was jailed repeatedly for drug offenses until he began taking buprenorphine again recently.

"167928"	"he"	"recalls"	" Meanwhile, immigrant restaurateur Rocky Aoki found the opposite tack was the way to make actual Japanese fare palatable to the general public. His first Benihana, opened in 1964 in New York, foundered when the menu of griddle-cooked dishes hewed to tradition. So he learned to replace typical Japanese understatement with spectacle - think onion volcano - and delicate portions with plates heaped so high, he recalls, you couldn't see the edge of a dish. This is what Americans like. This is value. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"

"173571"	"he"	"recalls"	" It was 1985, when Troupe got the assignment for Spin, and he went to Davis' brownstone, he recalls, my little tape recorder in my hand. The meeting got off to a shaky start when Davis asked, How'd you get your hair like that? and proceeded to play with one of Troupe's dreadlocks. The writer slapped away his hand. I told him I was there to conduct an interview, not to have my own personal space invaded, he said. And Miles, well, he looked pretty shocked. Davis went on to spew some colorful language before calming down and asking what Troupe wanted to know. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"174563"	"she"	"recalls"	" There was a visitor, she recalls, who was on a diet involving pureed zucchini, and then she'd see what everybody else was having and decide she wanted that, and you wouldn't believe you'd been to all that trouble fixing the zucchini, Hotchner said. Another guest explained that her No. 1 poison food group was dairy, which of course meant no ricotta, no mozzarella, no Parmesan cheese. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
