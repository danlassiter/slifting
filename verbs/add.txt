"16498"	"they"	"add"	" A decade ago, many jumped on the high-tech bandwagon, believing that finding the right machine was the key to a cure. Machines are still there in their offices -- fancy ones like the isokinetic dynamometer that looks like a dentist's chair and lets therapists treat patients at different speeds, and everyday ones like a treadmill -- but they're often idle. Therapists say they care about building strength only if it helps build function, and that patients too often used machines as a crutch, avoiding the rigorous requirements of rehab; the bottom line, they add, is getting people back to activities they need and want to do. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199503.gz"

Accusations soon flew that the new paper would ``suck dollars'' out of Berlin, and James was openly furious that the Sun tried to hire away one of his employees.

At midnight Feb. 6, the start of the Chinese New Year of 4695, the ox will dominate the heavens and direct mortals' fate until Jan. 27, 1998, when the tiger takes over. One of the best places to celebrate is in San Francisco, where more than 200,000 Asian-Americans make their homes. Asian oracles evaluate the Year of the Ox as a period of productivity., They also add that those, such as I, born under the sign of the ox (the years of '25, '37, '49, '61, '73 and '85), are trustworthy, strong-willed introverts. However, they add, ox-types are known to carry long grudges.

"91077"	"they"	"add"	" Former employees and analysts have a very different explanation for the company's effort to focus Wall Street on its ``new business model.'' After years of inflating revenue and profits, Computer Associates has finally run out of accounting tricks, they say. Now, they add, it hopes to persuade analysts to ignore its standard accounting results while it unravels the mess it has created. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200104.gz"

"92018"	"they"	"add"	" So complex that nearly every industry spokesman repeats this widely accepted assertion: Today's cars have more computers than there were on the Apollo 11 spacecraft that took humans to the moon.

With a $19 billion down payment to oversee the development of the next generation of combat fighter jets _ in a project expected to total more than $200 billion in the next three decades _ Burbage has become one of the most important executives to watch among military suppliers today.

And yet during the last decade, much of the art has made its way out of Afghanistan to North America, Western Europe and, in particular, Japan. By Celestine Bohlen.  (ART ADV: Photos NYT9,10 are being sent to NYT photo clients.)  AUCTION-ANXIETY (New York) _ The important fine art auctions are to get under way on Monday, followed three days later by the start of the much-publicized trial of Sotheby's former chairman who was indicted last year along with his counterpart at Christie's on charges of illegally colluding to fix commission fees charged to thousands of customers. The anxiety levels at Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips are running high, as experts have been comparing these sales to those during other troubled times, particularly the early 1990s when the real estate market nose-dived and the art world froze.

Ackerman, a poet and author of 18 books, talks plenty about squirrels and deer and hummingbird feeders in ``Cultivating Delight: A Natural History of My Garden,'' just published by HarperCollins.

Most state preservation laws apply only to buildings that are at least 50 years old, which means thousands of postwar buildings are now becoming eligible. But most are in styles that don't yet have a name. Buildings under consideration this year included a house referred to as Hidden Valley Ranch and a post office with a thin-concrete roof in the shape of a whimple, which elicited variants on ``Flying Nun.''

"99547"	"they"	"add"	" Average 30-year mortgage rates fell to about 6.5 percent at the beginning of this week, from a high of 8.7 percent last year. The Treasury Department's announcement on Wednesday that it would stop selling 30-year bonds should create additional demand for long-term bonds and send the interest rates on these issues lower, pushing down the long-term rates on home loans, if only slightly, economists said. Rates will probably remain low for at least the next few months, they add, because of the continued weakness of the global economy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"100218"	"they"	"add"	" Teachers who use the books in their classrooms said the stories involve well-developed characters and a universal theme of good versus evil that students relate to easily. And, they add, the books have piqued students' interest in reading, with many completing a novel for the first time in their lives. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"100748"	"they"	"add"	" Because of these assumptions, the researchers say, the estimate of odds is only just that, an estimate. But it's clear, they add, that the risk is lower than previously believed. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"101233"	"they"	"add"	" Not to mention, they add, the ``Chronicles of Narnia'' by the Christian writer C.S. Lewis and the ``Lord of the Rings'' series _ which will be out as a film in December _ which was heavily influenced by author J.R.R. Tolkien's Catholic faith. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"

"101648"	"they"	"add"	" Many say King's work ethic and drive haven't changed much through the years, but, they add, he has become more spiritually and emotionally grounded. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"101690"	"they"	"add"	" The California lawyers will oppose the settlement in court next Tuesday. They say that the deal is cleverly altruistic, but that its main beneficiary would be Microsoft. The cost would be tiny compared with Microsoft's potential liability, they contend. And the nearly unlimited donations of Microsoft software to eligible schools, they add, would serve to create an even larger market in the future for the company's products because students would be introduced to computing by using Microsoft products, like Windows, Word and Excel. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"101707"	"they"	"add"	" External sources of electromagnetic energy are known to interfere with existing radio systems, they say. They also point to long-debated but still unresolved questions about their effect on human health. The physical presence of large structures near a sensitive wildlife habitat, they add, would create hazards for migratory birds and artificial hunting opportunities for predatory fowl. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"

"103139"	"they"	"add"	" Tyson officials insist that the company has been falsely portrayed by activists and that it has been working to improve plant conditions and environmental compliance. If anything, they add, the cascade of government accusations disproves the notion that the company wields enormous political influence _ a part of Tyson's image since its backing of Sen. J. William Fulbright of Arkansas in the 1950s and '60s. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"104956"	"they"	"add"	" Fiorina and the rest of the Hewlett-Packard board say that the merger is a way to consolidate the PC operations of both companies, saving money and becoming more efficient. By combining with Compaq, they add, Hewlett-Packard can become a full-service supplier of hardware, software and services to large corporate customers _ more along the lines of IBM. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"105338"	"they"	"add"	" That diverted attention, they add, apparently prevents people from using the body's time machine, its natural rhythms, to fight illness and achieve maximum health. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"108531"	"they"	"add"	" One of the unavoidable truths after Sept. 11, they add, is that the attacks did, in fact, succeed in forcing the United States and Saudi Arabia to question _ with unparalleled intensity _ the terms of their partnership. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"109057"	"they"	"add"	" These days, Gamba's bed is one of five lined up behind a curtain in a short-term basement shelter a few blocks from Times Square. At Project Renewal, the nonprofit agency that runs the shelter under contract to the city, staff members say that to do better, he needs an identity. Without it, they add, he could end up in a category the city is now trying hard to shrink: about 1,200 men and women dubbed ``long-term shelter-stayers'' because they have occupied shelter beds for more than 730 days in the last four years. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"109763"	"they"	"add"	" Some education experts say they worry, however, that as more students seek special accommodations, the whole notion of standardized testing may break down. What is a diploma worth, they add, if students who cannot read, write or do arithmetic are allowed to pass academic tests? </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"111345"	"they"	"add"	" But energy analysts note that oil prices remain far below their 2000 peak of more than $38 a barrel. The current rise, they add, doesn't yet threaten the economic recovery. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"111639"	"they"	"add"	" When executives fail to live up to their predictions, the cases are less clear-cut than those in which companies rewrite their financial history, corporate governance experts say. Even so, misplaced optimism can be troubling, they add, particularly when that optimism leads directly to a large executive payday. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"114400"	"they"	"add"	" In addition, the administration has proposed cutting $28.3 million from the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health budget, reducing it to $258.3 million. NIOSH, Democrats point out, is the only health research agency that focuses on worker health and safety. Yet, they add, the administration is seeking major budget increases for homeland security aimed at protecting the public from bioterrorist attacks. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"114510"	"they"	"add"	" Should Israel formally annex the West Bank and Gaza, as some Israelis have demanded, they add, the country would remain a Jewish state only by denying voting and other rights to its Palestinians residents. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"116183"	"they"	"add"	" For one thing, the scientists say, the find suggests that the Olmecs, who flourished on the southern Gulf Coast of Mexico, exerted wide influence in the Guatemalan highlands as well. All told, they add, the Guatemalan lode was worked for millenniums, compared with centuries for the Burmese one. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"117150"	"they"	"add"	" Critics point out that international humanitarian law calls for maintaining a clear distinction between military personnel and noncombatants in war-torn nations. Past efforts to bring civilians into the Colombian war, they add, led to the formation of abusive paramilitary groups. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"119206"	"they"	"add"	" The reasons go beyond the weak economy. Perhaps for the first time since the invention of the computer, technology is outpacing customers' needs, industry executives say. The equipment of today, they add, can generally handle most of what software users throw at it, meaning that companies will not replace equipment as often _ a trend that they say will outlast the current economic sluggishness. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"120234"	"they"	"add"	" Besides, they add, it's not their duty to be immigration agents. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"
"120374"	"they"	"add"	" Supporters of imposing strict holding periods say they align executives' pay with their company's performance. Executives' annual salary and bonus, which typically equal a few million dollars, are big enough to keep them comfortable, the investors say. Stock grants, they add, should make the executives lavishly wealthy only if their companies are successful over the long run. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"
"120468"	"they"	"add"	" Prosecutors say that Sankus helped steal millions of dollars' worth of intellectual property. And despite the guilty pleas from him and others, they add, the stealing continues because of the nature of the distribution medium. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"
"121454"	"they"	"add"	" But others argue that creativity, artistry and improvisation have always been integral at Rucker Park. And league play, they add, was never free from outside interference. There has been high-stakes gambling on games, under-the-table payments to players and team sponsorship by drug dealers, for whom winning was a matter of much pride. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"

"122230"	"they"	"add"	" Bush, they add, is not at his best when talking about the economy. Sometimes he has made odd off-the-cuff remarks, such as suggesting that Americans might look for stock bargains when the Dow is down. Sometimes he has been seen as cheerleading in the face of bad economic news. At other times his threats to throw corporate criminals in jail have seemed to agitate rather than quiet investors. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"

"122872"	"they"	"add"	" Another barrier, they add, is the enormous growth of population and consumption. Although global population appears headed for a 50 percent increase in the next 50 years, for example, demand for food will likely double, as prosperity raises the per capita consumption of calories. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"

"124516"	"they"	"add"	" Although age discrimination is illegal in the workplace, career experts say older workers may fall victim to some type of it: Companies may favor hiring younger workers who are starting out or at the peaks of their careers. Employers, they add, may also be wary of investing in workers whose primary reason for returning to work is financial. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"124663"	"they"	"add"	" Opponents say commercial databases have been known to be error-prone. It's dangerous, they add, to use information gathered for marketing purposes to make decisions about individual rights. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"125903"	"they"	"add"	" ``We read that airplanes can fly through the reinforced, steel-lined 1.5-meter-thick concrete walls surrounding a nuclear reactor, and inevitably cause a meltdown resulting in `tens of thousands of deaths' and `make a huge area uninhabitable for centuries,' to quote some recent stories,'' the article says. But, they add, ``no airplane, regardless of size, can fly through such a wall.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"126076"	"they"	"add"	" Torricelli's supporters acknowledge that he brought his problems on himself. But, they add, it is important for Democrats not to lose sight of what is at stake in the November election: continued Democratic control of the Senate. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"

"127119"	"they"	"add"	" This time, some Queens connoisseurs say, the talk may actually come true. But if it does, they add, it will have less to do with available loft space (which is limited) than with clusters of cultural institutions, some new to the sprawling borough, which are now busily feeding off each other and off a fast-growing, ethnically diverse population. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"128189"	"they"	"add"	" With one exception, Batlogg, it turned out, did not witness any of the disputed experiments, and he did not directly analyze the original data. Colleagues say that is unusual for Batlogg. In fact, they add, he is known for uncovering overlooked nuggets. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"
"128549"	"they"	"add"	" Renovation experts suggest that homeowners leave a 5 to 10 percent cushion for unexpected expenses. In some cases, they add, homeowners may also need to factor in the cost of temporarily renting an apartment or staying in a hotel, plus expenses for meals. Some contractors may provide portable mini-kitchen units that can be set up in a dining room or on a porch. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200210.gz"

"131321"	"they"	"add"	" The authors point out that the definition of the ideal body changes with time and culture. When resources were scarce, they add, ``a full figure was stylish because it indicated the ability to eat well'' and suggested ``probable health and fertility.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"132355"	"they"	"add"	" Economists on the left and the right say Feldstein selects the bureau's researchers without regard to their politics. If he has a weakness, they add, it is for economists at elite universities. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"
"132616"	"they"	"add"	" No major damage from enemy fire is visible on the sides of its hull, the American explorers said. That fact alone, they add, suggests that the Bismarck was in fact scuttled _ as German survivors have claimed all along, saying that their naval tradition was to deliberately sink ships in danger of falling into enemy hands. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200212.gz"
"136312"	"they"	"add"	" Tolstaya's forte, viewers say, is her humor, but sometimes, they add, her wit takes on a caustic, contemptuous edge _ as when she makes her now-well-known observations about American life _ from the culture of political correctness to the stubborn recalcitrance of underprepared college students. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"136619"	"they"	"add"	" Analysts say that AOL Time Warner also must resolve federal investigations of America Online's accounting practices to regain investors' faith. And management, they add, still must try to find the synergies that Case and Levin imagined when they struck the merger three years ago _ a task that requires the hard work of making Time Warner's notorious fiefdoms collaborate among themselves, and with the managers running America Online. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"
"137258"	"they"	"add"	" Industry observers think most airlines can survive a short conflict. But even under a relatively rosy scenario, they add, carriers will again have to cut jobs and capacity.

"137926"	"they"	"add"	" Recent research, they add, says that fetal cells from past pregnancies can survive in the bloodstreams for more than 20 years and may promote an immune responselaje the rejection of a transplanted organ, perhaps causing diseases like scleroderma, a skin-hardening disorder, and multiple sclerosis. </P> 	nyt_eng_200306.gz

, he added,	 Monday, coalition administrators announced there was a basis for objections. Several weeks of investigation produced a ``large amount of evidence,'' some from witnesses, suggesting Mun'im was ``misusing his political office,'' the coalition spokesman said. The arrest, he added, sends a strong message to regional leaders all over Iraq that they will be held accountable for their actions: ``The civil administrator, Ambassador (L. Paul) Bremer, was particularly distressed that this official was misusing his public office. However, it's worth emphasizing that this is the first time really in Iraq that individual citizens have been able to bring forth these kinds of allegations to the attention of the authorities.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200306.gz

Last year Blumenthal's palm-size silver beaded evening bag got star billing on one of the highest rated episodes of ``Sex and the City,'' a show in which Sarah Jessica Parker's character, Carrie, parts ways with Aidan, her ever-solicitous boyfriend. ``Before that show, I had no credibility,'' Blumenthal recalled.

Insufficient US troops on the ground, inadequate real-time intelligence, and a reliance on local Afghan warlords are what those officials believe allowed bin Laden to flee. Those same deficiencies and flawed strategies persist as the hunt continues, they add, particularly in the provinces that straddle the border. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"172624"	"they"	"add"	" Even some merger critics said they're not holding out hope that the FCC will make the company sign off on stringent new net neutrality guarantees. More realistic to expect, they add, are conditions that would offer consumers low-cost broadband and protect rivals that sell to business customers inside the merged AT&amp;T-BellSouth's territory. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"

"172962"	"they"	"add"	" Bush, they add, sees himself as a national clarifier, someone who regards dividing the electorate as an acceptable avenue to a consequential presidency, one that would make the country's policies and institutions more conservative than they had been for generations. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"172976"	"they"	"add"	" On top of everything, they add, is another, undeniable incentive to stay, come what may: There is nowhere else to move in Manhattan. Where else could a bunch of galleries go and find the kinds of lower rents that galleries found when they left SoHo for Chelsea? asked Stuart Siegel, a real estate brokerage executive who represents the Chelsea Arts Tower.

The proposal would lengthen the roughly 45-mile long shipping lanes by about 4 miles, probably adding 15 minutes each way to the trip in and out of Boston.
