Jerry Jones -- The Hound in the Fox deal of a season ago -- doesn't know why, either. But he still has a lingering concern about that non-interference call.

Sure, there was the water problem. (Seventy-seven people were in the inn when the water stopped flowing at 4:30 one afternoon, just as skiers were taking to the shower.) And the tables set up in the kitchen were a bit awkward. But the inn had a rugged feel. There was Yankee pot roast on the menu, not the roast pork tenderloin.

DECOY OWL DEPLOYED IN CRACKDOWN ON PIGEONS IN TIMES SQUARE  NEW YORK _ With a 25-pound stone owl, summons books and lots of dis _ as in disrespect and disdain _ New York City opened a new offensive Thursday against an old foe: the pigeon.  At the outset of Operation Stool Pigeon, as the campaign was called by the Department of Sanitation, the objective of the land-based forces was to reclaim Times Square from the squadrons of birds that have defaced signs and sidewalks with their droppings, and to interdict their supply lines by warning pigeon feeders to cease and desist or face fines as high as $250.  The Sanitation Department instructed its enforcement officers to focus on areas favored by the pigeons and their fanciers _ 42nd Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue and the medians between Broadway and Seventh Avenue from 43rd to 46th Streets.  The Times Square Business Improvement District, which joined in the effort, deployed its faux owl _ real owls being pigeon predators _ in a planter between 45th and 46th Streets on Broadway, to convince the birds that they could get mugged in Times Square.  Giving the history behind Operation Stool Pigeon, Lucian Chalfen, a spokesman for the Department of Sanitation, said:  ``Basically, the overall complaint was that there seems to have been a proliferation of pigeons in the general Times Square area directly attributable to the fact that there are people feeding these birds. And I guess it gets around in bird circles. A nominal problem all around the city and in many cities exacerbated itself in that area.''  Christine Sheppard, curator of birds at the Bronx Zoo, said that when birds that normally go exploring for food find a good source, they have no reason to look elsewhere: ``The number of animals that come to this party continues to increase, and nobody leaves.''  Dr. Sheppard held out scant hope for the efficacy of the stone owl. ``Hilarious,'' she said. ``These birds are not stupid. In order to survive in the wild, pigeons have to be aware of predators. Any bird that sits still for 24, 48, 96 hours they know is not dangerous.''  _NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE  BILL'S WORLD  By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star  Mickey Mantle's prognosis is described as excellent. Another home run would be nice, but we bet he'd settle for a home walk.  Forecasters expect several major hurricanes this season. This will be disappointing to folks hoping to keep the high winds, damage and all-wet people confined to Washington.  ``We are on the verge of having a 40-year low in the minimum wage,'' Mr. Clinton says. And who knows which office-holder after 1996 will be forced to get a job paying that?  ``Everybody wants to cut Medicaid to shreds,'' the president says. Not so. Some folks want to cut it to smaller pieces than shreds.  The man at the next desk says you know it's a bad day when you fax an e-mail to someone's voice mail but it gets detoured through the copier and into the shredder.  Newt Gingrich is going to do a cross-country tour to sell his new book, ``To Renew America.'' A cross country. That pretty well describes the U.S. now.  Any day now we expect to see an official ballot that lists the candidates' names followed by a Universal Price Code for each.  A new survey shows coin collectors would like to see Ronald Reagan's face on a proposed new dollar coin. Because they admire his mettle?  ``The mining law of 1872 needs to be modernized,'' says Mr. Clinton. Though he failed to suggest who should get the shaft.  ``Farming,'' Mr. Clinton says, ``has become more and more capital-intensive.'' It's one more way farming resembles life.  IS THERE INTELLIGENT LIFE ELSEWHERE IN THE COSMOS? DON'T BET ON IT (Bonus NYLite column) By BILL TAMMEUS  Admit it. When you look into the night sky (assuming you can see anything past the urban light pollution and this spring's incessant clouds), don't you wonder if there are other people on other planets?  Naturally you do. It's simple curiosity. Besides, it takes your mind off the O.J. Simpson trial, Bosnia, the Michigan Militia and the start any day now of the pro football season.  Of course, our collective hope that we're not alone in the universe is tempered by a fear that aliens from other planets may be no better than we are _ may, in fact, be waiting for a dark night to mug Earth and steal her purse.  Despite such fears, our insatiable drive to learn whether we're alone in the universe is causing space scientists to ask Congress for money to conduct a search for other planets in the galaxy.  Well, it's either that or NASA's insatiable drive to survive as a government agency at a time when Congress is sharpening its budget axes. (I stole that axes cliche directly from the last 3,739 wire stories about Congress and the budget. So sue me.)  Anyway, NASA's idea, as I get it, is to check out some of the Milky Way's 100 billion or so stars with various telescopes to see if there are some that might have solar systems. If they find some, they would send unpersoned spacecraft to the area to see if there really were planets.  The proof of planetary life elsewhere, I suppose, would be getting one of these space probes back stamped ``Return to Sender.''  NASA, as you may know, is not the only group interested in finding other life out in the universe.  Scientists from the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., (SETI, pronounced SETI, stands for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) recently set up a computerized listening system in Australia to pick up sounds of other life. SETI has been in existence for more than 30 years. So, in fact, have I, but let it go.  And amateur groups all over the world have been collecting data and rumors on UFOs and on aliens who may or may not have visited Earth, may or may not have borrowed some of us for experimental purposes and may or may not be waiting on us in fast-food franchises.  I frankly don't know why we're so fascinated by the possibility of life elsewhere. My guess is we wouldn't be if we were happy with the life forms around us.  But we look out our windows and see lumpy people and skinny people and people with earrings in their navels. And we say to ourselves, ``Is this the best we can do?'' Then we look in the mirror and say the same thing.  Which causes us to wander out into the night, stare at the sky and imagine beautiful people with strikingly high intelligence living on some distant planet _ people who never cut their nails in public, who never order the wrong wine with dinner, who always manage to balance their checkbooks.  But my guess is that if NASA convinces Congress to fund its search for life and if we eventually find other people, we're going to be disappointed.  What, after all, ever matches our dreams? Well, I mean besides the time I dreamed I was drowning and woke up with my head sticking out of a tent in the rain.  Probably the people we find, if any, will want to lend us money at exorbitant rates. Or sell us second-quality cars at first-quality prices. Or borrow our mowers and not return them. Shoot, for people like that we can limit our search to a couple of ZIP Codes I could name but won't. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950609.0355 type=story > <HEADLINE> MOYNIHAN AIDE COMES UNDER FIRE FOR COMMUTING, HIRING PRACTICES </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WASHINGTON (BC-MOYNIHAN-AIDE-HNS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

DECOY OWL DEPLOYED IN CRACKDOWN ON PIGEONS IN TIMES SQUARE  NEW YORK _ With a 25-pound stone owl, summons books and lots of dis _ as in disrespect and disdain _ New York City opened a new offensive Thursday against an old foe: the pigeon.  At the outset of Operation Stool Pigeon, as the campaign was called by the Department of Sanitation, the objective of the land-based forces was to reclaim Times Square from the squadrons of birds that have defaced signs and sidewalks with their droppings, and to interdict their supply lines by warning pigeon feeders to cease and desist or face fines as high as $250.  The Sanitation Department instructed its enforcement officers to focus on areas favored by the pigeons and their fanciers _ 42nd Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue and the medians between Broadway and Seventh Avenue from 43rd to 46th Streets.  The Times Square Business Improvement District, which joined in the effort, deployed its faux owl _ real owls being pigeon predators _ in a planter between 45th and 46th Streets on Broadway, to convince the birds that they could get mugged in Times Square.  Giving the history behind Operation Stool Pigeon, Lucian Chalfen, a spokesman for the Department of Sanitation, said:  ``Basically, the overall complaint was that there seems to have been a proliferation of pigeons in the general Times Square area directly attributable to the fact that there are people feeding these birds. And I guess it gets around in bird circles. A nominal problem all around the city and in many cities exacerbated itself in that area.''  Christine Sheppard, curator of birds at the Bronx Zoo, said that when birds that normally go exploring for food find a good source, they have no reason to look elsewhere: ``The number of animals that come to this party continues to increase, and nobody leaves.''  Dr. Sheppard held out scant hope for the efficacy of the stone owl. ``Hilarious,'' she said. ``These birds are not stupid. In order to survive in the wild, pigeons have to be aware of predators. Any bird that sits still for 24, 48, 96 hours they know is not dangerous.''  _NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE  BILL'S WORLD  By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star  Mickey Mantle's prognosis is described as excellent. Another home run would be nice, but we bet he'd settle for a home walk.  Forecasters expect several major hurricanes this season. This will be disappointing to folks hoping to keep the high winds, damage and all-wet people confined to Washington.  ``We are on the verge of having a 40-year low in the minimum wage,'' Mr. Clinton says. And who knows which office-holder after 1996 will be forced to get a job paying that?  ``Everybody wants to cut Medicaid to shreds,'' the president says. Not so. Some folks want to cut it to smaller pieces than shreds.  The man at the next desk says you know it's a bad day when you fax an e-mail to someone's voice mail but it gets detoured through the copier and into the shredder.  Newt Gingrich is going to do a cross-country tour to sell his new book, ``To Renew America.'' A cross country. That pretty well describes the U.S. now.  Any day now we expect to see an official ballot that lists the candidates' names followed by a Universal Price Code for each.

DECOY OWL DEPLOYED IN CRACKDOWN ON PIGEONS IN TIMES SQUARE  NEW YORK _ With a 25-pound stone owl, summons books and lots of dis _ as in disrespect and disdain _ New York City opened a new offensive Thursday against an old foe: the pigeon.  At the outset of Operation Stool Pigeon, as the campaign was called by the Department of Sanitation, the objective of the land-based forces was to reclaim Times Square from the squadrons of birds that have defaced signs and sidewalks with their droppings, and to interdict their supply lines by warning pigeon feeders to cease and desist or face fines as high as $250.  The Sanitation Department instructed its enforcement officers to focus on areas favored by the pigeons and their fanciers _ 42nd Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue and the medians between Broadway and Seventh Avenue from 43rd to 46th Streets.  The Times Square Business Improvement District, which joined in the effort, deployed its faux owl _ real owls being pigeon predators _ in a planter between 45th and 46th Streets on Broadway, to convince the birds that they could get mugged in Times Square.  Giving the history behind Operation Stool Pigeon, Lucian Chalfen, a spokesman for the Department of Sanitation, said:  ``Basically, the overall complaint was that there seems to have been a proliferation of pigeons in the general Times Square area directly attributable to the fact that there are people feeding these birds. And I guess it gets around in bird circles. A nominal problem all around the city and in many cities exacerbated itself in that area.''

(I stole that axes cliche directly from the last 3,739 wire stories about Congress and the budget. So sue me.)  Anyway, NASA's idea, as I get it, is to check out some of the Milky Way's 100 billion or so stars with various telescopes to see if there are some that might have solar systems. If they find some, they would send unpersoned spacecraft to the area to see if there really were planets.  The proof of planetary life elsewhere, I suppose, would be getting one of these space probes back stamped ``Return to Sender.''  NASA, as you may know, is not the only group interested in finding other life out in the universe.  Scientists from the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., (SETI, pronounced SETI, stands for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) recently set up a computerized listening system in Australia to pick up sounds of other life. SETI has been in existence for more than 30 years. So, in fact, have I, but let it go.  And amateur groups all over the world have been collecting data and rumors on UFOs and on aliens who may or may not have visited Earth, may or may not have borrowed some of us for experimental purposes and may or may not be waiting on us in fast-food franchises.  I frankly don't know why we're so fascinated by the possibility of life elsewhere. My guess is we wouldn't be if we were happy with the life forms around us.  But we look out our windows and see lumpy people and skinny people and people with earrings in their navels. And we say to ourselves, ``Is this the best we can do?'' Then we look in the mirror and say the same thing.  Which causes us to wander out into the night, stare at the sky and imagine beautiful people with strikingly high intelligence living on some distant planet _ people who never cut their nails in public, who never order the wrong wine with dinner, who always manage to balance their checkbooks.  But my guess is that if NASA convinces Congress to fund its search for life and if we eventually find other people, we're going to be disappointed.  What, after all, ever matches our dreams? Well, I mean besides the time I dreamed I was drowning and woke up with my head sticking out of a tent in the rain.  Probably the people we find, if any, will want to lend us money at exorbitant rates. Or sell us second-quality cars at first-quality prices. Or borrow our mowers and not return them. Shoot, for people like that we can limit our search to a couple of ZIP Codes I could name but won't. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950610.0163 type=story > <HEADLINE> COMMENTARY: GOP GANGSTA RAP </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-RICH-COLUMN-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

Du Pont, former presidential candidate, had asserted that the Republican Political Action Committee, which he founded and over which Gingrich presided until last May, represents the ``small businessman on Main Street America.''  ``Isn't this a little ironic for you,'' Talbot asked, ``since you come from one of the oldest and most prosperous American families?''  ``Well, it's, I suppose, ironic,'' answered du Pont. ``I do come from a family that has been here for almost 200 years. But after all, my ancestors started a very dangerous gunpowder business in 1802, and my great grandfather and his father were both killed in gunpowder explosions. So, there were some entrepreneurial du Ponts that are a little different from the heads of corporations today.''  P.S. A Gingrich angle that was edited (for time) from the ``Frontline'' profile: Kit Gingrich, Newty's talkative mother _ she's the one who whispered to Connie Chung her son's opinion of Hillary Clinton _ was equally unshy when she talked of her son and his first wife, Jackie.  ``I am sorry that they divorced,'' she said. ``I really am. Because she did without a lot of things to help Newty. She tutored him, she took care of the children. They managed apartments in Atlanta. And she didn't have nice furniture ...  ``But we often wonder if she would have lost some weight if it would have helped. She was quite heavy.''  BEST AND WORST IN THE WORLD?

Susan Molinari, R-N.Y., played a cleaning woman; Barney Frank, D-Mass., played a hoodlum; Dick Armey, R-Texas, played a corrupt sheriff.  _ Cokie Roberts played the fiance of reporter Hildy Johnson.  _ Labor Secretary Robert Reich played the death row escapee hidden in a desk; Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala played a compulsively neat reporter; NAACP President Kweisi Mfume played her pal.  _ Despite past professional differences, Senator Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., as a messenger, and NPR's Nina Totenberg, as a prostitute, sang ``A Fine Romance'' to each other.  When the show was over, Donaldson said, ``I haven't had this much fun since Watergate!''  HOW THE SHRINKS STAND UP IN COURT  In its 1995 session, the New Mexico legislature pondered and passed a bill that set limits on the testimony of psychologists in court. Senate bill 459, written by Richard Romero, included the following language, quoted in the newsletter Dispatches:  ``When a psychologist or psychiatrist testifies during a defendant's competency hearing, the psychologist or psychiatrist shall wear a cone-shaped hat that is not less than two feet tall. The surface of the hat shall be imprinted with stars and lightning bolts.  ``Additionally, a psychologist or psychiatrist shall be required to don a white beard ... and shall punctuate crucial elements of his testimony by stabbing the air with a wand.'' Before the expert's testimony about competency, the bill specified, ``the bailiff shall contemporaneously dim the courtroom lights and administer two strikes to a Chinese gong.''  Although the Senate passed the bill by a voice vote, and the House voted 46 to 14 to make it official, New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson vetoed it. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960130.0516 type=story > <HEADLINE> JOHN KILLILEA: BASKETBALL WAS HIS LIFE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-BKO-RYAN-COLUMN-BOS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199601.gz"

"62925"	"I"	"suppose"	" It is, moreover, not true that Virginia's contemporary reasons for maintaining VMI are not explicitly recorded. It is hard to imagine a more authoritative source on this subject than the 1990 Report of the Virginia Commission on the University of the 21st Century to the Governor and General Assembly (1990 Report). As the parties stipulated, that report ``notes that the hallmarks of Virginia's educational policy are `diversity and autonomy.''' Stipulations of Fact, at 37, reprinted in Lodged Materials from the Record 64 (Lodged Materials). It said: ``The formal system of higher education in Virginia includes a great array of institutions: state-supported and independent, two-year and senior, research and highly specialized, traditionally black and single-sex.'' 1990 Report, quoted in relevant part at Lodged Materials 64-65 (emphasis added). (footnote 2) The Court's only response to this is repeated reliance on the Court of Appeals' assertion that ```the only explicit (statement) that we have found in the record in which the Commonwealth has expressed itself with respect to gender distinctions''' (namely, the statement in the 1990 Report that the Commonwealth's institutions must ``deal with faculty, staff, and students without regard to sex'') had nothing to do with the purpose of diversity. Ante, at 7, 21 (quoting 976 F. 2d, at 899). This proves, I suppose, that the Court of Appeals did not find a statement dealing with sex and diversity in the record; but the pertinent question (accepting the need for such a statement) is whether it was there. And the plain fact, which the Court does not deny, is that it was. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199606.gz"

OLY-BOXING-ART _ AUGUSTA, Ga. _ After a worrisome start that featured more bellyaching than body punching, the U.S. boxing team breaks camp here this morning and heads to Atlanta brimmimg with confidence and sounding like a cohesive unit. What remains to be seen is how tough they are.  OLY-ARCHERY _ ATLANTA _ Citing his failure to attend a crucial competition in Germany and a weeklong training camp in Atlanta, five of the six U.S. Olympic archers asked their coach to resign, team members said Thursday. Mike King of Grand Rapids, Mich., the U.S. coach, confirmed the request, but said he refused because of his commitment to the National Archery Association.  OLY-FLEE _ ATLANTA _ A second athlete is missing from his training camp at Reinhardt College, a Gambian runner who apparently has since been seen in Atlanta, a school spokeswoman said Thursday.  OLY-DUCKEK _ CONYERS, Ga. _ Hermann Duckek is a connoisseur of soil and sand. And he has spent the past month in Conyers stirring, sifting and directing tractors and workmen to create a scientifically engineered equestrian carpet of dirt. Duckek is the world's undisputed master of ``footing,'' the dirt surface on which horses perform. He has supervised the footing at every Olympic Games since 1976, except Los Angeles in 1984.  OLY-TWIGG-ART _ undated _ She started college at age 14. Now, at 33, she is preparing to start graduate school in the fall. In between, she won seven national cycling championships and six world titles. She became a computer programmer, and she found God. This is Rebecca Twigg. World-class athlete. Intellectual. Developing spiritual being. Complete person.  OLY-PROTEST _ undated _ Cyclist Clara Hughes will represent the Canadian Olympic team in the road race and individual time trial, but she may be remembered for an event in which she won't compete.  OLY-GWEN _ CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ Less than a month ago, Gwen Torrence was being widely billed as the lead female attraction at the Olympics in her hometown. Since then, she fell short of the Olympic squad in her favorite event, the 200 meters. Slowed by injury, she was nudged out by upstart Inger Miller for third place, the final qualifying spot. Her troubles weren't over. But she hasn't shed a tear.  OLY-DREAM-ART-2takes _ undated _ Comfortably ensconced in the pool room at the Dream Team's resort hotel in Scottsdale, Ariz., head coach Lenny Wilkens sat down with Cox News Service's Ailene Voisin for a question/answer session.  OLY-SAIL _ SAVANNAH, Ga. _ Andy Zawieja did what anyone might as Hurricane Bertha veered from the Olympic yachting venue Thursday. He shopped for a washer and dryer.  OLY-CYCLING _ undated _ Jeanne Golay has a recurring nightmare: The Olympic road race is tomorrow, and she's not ready. Suddenly, she wakes with a fright, gathers her thoughts and realizes her race isn't until July 21. Even as a dream, it is a fitting metaphor for U.S. Olympic cycling.  OLY-HANDBALL _ undated _ You won't find a team handball assembly line churning out players and stamping them with Made in the USA labels. So how does a country, where the market craves baseball, basketball and football, produce a top-of-the-line handball player? It exports.  OLY-WRESTLE _ CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. _ Gordy Morgan knows a thing or two about big things. He's from a big family, loves hunting big game, likes a big truck with big tires and is big-time humble. The humility comes easily when you're the 10th of 12 kids. You learn your place _ and you get the bed in the basement. And share it with your baby brother.  OLY-KAYAK _ DUCKTOWN, Tenn. _ It was one of those moments of true world friendship the Olympics is supposed to be all about. American whitewater kayaker Scott Shipley, a medal favorite, gave a $2,000 kayak to a Bosnian paddler who is just  lucky to be here after four years of war in his homeland.

OLY-HORSES _ ATLANTA _ Horse- drawn carriages, banned downtown during the Olympics for fear that horses and shoulder-to-shoulder crowds wouldn't mix, will be allowed to operate after all.  OLY-MEDIA-ART _ ATLANTA _ It was supposed to be an event of great dignity, but instead it looked like feeding time on a hog farm. IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch, on hand at the Olympic Village Thursday to raise the Olympic flag, was met by respectful groups of athletes _ and a messy, disrespectful horde of dozens of American and international journalists.  OLY-BUZZ _ ATLANTA _ Artist's nude stickers lack stamp of authority.  OLY-POLICE _ ATLANTA _ Atlanta Police arrested 36 people Thursday in a sweep of neighborhoods around the Atlanta University Center after Olympic security officers housed there repeatedly complained of harassment.  OLY-MORETORCH _ VALDOSTA, Ga. _ They waved from their farm trucks and tractors as they plowed through the morning mist in the South Georgia fields and furrows. They waited in the family car where driveway met highway along U.S. 319. On Ga . 32, one sat alone in a lawn chair with a lantern and an American flag at 5:15 a.m.  OLY-RADIO _ ATLANTA _ During Olympics, radio stations will fill air with contests, celebrity interviews.  OLY-REPORTER-ART _ ATLANTA _ Ed Hula is the king of Olympic radio in Atlanta, having made a cottage industry of the beat since 1988.  OLY-BRIEFS-ART _ ATLANTA _ More than a dozen individuals and agencies have called the mayor's office or The Atlanta Journal-Constitution to offer help to the 300 foreign journalists who paid more than $1.4 million to a woman for housing she failed to provide.  OLY-MEDIA-ART _ undated _ OLYMPIC CITY COLUMN  OLY-BRICK-ART _ ATLANTA _ When Jeff Speer decided to propose to girlfriend Joy Diamond, he bought a ring _ and a brick. But their engagement won't quite be complete until they see the proof in Centennial Olympic Park. After the park opens Saturday morning, the two will head to Section 77 and look for a light-colored brick engraved ``Joy Will You Marry Me?''  COKE-ART _ ATLANTA _ Suddenly, the city is awash in red. Coca-Cola red. Downtown, around town and along the MARTA line, the Atlanta-based soft drink giant has put up signs and set up vending kiosks and carts. You can't escape them. It's all part of a finely honed strategy to make sure consumers know that Coca-Cola Co. is the official Olympic soft drink sponsor _ and is spending more than any other corporate sponsor in the history of the Olympic Games.  Lifestyle, Entertainment  NELLY _ undated _ MOVIES: Young lady rekindles an older man's flame. (e)  KEY-WEST-ART-2takes _ KEY WEST, Fla. _ T-shirt shops have taken over Duval Street like pollution-fed algae spreading over a coral reef. Soon, a Hard Rock Cafe will be the ultimate insult on this 174-year-old community's main street. The cafe will sell hats, souvenirs _ and T-shirts. (t)  KEY-WEST-INNS-ART _ KEY WEST, Fla. _ A name like Paradise Inn promises a lot, especially when it's a new place trying to compete in a town famous for its historic inns. This, after all, is home to such legendary inns as La Terraza (affect ionately called La-Te-Da), which was once the home of Cuban poet and revolutionary Jose Marti, and the Marquesa, which has a AAA four-diamond rating. (t)  EVERGLADES _ FLAMINGO, Fla. _ Everglades National Park covers the southern end of the Florida peninsula, a 2,343-square-mile sweep of sawgrass plains, mangrove islands and subtropical hammocks. The third largest national park in the country _ only Denali in Alaska and Yellowstone in Wyoming are bigger _ is home to about 300 kinds of birds, almost 1,000 species of flowering plants, 65 kinds of reptiles, alligators and crocodiles, and 14 endangered species including the Florida panther, the leatherback turtle and the manatee.

WILKESBORO _ LOUDON, N.H. _ A bit of stock car racing's glory days faded Thursday when North Wilkesboro Speedway lost its two Winston Cup dates, effective next season. Those dates were assigned to the new Texas Motor Speedway near Fort Wo rth and to New Hampshire Speedway in Loudon, giving it two races on the 1997 schedule. (s)  NFL-HERSCHEL-WALKER _ undated _ Nearly seven years after he was the central player in the biggest trade in NFL history, Herschel Walker has come full circle in one of its greatest ironies.

PHOTOGRAPHER'S EX-WIFE SENTENCED FOR THEFT OF HIS WORK (bl) By MONTE WILLIAMS c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service  WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ The former wife of O. Winston Link, the 81-year-old photographer known for his black-and-white images of America's last railroad steam engines, was sentenced here Tuesday to 61/3 to 20 years in prison for stealing more than $1 million worth of his photographic prints.  Early last month, Conchita Link, 61, was found guilty of grand larceny in a case that captured the attention of the photography and art world. In contrast to the allegations of thievery and betrayal, Mr. Link's photographs captured the romance of the rails of the 1950s and America's erstwhile innocence.  The sentence imposed by Judge Daniel Angiolillo of Westchester County Court, considered harsh by law-enforcement officials, was not tough enough for Mr. Link. He read a long statement urging the court to give his ex-spouse the maximum sentence, 81/3 to 25 years. He said she would scream ``have a heart attack'' in hopes he would die and leave behind his valuable artwork.  ``In my 81 years,'' he said, ``I have never met nor heard of anyone more evil than her.''  Mrs. Link, who did not testify during the trial, said before sentencing that she was responsible for Mr. Link's fame because of her efforts to market his photos. She said she did not know the whereabouts of the prints, adding: ``Where would I go to sell these prints? I'm known in the art world.''  The judge admonished Mrs. Link: ``You took advantage of someone who trusted you. You took advantage of someone's age.''  In 1992, Mr. and Mrs. Link began lobbing charges of physical and psychological abuse at each other. At the trial here, gallery owners testified that Mrs. Link falsely led them to believe that her husband was suffering from Alzheimer's disease so that she could take over his business affairs.  Mrs. Link's lawyer, Darien J. Zoppo, did not call any witnesses or provide jurors with any clear version of events.  But in an earlier civil case that included a divorce, Mr. Link won damages of more than $5 million after Mrs. Link made several admissions that proved damaging in the criminal case.  For example, she admitted writing a letter asserting that she was the legal owner of all of Mr. Link's work after Mr. Link had formally notified her in 1992 that she would have no further input in his business affairs.  During the criminal trial, Mr. Link said he saw his ex-spouse packing what appeared to be boxes of the prints in her car. Although Mr. Link said he has negatives of the 1,400 missing prints of steam locomotives of the the Norfolk &AMP; Western Railway, estimated to be worth $1.6 million dollars, he said his ability to oversee the production of new prints may be impaired because of his age.  District Attorney Jeanine Pirro said her office would prosecute anyone caught selling or buying the missing prints. ``I caution anyone if they are approached about buying the prints: We will continue to prosecute this matter.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960820.0642 type=story > <HEADLINE> HIT THE LOTTERY, BUY A TOASTER: MUNDANE ADS REPLACE HYPE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> ALBANY, N.Y.

Times News Service  HIGH COURT HEARS CASE AGAINST U.S.-REQUIRED ADS  The Supreme Court, which has long agreed that businesses have a First Amendment right to advertise their products, heard the other side of the advertising coin: whether businesses may decline to take part in a Government-required ad program.  A group of handlers of California peaches, nectarines and plums sued, claiming a First Amendment right not to engage in Government-compelled speech, and refused to pay fees assessed by the Department of Agriculture to urge consumers, for example, to ``buy California peaches.'' The fees can run to a half million dollars for a big farm and total more than $10 million a year.  ECONOMY SHOWN GETTING STRONGER  Economic strength was shown by two measures _ in contrast to other recent data that showed a cooling economy. The National Association of Purchasing Management's index rose to 52.7, and construction spending rose 1.8 percent in October.  DOW UNCHANGED AS NASDAQ GAINS  Stock prices were mixed, with the Dow Jones industrial average unchanged at 6,521.70. It had an early slide of nearly 49 points after the strong economic news raised inflation fears, but bargain hunters drove stock prices back up. The Nasdaq index set its sixth straight record, rising 7.21 points, to 1,299.82, as computer-related issues gained.  Treasury prices fell, pushing the yield on the 30-year bond up to 6.36 percent.  VW IGNORES GM IN PROMOTION  Ignoring a General Motors ultimatum, Volkswagen has promoted a former GM executive who GM had demanded be dismissed in the legal dispute between the two companies. Volkswagen named Francisco Javier Garcia Sanz to take the seat on the company's managing board vacated by Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, left, the former G.M. executive who was forced to step down at VW last week.  MERRILL LYNCH NAMES PRESIDENT  Merrill Lynch selected Herbert M. Allison Jr. as president and chief operating officer, making him the likely eventual successor to David H. Komansky, who is to succeed Daniel P. Tully, as the company's head.  VORNADO'S LURE: $50 MILLION  Michael Fascitelli quit his lucrative partnership at Goldman, Sachs to become president of Vornado Realty Trust for a pay package worth at least $50 million.  JEEPS DRIVE CHRYSLER SALES UP  Chrysler sales rose 1.4 percent last month, in line with analysts' expectations, as the wildly popular sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks gained 7.3 percent, to 127,527. Car sales fell 10.6 percent, to 52,101.  USERS OVERWHELM ON-LINE SERVICE  Computer users eager to take advantage of America Online's new flat-rate pricing plan, which includes unlimited Internet access, overwhelmed the system, causing widespread busy signals across the nation.  GERMAN COMMENT BOLSTERS DOLLAR  The dollar surged to nearly two-year highs of 1.5536 German marks and 1.3220 Swiss francs. Signs of robust American economic growth helped it, as did comments by Hans Tietmeyer, Germany's central bank chief, who suggested that the dollar should rise further.

DRUMMOND AYRES JR. c.2001 New York Times News Service  For almost two years, most talk about the 2002 governor's race in Maryland has centered on Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend.  Townsend has been an active, high-profile No. 2, a good start for running for the No. 1 spot. She has been all over the state meeting and greeting and raising money to run. And as one of Robert F. Kennedy's daughters, she has the political lineage to run.  No big surprise, then, that with those credentials she has scared off the other major Democrats who would be governor _ except Mayor Martin O'Malley of Baltimore.  O'Malley, now almost halfway through his term, has not classified himself as a Democratic hopeful for governor. But he talks a lot about the job and the need for a ``real leader'' to fill it.  The broad assumption is that he thinks Kennedy is not that leader but that he could be _ or could be a major player in the effort to find that leader, increasing his and his city's political influence in Annapolis, the capital.  O'Malley has not directly attacked Townsend. Mostly he has left it to others to speak resentfully of how, because Republicans seldom do well in statewide races in heavily Democratic Maryland, she has been all but anointed as the next governor. But last week, pressed by The Baltimore Sun on where he stood on the race, O'Malley offered this:  ``I'm waiting to see some leadership from people who want to be governor, and so far I haven't see a whole lot of that. There are those that feel there's a big vacuum in this race. Any number of people could fill that vacuum, I suppose, including the one known candidate. But so far I think that most people would agree there is a pretty big vacuum.''  Neighborly Repartee Takes On an Edge  Minnesota and South Dakota share a border, and their governors, like good neighbors, talk to each other a lot. The exchanges have been mostly good-natured, but lately they have taken on an edge _ which was probably inevitable, given that few governors are more outspoken than Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, an independent, and William J. Janklow of South Dakota, a Republican.  It all began two weeks ago when Ventura, at a trade show in Canada, speculated that Janklow was not at the show because he was home ``cutting new ads'' to induce Minnesotans and Minnesota businesses to move to South Dakota.  Then, warming to his topic, Ventura added: ``I love his ads, and I love the points he makes. The bottom-line problem is you then have to live in Sioux Falls. If that element wasn't in there, you'd be home free.''  Sioux Falls, just west of Minnesota's southwest corner, has received laudatory livability reviews in recent years in several polls and business publications. Janklow immediately countered the governor, a former pro wrestler, with this smackdown: ``Whoever said that sounds like a jerk.''  Then last week, after a few days of quiet, Janklow went back on the offensive.  A Minnesota company had decided to expand _ but in South Dakota, he announced. He said he wanted Ventura to know ``how pleased we are that another company has seen that their future in Minnesota means an investment in the people of South Dakota.''  Ventura responded that the company would not stay long in South Dakota after it discovered how much higher Janklow taxes were than Ventura taxes.  Stay tuned.  Name Recognition Shapes Illinois Race  Election Day is still a year off for the 2002 Illinois governor's race. So how is it shaping up this early?  A new Chicago Tribune poll indicates that name recognition is about the biggest factor for Republican and Democratic candidates.  On the Democratic side, Roland W. Burris, a former state attorney general, holds a two-to-one lead over the four other hopefuls: Paul Vallas, the former head of Chicago public schools; Rep. Rod R. Blagojevich, from Chicago's North Side; Michael J. Bakalis, a former state comptroller; and Patrick Quinn, a former state treasurer. Ninety percent of poll respondents knew who Burris was, while no other candidates had name recognition above 75 percent.  Still, Burris has little reason to be content with his initial numbers. Four in 10 voters said they were undecided this far from the election. In two previous races for governor, name recognition also put Burris out front in early polls, but he finished second in both contests.  Among Republican hopefuls, the poll found Attorney General Jim Ryan, with almost 100 percent name recognition, leading better than three to one over the two other hopefuls, Lt. Gov. Corinne Wood and state Senator Patrick O'Malley from suburban Chicago. Their name recognition was around 80 percent. The undecided vote was almost 25 percent.  The poll had other good news for Ryan. It found he had strong support in both the moderate wing of the party, Wood's base, and the conservative wing, O'Malley's base.  No Democrat-Republican matchups were included in the survey. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20011103.0127 type=story > <HEADLINE> SPORTS COLUMN: OH, THOSE HATED YANKEES </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> NEW YORK (BC-BBO-LIPSYTE-COLUMN-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"

"101770"	"I"	"suppose"	" The one I fell for was lounging over the soft gray-green leaves of a Plectranthus argentatus. Its magenta petals were echoed by a nearby dahlia called Fascination, fascinating, I suppose, for its combination of deep and pale pink petals. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"

"103341"	"I"	"suppose"	" The second test involved running over a fruitcake with a 3,000-pound sport utility vehicle. This proved to be more effective, leaving a ``tire-marked, raisin-flecked smear on the asphalt,'' according to Gazette-Journal reporter Camille Hayes. This certainly comes as good news to people like me who thought SUVs were good for nothing except rolling over and sucking gasoline at the rate of a gallon a second, even when they are not turned on. I hope the makers of SUVs are made aware of this ground-, or rather fruitcake-, breaking study and incorporate it into future TV commercials. If you believe the commercials out now, most people buy SUVs for the purpose of having them set down by helicopter atop high, narrow peaks in the middle of the desert. This could be fun, I suppose, but I think many more Americans would be inclined to buy an SUV if they knew that it, alone among all the forces of nature, was capable of rendering fruitcake into a, and I quote, ``tire-marked, raisin-flecked smear on the asphalt.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"

"107565"	"I"	"suppose"	" Gregory Mcdonald was one of the great American writers of the 1970s and '80s, and Vintage Crime is launching a reprint series with ``Fletch'' ($12), first published in 1974, in which the sometime reporter spends a lot of down hours hanging out at the beach, misdirects the reader, flummoxes the police, and goes most satisfactorily undercover. Mcdonald's books were like potato chips, addictive and sufficiently forgettable that one can read them again now, a quarter-century later, and not remember where all this activity is going. This is regurgitation, I suppose, but never unpleasant, and I look forward to the rest of Fletch's oeuvre. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"108606"	"I"	"suppose"	" The generally estimable Ryan gives a performance that hits all the notes but doesn't feel particularly original or inspired; there isn't much in her overbearing Big Mama that hasn't been effected many, many times before. Particularly disappointing is her version of the bawdy ``Kitchen Man''; it's calculated in its physical and vocal subtlety, I suppose, but the brazen sexual innuendo of the lyrics is so underwrought in her actions that her costume does much of the work. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"109444"	"I"	"suppose"	" I am being grumpy partly, I suppose, because of the anguished e-mail messages from Holocaust survivors and their relatives who tell me how stunned they are that the Jewish Museum would present Tom Sachs (of the Prada death camp). Sachs, who said in an article in The New York Times Magazine on Sunday that he found the engineering of the death camps ``amazing,'' also said that he was using the iconography of the Holocaust to bring attention to fashion. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"109540"	"I"	"suppose"	" Laziness? Out of practice? Can't find a parish I like? Any of those will do as excuses, I suppose, but the reality is this: The church doesn't match what I feel in my heart. Or my head. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"110013"	"I"	"suppose"	" Although Vert (pronounced ``vair''), Wolfgang Puck's newest restaurant, isn't as green as its French name would suggest, there are enough greenish tones in the banquette upholstery, some of the artwork and the bar, I suppose, to support its appellation. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"

"111177"	"I"	"suppose"	" A variant on the first style, I suppose, is to offer quotations from authors this reader has never heard of and so can make no judgment about their taste or relevance. Bob Shacochis and Tom Paine (no, not that Tom Paine) like ``Desert Burial,'' by Brian Littlefair (Holt, $25), and so do I, so I am glad, with apologies to Messrs. Shacochis and Paine, that I didn't put the book aside with a ``Who he?'' or ``Who they?'' dismissal. I am not in awe, as one blurber is, and I don't think the book ``is a flamethrower of truth,'' whatever that is, as the second blurber does, but I do think it's pretty good. Set in northwest Africa in ``the near future,'' the book is about an American geologist who leads a convoy of refugees deep into the interior of Mali, just as an avaracious company, Timbuktu Earthwealth, is trying to use the same land to bury nuclear waste. A lot is going on in this book, most of it morally outrageous, and Littlefair, for whom this is a first novel, unfolds his story well. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"111867"	"I"	"suppose"	" ``One of the things that definitely was compelling to me was the aftereffects of a single death,'' Bogdanovich says of ``Cat's Meow.'' ``We've been so brutalized by events on the screen -- and, I suppose, in history also -- but there's been an awful lot of killing and violence on the screen in recent decades, much more than in other days. I think that has made people a little insensitive to death in the movies, and I thought it would be interesting to make a movie in which a single death would have extraordinary reverberations that would affect everybody. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"

"112183"	"I"	"suppose"	" It is natural, I suppose, that a great library should be a more important presence in the life of a writer than it is for those whose work does not involve constant contact with the written word.

"112809"	"I"	"suppose"	" The MacLiammoir (and now, I suppose, the Callow) form of storytelling theater is different: it is about the audience surrendering to its own imagination, which then in turn feeds back to the storyteller. The power of suggestion is all, and every audience will respond with its own and different mental pictures, creating a unique sense of possibility in the auditorium. In this form of theater, too, where different characters are assumed one after another without recourse to makeup or change of costume, there is an element of complicity in the art of acting that is unexpectedly exhilarating. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"

NY-AUSTRIAN-ARCHITECTURE (New York) _ In architecture, the history of ideas is more reliable than the history of forms. It was almost worth suffering through postmodernism to absorb this simple lesson. Visually similar forms can convey appreciably different meanings. Not all glass elevations deliver the same message as that presented by the landmarks of the International Style. In the case of the new Austrian Cultural Forum in Manhattan, the message is quite contrary. In contrast to the lucid rationality of the modern glass tower, the forum projects the idea that serious disturbances may lie beneath a relatively smooth appearance. Call this a psycho-building: every skyline goes a little crazy sometimes. By Herbert Muschamp.  NOGUCHI-EXHIBIT (New York) _ By no means an artist of narrow focus, the Japanese-American sculptor Isamu Noguchi (1904-1988) took Zen Buddhism into his creative vocabulary, along with Western concepts and sensibilities. Although he was never a Zen practitioner, he admired the discipline's encouragement of spareness and simplicity, its stress on meticulous craftsmanship, and its insistence on asymmetry, or lack of formal balance, to turn the mind away from excess rationalism. Noguchi's take on Zen, a somewhat Westernized version of it, is on view in ``Zen No Zen: Aspects of Noguchi's Sculptural Vision,'' a selection of works from the Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum in Long Island City, which is undergoing renovation. By Grace Glueck.  DARGER-OUTSIDE-ART (New York) _ ``Right or wrong, to be different is to be distinguished,'' wrote the American artist Henry Darger (1892-1973), who was different and distinguished indeed. He was 5-foot-1 and talked to himself more than to anyone else. He was raised in an asylum for ``feeble-minded'' children but wrote, and lavishly illustrated, a fantasy novel more than 15,000 pages long. He died in obscurity in Chicago; today he is one of the stars in an international constellation of ``outsider'' artists. He is also a 21st-century culture hero. The American Folk Art Museum in Manhattan, after acquiring the bulk of the manuscripts and drawings, has created the Henry Darger Study Center for the scholarly elucidation of his impoverished life and protean work. In fact, his life and work are inseparable. Most artists and writers are daily commuters to the imagination. Darger lived in it full time. By Holland Cotter.  MILLIE-THEATER-REVIEW (New York) _ The opening of ``Thoroughly Modern Millie,'' adapted from the 1967 movie musical of the same title. Reviewed by Ben Brantley.  CARRAFA-DANCE (New York) _ John Carrafa is a choreographer who seems to be everywhere at once. To start, he has two musicals on Broadway. ``Into the Woods,'' in previews at the Broadhurst Theater, opens on April 30. The zany hit ``Urinetown'' is two blocks away at the Henry Miller. And there is more. Carrafa is creating new choreography for ``The Pajama Game'' for performances next month in the City Center Encores! series. He will soon begin work for the Broadway-bound musical ``Dance of the Vampires.'' He continues to coach actors for dance sequences in film. He is choreographing a revival in July of ``A Little Night Music,'' part of the Sondheim Celebration at the Kennedy Center in Washington. And he will also choreograph ``Amour,'' based on the music of Michel Legrand, which is to open on Broadway in October. An interview by Jennifer Dunning.  NY-GARGOYLES (New York) _ New York may be known for its skyscrapers, but you don't have to look up that far to glimpse a less imposing, and in some ways more enticing, puckish feature of this city's architecture: its gargoyles. Whether carved from sandstone or terra cotta, these decorative monsters stand guard over buildings great and small, blending the medieval with the modern and sprinkling Gotham with a touch of the Gothic.

MISSISSIPPI-BLUES (Undated) _ On the blues trail with Rick Bragg in the Mississippi Delta: I came looking for the blues.

By Rick Bragg.  With photos.  SECOND-HOMES (Undated) _ Appalachia is not yet the new Florida, but it could be making a run for it. Over the last decade, some of the fastest growth in seasonal and second homes has come not along the sunny shores of Florida or in the lush oases of the California desert. Rather, the new destinations are more likely to be in states like West Virginia, Tennessee and Arkansas, landlocked and mountainous, at least in part, but with more temperate climates than the traditional mountain retreats in the northeastern United States and the Rockies. And while second homes are still going up in more traditional vacation spots like Arizona and New Mexico, it is the less populated farther reaches of those states where growth is fastest.

MUSTANG-FEVER (Undated) _ Brad Barnett, 23, runs two Web sites for devotees of the Ford Mustang and is a member of the Magic City Mustangs, a Birmingham, Ala. ``We're not trying to save the world,'' said Barnett. ``It's just guys who like Mustangs, talking Mustangs.'' Today, though, the muscle cars Barnett and his fellow auto enthusiasts covet are a dying breed. The latest casualty came when General Motors said this would be the last year for its Camaro and Firebird models. Now the Mustang stands practically alone. In fact, in recognition of its staying power, in 2004, the Ford Motor Co. will move production of the car from the aging Dearborn, Mich., assembly plant to a newer facility. And J. Mays, Ford's chief designer, plans a retro look for it by mid-decade, so that its body more resembles the sinuous brute Steve McQueen drove in ``Bullitt.'' By Danny Hakim.  RITUALS-CLOSETS (Undated) _ Most people find the weekend chore of cleaning out the closet dreary, frustrating and worthy of first-degree procrastination. I find it relaxing. It gives me a sense of completion and, I suppose, control. Well-organized closets make me feel like I inhabit a well-organized world, while the truth is anything but. Rarely does a weekend pass by without finding me deep in a closet, weeding out life's debris. By Nancy M. Better.  BUYING-COMIC-BOOKS (New York) _ I read comic books. That was hard to admit when I was a kid because at school, reading comics was something only nerds did. Being out about it could get a person beaten up. It was also something my family didn't like, because they didn't approve of the ``wasted'' money. At 30, my comic collecting still feels like a dirty little secret. I am still buying comics.

WASHINGTON (``w'' code)  IRAN-HOSTAGES (Washington) _ A U.S. District Court judge ruled Thursday that the Americans who were held for 444 days at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran cannot win damages from Iran because the agreement that freed them 21 years ago barred any subsequent lawsuits against the Iranian government.

The city is a compact, easily accessible place to spend a weekend break. By Jennifer Conlin.  CAR-COLORS (Undated) _ The big car color for the model year of 2004 and beyond and how it is chosen. By Tim Moran.  CULTURE AND ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' code)  NY-AUSTRIAN-ARCHITECTURE (New York) _ In architecture, the history of ideas is more reliable than the history of forms. It was almost worth suffering through postmodernism to absorb this simple lesson. Visually similar forms can convey appreciably different meanings. Not all glass elevations deliver the same message as that presented by the landmarks of the International Style. In the case of the new Austrian Cultural Forum in Manhattan, the message is quite contrary. In contrast to the lucid rationality of the modern glass tower, the forum projects the idea that serious disturbances may lie beneath a relatively smooth appearance. Call this a psycho-building: every skyline goes a little crazy sometimes. By Herbert Muschamp.  NOGUCHI-EXHIBIT (New York) _ By no means an artist of narrow focus, the Japanese-American sculptor Isamu Noguchi (1904-1988) took Zen Buddhism into his creative vocabulary, along with Western concepts and sensibilities. Although he was never a Zen practitioner, he admired the discipline's encouragement of spareness and simplicity, its stress on meticulous craftsmanship, and its insistence on asymmetry, or lack of formal balance, to turn the mind away from excess rationalism. Noguchi's take on Zen, a somewhat Westernized version of it, is on view in ``Zen No Zen: Aspects of Noguchi's Sculptural Vision,'' a selection of works from the Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum in Long Island City, which is undergoing renovation. By Grace Glueck.  DARGER-OUTSIDE-ART (New York) _ ``Right or wrong, to be different is to be distinguished,'' wrote the American artist Henry Darger (1892-1973), who was different and distinguished indeed. He was 5 feet 1 inch and talked to himself more than to anyone else. He was raised in an asylum for ``feeble-minded'' children but wrote, and lavishly illustrated, a fantasy novel more than 15,000 pages long. He died in obscurity in Chicago; today he is one of the stars in an international constellation of ``outsider'' artists. He is also a 21st-century culture hero. The American Folk Art Museum in Manhattan, after acquiring the bulk of the manuscripts and drawings, has created the Henry Darger Study Center for the scholarly elucidation of his impoverished life and protean work. In fact, his life and work are inseparable. Most artists and writers are daily commuters to the imagination. Darger lived in it full time. By Holland Cotter.  MILLIE-THEATER-REVIEW (New York) _ The opening of ``Thoroughly Modern Millie,'' adapted from the 1967 movie musical of the same title. Reviewed by Ben Brantley.  CARRAFA-DANCE (New York) _ John Carrafa is a choreographer who seems to be everywhere at once. To start, he has two musicals on Broadway. ``Into the Woods,'' in previews at the Broadhurst Theater, opens on April 30. The zany hit ``Urinetown'' is two blocks away at the Henry Miller. And there is more. Carrafa is creating new choreography for ``The Pajama Game'' for performances next month in the City Center Encores! series. He will soon begin work for the Broadway-bound musical ``Dance of the Vampires.'' He continues to coach actors for dance sequences in film. He is choreographing a revival in July of ``A Little Night Music,'' part of the Sondheim Celebration at the Kennedy Center in Washington. And he will also choreograph ``Amour,'' based on the music of Michel Legrand, which is to open on Broadway in October. An interview by Jennifer Dunning.  NY-GARGOYLES (New York) _ New York may be known for its skyscrapers, but you don't have to look up that far to glimpse a less imposing, and in some ways more enticing, puckish feature of this city's architecture: its gargoyles.

I came to see this land where the blues began, and to see a child who was born here pick up a guitar and plug in a hot amplifier with a sound like bacon spitting from a hot skillet, and play me a song. By Rick Bragg.  (ART ADV: Photo and map are being sent to NYT photo and graphic clients.)  SECOND-HOMES (Undated) _ Appalachia is not yet the new Florida, but it could be making a run for it. Over the last decade, some of the fastest growth in seasonal and second homes has come not along the sunny shores of Florida or in the lush oases of the California desert. Rather, the new destinations are more likely to be in states like West Virginia, Tennessee and Arkansas, landlocked and mountainous, at least in part, but with more temperate climates than the traditional mountain retreats in the northeastern United States and the Rockies. And while second homes are still going up in more traditional vacation spots like Arizona and New Mexico, it is the less populated farther reaches of those states where growth is fastest. By Edward Wyatt.  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.)  MUSTANG-FEVER (Undated) _ Brad Barnett, 23, runs two Web sites for devotees of the Ford Mustang and is a member of the Magic City Mustangs, a Birmingham, Ala. ``We're not trying to save the world,'' said Barnett. ``It's just guys who like Mustangs, talking Mustangs.'' Today, though, the muscle cars Barnett and his fellow auto enthusiasts covet are a dying breed. The latest casualty came when General Motors said this would be the last year for its Camaro and Firebird models. Now the Mustang stands practically alone. In fact, in recognition of its staying power, in 2004, the Ford Motor Co. will move production of the car from the aging Dearborn, Mich., assembly plant to a newer facility. And J. Mays, Ford's chief designer, plans a retro look for it by mid-decade, so that its body more resembles the sinuous brute Steve McQueen drove in ``Bullitt.'' By Danny Hakim.  RITUALS-CLOSETS (Undated) _ Most people find the weekend chore of cleaning out the closet dreary, frustrating and worthy of first-degree procrastination. I find it relaxing. It gives me a sense of completion and, I suppose, control. Well-organized closets make me feel like I inhabit a well-organized world, while the truth is anything but. Rarely does a weekend pass by without finding me deep in a closet, weeding out life's debris. By Nancy M. Better.  BUYING-COMIC-BOOKS (New York) _ I read comic books. That was hard to admit when I was a kid because at school, reading comics was something only nerds did. Being out about it could get a person beaten up. It was also something my family didn't like, because they didn't approve of the ``wasted'' money. At 30, my comic collecting still feels like a dirty little secret. I am still buying comics. By George Gene Gustines.  FLOWER-POT-COOKING (Undated) _ My kitchen is not exactly powered by flowerpots, but I could make a strong case for their essential culinary life. As multifaceted kitchen enablers, nothing can quite supplant the gorgeous, timeless, ever available, often dirt-cheap terra-cotta flowerpot. By Suzanne Hamlin.  DETROIT-36-HOURS (Undated) At first glance, Detroit still looks like a city under siege. But these days the scene is not one of crime; it is one of construction.

"113232"	"I"	"suppose"	" Big statement, but then, so are the trout. In six days of fishing at the sprawling Estancia Maria Behety, in bone-chilling water and tooth-rattling wind, I landed a half-dozen trout over 15 pounds and one 27{-pounder on a No. 12 Prince Nymph, the piscatorial equivalent, I suppose, of shooting a grizzly with a slingshot.

"115142"	"I"	"suppose"	" JONES: There's an inherent problem with the sequels. Sequels have become very popular. Various studios have announced their intention to make nothing else.

"115495"	"I"	"suppose"	" The miscalculations begin with the grim determination in which Lucas and co-writer Jonathan Hales (wasn't this guy supposed to help?) set forth the thick and generally uninspired exposition. ``Phantom Menace'' fatally centered on trade wars and bureaucratic maneuverings (for, I suppose, those who were waiting for NAFTA: The Movie).

"116458"	"I"	"suppose"	" Inspired by the introduction to Dutch art previously unfamiliar to me, I also visited Rembrandt's house, where he lived from 1639 to 1660. Although the interior, including the artist's studio, has been reconstructed to reflect the time period, his more than 250 sketches, drawings and etchings are quite real (and one curious plaque in the kitchen authoritatively marks the spot where Rembrandt had a terrible row with his mistress, a nod, I suppose, to our fascination with the private lives of our heroes). During my visit, the museum's adjacent modern gallery displayed an instructive exhibit of about 100 prints that demonstrated how Goya and Picasso were influenced by Rembrandt _ an example of how smaller exhibits can be worth ferreting out. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"

At least the slick ``Sum of All Fears'' made you wince at a terrorist act; ``Bad Company'' just makes you wince as you sit through one poorly staged and uninspired action sequence after another.

The prices were predictably steep ($200 for three, with wine), while the food was simple and well-prepared.

NATIONAL  CONGRESS -- WASHINGTON-- A bill to create a Homeland Security Department could pass in the Senate as soon as Friday, but it could also be held up by efforts to re-instate an independent commission to investigate intelligence failures that led up to the Sept. 11 attacks. A previous version of the bill included the commission. In addition, Sen. Robert Byrd urged lawmakers to wait a few days before voting for the bill (Moscoso, Cox News Service)  DEMLEADERS -- WASHINGTON -- Congressional Democrats elected Nancy Pelosi to be their leader today, making the liberal Californian the first woman to head either party in either chamber of Congress. Democrats chose Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, a 21-year-veteran known for working well with Republicans, to succeed Pelosi as whip, the party's second-highest rank. Rep. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a leader of the Hispanic caucus, was elected caucus chairman. (Shepard, Cox News Service)  WITH  PELOSI -- WASHINGTON-- A profile of Rep.

I was looking for the source of the song ``Sweet Home Alabama'' that sprang from my car radio on a visit to Baghdad last month.

Democrats chose Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, a 21-year-veteran known for working well with Republicans, to succeed Pelosi as whip, the party's second-highest rank. Rep.

INTERNATIONAL  PAKISTAN -- WASHINGTON -- With the hunt for Osama bin Laden moving back to center stage, the spotlight shifts again to the murky situation in Pakistan. Contradictions abound. Pakistan has captured a number of leading figures in bin Laden's al-Qaida terror network. But Pakistan also offers what is the most likely spot for bin Laden to be hiding.

I was looking for the source of the song ``Sweet Home Alabama'' that sprang from my car radio on a visit to Baghdad last month. After two rough decades, it seems that many Iraqis cling to a '60s and '70s vibe.

Sadly, the Muslim concept has been perverted by those who would betray Islam and destroy Judaism and Christianity. Jihad is not primarily a holy war against another religion.

The storm hit the Indian state of West Bengal on Tuesday, then headed toward Bangladesh. The densely populated coastal areas of eastern India and Bangladesh are regularly hit by storms from the Bay of Bengal.  NEPAL: AFTER STRIKE, REBELS STATE DEMANDS  At the end of a three-day national strike, leaders of the Maoist insurgency issued a statement reiterating their demands for peace. The Maoists, who have been waging a guerrilla war against the constitutional monarchy since 1996, want a conference with all parties taking part, the formation of an all-party government and an election for a constituent assembly. The government said the rebels should present their demands at a negotiating table.   EUROPE   CYPRUS: ADVICE FROM U.S. ON PEACE PLAN  A U.S. envoy urged Cyprus' rival Greek and Turkish leaders to seriously consider a new U.N. peace plan or miss out on a ``settlement opportunity that may not exist for some time to come.'' The appeal by Thomas Westen, the Bush administration's special envoy on Cyprus, came after the United Nations presented a plan this week calling for the creation of a federation on Cyprus with the Greek and Turkish halves united by a central government modeled on Switzerland's. Resolving the dispute is seen as crucial to Cyprus' hopes to join the European Union.   YUGOSLAVIA: RE-RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT  Vojislav Kostunica, the president of Yugoslavia, announced that he would run again for the same post in Serbia, the federation's main republic. Kostunica won the Serbian presidential election last month only to see his victory annulled because less than half the electorate voted, largely because of disillusionment with political infighting among the reformers who toppled Slobodan Milosevic. Kostunica has since struck a deal with his main rival, the Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic of Serbia, but it is unclear whether he will have Djindjic's support in the election on Dec. 8.  CROATIA: WANTED GENERAL ENTERS HOSPITAL  A senior Croatian general wanted on war crimes charges by the U.N. tribunal in The Hague checked himself into a hospital in Zagreb. Janko Bobetko, an 83-year-old diabetic with a deteriorating heart condition, refuses to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the tribunal, and the Croatian government is resisting international pressure to hand him over.  CZECH REPUBLIC: PLOT TO DARKEN NATO SUMMIT  The police in North Moravia announced that they had arrested five high school and university students who were planning to cut off electricity to the NATO summit meeting in Prague next week. The police said the youths fashioned themselves as anarchists but had no links to international terrorist groups. Instead, they seemed to like to cut off electrical installations for fun, said Karel Trnka, the chief of the North Moravian criminal police.   SPAIN: WARRANT ISSUED FOR BASQUE POLITICIAN  The Supreme Court issued an international arrest warrant for a member of the Basque regional parliament who failed twice to appear in court on charges that he ordered a terrorist bombing in 1987. Jose Antonio Urruticoetxea, who was imprisoned for membership of the violent separatist group ETA and later elected to the regional parliament for the Batasuna party, which is now outlawed, told a newspaper he would not respond to the court summons because ``I was judged a long time ago.'' He is accused of ordering the ETA bombing of a Civil Guard barracks in Zaragoza in 1987, which killed 11 people, including five children.  SPAIN: LEAKING TANKER TOWED FROM COAST  An aging tanker leaking fuel oil that made a 20-mile slick off the coast of northwestern Spain was towed toward international waters on Thursday night in the hope of averting an environmental disaster. The high winds and 25-foot waves buffeting the tanker died down at midday, allowing tugs to haul the ship out to sea and enabling technicians to restart an engine. Officials said the ship would be escorted 120 miles offshore and probably turned over to a salvage company to be taken into harbor for repair.   WORLD   NO AGREEMENT ON BIO-WEAPONS INSPECTIONS  Countries meeting in Geneva to discuss strengthening the Biological Weapons Convention failed to resolve a dispute on inspections to verify compliance with the pact, which prohibits the development, production and stockpiling of the weapons. Last year, the United States blocked attempts to set guidelines to verify compliance, saying the proposals would not deter countries from acquiring or developing biological weapons. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20021114.0214 type=story > <HEADLINE> WHO'S BEEN SLEEPING IN MY BED? </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 11-14-02 18:09:00EST (BC-LIVE-IN-CARETAKERS-NY) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"

Rosalia D'Aprano, who was promoting a digital and satellite telecommunications exhibition that is to take place in Venice in October, said the risks of being hit by terrorism while traveling had to be put in perspective: ``You are more likely to be run over by a car at home, especially back in Italy the way people drive.'' </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20030411.0013 type=story > <HEADLINE> BANKER RESIGNS FROM UBS WARBURG </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 04-11-03 01:04:00EDT (BC-BANKER-RESIGNS-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200304.gz"

There are two distinct cultures that have evolved, and by far the smaller is the one that's tied up with book and high culture.

"143224"	"I"	"suppose"	" I understand the importance of closure to my family, friends, and supporters, Martha Stewart declared 10 days ago as she told the world she was ready for her stint in the slammer. She's not the only one, these days, who's aware of the importance of closure. A dozen years after the word was first denounced in print as psychobabble, its detractors say ..closure remains a blight on the lexicon of loss. Worse, some say, it is edging out closing in non-therapeutic contexts. Local TV announcers, a friend writes, are prattling on about closures of area churches. Another reader e-mails, I wonder if closings will ever be allowed back? Then, I suppose, I will have closure. But their gloom may be premature. A look at the evidence suggests that the noun form closing is holding up nicely, and closure may actually be past its peak. Before it moves on to Buzzword Heaven, though, closure deserves a closer look; its life story is more complicated than most critics have noticed. Yes, closure has clear origins in the world of psychology. It was introduced in the 1920s by Gestalt therapy, which defined it as (in the words of the Oxford English Dictionary) the process whereby incomplete forms, situations, etc., are completed subjectively by the viewer or seem to complete themselves; the tendency to create ordered and satisfying wholes. That covers everything from our ability to see a triangle even though its perimeter isn't complete to our predilection for constructing narratives that make sense of our experience. But the Gestalt version of closure remained a specialized usage till recently. It wasn't part of the pop-psych vocabulary skewered in Richard Rosen's 1977 book Psychobabble, for instance, even though Gestalt therapy was part of the cultural landscape at the time. The Age of Aquarius, for reasons of its own, was more interested in getting in touch with its inner child and going with the flow than in pursuing closure. Meanwhile, some earlier uses of closure -- as a synonym for concluding or closing -- were chugging along, meeting no opposition. And why should they? The first sense is recorded in 1588, the second in 1600, in a reference to Augustus's second closure of the temple of Janus. And when closure did break into wider usage in our time, it was the signing a deal, resolving the situation senses that made the leap, not the psychological term. Here's Secretary of State George Shultz in 1987, after a meeting in Moscow: While we have explored matters in the space-defense ABM treaty area . . . we don't see quite where we can come to closure on that subject. Or a senior US official quoted in 1991: It is quite difficult to understand how (Israelis and Palestinians) cannot come to closure. The spread of this diplomatic closure may have helped to revive the therapeutic term, or simply softened us up for it, but it certainly came first: The grief-related closure made its big move a bit later, between 1990 and 1995. Since that surge, though, its popularity has leveled off -- perhaps because of the fierce opposition it met. Just from 1997 through 1999, closure was called the psychotherapeutic cliche du jour, the cliche word of modern tragedy, and even the most reviled (term) in the English language. Further evidence that the campaign against the therapeutic-jargon closure may succeed: Of the half-dozen most recent print examples I looked at one day last week, four were direct quotes from people who hoped for (or despaired of achieving) closure, one was sarcastic, and only one was straight. If the victims of misfortune would stop talking to reporters about closure, the usage would probably go extinct. Of closure as a synonym for closing, the same cannot be said. In current newspapers, in fact, this version of closure dominates: The word is roughly three times as likely to refer to lane closings or station closings as to emotional resolution. And since this usage is 400 years old, we may as well grin and bear it; otherwise, closure could be a long time coming. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200409.gz"

Coffman retired as chief executive of Lockheed Martin last August, the company wanted to show a little gratitude. So the board endowed a $1.5 million professorship at Iowa State University, Coffman's alma mater, to honor his steady leadership over 37 years. It also agreed to foot the bill for various expenses, like his country club membership and use of company aircraft, until he steps down as chairman this month at the age of 61. Those perks, however, are pocket change compared with the pension that Lockheed bestowed upon Coffman a few weeks ago: a $31.5 million lump-sum payment. Everyone knows that chief executives are paid huge amounts of money while they are working. Less known is just how much they make in retirement. At many of America's biggest corporations, it is not uncommon for retired executives who were paid tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars during their tenures to receive $1 million or more in pension benefits every year -- for as long as they live. By Eric Dash.  Other Exec Pay stories  EXEC-BONUSES (Undated) -- It is hard to find three chief executives who had a tougher year than Carley Fiorina, Raymond V. Gilmartin and Michael D. Eisner. But you would never guess that from the size of their annual bonuses. At Hewlett-Packard, Fiorina was forced to step down after directors concluded that her strategy wasn't working. But the board reinstated part of her bonus after a strong fourth quarter, so she still managed to pocket $1.57 million. At Merck, Gilmartin collected a $1.4 million bonus for 2004, despite the fact that Vioxx, its top-selling pain medicine, was pulled from the shelves late last year; investors pulled out of the company's stock even faster. At Disney, Eisner was the subject of a shareholder revolt that led him to retire a year earlier than he originally said. No matter. He received a $7.25 million bonus for the company's greatly improved fiscal performance in 2004. The fact that all three made out so well underscores a trend in executive pay last year: The big bonus is back. By Eric Dash.  EXEC-PERKS (Undated) -- Pressed by shareholder activists, companies are starting to be more forthcoming about the corporate jets, company cars and other perquisites they give their executives on top of their salaries, bonuses and other compensation. But there is scant evidence that the fuller disclosure is reining in any regal lifestyles just yet. The amounts of money spent on executive perks vary widely, and they rise and fall inexplicably. Most often, the cash goes to sweeten corporate officers' health care benefits and retirement accounts. But there other popular perks that fall outside the office, like the annual bill for the chief executive's country club membership. By Patrick McGeehan.  EXEC-PAY-OPTIONS (Undated) -- Fifteen years ago, Michael C. Jensen, a professor at the Harvard Business School, co-wrote a paper that trumpeted some pretty radical ideas for the time. Compensation systems, they posited, prompted chief executives to add revenue, not to increase profit, pay dividends or otherwise reward long-suffering shareholders. Their suggestion was to make stock options a big component of top management's pay, ensuring that they do well only if shareholders do well. Of course, it turned out that in far too many cases, stock options tempted managers to pick strategies, schedule deals and investments, even juggle the numbers, so that the company looked best when it came time to exercise those options. So in 2001, Jensen debunked his own theories in another paper. But Jensen, 65, is still not done with the subject. Claudia H. Deutsch. talks to him. In Q&amp;A form.  Commentary  MARKET-WATCH (Undated) -- Weekly Wall Street commentary. By Gretchen Morgenson.  ECON-COLUMN (Undated) -- The weekly Economic View column: Tax reform, like a second marriage, is the triumph of hope over experience. The United States has just gone through the most sweeping tax cuts since the 1980s, but hardly anybody is satisfied. President Bush contends that we need still-lower taxes in order to prosper. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, is suggesting a radical shift to a consumption tax. And the Republican Party has taken aim at the entire tax system. At the heart of all this antitax sentiment is a belief: Taxes are bad for the economy. There is just one problem, though. Despite the widespread notion that taxes harm the economy, no one has actually been able to back that up. By Anna Bernasek.  BILLIONAIRES (Undated) -- The On the Contrary column: This year's Forbes list of the world's billionaires is out, and, as usual, the news is bad. You didn't make it. Neither did I. You may have fantasized about what it would be like to have multiple homes, to cruise around on your yacht and spend time counting your cash. But even if billionaire status never arrives, allow me to set your yearnings at ease. Do not envy these people. For most of the superrich, the benefits of each additional dollar of wealth reached the vanishing point long ago. I can't speak from experience, of course, but in all likelihood, having billions does not offer significant advantages over having mere millions and indeed imposes the disadvantage of some significant cost burdens. By Daniel Akst.  Features  AIRFARES (Undated) -- Five years ago, flying across the United States was much the same as it had been throughout much of the jet age. Passengers booked a ticket on one of the big airlines, like United or American, and paid an average of $600 round-trip in coach class unless they snagged a discount. But low-fare airlines have been gobbling market share throughout the industry, and they are now focusing on the transcontinental market with a vengeance. Cross-country flights account for almost half the business that the low-fare companies have added during this decade. As a result, average ticket prices have plummeted, turning the transcontinental market, like those for flights within California or from East Coast cities to Florida -- into a big air-fare flea market. By Micheline Maynard.  Investing  INVEST-BONDS (Undated) -- Longer-term interest rates may finally be moving up in earnest. If the trend continues, fixed-income investors who have not prepared will be taught an ugly lesson: as yields rise, prices fall and the value of a bond portfolio declines. But there are ways to minimize the pain. The most common moves are to sell longer-term bonds and to hold cash or shorter-term securities, which won't be hurt as badly as their cousins with longer maturities. Some portfolio managers also use futures contracts to hedge against rate increases. But professionals are also using a less known way to cushion a bond portfolio: by buying premium callable bonds.

That is why the Koreans are expanding their footprint in the United States, and are moving into new market segments. For instance, a new large sedan from Hyundai, the 2006 Azera, looks like a serious challenger to the Toyota Avalon and Nissan Maxima, especially with more luxury features and a lower price.

FOREIGN  With story BC-POPE-HEALTH-NYT  Pope John Paul II was clinging to life Friday as his condition deteriorated further, and the Vatican said his breathing was shallow and his kidneys were failing after complications from a urinary tract infection.  At a time when Washington is celebrating its lowest number of homicides since 1986, the number of juvenile homicide victims has nearly doubled. In 2004, about one out of every eight murder victims in Washington was under the age of 18.  The nation's unemployment rate dipped slightly in March, the government said on Friday, but job creation was weaker than most analysts had expected.  Oil prices jumped 3.4 percent to a record on Friday, triggered by renewed concerns over the level of gasoline stockpiles in the United States before the summer driving season.  Employers added 110,000 workers in March, barely half the number expected, as rising costs crimped hiring.  The spectacle of once-respected corporate titans doing perp walks -- Martha Stewart, Bernard J. Ebbers, Richard M. Scrushy, the list seems endless -- has pretty well tarnished the title of chief executive. But it has done little, it seems, to scratch the gilt from the corner office. In fact, the boss enjoyed a hefty raise last year.  We moved EXEC--Pay--compared -- 1 x 5 1/2  Comparing CEOs' pay with average workers; shift in the makeup of CEO pay.  Everyone knows that chief executives are paid huge amounts of money while they are working. Less known is just how much they make in retirement. At many of America's biggest corporations, it is not uncommon for retired executives who were paid tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars during their tenures to receive $1 million or more in pension benefits every year -- for as long as they live.

With story BC-EXEC-PERKS-NYT  Pressed by shareholder activists, companies are starting to be more forthcoming about the corporate jets, company cars and other perquisites they give their executives on top of their salaries, bonuses and other compensation. But there is scant evidence that the fuller disclosure is reining in any regal lifestyles just yet.  We moved EXEC--Perk--costs -- 30p5 x 3 1/2  Shift in cost to companies for providing a company car and financial advice, broken down.  With story BC-MARKET-WATCH-NYT  The scandal unfolding at American International Group is not Enron. Of that we can be sure. AIG, after all, is a real company with global operations, generating genuine profits from a variety of financial enterprises. As companies go, Enron was all smoke and mirrors; AIG is substance.  Five years ago, flying across the United States was much the same as it had been throughout much of the jet age. Passengers booked a ticket on one of the big airlines, like United or American, and paid an average of $600 round-trip in coach class unless they snagged a discount. But low-fare airlines have been gobbling market share throughout the industry, and they are now focusing on the transcontinental market with a vengeance.  We moved AIRFARES--Compared -- 14p6 x 3 3/4  Long-distance airline fares since 1990, major vs. low-cost carriers.  With story BC-INVEST-BONDS-NYT  Longer-term interest rates may finally be moving up in earnest. If the trend continues, fixed-income investors who have not prepared will be taught an ugly lesson: as yields rise, prices fall and the value of a bond portfolio declines.

EXP-POPE-HEALTH (Vatican City) -- Pope John Paul II was clinging to life Friday as his condition deteriorated further, and the Vatican said his breathing was shallow and his kidneys were failing after complications from a urinary tract infection. (Summary from wires) By Ian Fisher.  EXP-POPE-VATICAN (Undated) -- The death of a pope sets in motion a ritualized sequence of events that evokes centuries of tradition in the Roman Catholic Church. It also puts governance of the religion of more than a billion believers into a state of suspended animation. By Daniel J. Wakin.  EXP-POPE-VIGIL (Dateline TK) -- Around the world, Roman Catholics and others offered prayers on Friday for the gravely ill Pope John Paul II. (Byline TK)  EXP-ZIMBABWE-ELECT (Harare, Zimbabwe) -- Nearly complete results in Zimbabwe's national parliamentary elections pointed on Friday to a victory for President Robert G. Mugabe's ruling party and a drubbing for his political opposition, which had predicted a dramatic showing. Some democracy advocates here called for the opposition to mount mass protests against the Mugabe government, saying this week's vote proved that a fair election was currently impossible. By Sharon LaFraniere and Michael Wines.  EXP-IRAQ (Baghdad, Iraq) -- A group of Sunni Arab clerics, including some hard-line figures who fiercely oppose the American presence in Iraq, issued a statement on Friday urging Iraq's Sunni Arabs to join the Iraqi army and police. The edict was a striking turnaround for the clerics, who have often lashed out in sermons at the fledgling army and police and branded them collaborators. By Robert F. Worth.  EXP-MEXICO-MAYOR (Mexico City) -- A congressional panel here on Friday passed a motion to strip Mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of Mexico City, the country's most popular politician, of his official immunity so he can stand trial in a land dispute. The move could prevent him from running in the upcoming presidential election. By Ginger Thompson.  EXP-SPAIN-TERROR (Madrid, Spain) -- The Spanish police took 13 people into custody on Friday in connection with the deadly train bombings here last year, including a man extradited from Belgium who is accused of being one of al-Qaida's top leaders in Europe, the Interior Ministry said. By Renwick McLean.  EXP-PHARMACY-BIRTH-CONTROL (Chicago) -- With a growing number of reports of pharmacists around the country refusing to fill prescriptions for birth control and emergency contraception, Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich on Friday filed a rule requiring pharmacies to promptly accept and dispense all such prescriptions in Illinois. By Monica Davey.  EXP-GUNS-DEBATE (Undated) -- Across the country, efforts to expand or establish laws allowing concealed handguns have been fueled by the horrifying shootings in the last month. By Kate Zernike.  EXP-ECON-REPORT (Washington) -- The nation's unemployment rate dipped slightly in March, the government said on Friday, but job creation was weaker than most analysts had expected. The nation added about 110,000 jobs last month, about half what Wall Street analysts had predicted, as the unemployment rate declined to 5.2 percent from 5.4 percent in February. By Edmund L. Andrews.  EXP-OIL-PRICES (Undated) -- Oil prices jumped 3.4 percent to a record on Friday, prompted by renewed concerns over the level of gasoline stockpiles in the United States before the summer driving season.

Ebbers, Richard M. Scrushy, the list seems endless -- has pretty well tarnished the title of chief executive. But it has done little, it seems, to scratch the gilt from the corner office. In fact, the boss enjoyed a hefty raise last year. The chief executives at 179 large companies that had filed proxies by last Tuesday -- and had not changed leaders since last year -- were paid about $9.84 million, on average, up 12 percent from 2003, according to Pearl Meyer &amp; Partners, the compensation consultants. Surely, chief executives must have done something spectacular to justify all that, right? Well, that's not so clear. The link between rising pay and performance remained muddy -- at best.and performance remained muddy -- at best. With a graphic.  EXEC-PENSIONS (Undated) -- When Vance D. Coffman retired as chief executive of Lockheed Martin last August, the company wanted to show a little gratitude. So the board endowed a $1.5 million professorship at Iowa State University, Coffman's alma mater, to honor his steady leadership over 37 years. It also agreed to foot the bill for various expenses, like his country club membership and use of company aircraft, until he steps down as chairman this month at the age of 61. Those perks, however, are pocket change compared with the pension that Lockheed bestowed upon Coffman a few weeks ago: a $31.5 million lump-sum payment. Everyone knows that chief executives are paid huge amounts of money while they are working. Less known is just how much they make in retirement. At many of America's biggest corporations, it is not uncommon for retired executives who were paid tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars during their tenures to receive $1 million or more in pension benefits every year -- for as long as they live. By Eric Dash.  EXEC-BONUSES (Undated) -- It is hard to find three chief executives who had a tougher year than Carley Fiorina, Raymond V. Gilmartin and Michael D. Eisner. But you would never guess that from the size of their annual bonuses. At Hewlett-Packard, Fiorina was forced to step down after directors concluded that her strategy wasn't working. But the board reinstated part of her bonus after a strong fourth quarter, so she still managed to pocket $1.57 million. At Merck, Gilmartin collected a $1.4 million bonus for 2004, despite the fact that Vioxx, its top-selling pain medicine, was pulled from the shelves late last year; investors pulled out of the company's stock even faster. At Disney, Eisner was the subject of a shareholder revolt that led him to retire a year earlier than he originally planned. No matter. He received a $7.25 million bonus for the company's greatly improved fiscal performance in 2004. The fact that all three made out so well underscores a trend in executive pay last year: The big bonus is back. By Eric Dash.  With a photo, NYT18.  EXEC-PERKS (Undated) -- Pressed by shareholder activists, companies are starting to be more forthcoming about the corporate jets, company cars and other perquisites they give their executives on top of their salaries, bonuses and other compensation. But there is scant evidence that the fuller disclosure is reining in any regal lifestyles just yet. The amounts of money spent on executive perks vary widely, and they rise and fall inexplicably. Most often, the cash goes to sweeten corporate officers' health care benefits and retirement accounts. But there other popular perks that fall outside the office, like the annual bill for the chief executive's country club membership. By Patrick McGeehan.  With a graphic.  EXEC-PAY-OPTIONS (Undated) -- Fifteen years ago, Michael C. Jensen, a professor at the Harvard Business School, co-wrote a paper that trumpeted some pretty radical ideas for the time. Compensation systems, they posited, prompted chief executives to add revenue, not to increase profits, pay dividends or otherwise reward long-suffering shareholders. Their suggestion was to make stock options a big component of top management's pay, ensuring that they do well only if shareholders do well. Of course, it turned out that in far too many cases, stock options tempted managers to pick strategies, schedule deals and investments, even juggle the numbers, so that the company looked best when it came time to exercise those options. So in 2001, Jensen debunked his own theories in another paper. But Jensen, 65, is still not done with the subject. Claudia H. Deutsch. talks to him. In Q&amp;A form.  MARKET-WATCH (Undated) -- Weekly Wall Street commentary: American International Group is no Enron. Of that we can be sure. AIG, after all, is a real company with global operations, generating genuine profits from a variety of financial enterprises. As companies go, Enron was all smoke and mirrors. Moreover, until five minutes ago, AIG was run by Maurice R. Greenberg, a brilliant man who was both visionary and micromanager, a far cry from the know-nothing that Ken Lay, Enron's former chief executive, claims to be, now that his trial looms. There are, however, some disturbing similarities between AIG and Enron: Asleep-at-the-switch auditors. Secretive off-balance-sheet entities that should have been included on the company's financial statements but weren't. A management team willing to try any number of accounting tricks to make the company's results appear better than they actually were. And one more likeness: As AIG's shares have plummeted, the financial position of one of the company's insurance subsidiaries has taken a big hit. By Gretchen Morgenson.  With a graphic.  ECON-COLUMN (Undated) -- The weekly Economic View column: Tax reform, like a second marriage, is the triumph of hope over experience. The United States has just gone through the most sweeping tax cuts since the 1980s, but hardly anybody is satisfied. President Bush contends that we need still-lower taxes in order to prosper. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, is suggesting a radical shift to a consumption tax. And the Republican Party has taken aim at the entire tax system. At the heart of all this antitax sentiment is a belief: Taxes are bad for the economy. There is just one problem, though. Despite the widespread notion that taxes harm the economy, no one has actually been able to back that up. By Anna Bernasek.  BILLIONAIRES (Undated) -- The On the Contrary column: This year's Forbes list of the world's billionaires is out, and, as usual, the news is bad. You didn't make it. Neither did I. You may have fantasized about what it would be like to have multiple homes, to cruise around on your yacht and spend time counting your cash. But even if billionaire status never arrives, allow me to set your yearnings at ease. Do not envy these people. For most of the superrich, the benefits of each additional dollar of wealth reached the vanishing point long ago. I can't speak from experience, of course, but in all likelihood, having billions does not offer significant advantages over having mere millions and indeed imposes the disadvantage of some significant cost burdens. By Daniel Akst.  LEVERAGED-BUYOUTS (Undated) -- The Dealbook column: How many leveraged buyout firms does it take to do a deal? Evidently, quite a few. Last week, seven of the nation's most prominent private equity firms crowded into one deal, teaming up to buy SunGard Data Systems for $11.3, the largest leveraged buyout since Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. bought RJR Nabisco in 1989 for $25 billion. Now Wall Street is aflutter with talk of still bigger leveraged buyouts with even bigger teams of private equity firms. But as LBO deals get bigger -- and, more important, the number of private equity firms in a club or consortium starts to bulge to pay the escalating prices -- problems are sure to emerge. By Andrew Ross Sorkin.  Features  MORGAN-STANLEY (New York) -- On the surface, the open revolt by eight retired Morgan Stanley executives against the leadership of Philip J. Purcell seems to be a power struggle, pure and simple, over who should control that storied investment house. In a larger sense, however, the attempted putsch may represent a final death rattle of a bygone Wall Street era, personified by the well-born, Ivy League-educated investment bankers who formed the core of Morgan Stanley during its heyday in the 1970s and 1980s. By Landon Thomas Jr.  AIRFARES (Undated) -- Five years ago, flying across the United States was much the same as it had been throughout much of the jet age. Passengers booked a ticket on one of the big airlines, like United or American, and paid an average of $600 round-trip in coach class unless they snagged a discount. But low-fare airlines have been gobbling market share throughout the industry, and they are now focusing on the transcontinental market with a vengeance. Cross-country flights account for almost half the business that the low-fare companies have added during this decade. As a result, average ticket prices have plummeted, turning the transcontinental market, like those for flights within California or from East Coast cities to Florida -- into a big air-fare flea market. By Micheline Maynard.  INVEST-BONDS (Undated) -- Longer-term interest rates may finally be moving up in earnest. If the trend continues, fixed-income investors who have not prepared will be taught an ugly lesson: as yields rise, prices fall and the value of a bond portfolio declines. But there are ways to minimize the pain. The most common moves are to sell longer-term bonds and to hold cash or shorter-term securities, which won't be hurt as badly as their cousins with longer maturities. Some portfolio managers also use futures contracts to hedge against rate increases. But professionals are also using a less known way to cushion a bond portfolio: by buying premium callable bonds. By Virginia Munger Kahn.  AUTOS-KIA (Undated) -- A review of the Kia Spectra 5, a pleasant, economical and surprisingly stylish hatchback/wagon. Move over, Maybach: This $15,000 Korean car gets compliments from valet attendants at chic L.A. nightspots. By Michelle Krebs.  With photos, NYT29-30, and a graphic.  AUTOS-KOREANS (Undated) -- The Korean automakers were bottom feeders not long ago, but now they are nipping at the heels of the Japanese -- and have rising Chinese companies closing in from behind. That is why the Koreans are expanding their footprint in the United States, and are moving into new market segments. For instance, a new large sedan from Hyundai, the 2006 Azera, looks like a serious challenger to the Toyota Avalon and Nissan Maxima, especially with more luxury features and a lower price. By Michelle Krebs.  CARS-AMERICAN-MOTORS (Undated) -- Pacers, Marlins and Gremlins, oh my! People who cant forget the sometimes forgettable (and occasionally endearing) cars of American Motors. By John Matras.  CARS-WAYNES-WORLD (Undated) -- The AMC Pacer used in the Wayne's World movies was recently sold on eBay. Who bought it? Why? A short, by John Matras.

LA-SCALA-MUTI (Undated) -- Even by operatic standards, the plot turned with stunning swiftness. Not two months ago, Riccardo Muti seemed the unshakable master of the Teatro Alla Scala, the legendary opera house in Milan. Italy. But now, besieged in the political arena and denounced by the orchestra he so lovingly molded over two decades, he has all but lost his grip on the company. New twists arise almost daily. How long will Muti, 63, who is as proud and stubborn as he is brilliant and charismatic, continue to weather insults intended to force his departure from the position he has held since 1986? By Daniel J. Wakin and James R. Oestreich.  MCDONAGH-THEATER (New York) -- Acclaimed by critics on both sides of the Atlantic, Martin McDonagh remains a confounding character: A writer of enormous lyrical gifts and sometimes off-putting arrogance; a mild-mannered, soft-spoken vegetarian whose plays depict casual torture, buckets of blood and the occasional decapitation; and a self-described skeptic of the magic of theater who has nonetheless become one of the most successful and produced playwrights in the world. By Jesse McKinley.  HIRST-PAINTING (New York) -- With his first New York show since 2000, Damien Hirst, abandoning his famous menagerie of dead sharks and pharmaceuticals and 8-foot-wide ashtrays, has unveiled 31 photorealist paintings, all heavily assistant-aided and tongue in cheek. The subjects include skulls, crystals, pills, a doctor proffering a brain. The show's opening galvanized the predictable mob of ebullient celebrities and tut-tutting rubberneckers. By Michael Kimmelman.  Editors, Frank Rich, whose column anchored the Arts &amp; Leisure cover, has moved back to the Sunday Op-Ed page. His once-a-week columns will begin there on April 10.  Theater  DENZEL-WASHINGTON-BROADWAY (New York) -- During his working vacation away from Hollywood, Denzel Washington may be willing to go without the luxury trailer, but the bodyguard stays: a very large bearded man leads the way to the small room in the Belasco Theater where Washington, in a long-sleeved T-shirt and jeans, is relaxing before afternoon rehearsal for Julius Caesar. The show is still in previews, but in the corner, there's already a bin full of letters from fans who have seen the show; the theater had to hire extra security to handle the mob that waits for him each night after the curtain falls. Playing Brutus, Washington is adjusting to the high-wire act of live theater -- and yes, he says, it's a lot more work than film. Susan Dominus talked to him. In Q&amp;A format.  Film  CHOW-FILM (Undated) -- Previous generations of Hong Kong action heroes have flown through the air with the aid of hidden wires and trampolines. But now, Hong Kong filmmakers are following Hollywood into the digital age, using computer technology to manipulate images and make the feats of their protagonists seem even more otherworldly and astonishing. One of the comic (and even poetic) highlights of Stephen Chow's new film Kung Fu Hustle finds Chow leaping so far off the ground that he encounters Buddha in the form of a cloud formation, before he plunges back to earth to deliver a devastating coup de grace to an opponent. At 42, he is East Asia's most popular comedy star, having appeared in more than 50 films since his big screen debut in 1988. Chow is now looking for new worlds to conquer, both creatively as a writer and director and commercially as a box-office name in the Western hemisphere. By Dave Kehr.  Dance  AMERICAN-DANCE (Undated) -- Look at the rosters of important American ballet companies. At the Boston Ballet, 17 of 20 of the top dancers are foreign-born and at least initially foreign trained. In San Francisco, only four of the 17 principals were born in this country. American Ballet Theater has long welcomed foreign-trained stars. The same pattern prevails in many other big companies. In our era of globalization, is this a problem, or merely a swing of the pendulum from internationalism to nativism and back again? By John Rockwell.  Art and Architecture  ART-PRIZES (Undated) -- For decades now, Robert Rauschenberg has held the highest artistic honors: for starters, pride of place on the walls of institutions like MoMA, the Guggenheim and the Tate. But recently the artist fielded a more obscure accolade: the Premio Internacional Julio Gonzalez, one of a multitude of new art prizes awarded by the museum world to living artists. Over the last few years, museums large and small have started awarding their own prizes, usually named after the institution and sponsored by a corporate donor, to capitalize on the glamour associated with contemporary art. To burnish their appeal, many of the new awards are modeled on the Tate Modern's venerable Turner Prize, which has evolved into a nationally televised event that attracts celebrity presenters like Madonna and habitually polarizes the British press.

EXEC-PAY (Undated) -- The spectacle of once-respected corporate titans doing perp walks -- Martha Stewart, Bernard J. Ebbers, Richard M. Scrushy, the list seems endless -- has pretty well tarnished the title of chief executive. But it has done little, it seems, to scratch the gilt from the corner office. In fact, the boss enjoyed a hefty raise last year. The chief executives at 179 large companies that had filed proxies by last Tuesday -- and had not changed leaders since last year -- were paid about $9.84 million, on average, up 12 percent from 2003, according to Pearl Meyer &amp; Partners, the compensation consultants.

It also agreed to foot the bill for various expenses, like his country club membership and use of company aircraft, until he steps down as chairman this month at the age of 61. Those perks, however, are pocket change compared with the pension that Lockheed bestowed upon Coffman a few weeks ago: a $31.5 million lump-sum payment. At many of America's biggest corporations, it is not uncommon for retired executives who were paid tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars during their tenures to receive $1 million or more in pension benefits every year -- for as long as they live.

The fact that all three made out so well underscores a trend in executive pay last year: The big bonus is back. By Eric Dash.  With a photo, NYT18.  EXEC-PERKS (Undated) -- Pressed by shareholder activists, companies are starting to be more forthcoming about the corporate jets, company cars and other perquisites they give their executives on top of their salaries, bonuses and other compensation.

Their suggestion was to make stock options a big component of top management's pay, ensuring that they do well only if shareholders do well.

For most of the superrich, the benefits of each additional dollar of wealth reached the vanishing point long ago. I can't speak from experience, of course, but in all likelihood, having billions does not offer significant advantages over having mere millions and indeed imposes the disadvantage of some significant cost burdens. By Daniel Akst.  LEVERAGED-BUYOUTS (Undated) -- The Dealbook column: How many leveraged buyout firms does it take to do a deal? Evidently, quite a few. Last week, seven of the nation's most prominent private equity firms crowded into one deal, teaming up to buy SunGard Data Systems for $11.3, the largest leveraged buyout since Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. bought RJR Nabisco in 1989 for $25 billion. Now Wall Street is aflutter with talk of still bigger leveraged buyouts with even bigger teams of private equity firms. But as LBO deals get bigger -- and, more important, the number of private equity firms in a club or consortium starts to bulge to pay the escalating prices -- problems are sure to emerge. By Andrew Ross Sorkin.  Features  MORGAN-STANLEY (New York) -- On the surface, the open revolt by eight retired Morgan Stanley executives against the leadership of Philip J. Purcell seems to be a power struggle, pure and simple, over who should control that storied investment house. In a larger sense, however, the attempted putsch may represent a final death rattle of a bygone Wall Street era, personified by the well-born, Ivy League-educated investment bankers who formed the core of Morgan Stanley during its heyday in the 1970s and 1980s. By Landon Thomas Jr.  AIRFARES (Undated) -- Five years ago, flying across the United States was much the same as it had been throughout much of the jet age. Passengers booked a ticket on one of the big airlines, like United or American, and paid an average of $600 round-trip in coach class unless they snagged a discount. But low-fare airlines have been gobbling market share throughout the industry, and they are now focusing on the transcontinental market with a vengeance. Cross-country flights account for almost half the business that the low-fare companies have added during this decade. As a result, average ticket prices have plummeted, turning the transcontinental market, like those for flights within California or from East Coast cities to Florida -- into a big air-fare flea market. By Micheline Maynard.  INVEST-BONDS (Undated) -- Longer-term interest rates may finally be moving up in earnest. If the trend continues, fixed-income investors who have not prepared will be taught an ugly lesson: as yields rise, prices fall and the value of a bond portfolio declines. But there are ways to minimize the pain. The most common moves are to sell longer-term bonds and to hold cash or shorter-term securities, which won't be hurt as badly as their cousins with longer maturities. Some portfolio managers also use futures contracts to hedge against rate increases. But professionals are also using a less known way to cushion a bond portfolio: by buying premium callable bonds. By Virginia Munger Kahn.  AUTOS-KIA (Undated) -- A review of the Kia Spectra 5, a pleasant, economical and surprisingly stylish hatchback/wagon. Move over, Maybach: This $15,000 Korean car gets compliments from valet attendants at chic L.A. nightspots. By Michelle Krebs.  With photos, NYT29-30, and a graphic.  AUTOS-KOREANS (Undated) -- The Korean automakers were bottom feeders not long ago, but now they are nipping at the heels of the Japanese -- and have rising Chinese companies closing in from behind. That is why the Koreans are expanding their footprint in the United States, and are moving into new market segments. For instance, a new large sedan from Hyundai, the 2006 Azera, looks like a serious challenger to the Toyota Avalon and Nissan Maxima, especially with more luxury features and a lower price.

CAMILLA-STYLE (London) -- The bride wore tweed. Or at least you get the feeling that she would, if she could. Only the most hard-hearted could fail to sympathize, if even a teeny bit, with Camilla Parker Bowles as the days dwindle before her wedding to Prince Charles on April 8. Comparisons to the late Princess Diana, which linger deep in the British psyche, have come inevitably to the forefront. And in the fashion arena, Parker Bowles has often seemed defenseless. She has endured the scorching public eye and the jabs of style critics for years. It would be unfair, unkind and even superficial, however, to dismiss the future Duchess of Cornwall's sense of style as nonexistent. Instead, Parker Bowles's simple tailored suits and hunting-jacket-plus-jodhpurs look is that of the quintessential upper-crust British woman, her peers say. And, some add, even though she is in her late 50s, her sense of fashion is rapidly evolving. By Heather Timmons.  HOOKING-UP (New York) -- A look at the mating rituals of the post-Sex and the City generation.

The show is still in previews, but in the corner, there's already a bin full of letters from fans who have seen the show; the theater had to hire extra security to handle the mob that waits for him each night after the curtain falls. Playing Brutus, Washington is adjusting to the high-wire act of live theater -- and yes, he says, it's a lot more work than film. Susan Dominus talked to him.

, it seems,	 EXEC-PAY (Undated) -- The spectacle of once-respected corporate titans doing perp walks -- Martha Stewart, Bernard J. Ebbers, Richard M. Scrushy, the list seems endless -- has pretty well tarnished the title of chief executive. But it has done little, it seems, to scratch the gilt from the corner office. In fact, the boss enjoyed a hefty raise last year. The chief executives at 179 large companies that had filed proxies by last Tuesday -- and had not changed leaders since last year -- were paid about $9.84 million, on average, up 12 percent from 2003, according to Pearl Meyer &amp; Partners, the compensation consultants. Surely, chief executives must have done something spectacular to justify all that, right? Well, that's not so clear. The link between rising pay and performance remained muddy -- at best. By Claudia H. Deutsch. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
, they posited,	 EXEC-PAY-OPTIONS (Undated) -- Fifteen years ago, Michael C. Jensen, a professor at the Harvard Business School, co-wrote a paper that trumpeted some pretty radical ideas for the time. Compensation systems, they posited, prompted chief executives to add revenue, not to increase profits, pay dividends or otherwise reward long-suffering shareholders. Their suggestion was to make stock options a big component of top management's pay, ensuring that they do well only if shareholders do well. Of course, it turned out that in far too many cases, stock options tempted managers to pick strategies, schedule deals and investments, even juggle the numbers, so that the company looked best when it came time to exercise those options. So in 2001, Jensen debunked his own theories in another paper. But Jensen, 65, is still not done with the subject. Claudia H. Deutsch. talks to him. In Q&amp;A form. </P> 	nyt_eng_200504.gz
