"10224"	"I"	"wasn't"	" ``No, I wasn't, Geraldo. In fact, on my wedding day, I weighed 103 pounds. I was a perfect size 6.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199412.gz"
"13116"	"I"	"wasn't"	" Bloch said he was simply a paid spokesman who had no idea until July that there were problems with the DeAngelis brothers. As he said on the television program ``Inside Edition'' earlier this month: ``The allegation is that I was in business with these yo-yos, OK? The answer is, I wasn't, never have been, and never will be.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"
"17549"	"he"	"wasn't"	" Early on, of course, he wasn't, because this was after all just Mississippi State.

It was 209 minutes 59 seconds of playoff hockey, if you count Game 6 last year. And when the dam-burster came, it wasn't, shall we say, artistic. It was, in fact, grunt stuff. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199505.gz"
"43238"	"it"	"wasn't"	" Of course, it wasn't, and Watterson's quirky, ambitious Sunday panels (``Tyrannosaurs in F-14s!!'') soar above the competition.

"110214"	"it"	"wasn't"	" Coach Jim O'Brien downplayed the significance of a practice Tuesday that was dedicated to defense. When it was suggested it must have been one heck of a workout, O'Brien said, ``Well, it wasn't, frankly.'' Paul Pierce, Antoine Walker, Kenny Anderson, Eric Williams, and Tony Delk sat out to rest. So, the bulk of the defensive instruction came via video. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"

"158852"	"it"	"wasn't"	" It seemed like a continuation of That Was the Week That Was, with more attention to popular culture. I always fought for stuff that didn't have anything to do with television and movies. And for the most part, when I think back on the stuff that I love, it wasn't, such as Uncle Roy and the political stuff. Chevy (Chase) and Danny (Aykroyd) were always up for a good political sketch. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"
"163202"	"he"	"wasn't"	" Gretzky is a class act and has done so much for this city. Look at the headlines on the first day when the story broke and Gretzky's name was leaked by the New Jersey police.

He was enticing because he appeared to be getting better at the plate with each passing year, and the expectation was that further improvement was a given. Well, it wasn't, and that's not a strange baseball occurrence, especially when someone is changing teams. My guess is that he will be a much more productive player next year, but it's foolish to think he's going to be Johnny Damon. Fans cannot hold him to that standard. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"172307"	"he"	"wasn't"	" Well, he wasn't, say many prosperity pastors.
