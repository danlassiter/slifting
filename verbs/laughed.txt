A new cardiac imaging technique, debuting this week in metro Atlanta, could sound a warning before it's too late. (a)  FAVRE-2takes _ KILN, Miss. _ Two miles back, State Route 603 funneled from a divided four-lane highway into a narrow two-lane separated by a faded broken yellow stripe. Except for a small green road sign and the flashing yellow light that represents the hub of this rural drive-by, there is little evidence of anything nearby worth a pilgrimage. Yet it's here, 60 miles from New Orleans but still so remote that Al Capone once used the nearby Jourdan River to run Prohibition rum from South America, that a tiny town of 1,582 has become the spiritual center of this Sunday's high holiday, Super Bowl XXXI.

But the cartoon in a recent issue of a Kabul weekly that showed President Hamid Karzai leading a song and dance number, sent the magazine's editor to jail for two nights last month.  The editor, Abdul Ghafoor Iteqad, of the weekly Farda, or Tomorrow, was arrested by two men from the prosecutor's office, who told him that the cartoon, drawn on his instructions, had insulted the honor of the president.  The order to arrest him came from the man considered by many people here to be the most powerful in the country _ not the president, but the defense minister and vice president, Marshal Muhammad Fahim. Karzai was out of the country at the time, and Marshal Fahim was in charge. The president returned two days later, laughed at the cartoon and immediately ordered the editor's release.  ``He joked that I had made some of his friends unhappy,'' Iteqad said after meeting with Karzai. ``He did not apologize or overturn the order, but he was glad I was out,'' Iteqad said.  Despite the president's easygoing attitude, editors in Afghanistan are well aware that there are others in authority who do not seem to appreciate a joke, especially if it is aimed at those in positions of power.  Iteqad's experience has been a reminder to editors and journalists that even though Karzai has announced that there is press freedom, they face risks if they push the boundaries of political satire.  ``There are some offices and organizations that want to control the press,'' Iteqad said. ``It is still the rule of the gun here.''  The deputy chief prosecutor, Nurkhel, who sent Iteqad to jail, confirmed that the defense minister had prompted him to take note of the cartoon and arrest the editor. Nurkhel also confirmed that Karzai had taken the cartoon lightly.  ``He laughed and said, `Release him, this is press freedom,''' Nurkhel said.  But Nurkhel also gave a hint that the president's attitude is not the only one that counts. ``Even press freedom does not allow you to insult the president,'' he said. ``We did this to prevent other magazines and papers doing more things like this.''  Afghanistan is emerging from the draconian strictures of the Taliban era and years of fighting and ethnic strife, and could easily be destabilized by too much freedom, Nurkhel said. The government should not be undermined at this early stage, he added.  Editors here, aware of the history and of attitudes like Nurkhel's, admit to using caution, even self-censorship. But most say they do not intend to be intimidated. They are churning out bitingly funny cartoons and columns of scathing gossip aimed at senior officials as well as United Nations and other foreign aid agencies here.  As soon as he was released, Iteqad printed a cartoon showing a dove named ``press freedom'' flying out of a cage as a man tries to shoot it down.  He also depicted the minister of information and culture using a crane to try to yank a bureaucrat from his coveted chair, while a larger fist installed another man in the chair, a reference to the strong powers working behind the scenes.  ``I have been in jail once now,'' Iteqad said. ``My fear has flown.''  He said he had been through far worse than that. His father-in-law, Aziz Rahman-ul-Fat, who founded a newspaper named Afghanistan while in exile in Pakistan in the 1980s, was killed, apparently by Islamic militants, after criticizing them in his paper.  He maintains that cartoons are vital to attract readers in a country where there is widespread illiteracy and where few have the habit of reading newspapers.  The undoubted leader in Afghan wit is the monthly magazine Zanbel-e-Gham, or Basket of Sorrows, a handwritten, small circulation, satirical magazine that was founded during the Taliban regime, photocopied in secret and handed around among friends. It is still handwritten but now circulates openly.  ``In our ancient literature our people are quite familiar with satire,'' said the editor, Usman Akram, who produces it under the pseudonym Sargadan. ``We have a lot of satirical poems, for example.''  But for the last two decades, under the Communists and then the Taliban, satire was under strict government control. ``When the government gave you permission to laugh, you laughed,'' Akram said. ``Otherwise you could not.''  Akram said he now spent a lot of time persuading unhappy government and aid officials, politicians and commanders that they were not the intended target of his barbs. ``Fortunately I have not been taken to court yet,'' he said, laughing.  It was the sheer mirthlessness of the Taliban times that persuaded him to start the magazine. He once depicted the former Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, as one of the sorrows in the basket in his magazine's masthead. Today his cartoonist poked fun at the Afghan riding a donkey and speaking into a mobile phone, or the woman riding a bicycle in a burka.  Akram strikes out at corruption, inefficiency and political humbug, laughing at the new national army that is paid by foreign dollars and so, he contends, should be called the ``international army.''  He shows Afghanistan's neighbors poised with butterfly nets to ensnare the dove of peace, and a globe-faced U.N. official looking down at the midget map of Afghanistan who is trailing around after him.  ``Laughter should not be pointless,'' Akram said. ``It should be like a knife that cuts the head of the person targeted.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20030111.0114 type=story > <HEADLINE> METERS SEEN AS PARKING VIOLATION </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> SAN FRANCISCO  (BC-SANFRAN-BICYCLISTS-AR) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200301.gz"

But talking with Elaine Stritch was still a very different proposition from watching Elaine Stritch talk onstage. What keeps audiences coming to the show is her ability to make a connection with them, to draw them into her life and make them feel its resonances with their own. But that's a kind of magic that comes alive only in performance, and even she isn't quite sure how or why it works. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"

They ate, they laughed, they played pool, they even talked a little football. That became minor talk radio grist in the days that followed, some suggesting that such pregame camaraderie was downright anti-football.
