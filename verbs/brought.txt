WACO HEARINGS  WASHINGTON _ More than two years after a rampaging fire tore through the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, a congressional investigation has reopened the wounds from a law enforcement debacle that claimed at least 79 lives. Beginning Wednesday, two House subcommittees will re-examine the 51-day siege in eight days of public hearings. By RON HUTCHESON. Story will move in ``w'' Washington category.  JOHNSON-VIETNAM  WASHINGTON _ For nearly seven years, Rep. Sam Johnson endured frequent beatings, near-starvation and psychological torture in a rat-infested Vietnamese prison camp. The ordeal left the Texas lawmaker with a mangled right arm and some strong feelings about President Clinton's decision to normalize relations with the government of his former captors. By RON HUTCHESON. Story will move in ``w'' Washington category.  SEX BOOK  FORT WORTH, Texas _ The women were ready for Ella Patterson. Anticipating her arrival to speak about her new book, they'd set out a tray of fruit, a big jar of pickles, other edible odds and ends. ``It was like they read the book, and everything they read about, they brought,'' Patterson, 40, explains weeks later, laughing. ``They wanted me to demonstrate everything.'' Which wouldn't be so odd if Patterson had written, say, a cookbook. But ``Will the Real Women ... Please Stand Up?'' is most definitely not that, though it does include some rather unusual, uh, recipes _ most of which you probably would not feel comfortable sharing with your mother-in-law. That's right. Meet Ella Patterson, schoolteacher turned sex adviser. By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ. Story has moved in ``l'' lifestyle category.  SANTA FE-EXHIBIT  SANTA FE, N.M. _ In terms of attitude and local geography, the scene was far removed from the plaza where assorted tourists pored over Indian silver spread on blankets and danced to bluegrass music. Off in the closest thing Santa Fe has to an eyesore neighborhood, a warehouse recently converted to an austerely appointed exhibit space echoed with the voices of hundreds of bemused art viewers and the sounds of often-kinetic, noise-making art. The event was Thursday's patron opening of ``Longing and Belonging: From the Faraway Nearby,'' the inaugural exhibition of a nonprofit organization called SITE Santa Fe. By JANET TYSON. Story will move in ``e'' entertainment category.  LANDSCAPING  FORT WORTH, Texas _ Landscaping can be a costly and time-consuming project, but it doesn't have to be an unmanageable one. A major landscaping project can be divided into stages and carried out over time. This way, you won't have to do and pay for things all at once. By VICTOR PANICHKUL. Story has moved in ``l'' lifestyle category.  CHURCH-FOX  LOS ANGELES _ Thomas Hayden Church let the bird in hand fly away, opting for a ``Ned and Stacy'' in the bush. Church has played the dimwitted Lowell on NBC's hit series ``Wings'' for six years, but he's leaving the security of that show to take a chance on a Fox network comedy that premieres Sept. 9, a Saturday, but then moves to a Monday slot. By STEVEN COLE SMITH. Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment category.  CARS-SMITH-COLUMN  UNDATED _ ``It looks like a pizza delivery truck,'' my wife said, but I'm sure she meant it in the nicest possible way. Actually, though, the little white Isuzu did look sort of, well, ``industrial,'' despite chrome trim rings on the wheels, a brown stripe down the side and a plastic bed liner. And, sort of like the runt of the litter, there was something endearing about it. And honest. By STEVEN COLE SMITH.

"102301"	"she"	"brought"	" She was responsible for banning the Danish film ``The Sex Life of Jesus Christ'' in 1977. In 1979, she instigated Britain's first blasphemy trial in 52 years, which resulted in a suspended nine-month jail sentence for the editor of Gay News. In 1982, she brought, but later dropped, a private prosecution against Howard Brenton's play ``The Romans in Britain,'' which explicitly portrayed sexual acts. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
