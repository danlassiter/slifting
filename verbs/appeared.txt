OBIT-GOULD (Undated) _ Dr. Stephen Jay Gould, the evolutionary theorist at Harvard University whose lectures, research and prolific output of essays helped to reinvigorate the field of paleontology, died Monday morning at his home in New York. He was 60 years old. The cause was adeno carcinoma, his wife, Rhonda Roland Schearer, said. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon.  SCI-PROSTATE-SCREENING (Orlando, Fla.) _ A large study finds that PSA screening for prostate cancer can be done every five years for some and two years for others, instead of every year, if men choose to be tested, according to research presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Oncologists. By Lawrence K. Atlman.  SCI-LINDBERGH-SPIRIT (Undated) _ The Spirit of St. Louis was sufficient to its task, where others had failed. Seventy-five years ago today, Charles A. Lindbergh, alone in a stiff wicker seat in the little plane's cramped cockpit, completed the first nonstop flight across the Atlantic to Europe. The flight established a benchmark in human courage and aviation history. With becoming modesty and a good deal of accuracy, Lindbergh always shared credit for the achievement with his airplane. For a critical period, the two were inseparable. He recommended the design specifications and oversaw each step in the plane's assembly. He took it on all the test flights. In fact, he was the only pilot the plane ever had, before and after its historic flight. Lindbergh referred to himself and the plane as ``we.'' By John Noble Wilford.  SCI-GARBAGE-RISK (Undated) _ Consider the nasty consequences of a garbage strike. Trash accumulates on curbs and back alleys. Garbage festers. The orderly process of daily living is disrupted. If the strike goes on long enough, things come to a standstill. Scientists say that kind of disruption may lie at the heart of at least 30 diseases, most of them incurable, afflicting millions of Americans. The problem can lie in the proteins, the long, complex molecules whose functioning in the body depends on how they are folded on themselves. By John Noble Wilford.  SCI-RUNNERS-HIGH (Undated) _ Despite a widespread belief in the so-called runner's high, a feeling of intense euphoria that is supposed to come with vigorous exercise, the experience is not consistent or predictable. Some researchers have asked whether it exists at all. Many say that its supposed genesis, a rush of endorphins into the brain, is without scientific evidence and some say the whole endorphin-runner's high hypothesis is the scientfic version of an urban legend. By Gina Kolata.  SCI-GUSTERSON-PHYSICISTS (Undated) _ A conversation with Dr. Hugh Gusterson, a 43-year-old professor of anthropology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has applied the intensive scrutiny of scientific investigation not to island natives but to mostly affluent white men with ``Ph.D.'' affixed to their names. He studies nuclear physicists. By Claudia Dreifus.  SCI-TERROR-REACT (Stillwater, Minn.) _ fore being thrown into nearly continuous coverage of the World Trade Center disaster since Sept. 11, I had spent years absorbing and explaining the insights of physics. Here at a forest-enshrouded lodge achatter with the camaraderie of some of the world's smartest people, I am attending my first major scientific conference since that terrible day. My convalescence is not going well. An essay by James Glanz.  SCI-CHEFS-SEA-BASS (Undated) _ More than 200 chefs from prominent restaurants in New York City and Los Angeles plan to drop Chilean sea bass from their menus until the largely unregulated fishery for the slow-growing Antarctic delicacy is brought under effective international control.

SCI-SEX-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Books on Health: ``Getting the Sex You Want: A Woman's Guide to Becoming Proud, Passionate, and Pleased in Bed,'' by Sandra Leiblum and Judith Sachs; ``The New Love and Sex After 60,'' by Robert N. Butler and Myrna I. Lewis. Reviewed by John Langone.  SCI-YUCATAN-ENVIRON (Undated) _ Nearly 100 feet beneath the Yucatan Peninsula in southern Mexico, cave divers are mapping the world's longest underground river. More important, they are unraveling the mysteries of a fragile ecosystem that may be destroyed before it is fully understood. By Angela M.H. Schuster.  SCI-JELLYFISH (Port Douglas, Australia) _ In many places around the world, jellyfish populations are sharply increasing, stinging more people and wreaking economic damage. While in some areas the increase appears to be part of a natural cycle (jellyfish populations are declining in some areas), scientists have noticed an overall upward trend. And they suspect that human activity is to blame. By Otto Pohl.  SCI-BIRD-SONGS (Undated) _ Two new sets of tapes and CD's, by Richard Walton and Robert Lawson, help birders sort out the songs. By E. Vernon Laux.  SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on alligators' sensory devices that can detect a stir in the water, the way building lights affect migratory birds and the moon race between Jupiter and Saturn. By Henry Fountain.  SCI-POLLUTED-RIVER (Undated) _ Biological diversity is normally associated with tropical rain forests or coral reefs, not rivers laden with heavy metals and with a pH of 2, halfway between vinegar and stomach fluid. But when an international team of biologists took a closer look at the Rio Tinto, just such a river in southwestern Spain, they were startled by what they found: hundreds of species of one-celled algae, fungi, yeast, amoebas, and other microbes, some of which appear unique to that river. By Andrew C. Revkin.  SCI-SPERM-BANKS (Undated) _ Though most of the country's 100 sperm banks offer only anonymous donors, increasing numbers are offering ways, sometimes highly creative ways, to assure that children born with donated sperm can meet the men who fathered them. Other banks are at least considering the option. By Linda Villarosa.  SCI-POLIO-DECLINE (Undated) _ In 1988, 350,000 children were paralyzed by polio. That year, the World Health Organization began a global vaccination campaign, with the goal of wiping out the disease by the end of 2000. The campaign fell short, but not by much: last year, there were only 600 cases spread over 10 countries. By Denise Grady.  SCI-MIND-BODY-MEDICINE (Undated) _ A cardiologist moves aggressively to treat a heart attack patient's depression, getting in touch with a psychiatrist. Each is exceptionally pleased with the move to get the mind and body working together. But for the patient, it only made sense. By Ana Fels, M.D.  SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health: While there has been much back and forth, the preponderance of evidence has indicated a strong relationship between what can be summed up as excessive emotional stress and an elevated risk of developing and dying of heart disease. One researcher argues that stress is responsible for 40 percent of heart attacks and sudden deaths. By Jane E. Brody.  SCI-HIV-WASTING (Undated) _ Even as people with H.I.V. are living longer than ever, a significant number look deathly ill because of a condition called lipodystrophy _ a disruption in the body's methods of processing and distributing fat. Many say their emaciated appearance frightens family members, friends and co-workers and severely undermines their self-confidence. By David Tuller.  SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and fitness. By Eric Nagourney:  _ Researchers in Britain say they have found no evidence that cleaning, even heavy housework, causes women ages 60 to 79 to lose weight. The finding contradicts earlier reports that housework qualified as daily exercise.  _ Thousands of people could be steered toward treatment for depression if their regular doctors took a moment to ask them two simple questions, a study reported. The first question could not be more direct: ``Are you currently sad or depressed.'' The second: ``Are the things that previously brought you pleasure no longer bringing you pleasure?''  _ Special shoes worn by diabetics to prevent foot ulcers, and ultimately prevent amputations, may not be any better than well-fitted regular shoes, researchers report.  _ A new study raises the possibility that soy-based infant formulas, which account for one-fourth of all the formula used in the United States, may weaken babies' immune systems.  SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ A science question answered: What is microfiber, anyway? By C. Claiborne Ray.  Photos, where indicated, are being sent to NYT photo clients. Graphics, to NYT graphic clients.
