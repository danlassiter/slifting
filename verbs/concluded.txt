Instead of focusing on whether ``there was no taking,'' we read the question as a whole. Since the decisions by the Courts of Appeals and the lower court opinion involved only physical takings, we concluded, ``Fairly construed, then, petitioners' question presented is the equivalent of the question, `Did the court below err in finding no physical taking?''' 503 U.

"25158"	"we"	"concluded"	" Our Jones Act cases establish several basic principles regarding the definition of a seaman. First, ``(w)hether under the Jones Act or general maritime law, seamen do not include land-based workers.'' Wilander, supra, at 348; see also Allbritton, Seaman Status in Wilander's Wake, 68 Tulane L. Rev. 373, 387 (1994). Our early Jones Act decisions had not recognized this fundamental distinction. In International Stevedoring Co. v. Haverty, 272 U. S. 50 (1926), we held that a longshoreman injured while stowing cargo, and while aboard but not employed by a vessel at dock in navigable waters, was a seaman covered by the Jones Act. Recognizing that ``for most purposes, as the word is commonly used, stevedores are not `seamen,''' the Court nevertheless concluded that ``(w)e cannot believe that Congress willingly would have allowed the protection to men engaged upon the same maritime duties to vary with the accident of their being employed by a stevedore rather than by the ship.'' Id., at 52. Because stevedores are engaged in ``a maritime service formerly rendered by the ship's crew,'' ibid. (citing Atlantic Transport Co. of W. Va. v. Imbrovek, 234 U. S. 52, 62 (1914)), we concluded, they should receive the Jones Act's protections. See also Uravic v. F. Jarka Co., 282 U. S. 234, 238 (1931); Jamison v. Encarnacion, 281 U. S. 635, 639 (1930). In 1946, the Court belatedly recognized that Congress had acted, in passing the LHWCA in 1927, to undercut the Court's reasoning in the Haverty line of cases and to emphasize that land-based maritime workers should not be entitled to the seamen's traditional remedies. Our decision in Swanson v. Marra Brothers, Inc., 328 U. S. 1, 7 (1946), acknowledged that Congress had expressed its intention to ``confine the benefits of the Jones Act to the members of the crew of a vessel plying in navigable waters and to substitute for the right of recovery recognized by the Haverty case only such rights to compensation as are given by (the LHWCA).'' See also South Chicago Coal &AMP; Dock Co. v. Bassett, 309 U. S. 251, 257 (1940). Through the LHWCA, therefore, Congress ``explicitly den(ied) a right of recovery under the Jones Act to maritime workers not members of a crew who are injured on board a vessel.'' Swanson, supra, at 6. And this recognition process culminated in Wilander with the Court's statement that, ``(w)ith the passage of the LHWCA, Congress established a clear distinction between land-based and sea-based maritime workers. The latter, who owe their allegiance to a vessel and not solely to a land-based employer, are seamen.'' 498 U. S., at 347. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"
"25159"	"we"	"concluded"	" We believe it is important to avoid ```engrafting upon the statutory classification of a ``seaman'' a judicial gloss so protean, elusive, or arbitrary as to permit a worker to walk into and out of coverage in the course of his regular duties.''' Barrett v. Chevron, U. S.A., Inc., 781 F. 2d 1067, 1075 (CA5 1986) (en banc) (quoting Longmire v. Sea Drilling Corp., 610 F. 2d 1342, 1347, n. 6 (CA5 1980)). In evaluating the employment-related connection of a maritime worker to a vessel in navigation, courts should not employ ``a `snapshot' test for seaman status, inspecting only the situation as it exists at the instant of injury; a more enduring relationship is contemplated in the jurisprudence.'' Easley, supra, at 5. Thus, a worker may not oscillate back and forth between Jones Act coverage and other remedies depending on the activity in which the worker was engaged while injured. Reeves v. Mobile Dredging &AMP; Pumping Co., 26 F. 3d 1247, 1256 (CA3 1994). Unlike JUSTICE STEVENS, see post, at 8, we do not believe that any maritime worker on a ship at sea as part of his employment is automatically a member of the crew of the vessel within the meaning of the statutory terms. Our rejection of the voyage test is also consistent with the interests of employers and maritime workers alike in being able to predict who will be covered by the Jones Act (and, perhaps more importantly for purposes of the employers' workers' compensation obligations, who will be covered by the LHWCA) before a particular work day begins.To say that our cases have recognized a distinction between land-based and sea-based maritime workers that precludes application of a voyage test for seaman status, however, is not to say that a maritime employee must work only on board a vessel to qualify as a seaman under the Jones Act. In Southwest Marine, Inc. v. Gizoni, 502 U. S. 81 (1991), decided only a few months after Wilander, we concluded that a worker's status as a ship repairman, one of the enumerated occupations encompassed within the term ``employee'' under the LHWCA, 33 U. S. C. s902(3), did not necessarily restrict the worker to a remedy under that statute. We explained that, ``(w)hile in some cases a ship repairman may lack the requisite connection to a vessel in navigation to qualify for seaman status, . . . not all ship repairmen lack the requisite connection as a matter of law. This is so because `(i)t is not the employee's particular job that is determinative, but the employee's connection to a vessel.''' Gizoni, supra, at 89 (quoting Wilander, 498 U. S., at 354) (footnote omitted). Thus, we concluded, the Jones Act remedy may be available to maritime workers who are employed by a shipyard and who spend a portion of their time working on shore but spend the rest of their time at sea. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199506.gz"

The Secretary argues, however, that our decision in Darnell v. Indiana, 226 U. S. 390 (1912), compels us to sustain the North Carolina statute. The statutory scheme at issue in Darnell taxed all shares in foreign corporations owned by Indiana residents as well as all shares in domestic corporations to the extent that the issuing corporations' property was not subject to Indiana's general property tax. Writing for the Court, Justice Holmes found that ``(t)he only difference of treatment . . . that concerns the defendants is that the State taxes the property of domestic corporations and the stock of foreign ones in similar cases.''

"81484"	"he"	"concluded"	" Last year on ``Chicago Hope,'' an HMO ended a doctor's contract because he ordered too many tests. When the doctor took the HMO to court, he explained its strategy to the judge: ``They told me I could treat patients like usual, and at first I could. Then six months later, with 80 percent of my practice HMO patients, they knew they had me. Then they start with the squeeze: no X-ray, no consults, no ultrasound.''

"81713"	"he"	"concluded"	" He doubted that the surge in homelessness had to do with budget cuts in social programs or rent control or rent increases (though the last was the preferred explantion of most urban specialists.)

"89732"	"he"	"concluded"	" Even so, the Fed was more restrained than in the past. In setting short-term interest rates in recent years, Greenspan was guided by two basic lines of thinking.

"92225"	"he"	"concluded"	" Linde's theory is a modification of the inflation theory that was proposed in 1980 by Dr. Alan Guth, a physicist. He considered what would happen if, as the universe was cooling during its first violently hot moments, an energy field known as the Higgs field, which interacts with particles to give them their masses, was somehow, briefly, unable to release its energy. Space, he concluded, would be suffused with a sort of latent energy that would violently push the universe apart. In an eyeblink the universe would double some 60 times over, until the Higgs field released its energy and filled the outrushing universe with hot particles. Cosmic history would then ensue. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200105.gz"

"95741"	"she"	"concluded"	" A strange heat enveloped Valentine, Neb., in the last few hours before dawn on Monday when the temperature surged to 88 degrees from 72. The burst of heat came from a downdraft within a nearby thunderstorm. High in the thunderstorm, raindrops in a downward-moving current of air evaporated, chilling the air and causing it to accelerate. As the dried air plunged to earth, it was compressed and heated. Though the warming slowed the air's acceleration, it still had enough momentum to produce hot gusts of wind near 50 miles an hour around Valentine. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010730.0257 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (BC-SUNDAY-TRAVEL-BUDGET) </DATELINE> <TEXT> The New York Times News Service will move the following travel articles this week for release Sunday, August 5. If you have questions about stories, call 888-346-9867 or 212-556-1927.  (Coded `t')  ON THE COVER  TRAVEL-SLOVENIA-LJUBLJANA (Undated) _ Frank Bruni came to Slovenia with President Bush, who during his campaign for the presidency confused Slovenia with Slovakia. Bruni stayed on and discovered a country that has the best of Europe without the crowds. Bruni used the cosmopolitan capital of Ljubljana as a base for day trips. ``I walked the streets and drove the roads with the giddy, beaming sensation that I had stumbled onto a secret,'' he writes.  TRAVEL-SLOVENIA (Undated) _ The prospects of unspoiled Alpine splendor and the evocative remains of Central Europe's tangled history drew Alan Krauss to this tiny Alpine republic. Exploring the backroads by car, he stood at the scene of the fierce fighting described by Hemingway in ``A Farewell to Arms.'' He also visited Triglav National Park, a 210,000-acre nature preserve. He describes taking footbridges over rapids; the unfathomable green water of the Soca River; and finding a high altitude botanical garden where he spotted violet and orange blooms, amid the grasses and edelweiss.  OTHER FEATURES  TRAVEL-CUBA-FINES (Undated) _ Few of the thousands of Americans who break the law by visiting Cuba ever hear from the federal government. But according to administration officials, lawyers and travel agents, examples of travelers receiving notice of fines have multiplied this year in the wake of a crackdown announced by President Bush. The typical fine is $7,500, though it could reach $250,000, plus 10 years in prison. Experts say the government often settles for less and the odds are still in favor of not getting caught. By Frank Bruni.  TRAVEL-CUBA-SCUBA (Undated) _ You need a weeklong certification course to do real scuba diving, don't you? Not in Cuba. And especially not if you're at Maria La Gorda in Cuba in the capable hands of the Osvaldo Noriega. He has a gift for ``baptizing'' new divers which is how Carey Goldberg, a novice diver, found herself in one of the world's best diving areas. Thank goodness, she concluded, that Cuba is not yet afflicted by that wet-blanket word, ``liability.'' By Carey Goldberg.  HAVANA-RESTAURANTS (Undated) _ ``Pssst! Want to go to my mother's restaurant?'' In Cuba chances of getting a decent meal at one of the private restaurants are better than in most state-run establishments, where the service tends to be indifferent and the food barely edible. But it is still best to go paladres, private restaurants, that are recommended by guidebooks, rather than those touted by someone on the street. By Marion Burrow.  TRAVEL-TWA-AMERICAN (Undated) _ Airline mergers are notoriously messy, but since AMR Corp., American Airline's parent, bought TWA in a bankruptcy sale in April, it has been working on a grand plan to integrate the two airlines with the least disruption possible. Already TWA's jets are sporting American's red, white and blue stripes, a visible sign of many coming changes. By Laurence Zuckerman.  REGULAR FEATURES  PRACTICAL-TRAVELER-SPA (Undated) - Many resorts now offer spa options for grown-ups seeking to pamper themselves while their children are having fun at events organized for them. By Martha Stevenson Olson.  TRAVEL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ In a dispute with Orbitz, Southwest Airlines has withdrawn its fares from the Airline Tariff Publishing Co. Drivers going to North Myrtle Beach, S.C., now have quicker access with the recent opening of the 28.5-mile Conway Bypass. Some pieces of the collection of sculpture, prints and artifacts from Nunavik (northern Quebec) are on display in an exhibition called ``Traces of our Footsteps'' in Old Montreal. By Heather Camlot.  DEALS (Undated) _ Through Sept. 20, Amtrak is selling a two-for-one weekend fare on its Acela Express high-speed service between Washington and Boston. Renault Eurodrive will offer some automatics for the same price as cars with manuals. On weekends through Sept. 3, introductory rates at the Grand America Hotel in Salt Lake City will begin at $129 a night.

ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS  (moving in `e' category)  ON THE COVER  BAD-FILMS (Undated) _ It's the films that aspire to greatness _ social forklifts, ``elevating'' the human spirit _ that give bad movies a bad name. Franz Lidz and Steve Rushin suggest some films are terrible because they are so terribly self important: Think Merchant-Ivory. They describe ``The English Patient,'' ``Out of Africa'' and ``Dances With Wolves'' as mawkish. The subject turns everyone they interview into a critic. One Warner Brothers executive questions the value of any film positively reviewed by National Public Radio. Filmmaker Lloyd Kaufman has a bottom 10 list, which includes four of Lawrence Kasdan's films. His favorite unfavorite is ``Grand Canyon.''  THEATER-SEAGULL (New York) _ The roster of the ``Seagull'' is so high-powered there are 17 Tony awards and 7 Oscars among the 10 principal actors, the director (Mike Nichols), the set designer (Bob Crowley), the lighting designer (Jennifer Tipton) and the adapter (Tom Stoppard). The cast includes Meryl Streep, Kevin Klein, Christopher Walken, Marcia Gay Harden, John Goodman, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Natalie Portman. There's one unknown: Henry Gummer, Streep's son. By Peter Marks.  THEATER  THEATER-FRINGE (New York) _ In the first year of the New York International Fringe Festival, a play was performed in an Oldsmobile with an audience of four in the back seat and the cast of two in the front. In the third year, there was a musical about a city where a water shortage has led to the control of toilets by a malevolent corporation. ``Urinetown: The Musical'' opens on Broadway next month, a first for a show that opened in the festival. The Fringe Festival begins its fifth year Aug. 10 with 198 shows in 19 theaters and one parking lot. By Jonathan Mandell.  DANCE  DANCE-SCHOOL (New York) _ Today, the gold standard for ballet academies in America is the New York City Ballet's School of American Ballet: founded in 1934 and modeled after the great state schools of Europe, it trains professional dancers for the company year round. But a summer program at Ballet Theater established only six years ago is already competing with SAB for students. By Laura Leivick. With photo.  FILM  FILM-SESSION9 (Undated) _ The director Brad Anderson was living in the Boston area when he noticed an abandoned mental hospital looming over the city of Danvers, Mass. The building inspired a tale of psychological horror, ``Session 9,'' which opens on Aug. 11. ``Session 9,'' a kind of ``Blair Witch Project'' for grown-ups, begins as the tale of workers removing asbestos from the Danvers State Hospital. Slowly, each worker grows disturbed, one more than the rest. By Dana Kennedy.  FILM-GARDOS (Los Angeles) _ As of Aug. 10, two films in release will have the name of Eva Gardos in the credits. Made 22 years apart, the films _ ``Apocalypse Now Redux'' and ``An American Rhapsody'' _ bracket a career that went from production assistant to film editor to first-time writer-director. The link in the two films is Colleen Camp, an actress in ``Apocalypse.'' Between takes Gardos began telling Camp her story of being left in Hungary as an infant and then at age 6 being airlifted by the Red Cross to Canada. The heroine of ``An American Rhapsody'' is called Suzanne and she is airlifted to Southern California, but ``An American Rhapsody'' is the same moving tale of immigrants that Gardos told to Camp decades ago. Camp is the producer of the film. By Margy Rochlin.  TELEVISION/RADIO  TV-DEATH-OF-SALESMAN (Undated) _ Audiences can once again watch the transcendent performances of Lee J. Cobb and Mildred Dunnock in the CBS broadcast of ``Death of a Salesman'' in 1966. The CBS production of the 1949 Arthur Miller play will become available Aug. 5 on videocassette and on Sept. 30 it will be shown on Trio, a digital cable and satellite television channel. By Julie Salamon.  TV-CRIME-STORY (undated) _ Long before his Oscar nomination for ``The Insider,'' Michael Mann created ``Crime Story.'' The noirish television series starred Dennis Farina, a Chicago policeman-turned-actor, as a Chicago cop who chased his demons _ and the mob _ all the way to Las Vegas. Viewers can now catch up with the series on A&AMP;E, which is rerunning it on Monday nights at 9. By Thelma Adams.  MUSIC  MUSIC-WAGNER-ISRAEL (Undated) _ There has never been an official ban on performing the works of Richard Wagner in Israel. The policy has been more like an unsigned pact among religious leaders, officeholders and the public to keep Hitler's favorite composer, an infamous anti-Semite, out of the country's concert halls. Most musicians complied until July 7 when the conductor Daniel Barenboim performed the ``Tristan'' prelude in Jerusalem. Anthony Tommasini argues that there may not be a more important place to perform Wagner than in Israel.  MUSIC-MUNICH (Munich) _ Unlike Germany's capital, Berlin, which is struggling to keep its eight orchestras and three opera houses afloat, Munich, has no problem supporting five orchestras and two operas. It is a wealthy city, relatively unaffected by the burden of German reunification, and a lot of its institutions receive funds from the state of Bavaria, not just the city. Thanks to these factors, Munich, a city of 2.3 million people, was able to lure three superstars to become chief conductors of its three main orchestras: Zubin Mehta, James Levine and Lorin Maazel. No wonder the city has begun marketing itself as the Musical Metropolis Munich. By Anne Midgette.  MUSIC-IKE-TURNER (New York) _ On a recent performance at the Village Underground in New York, Ike Turner gave a powerful, driving performance. Farah Jasmine Griffin said she was uncomfortable with an audience of white men applauding a man best known for beating a black woman, but Ike and the Kings of Rhythm even had her, a Tina Turner admirer, tapping her feet. She concludes that the 69-year-old Turner deserves recognition as a musician of stature and importance.  ART/ARCHITECTURE  ART-INDIAN-CURTAIN (Undated) _ A tribal curtain emblazoned with an awesome thunderbird flanked by serpents breathing lightning has been returned to the Nuu-chah-nulth Indians of British Colombia. Helen Robinson had not seen it since her coming-of-age ceremony in the early 1940s. The curtain had made its way to the Denver Art Museum to a New York dealer who sold it back to the Indians for $17,000. Fourteen Indian nations contributed funds. ``When I first saw the curtain again, I said `hello' to my father and mother,'' she said. By Rita Reif.  TRAVEL  (Coded `t')  ON THE COVER  TRAVEL-SLOVENIA-LJUBLJANA (Undated) _ Frank Bruni came to Slovenia with President Bush, who during his campaign for the presidency confused Slovenia with Slovakia. Bruni stayed on and discovered a country that has the best of Europe without the crowds. Bruni used the cosmopolitan capital of Ljubljana as a base for day trips. ``I walked the streets and drove the roads with the giddy, beaming sensation that I had stumbled onto a secret,'' he writes.  TRAVEL-SLOVENIA (Undated) _ The prospects of unspoiled Alpine splendor and the evocative remains of Central Europe's tangled history drew Alan Krauss to this tiny Alpine republic. Exploring the backroads by car, he stood at the scene of the fierce fighting described by Hemingway in ``A Farewell to Arms.'' He also visited Triglav National Park, a 210,000-acre nature preserve. He describes taking footbridges over rapids; the unfathomable green water of the Soca River; and finding a high altitude botanical garden where he spotted violet and orange blooms, amid the grasses and edelweiss.  OTHER FEATURES  TRAVEL-CUBA-FINES (Undated) _ Few of the thousands of Americans who break the law by visiting Cuba ever hear from the federal government. But according to administration officials, lawyers and travel agents, examples of travelers receiving notice of fines have multiplied this year in the wake of a crackdown announced by President Bush. The typical fine is $7,500, though it could reach $250,000, plus 10 years in prison. Experts say the government often settles for less and the odds are still in favor of not getting caught. By Frank Bruni.  TRAVEL-CUBA-SCUBA (Undated) _ You need a weeklong certification course to do real scuba diving, don't you? Not in Cuba. And especially not if you're at Maria La Gorda in Cuba in the capable hands of the Osvaldo Noriega. He has a gift for ``baptizing'' new divers which is how Carey Goldberg, a novice diver, found herself in one of the world's best diving areas. Thank goodness, she concluded, that Cuba is not yet afflicted by that wet-blanket word, ``liability.'' By Carey Goldberg.  HAVANA-RESTAURANTS (Undated) _ ``Pssst! Want to go to my mother's restaurant?'' In Cuba chances of getting a decent meal at one of the private restaurants are better than in most state-run establishments, where the service tends to be indifferent and the food barely edible. But it is still best to go paladres, private restaurants, that are recommended by guidebooks, rather than those touted by someone on the street. By Marion Burrow.  TRAVEL-TWA-AMERICAN (Undated) _ Airline mergers are notoriously messy, but since AMR Corp., American Airline's parent, bought TWA in a bankruptcy sale in April, it has been working on a grand plan to integrate the two airlines with the least disruption possible. Already TWA's jets are sporting American's red, white and blue stripes, a visible sign of many coming changes. By Laurence Zuckerman.  REGULAR FEATURES  PRACTICAL-TRAVELER-SPA (Undated) - Many resorts now offer spa options for grown-ups seeking to pamper themselves while their children are having fun at events organized for them. By Martha Stevenson Olson.  TRAVEL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ In a dispute with Orbitz, Southwest Airlines has withdrawn its fares from the Airline Tariff Publishing Co. Drivers going to North Myrtle Beach, S.C., now have quicker access with the recent opening of the 28.5-mile Conway Bypass. Some pieces of the collection of sculpture, prints and artifacts from Nunavik (northern Quebec) are on display in an exhibition called ``Traces of our Footsteps'' in Old Montreal. By Heather Camlot.  DEALS (Undated) _ Through Sept. 20, Amtrak is selling a two-for-one weekend fare on its Acela Express high-speed service between Washington and Boston. Renault Eurodrive will offer some automatics for the same price as cars with manuals. On weekends through Sept. 3, introductory rates at the Grand America Hotel in Salt Lake City will begin at $129 a night.

"97063"	"she"	"concluded"	" Suzanne Fraser of Manhattan moved up the memorial service for her husband, Richard, by a full week. Waiting, she concluded, would do no good. Her son, she said, born with a neurological disorder, needed her undivided attention. ``I would love to be able to crawl in bed and cry for six months, but I can't,'' she said. ``I have a kid, and he's sick, and I have to take care of him. Me sitting around for a funeral for six months? That's not going to happen.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200109.gz"

"97519"	"he"	"concluded"	" But in thinking more about the value of comedy, he concluded, ``If I can laugh, I guess I'm still in one piece.'' He added: ``Comedy is a community, for whatever period of time, a half-hour of a television show or an hour in a club. There is a general agreement among whoever is in the room. In this specific space and time we are of like minds. We want to laugh.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"98795"	"he"	"concluded"	" AUSTIN, Texas - Roger Nelson analyzed the data collected in a Princeton, N.J., computer and the results, he concluded, were ``unequivocal.'' ``We do not know if there is such a thing as a global consciousness,'' Nelson wrote, ``but if there is, it was moved by the events of Sept. 11, 2001.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"
"99371"	"he"	"concluded"	" ``Our sense of jeopardy really needs to be rationally tested,'' Berger emphasized as he expressed pride in helping Washington.

"101577"	"she"	"concluded"	" In this case, however, Collins was startled to find that ``so many people stopped me on the street.'' The reason, she concluded, was that ``there is this desire now for some kind of simple feminine uniform'' to replace ``the kind of aggressive, chaotic androgyny'' that characterized the spirit of capital fashion with a capital F. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"
"102425"	"he"	"concluded"	" After offering his withering analysis of Olson's contentions, he concluded, ``The plea stands.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200112.gz"
"104437"	"it"	"concluded"	" Most important, it concluded, the diagnoses made when the cardiologists were watching as the tests were performed were accurate: there were only three minor changes when videos of the tests were reviewed later. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"107173"	"he"	"concluded"	" He admitted under cross-examination that the dogs were in the state they were because of the way they were being handled by Coumbs, who had them chained up. But, he concluded, ``These animals, irrespective of training or anything, I felt were dangerous animals.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"108343"	"he"	"concluded"	" It is, of course, the sky islands' ecological fecundity that prompted the museum to establish a research station here. C. Hart Merriam, an early and influential ecologist, recognized the region's unique richness a century ago. The miraculous layers of life that these ``islands'' sustain dramatize Merriam's breakthrough notion of the life zone. In terms of changing plant and animal communities, he concluded, each 1,000-foot rise in elevation is equivalent to traveling 300 miles north. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"109662"	"he"	"concluded"	" Menzies also described how, on his home computer and with a commercial software package called Starry Night, he reconstructed the Chinese celestial navigation system and traced what he thinks is the epic round-the-world voyage of Zheng He from March 1421 to October 1423. The Chinese, he concluded, explored the coasts of Africa, South America and Australia and sailed into the Caribbean and the Sea of Cortez, off what is now Baja California. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"111286"	"they"	"concluded"	" Brain researchers have explored the split between the brain's two hemispheres for hundreds of years. In the 1960s, Roger Sperry observed patients whose nerve fibers had been severed, separating the two hemispheres completely, and began sketching which side controlled particular cognitive tasks. The left side, they concluded, seems to house language skills, analytical and categorization tasks; the right has been widely associated with novelty, creativity and sometimes emotion. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"113252"	"he"	"concluded"	" Sunderland paused when asked how Shockey compared with noted tight ends like Dave Casper and Bavaro, and he said he didn't want to put pressure on Shockey. But, he concluded, ``You see a player with that type of ability.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"114772"	"he"	"concluded"	" A return to Tisch soured Jed quickly. The students complained about any nontheater courses, he said. Plus, he concluded, ``I do need to get out of the city'' and the lingering bitterness of his parents' divorce and his father's August remarriage. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"116561"	"she"	"concluded"	" Speaking of identity, Bethany Hornthal, a marketing consultant, noted that Silicon Valley had always been a multicultural place where young people felt they could go anywhere in the world and fit in. They were global kids. ``Suddenly after 9/11, that changed,'' she said. ``Suddenly they were Americans, and there was a certain danger in that identity. ((As a result)) the world has become more defined and restricted for them. Now you ask, Where is it safe to go as an American?'' So there is this sense, she concluded, that thanks to technology and globalization, ``the world may have gotten smaller _ but I can't go there anymore.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"116796"	"he"	"concluded"	" It had been, he concluded, ``the pressures and perishing hassles'' of preparing for his journey that had laid him low. Once he realized this, he made another phone call and the trip was back on. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"118768"	"he"	"concluded"	" Superior Court Judge James Warren said Monday that the couple, Marjorie Knoller, 46, and Robert Noel, 60, might be ``the most despised couple in this city,'' but that Knoller's conviction of second-degree murder for her animals' actions was unwarranted because, he concluded, she had no way of knowing her dog would kill someone when she left her apartment that day. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"119532"	"they"	"concluded"	" The game was fun for Gary Sheffield, too. In the last several years, the Mets have made several inquiries about Sheffield but either have been unable to agree on players for a trade or have been unwilling to take a chance on a player with a booming bat but a questionable reputation. The bat, they concluded, was not worth the risk. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"119718"	"he"	"concluded"	" The basic question that troubled the late Justice Harry A. Blackmun eight years ago was this: Does the system accurately and consistently determine which defendants `deserve to die? That question, he said then, ``cannot be answered in the affirmative.'' So, he concluded, ``I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"121449"	"he"	"concluded"	" And, he concluded, the surfer guys won. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"121546"	"he"	"concluded"	" James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer of Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, said the sharp decline in interest rates makes him less worried about the outlook. In addition, he said that the stock market has already been signaling that the economy would have no growth for a quarter or two. So, he concluded, ``I think it's positive that the stock market is essentially up over the last two weeks even though the economic reports are getting weaker.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"122041"	"he"	"concluded"	" In a recent magazine article, Beevor mused on why history has become ``the new novel.'' It has happened in part, he concluded, because the historian has learned to ``merge the stuff of oral history into narrative history.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"122169"	"she"	"concluded"	" The challenge, she concluded, is for Indonesia and its allies to ``be alert to the possibility of individuals making common cause with international criminals'' without undermining the country's fragile democracy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"122251"	"he"	"concluded"	" That someone, he concluded, might as well be himself. So Koskei hit the Heights at full throttle, dashed down the hill and claimed the 30th Falmouth Road Race title and the $11,000 check that came with it, holding off defending champion John Korir, his Kenyan countryman, by three seconds with a time of 32 minutes 10 seconds. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"122966"	"she"	"concluded"	" ``Han Mee crying,'' she announced, settling a debate about her reaction that has raged since her arrest on May 8. Studying the image of her mother, Lee Seong Hee, she concluded, ``Men beating Mommy.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"124004"	"they"	"concluded"	" Yet the policy-makers here also seemed to have an uneasy feeling that they would increasingly be called upon to deal with complex domestic and international issues that would demand activist, imaginative steps on their part. In a crisis, they concluded, their reluctance to put even their limited powers to work would be swept away by an imperative to use monetary and fiscal policy more aggressively than ever. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"124815"	"it"	"concluded"	" The group wrote that ``30 minutes of regular activity is insufficient to maintain body weight in adults in the recommended body mass index range.'' So, it concluded, ``to prevent weight gain as well as to accrue additional weight-independent health benefits of physical activity, 60 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity (e.g. walking/jogging at 4 miles per hour to 5 miles per hour) is recommended in addition to the activities required by a sedentary lifestyle.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"

Fierstein stayed with that show two years, before leaving to take a long break from performing. Which would have worked out just fine had director David Leveaux not called and asked the famously, outrageously, jubilantly gay actor if he might be interested in replacing Alfred Molina as Tevye in the revival of Fiddler on the Roof. After much hand wringing and a personal audition with the musical's creators, Fierstein agreed to take the role, grow the beard and take the biggest risk of his professional life. Along the way, he says, he's discovered how big Tevye's shoes are (see Zero Mostel, Topol, Theodore Bikel) and even found a little religion. How the critics take to his Tevye remains to be seen, but recently Fierstein took a break from rehearsals to talk to Jesse McKinley about making the leap from doing drag to doing deddle-deddle-dum. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz

He was 76.  The cause was pancreatic cancer, his family said.  Over 40 years, from the time his first collection, The Breaking of the Day, won coveted publication in the Yale Younger Poets series, Davison published 11 volumes of poetry. Though they won several awards and praise from figures like Alfred Kazin and W.S. Merwin, they may have been overshadowed by his four decades as a literary editor for the Atlantic Monthly Press and Houghton Mifflin (he edited Ward Just, Robert Coles, Farley Mowat and Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, among others) and by his 30 years as poetry editor of The Atlantic Monthly.  In The Atlantic he published many of America's leading poets (Robert Lowell's Ode to the Union Dead first appeared there), as well as managing patient and occasionally encouraging replies to many thousands of submissions each year.  His own poems are a commonplace book of living by a man with a jaunty, insatiable, speculative appetite for it. He wrote of pigs, rocks, loves, landscapes. Canoeing at dawn on a mirror-smooth bay, he notes the water lapping at the shore and the flurry of birds: The tide at its landward edge/ignited a smudge of commotion. Virgil wrote of the tears in things; in Davison's things, there is the shade of a smile.  He represented the living literary spirit of his city. It was not, of course, the Boston that yielded pride of place to New York after New England giants like Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, Melville and Dickinson were gone. In the 1950s there was a new flowering, especially of poets. Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath, Ann Sexton, Stanley Kunitz, Richard Wilbur, L.E. Sissman and Adrienne Rich were among those who clustered here and at Harvard across the river. Robert Frost came to lecture; Elizabeth Bishop moved here later.  Davison was one of their number, and in 1994 he wrote a memoir of the time and the cohort: The Fading Smile: Poets in Boston, From Robert Frost to Robert Lowell to Sylvia Plath, 1955-1960. Witty, charming and perceptive, it portrayed American poets as a community, at least to the extent that they could constitute one, being contentious, ambitious and rivalrous, with plenty to drink and a fair amount of sex.  Among much else he told of his regular enlistment for Getting Frost Home Before Midnight. Frost was so stimulated after his readings that he had to be walked around Cambridge, talking his way back to earth again, Davison explained. (Davison also had a brief involvement with Plath, he wrote, though she seems to have found him insufficiently scary, while he found her excessively so.)  Peter Davison was born in New York on June 27, 1928, the son of Edward Davison, an English poet, and Natalie Weiner Davison. He was brought up in Boulder, Colo., where his father taught at the University of Colorado and organized gatherings of poets and writers. Frost, Ford Madox Ford and Robert Penn Warren would attend; Natalie Davison had to throw the young Lowell out of one party for bumptiousness.  After graduating from Harvard, Davison spent a year at Cambridge University on the Fulbright Program. He worked for a while at Harcourt Brace and later became assistant to the director of Harvard University Press. In 1966, he joined the Atlantic Monthly Press, where he worked for 29 years, the last 15 as its director. ( Later it later merged with Grove to become Grove/Atlantic.) In the 1980s he joined Houghton Mifflin, retiring several years ago.  Aside from writing poetry and editing it for The Atlantic Monthly, Davison wrote a number of essays on the subject. He could be waspish; a particular irritation was the fashion of ignoring the several past tenses that English offers.  Something like 70 percent of the poems I receive seem to be written in the present indicative, he told an interviewer. They are constantly producing a sort of spectator poetry in which the poet is looking at himself: 'I go out, I look at the wires, there's snow on the wires, a blue jay sits on the wires and knocks off some snow, God I'm lonely.'  Davison's first wife, the former Jane Truslow, died in 1981. In 1984, he married Joan Edelman Goody, a prominent Boston architect and a principal in the firm Goody Clancy. She survives him, along with two children from his first marriage: a son, Angus, of Belmont, Mass., and a daughter, Lesley, of West Palm Beach, Fla.; four grandchildren; and a sister, Lesley Perrin of New York City. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20041231.0167 type=story > <HEADLINE> NYTR-LKL-METH-SID </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> LAKELAND </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz

Eugene Steuerle, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and an architect of President Ronald Reagan's tax overhaul in 1986, noted that personal savings plunged during the last four years even though tax subsidies for retirement accounts increased modestly over the same period. The reason, he theorized, is that many people do not use tax-advantaged accounts to save more money. Instead, they simply move their existing savings into new tax-advantaged accounts when the opportunity arises. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz

(Staff byline TK)  ASIA-QUAKE-INDONESIA (Dateline TK) -- Traveling with Indonesia's president as he visits worst-hit zone. By Jane Perlez.  ASIA-QUAKE-PSYCHOLOGICAL (Undated) -- Providing psychological services for millions who have lost family members, homes and communities in Sri Lanka, Indonesia and other countries will become critical in the coming weeks, officials from the World Health Organization, UNICEF and other relief agencies said Saturday. By Benedict Carey.  IRAQ (Baghdad, Iraq) -- Insurgents belonging to a group led by the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi posted a videotape on the Internet on Saturday showing five men being killed for serving in the Iraqi security forces. In the videotape, the militants warned other Iraqis that they would meet the same fate if they joined the Iraqi police or national guards. By Christine Hauser.  IRAQ-DEATH (Mosul, Iraq) -- A 31-year-old father of four, Capt. Bill Jacobsen was the highest-ranking soldier killed Dec. 21 when a suicide bomber walked into the mess tent at Forward Operating Base Marez in Mosul. His death shattered the troops in the unit he commanded, Alpha Company, 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry Regiment. By Richard A. Oppel Jr.  LIBYA-OIL (Tripoli, Libya) -- For the first time in a decade, a new oil territory is opening up. Reopening, that is. American oil executives have recently been flocking to Libya, crowding the lobby of Tripoli's only luxury hotel and literally standing in line to meet local officials. The executives are bent on finding out whether this oil-rich North African country -- long walled off from foreign investment because of its anti-American regime and ties to terrorist organizations -- could become the next frontier for exploration. By Jad Mouawad.  HAITI-UNREST (Port-Au-Prince, Haiti) -- Nine months after taking office, the interim government of Prime Minister Gerard Latortue is besieged by mounting criticism from every sector of society. Recent street fighting has claimed an estimated 200 lives and left much of Port-au-Prince's business district deserted. Many business owners are in hiding after a wave of kidnappings, and rebel forces control large swaths of the country. By Michael Kamber.  MIDEAST (Jerusalem) -- Mahmoud Abbas, the front-runner in the Palestinian presidential race, received a raucous welcome and was raised onto the shoulders of Palestinian gunmen as he campaigned on Saturday in the southern Gaza Strip, the scene of chronic fighting. By Greg Myre.  AFGHAN-DRUGS (Zaranj, Afghanistan) -- The Margo desert, with its forbidding reputation as the desert of death, deters most travelers, but it is the favored route of drug traffickers taking opium, heroin and hashish produced in Afghanistan to Iran for smuggling to Turkey and Europe. The desert crossing is part of a lucrative drug trade that threatens to turn Afghanistan into a narco-mafia state, U.N. and Afghan officials warn. Afghanistan, the biggest producer of opium in the world, is now the source of 90 percent of the heroin on Europe's street, the U.N. antidrug agency says. By Carlotta Gall.  FALUN-GONG-LAWSUIT (Undated) -- Zhao Zhizhen, the director of a local television station in Wuhan, China, was in New Haven, Conn., last summer, spending time with his daughter after seeing her graduate from Yale. Followers of Falun Gong, a spiritual practice banned in China, found him there and served him with a federal lawsuit. His station's programs, they said, had incited violence against them in China. Suits against Chinese officials by the movement's adherents in courts around the world are not unusual, and the officials typically ignore them. But Zhao, who says the suit challenges his honor as an independent and objective journalist, has taken a different approach. By Adam Liptak.  IRAQ-MOTHERS (Undated) -- As the number of American troops killed in Iraq has risen above 1,300, mothers of the dead have built a grim community of their own. In this network linked by sorrow and empathy, however, one issue divides them: the wisdom of the war. Relatives who believe the war in Iraq was necessary tend to gravitate toward one another, talking little of politics and more of pride, sacrifice and loneliness. And those who questioned the need to invade Iraq, find one another too, wrestling with their doubts about the war and the meaning of their losses. People on each side say they respect those on the other. Still, flashes of tension have crept up at small gatherings and group interviews, and even after condolence sessions with President Bush. By Monica Davey.  SAN-DIEGO-MISMANAGE (San Diego) -- In October 2003, a hunter lost in rural San Diego County set a small signal fire to attract help, igniting the largest wildfire in state history and revealing what proved to be lethal flaws in San Diego's disaster preparedness. The ensuing 14 months have provided an unraveling skein of self-inflicted woe that has tarnished the city's image and left residents wondering who has been minding the civic store. By John M. Broder.  LABOR-NLRB (Undated) -- The rulings of the National Labor Relations Board have poured out one after another in recent months, with many decisions tilting in favor of employers. The party-line decisions have been applauded by the Republican Party's business base, which sees them as bringing balance after rulings that favored labor during the Clinton administration. But some academic experts on labor relations say the recent rulings are so hostile to unions and to collective bargaining that they run counter to the goals of the National Labor Relations Act, the 1935 law that gave Americans the right to form unions. By Steven Greenhouse.  CALIF-HOUSE (San Francisco) -- Those hankering for a 17,000-square-foot Spanish colonial freebie -- a 35-room mansion with wood-beamed ceilings designed in 1926 by a famous California architect -- may be in luck. Earlier this month, the Town Council of Woodside, a horsy, affluent rural enclave about 35 miles south of here, upheld an earlier decision to allow Steve Jobs to demolish the sprawling palazzo he owns but cannot abide, giving him one year to find a historically minded soul with deep pockets willing to dismantle the house and cart it away. Barring further legal action, the decision brings a denouement to a long-running drama that had pitted preservationists from Woodside and beyond against Jobs, the billionaire chief executive of Apple and Pixar, who has called the mansion, built for an earlier captain of industry, the copper baron Daniel C. Jackling, one of the biggest abominations of a house I've ever seen. By Patricia Brown.  CHICAGO-MURDERS (Chicago) -- Chicago, which had the unwanted distinction of having more homicides than any other city in the nation a year ago, seems in a single year to have undergone a remarkable turnaround: It is on track for 2004 to have its lowest tally since 1965.The authorities here credited new policing methods -- surveillance cameras in heavy drug-trafficking areas and more officers on the streets, particularly in the most notorious gang neighborhoods -- for the 25 percent drop, from 598 homicides at the end of 2003 to 447 this year, as of Dec. 30. By Gretchen Ruethling.  2004-DEALS (Undated) -- The greatest (and lamest) deals of 2004. By Andrew Ross Sorkin.  CONGRESS (Washington) -- A more Republican and more conservative Congress convenes on Tuesday, with Republicans intending to use their greater strength in the House and Senate to help President Bush pursue a second-term agenda of major changes in bedrock programs like Social Security and income taxes. By Carl Hulse.  BUSH-BUDGET (Washington) -- To show that President Bush can fulfill his campaign promise to cut the deficit in half by 2009, White House officials are preparing a budget that will assume a significant jump in revenues and omit the cost of major initiatives like overhauling Social Security.

"166673"	"they"	"concluded"	" Nevertheless, they concluded, Our results suggest that good health is more likely to be the result, rather than the cause of taking on work along with family and child-rearing obligations. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200605.gz"
"167281"	"it"	"concluded"	" The report suggested the Army Corps has had trouble keeping up with the fast-changing world of geotechnical engineering, and does not share critical information among its many parts. Although the Corps had indications that the floodwalls might fail under intense storm conditions, the pieces were not put together to solve the puzzle, the report said. More must be done, it concluded, to share information among those who do research and those who design and build systems. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"

"167526"	"he"	"concluded"	" As if to emphasize Perez's point, Evan Shapiro, IFC's executive vice president and general manager, got choked up and his eyes brimmed with tears when he spoke proudly about attending the Tribeca Film Festival premiere of Yo Soy Boricua in April. Running IFC, he concluded, is the best job in the world. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200606.gz"
"170257"	"they"	"concluded"	" The researchers said they believed that it was unlikely that those factors could have accounted for the decreased overall survival time of obese women. The most likely reason, they concluded, is that the presence of fat tissue encourages tumor growth or increases resistance to treatment. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200608.gz"
"170794"	"they"	"concluded"	" Just north of a crater named Erebus, Squyres and his colleagues say, the instruments and camera aboard Opportunity examined layers of a sandstone outcrop named Olympia. The outcrop is crisscrossed by small troughs only inches deep, which the team's geologists determined could not have been formed by wind erosion or volcanism. The only possibility, they concluded, was that they were created by flowing water in the far distance past, 2 billion or more years ago, when Mars might -- just might -- have been warm and wet. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200609.gz"
"171633"	"he"	"concluded"	" The already energy-intensive shoreline along the Gulf of Mexico, he concluded, made the most sense, economically and politically, and he started buying real estate in uninhabited harbors close to existing pipelines and gas-thirsty refineries and petrochemical plants. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"172181"	"we"	"concluded"	" The bottom line is, we concluded, you'll either do it for religious reasons, which don't apply to us, or for social reasons - 'everybody else does it so we need to do it, too, so the poor kid doesn't look different when he grows up,'  Jonas said. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200610.gz"
"173894"	"he"	"concluded"	" In another article in the journal, a scholar not involved in the research, Francois Charette of the University of Munich museum, in Germany, said the new interpretation of the Antikythera Mechanism is highly seductive and convincing in all of its details. It is not the last word, he concluded, but it does provide a new standard, and a wealth of fresh data, for future research. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"
"173969"	"they"	"concluded"	" Barsoum and his co-workers analyzed the mineralogy of samples from several parts of the Khufu pyramid, and said they found mineral ratios that do not exist in any of the known limestone sources. From the geochemical mix of lime, sand and clay, they concluded, the simplest explanation is that it was cast concrete. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200611.gz"

"174229"	"he"	"concluded"	" In a eulogy of his idol Henry Clay, Abraham Lincoln noted that Clay's eloquence did not consist, as many fine specimens of eloquence do, of an elegant arrangement of words and sentences; but rather of that deeply earnest and impassioned tone, and manner, which can proceed only from great sincerity and a thorough conviction, in the speaker of the justice and importance of his cause. This, he concluded, is what enabled Clay truly to touch the chords of human sympathy. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
"174407"	"it"	"concluded"	" The headline on an accompanying editorial in the journal was blunt: Routinely Teaching Breast Self-Exam is Dead. What Does This Mean? Doctors, it concluded, should stop teaching breast self-exam, spend a little longer on clinical breast exams and find ways to teach women about painless lumps. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200612.gz"
