"159453"	"I"	"said.meanwhile"	" After three months of harassment I finally got a restraining order. My student was not allowed within a football-field length of my third-floor office, which meant that if she wanted to get near the English department, she would have to hover on a cloud outside. The department chairman came to my office one day and asked if I would show the student mercy and allow her at least to go to the English department offices. Of course, I said.Meanwhile, my divorce took on a sad life of its own, as divorces tend to do. At one point our court-ordered counselor told my wife and me that we were the most mature divorcing couple she had ever worked with. And it is true we were very well behaved. There were no threats or ugly outbursts. But our divorce was still the most painful thing I had ever been through. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200511.gz"
