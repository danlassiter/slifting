The expert, Frederick C. Cuny, who has worked on emergency relief projects in Biafra, Bosnia, Ethiopia and Somalia, was last heard from in Chechnya nine days ago.   The Soros Foundations hired Cuny to manage a project in Chechnya to help refugees who have fled the Russian offensive against the breakaway region as well as people who have stayed behind in Grozny, the battle-scarred Chechen capital.   Morton Abramowitz, a close friend of Cuny's who is president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Tuesday that he feared that Cuny was badly wounded or was being detained by one of the sides in the Chechen conflict.   ``There was some talk that he was a prisoner and the Russians had him and the Russians deny it,'' said Abramowitz.   NEW DELHI (NYT) -- Robert E. Rubin's first venture abroad to strengthen alliances through economic diplomacy suffered a surprise reversal of fortunes Tuesday when the treasury secretary found himself constantly crossing paths with another state visitor whom the United States has been struggling to isolate: President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran.   Rubin said that until last weekend, when he was attending a meeting of finance ministers in Indonesia, he was unaware that Rafsanjani and his delegation of 100 officials would be arriving just hours ahead of him, for three days of talks that included the possibility of building a of building of an oil pipeline to run between the two countries.   ``Clearly, we would have rescheduled, if we had known in a timely fashion,'' a chagrined Rubin said Tuesday. Shortly before, in what was originally intended as a relationship-building meeting with India's prime minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, Rubin felt obliged to remind his host in ``fairly clear terms,'' that the United States viewed Iran as an outlaw nation that supports terrorsim.   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (NYT) -- At least 62 people, most of them women and children, were killed last week in an unclaimed attack on a village near the Liberian port city of Buchanan, officials of the United Nations Children's Fund said Tuesday.   In the attack, the bloodiest incident in a recent flair-up of violence in Liberia's five-year old civil war, UNICEF officials said that unidentified fighters surrounded the village of Yosi and proceeded to hack its residents to death with machetes.   International relief agency officials based in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, said that no foreigners had yet been able to visit the scene of the massacre, details of which have come from injured survivors who have made their way to Buchanan, 20 miles away.   On Tuesday, a United Nations helicopter ferried four of the most gravely wounded survivors to Monrovia for treatment. Officials of Medecins Sans Frontieres, the French relief agency said that the injured included a badly slashed infant, a pregnant woman who had been repeatedly raped, causing a miscarriage, and a young girl whose head was partially split open by machete blow.   HEBRON, Israeli-Occupied West Bank (NYT) -- By the thousands, Israelis flooded into Hebron Tuesday to worship at the Cave of the Patriarchs shrine, prayers that for many were also a bitter anti-government protest.   This is Passover week, when Israel slows to a crawl and many people skip work. It has been seized by religious and political critics of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin as an opportunity to rally large crowds and, they hope, show that his peace policies lack popular support.   On Monday, an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 protestors marched 10 miles from the western edge of the West Bank to the coastal city of Netanya, passing on the way an intersection where 21 Israelis were killed in January by Palestinian suicide bombers. The point was to show how narrow Israeli territory is there, able to be crossed in a few hours on foot and a few minutes by car -- a vulnerable strip, they argued, should a hostile Palestinian state rise in the West Bank.   PARIS (NYT) -- France threatened Tuesday to withdraw its 4,530 peacekeeping troops from Bosnia unless its diplomatic partners and the United Nations could ensure their safety, get the belligerents back to the negotiating table and extend a ceasefire set to expire at the end of this month.   A statement issued by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur after a special cabinet session called in outrage over the killing of two French soldiers in Sarajevo last weekend said that if the safety of the peacekeepers could not be assured, France ``would be forced to decide on a withdrawal of the French soldiers in Bosnia.''   Foreign Minister Alain Juppe flew to New York and asked U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council to discuss what French officials said was a deteriorating security situation in Bosnia.   ``What we are looking for is action by the international community to avert the necessity of a withdrawal, not an excuse to leave,'' one of Juppe's aides said.  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950418.0202 type=story > <HEADLINE> PAKISTANI YOUTH, 12, CITED FOR RIGHTS WORK, MURDERED </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-YOUTH-SHOT-BOS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199504.gz"

In fact, she and her family were sheltered in the embassy after the 1956 Hungarian revolution.   ``My parents were Hungarian journalists on the run, and they spent part of my childhood in prison on false charges of being CIA agents,'' she said. ``After they got out, we lived in the embassy for a few weeks.''   That's not her only attachment to Budapest. ``We did part of our courting there,'' she said. ``Richard was ambassador to Germany when we started this grand romance, and we made our first trip together there.''   Holbrooke served in that post briefly last year.   Ms. Marton was recently divorced from Jennings after a two-year separation. They have two children, as does Holbrooke.   ``Richard asked me to marry him a year ago,'' she said. ``I don't want to gush, but I didn't realize such happiness was possible at our ripe age. We have a very grown-up relationship.''   She is 45, and he is 53.   NEW YORK -- Talk about stress in the workplace. On Saturday, the last day of the Metropolitan Opera season, Placido Domingo will sing the title role in Wagner's ``Parsifal,'' and in the evening he will conduct Puccini's ``Madama Butterfly.''   ``It was coincidence,'' Domingo said Wednesday. And when the scheduling people at the Met realized it, they offered to replace him as conductor with Samuel Cristler.   Had the order of the two operas been reversed, he might have accepted the offer. ``I couldn't conduct in the afternoon and sing in the evening because conducting takes a lot of your breathing and you need all the support for singing,'' the tenor said. ``This will be unique.''   It certainly will. ``Parsifal,'' which begins at noon, won't end until about 5:30, and ``Madama Butterfy'' starts at 8 and lasts until 11.   Domingo sounded relaxed, though. ``I will have two and a half hours between,'' he said, ``during which I will rest a bit, put myself to sleep, I hope, and then have a light meal.''  </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950419.0486 type=story > <HEADLINE> TERROR BLAST SHOCKS A NORMALLY QUIET TOWN </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla.

DAVID LETTERMAN ``LATE SHOW'' TOP TEN  Bob Dole Complaints About Hollywood  10. Why pay seven bucks to see boozing and adultery when you can watch Democrats for free?  9. No Academy Award for grouchiest senator.  8. Not enough Fonzie.  7. In ``Don Juan Demarco,'' Marlon Brando shows way too much cleavage.  6. Those ``Baywatch'' babes never seem to get it on with conservative old coots.  5. Why couldn't Gump shake hands with a senate majority leader instead of President Kennedy?  4. ``Casper the Friendly Ghost''? More like ``Casper the Bare-Ass Naked Ghost''!  3. Gets sick to stomach watching Letterman at the concession stand (videotape of Letterman buttering his face)  2. ``Dumb and Dumber'' was clearly propaganda for the Clinton/Gore ticket.  1. That creepy Richard Simmons guy (Simmons busts into theater).  BILL'S WORLD  By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star  Overheard on our bus: ``It's beginning to look as if O.J. stands for 0 jurors.''  Another way to think of Judge Ito is as a baseball manager who already has used up his bench and bullpen by only the 6th inning.  If there's a Simpson mistrial because of too few jurors, officials next time should know better. They should pick 12 jurors with no human flaws.  Maybe this big debate about sleaze coming from the entertainment industry could have been avoided had the place been named Hollywoodn't.  ``I agree with a lot of what Senator Dole said'' about Hollywood, Mr. Clinton says. This is what you call crypartisanism.  Gerald Ford says Bob Dole will get the GOP presidential nomination ``unless he makes a mistake or stumbles.'' Similarly, the federal government will balance the budget _ unless it spends more than it takes in.  ``I'm not happy with everything that's happening in Bosnia,'' says Mr. Clinton. Nor, we hope, in Washington.  ``Homeownership,'' the president says, ``encourages savings and investment.'' Especially if you're the plumber or electrician paid by the homeowner.  ``Vice President Gore is the most involved vice president in the history of the country,'' says Mr. Clinton. Isn't that like calling someone the most successful Cubs' manager in 50 years?  Bill Clinton says he intends to run again in 1996 with Al Gore. It's unclear, however, whether Gore will wait for a better offer.  CITY STREETS  Child, age 3-ish, while inserting an assortment of colored pegs into a pegboard: Mommy, tell me about making decisions.  Mother: Well, you make decisions about what you are going to do or how you are going to do something. Right now you are deciding where to put the pegs. You are making decisions.  Child: No, I'm not making decisions. I'm making a horse.  Place: Belasco Theater, West 44th Street.  Time: Opening night of ``Hamlet.'' Following a two-hour first act, my friend Amy and I head for the ladies' room. ``You know,'' I say, ``it would be nice if they could all get married and live happily ever after, but they all die at the end.''  Suddenly, a voice raised in disbelief and disappointment comes from behind me. ``They all die at the end?!''  I spin around, heart pounding, mind racing: This woman spent $65, sat through two hours and I've ruined the play for her. Maybe I should issue an apology. Maybe I should deny everything, in hopes of keeping her dangling. Instead, I turn away. I turn to face her again. This time she's smiling mischievously.  Note from a friend:  Cocktail talk, between fistfuls of peanuts at the Algonquin.  The topic at one table was charge accounts. ``You won't believe what happened last week,'' Woman No. 1 said. `` `Pay per view' refused to connect me with a movie because they said I owed too much.''  ``How humiliating!'' her companion sympathized.  ``Tell me!'' Woman No. 1 said. ``Even Bloomingdale's never did that.''  ``I'll drink to that,'' Woman No. 2 said.  And so they did.  Christopher Gammill is strolling on East 64th Street on a warm spring evening when a limo pulls up. A father and his 3- or 4-year-old daughter emerge.  A young woman and her golden retriever are passing by at the same time.  ``Don't bite the dog!'' the father says. ``Don't bite the dog!''  ``Oh, don't worry,'' the retriever's owner says. ``My dog won't bite her.''  ``You don't understand,'' Dad says, pointing to his daughter. ``She likes to bite dogs.''  To be filed under ``W,'' as in ``Who says New Yorkers aren't friendly?''  The place is Sheridan Square, where the fluffiest dog bounces along, trying to keep up with its owner. From the other direction stomps a body-builder type, leather jacket, tattoos, the works. As they pass one another, fluffy stops to sneeze, then ambles on. Mr. Muscle looks back over his broad shoulders. ``God bless,'' he says in a rumbling voice.  GOOD DAY, WIRE WANDERERS!!!!!  Offer not available in any store! (Or any other news service!)

DOLE-GRAMM  WASHINGTON _ Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas keeps GOP presidential rival Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas off the Senate-House conference committee on the budget. By MARIA RECIO. Story will move in ``w'' Washington category.  IMMIGRATION-CHANGES  WASHINGTON _ Former U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan of Texas, who was chairwoman of a committee looking into immigration, suggests cutting back on illegal immigration by putting a premium on skilled workers. By MICHAEL D. TOWLE. Story will move in ``w'' Washington category.  BRIGHT STUDENTS-PERILS  UNDATED _ A Harvard University pre-med student hacks her roommate to death before hanging herself. A Fort Worth, Texas, honor student is accused of masterminding a fake bomb scare that resembled some aspects of the deadly explosion in Oklahoma. How tragic, the public murmurs. How sad. But because these episodes involved talented, high-achieving students, another collective thought comes to mind: What could they possibly have been thinking? By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ. Story has moved in both ``l'' lifestyle and ``a'' general news categories.  COUSCOUS  UNDATED _ It sounds like a name you might call your cat when you chuck her under the chin; it looks like a grain of rice that hasn't yet reached puberty. No wonder supermarkets don't know where to stock couscous. Identified with Morocco and the rest of North Africa, couscous (pronounced KOOS-koos) is really nothing more than another pasta shape. In the United States, sales have grown 20 percent to 25 percent a year since 1989. Some recipes involving couscous are included. Story has moved in two takes in ``d'' food and dining category.  PICKLES  UNDATED _ Here's a tale about a pickle recipe that's so good, the son of the author, in one of his first sentences, said, ``I want Mommy's pickles.'' By BEVERLY BUNDY. Story has moved in ``d'' food and dining category.  FOOD-BUNDY-COLUMN  UNDATED _ Recipes galore involving Kellogg's Corn Flakes. By BEVERLY BUNDY. Story has moved in ``d'' food and dining category.  FOOD-CHAPMAN-COLUMN  UNDATED _ The statistics out there are too encouraging for men: The U.S. variety of the male species is programmed to die because of his food habits. But that can change with a little work. By ART CHAPMAN. Story has moved in ``d'' food and dining category.  FOOD-NOTES  UNDATED _ Quick hits from the chopping block, including items on Grey Poupon mustard, books for vegetarians, the ``Better Homes and Gardens'' cookbook, cooking via the Internet, table manners, new products and cooking videos for hunters. By BEVERLY BUNDY and JUNE NAYLOR RODRIGUEZ. Story has moved in two takes in ``d'' food and dining category.  ROCK-QUEENSRYCHE  UNDATED _ It's no question that the members of Seattle's Queensryche had earned a vacation at the end of the world tour that followed their 1990 CD ``Empire.'' The band had put out five CDs in seven years. It had pulled itself up from the ranks of opening for AC/DC and Def Leppard to arena-headliner status with the success of the ``Operation: Mindcrime'' CD and the success of ``Empire'' via the hits ``Silent Lucidity'' and ``Jet City Woman.'' Now the band is back after a period of self-reflection. By DAVE FERMAN. Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment category. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950607.0404 type=other > <DATELINE>  (BC-BONG-BULL-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> No. 323 for May 24-25  The Burned-Out Newspapercreatures Guild endorses U.S. Sen. and presidential candidate Phil Gramm for his courageous stand against the Hollywood liberal moguls' insidious grip on soft porn movie financing, and this is BONG Bull No. 323!  BULLETIN FROM THE WORLD PRESS CONSPIRACY COUNCIL. The Internet places where journalists gather have become tarbabies of La Brea proportion, pulling in loonies who post messages such as ``Peter Jennings phone me!'' And the worldwide press conspiracy is a prominent whipping boy, now that every stool-sitter in every cowboy bar has heard from a guy down at the yard's barber about the microchips in the money and the black helicopters, and how the press is setting up the big takeover.  The proof of a conspiracy is that no one has mentioned the real microchips -- the ones in the beer labels, so secret that they're not even being denied.  But the press has some serious defenders, even if they seem to be giggling as they post. A typical message: ``As we like to say in our shop, we don't have enough TIME to create a conspiracy, and we sure don't have the manpower to perpetuate it. And if we did, breaking news from O.J. would probably kill it, and we sure as hell can't take any time from sports and weather.''  HEADS WILL ROLL. Michele Dula Baum, now checking for clues at The Chattanooga Times, (MDulaBaol.com) reports, ``Back in the early '80s, when Gene Autry remarried at an elderly age, a night editor at The Johnstown (Pa.) Tribune-Democrat mused that `He's Back In the Saddle Again' but rejected it as too risque. The next morning, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ran with it. Alas, those opportunities for double entendre are far too rare to pass up.''  -- George Hesselberg (hessstatejournal.madison.com) of the Wisconsin State Journal advises, ``There were three of us left in the old Wisconsin State Journal newsroom the night Nixon fired Archibald Cox. We were finishing our Old Milwaukees ($1.10 a six pack from the Shamrock across from the Capitol) when the word came.  ``Steve Lovejoy, myself and Richard Schwarz (we all co-authored a book, Cocktails at Molotovs, consisting of newsroom bulletin board offerings, never printed, of course). Anyway Lovejoy grabs a sheet of copy paper and types out a top line: Nixon Sacks Cox, rolls it up and stuffs it into the tube and sends it on its way. Of course, deadlines were past and no one was around, but we had a great time imagining we could get it into the paper.  ``We were all late night cop reporters trained by the legendary June Dieckmann (This is Junie, baby), who had a Pabst IV in the hospital when she got her throat cancer cut out. She carried a two-shot derringer and a sixpack in her purse, never wore stockings (in Wisconsin) and cried when she put up the office Christmas tree alone every year.''  Yes, well, a fine story, George, and illustrative of your well-earned title of Most Dangerous Columnist in Wisconsin. And, um, how much is Old Milwaukee this week?  CORRECTION. Time to get serious.  Some members of the Pendulum mailing list on the Internet are sensitive to possible stigma that might be attached to those with a mental disorder (in this case, bipolar disorder), and quickly responded to BONG Bull 322's item about cartoonist Scott Adams on computer users being the sex symbols of the 90's. They point out that Adams' article was a repost to Pendulum, not written originally for it. (A list member's further repost reached BONG with the original source data lopped off.)  As we told Pendulum, it is BONG's policy to credit material from other sources as best we can, partly because when BONGers don't get information on how to sign onto other keen sources, flame mail arrives. We logged onto the list for a few days last week, received lots of e- mail from it, and found its members to be amusing and personable individuals. As for Pendulum, Ed Arnold (eraucar.edu) invites contacts from people who seek other people who care. Arnold's non- computer links: P.O.

With or without computer skills, the great undiscovered romance opportunity of our age is that cynical, crusty pro chewing down the last half of the last cigar in newspaperdom, right there in the lonely corner of your newsroom. Half-close your eyes (it blurs the cigar) and see him or her in a new light:  -- Burnouts are always available, once you get past their initial suspicion that you're warming them up for a new project team.  -- Burnouts know things. Useful things, like how to drop in on refreshments-provided staff meetings before the cold cuts are gone, but after the worst of the blather. They can find other people who don't want to be found. They employ exciting new methods to make office machines work after the dayside experts have gone home.  -- Burnouts' nose for news is hyperdeveloped, though often in different ways from their cop shop days. Like, they mysteriously know which glitched candy machine in the building is giving away Snickers bars 14 for a quarter, even if the machine is three floors underground and even the publisher doesn't go there.  -- When the burnout looks good to you, it's proof that you finally have overcome the meddlesome influences of childhood mentors, parents and clergy.  -- Other people are not rivals for the attentions of burnouts.  BONG GETS INK. Editor &AMP; Publisher goes for big streetrack sales in its May 13 issue with the Chief Copyboy's article, ``What I Would Study if I Went Back to College.'' It was an essay question for a doctoral program, written before anybody said you had to be a graduate before you can get into a post-grad program. So it went to E&AMP;P. Waste not, want not.  CATALOG SHOPPE. The famous BONG Pejorative Posters, listing more than 120 newspaper names, except the names -- Slimes, Crimes, Mess, Pest -- aren't what the publisher wishes the staff and public would call them; 11-by-17, $3 each postpaid to any address in North America.

The Further Adventures of Herman ``Speed'' Graphic, Ace Photographer for the Chagrin Falls Commercial Scimitar, and his Faithful Companion, Typo the Wonder Pig.  PANEL ONE: A slightly harried Typo greets his pal as Speed returns from the coffee desk wearing his trenchcoat, a deathbed gift from an ancient mystic wire service executive editor on a fog-shrouded eastern island, and declares, ``Ah, Boss, you're back! The results of the new Employee Sensitivity Survey are about to be posted!''  Speed queries, ``Employee sensi -- what?''  PANEL TWO: Typo explains, ``Right, Boss! You were upstairs discussing your South Bend trip with Features Editor Hyperba Lee so I filled it out for you and signed your name! Look, the secret results show that photographers see themselves as lovable, friendly, courteous and hard-working! And so do sports writers!''  Speed demands, ``Friendly, courteous -- sports writers?''  PANEL THREE: Glancing at the door, Typo reads on, ``In fact, every department saw itself as lovable, friendly, courteous and hard-working except the copy desk, which added contumelious and lubricious about themselves, jejune in reference to the editorial writers!''  Speed queries, ``Je-what? Editorial write -- ?''  PANEL FOUR: Sliding the print washer across the doorway, Typo explicates, ``Indeed, Boss! In fact, the results become really interesting when departments describe other departments, especially your spine-tingling analysis of the whole organization chart, with candid photos from the press convention! Positively ingenious! Prodigal, they'll sing of you! It's a best-seller!''  Speed requests, ``My analysis of -- ?''  PANEL FIVE: Stepping onto the window ledge and reaching for the downspout, Typo declaims, ``Historic, Boss! You'll be legendary among personnel consultants! And take your time with your doughnut -- it'll be at least six minutes before they get the battering ram in place, and nothing will happen to the negatives, I have them all safely with me!''

Another way to think of Judge Ito is as a baseball manager who already has used up his bench and bullpen by only the 6th inning.  If there's a Simpson mistrial because of too few jurors, officials next time should know better. They should pick 12 jurors with no human flaws.  Maybe this big debate about sleaze coming from the entertainment industry could have been avoided had the place been named Hollywoodn't.  ``I agree with a lot of what Senator Dole said'' about Hollywood, Mr. Clinton says. This is what you call crypartisanism.  Gerald Ford says Bob Dole will get the GOP presidential nomination ``unless he makes a mistake or stumbles.'' Similarly, the federal government will balance the budget _ unless it spends more than it takes in.  ``I'm not happy with everything that's happening in Bosnia,'' says Mr. Clinton. Nor, we hope, in Washington.  ``Homeownership,'' the president says, ``encourages savings and investment.'' Especially if you're the plumber or electrician paid by the homeowner.  ``Vice President Gore is the most involved vice president in the history of the country,'' says Mr. Clinton. Isn't that like calling someone the most successful Cubs' manager in 50 years?  Bill Clinton says he intends to run again in 1996 with Al Gore. It's unclear, however, whether Gore will wait for a better offer.  CITY STREETS  Child, age 3-ish, while inserting an assortment of colored pegs into a pegboard: Mommy, tell me about making decisions.  Mother: Well, you make decisions about what you are going to do or how you are going to do something. Right now you are deciding where to put the pegs. You are making decisions.  Child: No, I'm not making decisions. I'm making a horse.  Place: Belasco Theater, West 44th Street.  Time: Opening night of ``Hamlet.'' Following a two-hour first act, my friend Amy and I head for the ladies' room. ``You know,'' I say, ``it would be nice if they could all get married and live happily ever after, but they all die at the end.''  Suddenly, a voice raised in disbelief and disappointment comes from behind me. ``They all die at the end?!''  I spin around, heart pounding, mind racing: This woman spent $65, sat through two hours and I've ruined the play for her. Maybe I should issue an apology. Maybe I should deny everything, in hopes of keeping her dangling. Instead, I turn away. I turn to face her again. This time she's smiling mischievously.  Note from a friend:  Cocktail talk, between fistfuls of peanuts at the Algonquin.  The topic at one table was charge accounts. ``You won't believe what happened last week,'' Woman No. 1 said. `` `Pay per view' refused to connect me with a movie because they said I owed too much.''  ``How humiliating!'' her companion sympathized.  ``Tell me!'' Woman No. 1 said. ``Even Bloomingdale's never did that.''  ``I'll drink to that,'' Woman No. 2 said.  And so they did.  Christopher Gammill is strolling on East 64th Street on a warm spring evening when a limo pulls up. A father and his 3- or 4-year-old daughter emerge.  A young woman and her golden retriever are passing by at the same time.  ``Don't bite the dog!'' the father says. ``Don't bite the dog!''  ``Oh, don't worry,'' the retriever's owner says. ``My dog won't bite her.''  ``You don't understand,'' Dad says, pointing to his daughter. ``She likes to bite dogs.''  To be filed under ``W,'' as in ``Who says New Yorkers aren't friendly?''  The place is Sheridan Square, where the fluffiest dog bounces along, trying to keep up with its owner. From the other direction stomps a body-builder type, leather jacket, tattoos, the works. As they pass one another, fluffy stops to sneeze, then ambles on.

The BONG spinoff column, exploring the dialogue found in the thousands of Usenet special-interest groups, this week finds some Internet ``personals'' areas. And what do you know, if you're looking for love in soc.men and soc.women (group names), forget it. That's where you go to get yelled at by members of the opposite sex who think you're selfish, too fussy about appearances, ignorant of personal hygiene, insensitive, overbearing and can't manage a zipper.  And so's your meddlesome mother.  But actually there's hope for a relationship if you're tall, unmarried and want to pose for watercolor. There is also great wisdom available for those who want to steal books. It's all in this week's News From the Net by Charles Stough, weekly from the New York Times News Service, the most noble wire service of them all.  Alas, there are no plans to distribute NFTN to BONG's on-line members. But if they call up and harass their local managing editors into running the column, lo! magic will happen.  MORE ABOUT THE CITY OF PUNDITS. Faithful readers will recall the BONG crusade to have all the world's columnists, editorial writers and cartoonists emigrate to isolated Sanderson, Texas, rocketing their output to distant newsrooms by electronic means and establishing a majority in the little burg that can set its own rules of behavior, assuming they want any.  Comes now this unrehearsed, unsolicited report from Gene Charleton (e-charleton (at) tamu.edu) of the Texas A&AMP;M Office of University Relations :  ``All the good things your correspondent reports about Terrell County and Sanderson, Texas, are true. But you don't know what you're asking when you call for volunteers to confirm them. Sanderson is a long way from everywhere, y'all. Even in Texas. Except maybe Dryden and the Gage Hotel in Marathon.  ``Sanderson is idyllic because crime and urban blight just don't know where to find it. I mean, Sanderson's idea of crime prevention used to be the sign on the convenience store door that read (approximately) `Stickup artists please remove ski masks and unload pistols before entering.'' ' Is that great or what? A town that's like being at sea, only the waves don't make your stomach want to get out and paddle home alone.  But there's more. David P. Garland (garland (at) hti.net), a photographer in Austin, Texas, amplifies:  ``In 1987, the Amtrak Sunset Limited was stranded at the Sanderson station for several hours because of a freight train derailment ahead.  The people of Sanderson got together and put on a barbecue for the passengers on the train. The event made the news wires and is still talked about today on the railroad.'' Plenty of office space for rent there, he said. And if you just go sit on the tracks for a few hours, they feed you!  DISPATCH FROM THE DOWN UNDER BUREAU. Peter Ford of the Seven TV Network in Sydney, Australia (psford (at) ozemail.com.au) relates, ``G'day colleagues: I've been reading editions of BONG for the past two months and it's terrific. We haven't seen pioneering journalism like this since Clements left Hannibal with his newfangled typewriter.  ``I'm with the Seven Television Network (we number them down here instead of giving them letters such as CBS and NBC) in Sydney, and like the States, newsrooms here have their own special brand of mental deviation.  ``A Colleague With Another Network (and Who Shall Remain Nameless Outside These Shores) has made a name for himself with his unwittingly colourful leads over the years.

Colleagues will swear on a case of Fosters this is absolutely true. Yours in journalism, Peter Ford.'' Ford admits to 14 years in the States as a news anchor with CNN and NBC in Miami and Washington, D.C. ``I came back here because I missed the Outback deserts, and have reacquired an Aussie accent -- like the Midwest in geography and twang, except you talk through your nose -- it makes drinking beer easier.

Of more than 4,000 requests to the web page, Linksvayer reports, ``One issue, 326, has been read over 700 times. The reason?

Abate, had been asking Wendi Paster, the New York City chief of staff for Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, ``When are we ever going to get married?''  The couple, who had been engaged since February, had decided to marry in September and, in fact, got a marriage license in August.  But, they explained Friday, they could never carve out the time to set a date or find a place.  ``We spent a lot of time working for our bosses and volunteering for political events, so we had trouble putting together a party for ourselves,'' Lowenstein said.  Then, on the subway to work Wednesday, Ms. Paster announced, ``Today.''  ``We know enough judges,'' she said, ``and I figured we could call one and be married on our lunch hour.''  At 1 p.m., they were wed by Judge Rosalyn H. Richter of Manhattan Criminal Court in her chambers, with Gottfried and his wife, Louise (who lent Ms. Paster her wedding ring), as witnesses. After lunch at a Vietnamese restaurant, they went back to work.  Lowenstein was responsible for a fund-raising event that evening for Sen. Abate.  A honeymoon this weekend? Not a chance. Lowenstein's mother, Ellie Lowenstein, is running for the planning and zoning board in Westport, Conn., so the newlyweds are campaigning there for her.  ``We're still going to have a wedding with a rabbi and a big party,'' Ms. Paster vowed. ``But things are gearing up for the legislative session in Albany, plus there are the presidential primaries, the congressional and state races . . . ''  c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  It was one of those moments of truth on the lecture circuit in New York: big-name speakers facing a sparse audience. Most of the panel at a symposium on how movies and television depict the legal profession ignored the fact that fewer than 150 of the 500 seats were filled in the Great Hall of the New York City Bar Association.  But in his speech at the concluding session Thursday, Edwin Sherin, an executive producer of ``Law and Order,'' the hit television series, confronted the situation head-on.  ``I expected standing-room-only crowds,'' Sherin said of the bar association's program, which included the actor Sam Waterston; Justice Edwin Torres of the state Supreme Court, who is also a crime novelist, and Thomas H. Baer, a movie producer and lawyer.  ``This is somewhat of a shock,'' Sherin said. ``I would have thought that all those cars doubled-parked outside were people coming in this evening.''  ``I was a performer for many years,'' he continued, ``so when I look out and see such a sparse and, I hope, active group, I get somewhat disturbed, and I am reminded of the significant failures that I participated in during my career in the theater, television and film.  ``But I am very happy to say that `Law and Order' is not one of them.'' </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950922.0490 type=story > <HEADLINE> AS O.J.

Friends of Janet Pope, a decorative artist in Baltimore, shake their heads in awe at her weight loss _ 56 pounds in 13 months _ accomplished, like Ms. McCullough's, by cutting down on carbohydrates and concentrating on protein. Buoyed by these testimonials filling my ear, driven by curiosity and burdened with 14 surplus pounds, I joined the protein packers for five weeks, in direct opposition to my normal, deeply committed, plant-based complex-carbohydrate life. Ultimately, I lost weight, gained new admiration for protein, kept my respect for complex carbohydrates and began to question some of the very tenets of dietary dogma. By Suzanne Hamlin.

INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  MIDEAST-SUMMIT (Sharm El Sheik, Egypt) _ In one sense, the more than two dozen world leaders gathering at this Sinai resort Wednesday to prop up the tottering Middle East peace effort will have succeeded just by showing up, according to some of the sponsors. By Douglas Jehl.  (ART ADV: Locator map has been sent to NYT graphics clients.)  MIDEAST-INTEL (Washington) _ When the television lights go out after the anti-terrorism summit meeting in Egypt on Wednesday, the real work will begin in the dark: an international effort to form a counter-terrorism alliance involving the espionage services of half a dozen nations.

KREMLINOLOGY-EDUC (Undated) _ With breathtaking suddenness in 1991, the cadre of academicians popularly known as Kremlinologists _ pampered and privileged by years of federal, foundation and academic patronage _ found themselves outmoded. The Soviet Union had collapsed, the Cold War was over and they, despite their vaunted scholarship, linguistic proficiency and esoteric reporting skills, had utterly failed to forsee one of the turning points of the 20th century.

The worst three-pointing team in the Big West dropped in _ what else? _ a three-pointer to win its conference tournament and now has a date with Kentucky in the first round of the NCAA tournament  LIVING (Moved in ``d'' category)  KOREAN-GROCERS (New York) _ For years, the Jungs, who moved the family to New York from Seoul, South Korea, in 1983, have worked to send their daughters to good schools and, they hope, better lives. For the children, it has worked out; one is at Harvard, one at Bryan Mawr. But things aren't looking so good for their parents. There is a glut of small groceries in the city now, and it looks as if they will lose their business. By Elaine Louie.  PROTEIN-DIET (Undated) _ Frank McCullough, a book editor in Manhattan who has lost 60 pounds in the last year, is relishing the response of people who haven't seen her for a while (``Is that really you, Frank?''). Friends of Janet Pope, a decorative artist in Baltimore, shake their heads in awe at her weight loss _ 56 pounds in 13 months _ accomplished, like Ms. McCullough's, by cutting down on carbohydrates and concentrating on protein. Buoyed by these testimonials filling my ear, driven by curiosity and burdened with 14 surplus pounds, I joined the protein packers for five weeks, in direct opposition to my normal, deeply committed, plant-based complex-carbohydrate life. Ultimately, I lost weight, gained new admiration for protein, kept my respect for complex carbohydrates and began to question some of the very tenets of dietary dogma. By Suzanne Hamlin.

"54224"	"I"	"hope"	" Exposing the truth will not bring him back, but it will help erase a blot on the American judicial system and, I hope, save others from a similar fate. If we can learn from the travesty of the Hauptmann case, then it will give purpose to an otherwise senseless death. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199604.gz"

"62588"	"I"	"hope"	" The itinerant Olympic flame went out while visiting the White House last week, which, I hope, is no sign of things to come. The U.S. Track and Field Trials at the new stadium would give us a sort of preview of the Glorious Event as a side effect, it was supposed. First, it has been a disappointment at the gate.

GENERAL  EXCLUSIVE-CARTER-RELIGION-NYT (Plains, Ga.) _ As he strolled into the simple sanctuary of Maranatha Baptist Church, the Bible-toting Sunday school teacher was greeted by instant applause and an explosion of flashbulbs. ``Good morning everybody,'' Jimmy Carter said with a smile. ``Good morning,'' his 250 pupils responded in unison. By Kevin Sacks. W/photo. Moved 12-15.  PROFILE-NYE-BOS (Lexington, Mass.) _ Joseph S. Nye Jr. knows about weapons systems not even Tom Clancy can tell you about. What he says about U.S. policy in Asia is carefully tracked in Tokyo and Beijing. He is extremely close friends with the retired chief of the CIA. And he raises chickens. By John Yemma. W/photo. Moved 12-18.  CONDIT-PROFILE-SFCHRON (Washington) _ The son of an Oklahoma Baptist preacher, U.S. Rep. Gary Condit is a walking contradiction. At 48, he still radiates clean-cut boyishness _ but he's nobody's patsy. By Carolyn Lochhead. Moved 12-18.  STEPHANOPOULOS-LEGACY-NYT (Washington) _ It is a tiny warren, cluttered with coffee cups and crumpled papers, Greek icons, a bottle or two of expensive wine and row upon row of books. But in a world where proximity is power, the White House office of George Stephanopoulos, right next to the Oval Office, is the ultimate address. By Todd Purdum. W/photo. Moved 12-13.  PROFILE-SCHROEDER-BOS (Washington) _ Rep. Patricia Schroeder 56 blazed a trail 24 years ago in an institution that was hostile to women, particularly to brash and independent ones. ``It was a jock-ocracy,'' recalled Schroeder, whose wit made her a legend on Capitol Hill. ``People just forget what it was like.''

Moved 12-18.  MOTHER-FILM-$ADV22-NYT (Undated) _ There is a moment in the trailer for ``Mother,'' the new comedy by the director Albert Brooks opening Christmas Day, that says it all. Portraying one side of a telephone conversation about the movie, Brooks brags about landing the ``legendary Debbie Reynolds'' for the title role. A long pause ensues. A frown creases his face. ``No,'' he adds with a huff. ``She's (italics)not(end italics) dead.'' By Frank Bruni. Moved 12-18 for release 12-22.  FLYNT-LARRY-SPI (Seattle) _ Smut merchant Larry Flynt takes a puff off a Cuban ``cee-gar'' and mumbles in a thick, raspy voice that could be coming from a back-alley derelict. The topic is his new respectability. By M.L. Lyke. W/photo. Moved 12-16.  COX-MOVIE-LADN (Los Angeles) _ Courtney Cox wants you to know that she's not obsessive. She's really interested in obsession in a kind of passionate, analytical way, but hardly like Monica Geller, the needling neat freak she plays so convincingly on the hit sitcom ``Friends.'' By Bob Strauss. Moved 12-16.  COUNT-ENGLISHPATIENT-NYT (Budapest) _ The character compassionately depicted in the film ``The English Patient'' as a desert explorer with enigmatic origins is based on a real-life Hungarian who served German military intelligence in World War II and then apparently spied for the Soviet Union. Through an adventure-strewn life that traversed wildly different nations and cultures through two World Wars, the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire and the takeover of his country by the Communists, the tall, slender, slightly stooped, multilingual count often seemed many things to many people. By Jane Perlez.Moved 12-16.  MOVIES-MILLER-BOS (Undated) _ Looking more like a robust uncle than an age-bent grandfather, 81-year-old playwright Arthur Miller smiles seraphically.

After lean times, the Christmas party is back with verve for Wall Streeters, a reflection of a Dow Jones industrial average that has gone up more than 60 percent in the last two years, a market that has not been this strong in a two-year period since Dwight D. Eisenhower was president. Bonuses are back. But if the current holiday parties around this city _ at the Plaza Hotel, the St. Regis Hotel, the Knickerbocker Club and the Rainbow Room _ are brimming with the recovery they also exhibit a certain skittishness. By Monique P. Yazigi. W/photo. Moved 12-17.  FOREIGN-JOURNAL-BOS (Moscow) _ In most places, a two-day holiday is a win-win situation. You get the days off, and they come as part of a truncated work week. But in Russia things are never that easy. When the government pronounced last Thursday and Friday holidays in honor of the democratic constitution that Russia adopted in 1993, it quickly declared Saturday and yesterday ordinary weekdays, to make up for the lost productivity. Rather than a long weekend, Russian workers got a non-weekend. By David Filipov. Moved 12-16.  EARN-WHISTLE-BLOWERS-$ADV15-NYT (Undated) _ Sounding the trumpets for whistle-blowers.

Quite soon, most of you folks will be out of work. By David Pauly. Moved 12-12.

Moved 12-12.  WELFARE-WORK-HNS (San Francisco) _ Nyisha Gleaves remembers clearly the day she realized she was smart enough. It was the day she walked into her boss's office, confident and sure, with a disk in hand of the work she had just completed _ a spreadsheet report that weeks before had seemed close to impossible. By Venise Wagner. Moved 12-12.  DOCUMENT-MANAGEMENT-BOS (Undated) _ The computer age may have cut down on the mountains of paper accumulating in many workplaces, but it created a whole new kind of electronic chaos. With more work being done on computers, many companies have lost control of their electronic files, often losing them in a labyrinth of diskettes and hard drives. And the disorganization threatens to worsen as technology gets more sophisticated and the Internet gains acceptance as a means to link far-flung workers. By Joann Muller.Moved 12-17.  COLUMNS  WORKING-WOMEN-KAN (Undated) _ Toys tell us a lot about society, a lot about what we think of the roles of men and women. No doubt, there are plenty of men who never owned dolls and are now great fathers, and plenty of women who once adored Easy-Bake Ovens and now have careers. But before you rush to fill your child's holiday wish list, take a minute to think about the messages you're sending. Do women really look like Barbie? Does software have to be violent? Do only girls like cooking and boys like building? By Jilian Mincer.Moved 12-18.  ATWORK-COLUMN-KAN (Undated) _ Oh, for a good office party...My company, like many, stopped financing holiday parties several years ago. Employees now get gift certificates for groceries instead, and most everybody understands the reasons. Many people didn't go to the parties, and it didn't seem fair to spend a lot of money for a ``benefit'' that didn't benefit everyone. There were worries about company liability if employees drank too much and got in wrecks on the way home. By Diane Stafford. Moved 12-12.

ONJOBS-COLUMN-BOS (Exeter, N.H.) _ The way Cletus Kijek tells it, Osram Sylvania has long allowed near-intolerable working conditions at its plant here. Kijek contends Osram avoided taking action by firing him last year _ days after he blew the whistle and contacted federal safety inspectors. As Osram Sylvania sees it, the company has maintained a safe workplace and has taken corrective action when needed. As for Kijek, company officials say: He was fired for excessive absenteeism and falsification of workers compensation claims. Who's right? By Diane E. Lewis. W/photo. Moved 12-17.

GENERAL  EXCLUSIVE-CARTER-RELIGION-NYT (Plains, Ga.) _ As he strolled into the simple sanctuary of Maranatha Baptist Church, the Bible-toting Sunday school teacher was greeted by instant applause and an explosion of flashbulbs. ``Good morning everybody,'' Jimmy Carter said with a smile. ``Good morning,'' his 250 pupils responded in unison.

STEPHANOPOULOS-LEGACY-NYT (Washington) _ It is a tiny warren, cluttered with coffee cups and crumpled papers, Greek icons, a bottle or two of expensive wine and row upon row of books.

PROFILE-SCHROEDER-BOS (Washington) _ Rep.

Moved 12-18.  MOTHER-FILM-$ADV22-NYT (Undated) _ There is a moment in the trailer for ``Mother,'' the new comedy by the director Albert Brooks opening Christmas Day, that says it all. Portraying one side of a telephone conversation about the movie, Brooks brags about landing the ``legendary Debbie Reynolds'' for the title role. A long pause ensues. A frown creases his face. ``No,'' he adds with a huff. ``She's (italics)not(end italics) dead.'' By Frank Bruni. Moved 12-18 for release 12-22.  FLYNT-LARRY-SPI (Seattle) _ Smut merchant Larry Flynt takes a puff off a Cuban ``cee-gar'' and mumbles in a thick, raspy voice that could be coming from a back-alley derelict.

By Bob Strauss. Moved 12-16.  COUNT-ENGLISHPATIENT-NYT (Budapest) _ The character compassionately depicted in the film ``The English Patient'' as a desert explorer with enigmatic origins is based on a real-life Hungarian who served German military intelligence in World War II and then apparently spied for the Soviet Union. Through an adventure-strewn life that traversed wildly different nations and cultures through two World Wars, the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire and the takeover of his country by the Communists, the tall, slender, slightly stooped, multilingual count often seemed many things to many people.

FILM-ANGELS-SFCHRON (Undated) _ Angels are coming to a theater near you, and they're anything but cherubic. John Travolta is the heavenly messenger in ``Michael,'' coming out on Christmas Day, while Denzel Washington appears as an angel named Dudley in ``The Preacher's Wife,'' which opened this weekend. Both tell the story of allels who come down to earth and into the plots of romantic comedies. Both of these sexy saviors wear trench coats, but only Travolta has wings. By Don Lattin.Moved 12-12.  FILM-CLOONEY-SFCHRON (Beverly Hills) _ George Clooney arrived in Hollywood in the early 80s when the group of young actors known as the Brat Pack was on the rise. He read for the same parts as Judd Nelson and some of the others, but they were always hired instead. Then, in 1990, Clooney was almost cast as the hunky cowboy in ``Thelma &AMP; Louise.'' When Brad Pitt got the role, which would make him a star, ``I was pretty upset,'' Clooney admits. By Ruthe Stein.Moved 12-12.  BURTON-MOVIE-LADN (Los Angeles) _ He grew up on Evergreen Street in Burbank and discovered a playground for his imagination at the nearby Evergreen Cemetery, where he could take refuge from the world in the somber, spooky silences.

Moved 12-12.  BACALL-MOVIES-NYT (Hollywood) _ She's 72, still glamorous and feisty, and looking for work. ``Suddenly I've finished three pictures, can you imagine?'' said Lauren Bacall with a soft laugh. ``But now I'm unemployed. I mean, I've had a lot of dry years. So these pictures will, I hope, bring attention to the fact that I am around, breathing, walking and talking at the same time.''

That's a concept Mike Judge has sold to the world's teenagers. When you meet Judge, you can't help but think that this is what his creations _ ``Beavis and Butt-head'' _ will look like if they ever grow up. Judge, who writes, draws and does the voices for both teenage masters of the vulgar, is balding, sallow and a solemn eye-averter. By Bob Fenster. Moved 12-18.  STARTREK-FRAKES-PROFILE-NYT (New York) _ Even out of his Starfleet uniform, Jonathan Frakes, who has made a lucrative career out of playing the clear-eyed executive officer of the starship Enterprise in the ``Star Trek'' spinoffs, looks like a man in orbit. And no wonder: After acting for more than 20 years, many of them during the 1980s playing what he calls ``villains of the week'' in television dramas like ``Quincy'' and ``Barnaby Jones,'' he has just made his debut as a film director in ``Star Trek: First Contact.''

THEATER  ALLISON-JANNEY-THEATER-NYT (Undated) _ Noel Coward's ``Present Laughter'' may be the chain-smoking-est play on Broadway, and though Allison Janney maintains she had quit a half-pack-a-day habit, it looks like the actress has slid backward a bit. On Nov. 18, the day before her 36th birthday, Ms. Janney made her Broadway debut in the revival of the 1939 Coward comedy. She plays Liz, the former but not ex-wife of Garry Essendine (Frank Langella), a London matinee idol who heads a frenetic, neurotic show-biz family. By Jean Nathan. Moved 12-12.

By Ken Parish Perkins. Moved 12-12.  MUSIC  SAMPLING-RAP (New York) _ The New York City apartment is filled with bookshelves, but most of them don't hold books. Instead, they overflow with albums _ classical over here, jazz over there, and lots of soul and rock-and-roll in between. A parakeet named Adri flies around the living room offering guests, as the bird's owner puts it, ``sweet gangsta kisses.'' Most always there's the steady thump thump of hip-hop blasting in the background. You have entered the world of Hope Carr. By Charisse Jones. Moved 12-17.  CROWS-MUSIC-LADN (Los Angeles) _ Along with the voice and dark-night-of-the-soul lyrics of singer Adam Duritz on hits such as ``Mr. Jones,'' ``Round Here'' and ``Rain King,'' David Bryson's ringing electric guitar is Counting Crows the band's most distinctive calling card. By Fred Shuster. Moved 12-18.  BOOKS  FITZGERALD-CENTENNIAL (Undated) _ F. Scott Fitzgerald's centennial year should not end without a final celebration, especially now, when fiction has lost its pride of place as the form all serious writers must measure themselves by.

PORTLAND-PAPERBOYS-NYT (Portland, Maine) _ Following the lead of big-city dailies across the country, Portland Newspapers, which publishes The Portland Press Herald and The Maine Sunday Telegram, have begun replacing carriers younger than 18 with adults, many of whom deliver the paper more speedily, by heaving it from their cars.

CHESS-WOMEN-DECLINE-NYT (New York) _ Even as chess has grown in popularity and gained a foothold in American classrooms, the sport (game? art?) remains mystifyingly male-dominated and oddly segregated.

They don't give a whit for politics or a decent education. They rarely spend quality time with their families. They can't appreciate ``the good ol' days.'' Who are they? They could be the newly defined Generation Y _ but they could just as easily be any mass of youngsters under 25, at about any given point in American history. By Liz Stevens. Moved 12-17.  MINN-MALL-NYT (Bloomington, Minn.) _ ``Sometimes you need the authority of a security officer to make things right,'' she said when all was quiet, ``and sometimes you just need a mom.''

NINETIES-ROOMIES-ART-BOS (Boston) _ Omigod! You'll never believe what happened! You know how everyone has stories from their youth? You know, the stories that become kind of like folklore that you tell over and over and that make you and your friends feel like you've really been through something together? And if you tell it enough times, you know how what maybe started out as a small adventure just gets bigger and bigger and funnier and funnier? Well, that's what happened the week the incredibly nice thing Julia Gallacher did for Eileen Broderick had the unexpected consequence of giving half the girls a fright and turning Amelia Julian's tacky spillproof mug into something that could pass for modern art.

EDUCATION  NETSURF-WHITEHOUSE-NYT (Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.) _ Alex Burg, 10, was browsing on his computer last spring and, as a lark, sent a message to the White House.

Many high schools now offer the same number of choices to male and female athletes. Instead, coaches and athletes say they are increasingly using the law to challenge more subtle forms of discrimination.

"82864"	"they"	"hope"	" Finally, they decide to auction off all their livestock, farm machinery and household goods. That, they hope, will pay off the debt and keep the farm in the family. Phase 2 involves the elder Jordans, 70, moving into town and one of the grown sons, who owns his own farm machinery but rents a farm, taking over. One of the things that's moving about the film is the low-key matter-of-factness with which the hard realities of farm life are handled. It's not unusual for the grown children of farmers, Jordan says, to rent farms and work them while waiting for their fathers to retire or die. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"
"83317"	"I"	"hope"	" Daschle called the Gingrich probe, as well as a number of congressional investigations of the administration, including one involving campaign financing, pose a ``real threat`` to new calls for bipartisanship. ``We have to find ways to work through it,'' Daschle said. ``I think, I hope, we can,'' said Lott. Regardless what the ethics committee and the full House decides to do, Gingrich faces other possible problems. The Internal Revenue Service is already looking into the financing of the course Gingrich taught, and the matter could be referred for investigation to the Justice Department. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199701.gz"

Ledger, you should know, is the semi-star of ``The Patriot'' who proved he wasn't the big deal Hollywood may have thought previous to ``A Knight's Tale.''

"94760"	"they"	"hope"	" The Warriors took Jason Richardson (who, they hope, is more than a human pogo stick) and Troy Murphy, and the plan is to try Larry Hughes at point guard and take some of the scoring pressure off the kid . . . Walker, the Sonics' president, was taken aback by Gary Payton's predraft open letter to the fans of Seattle. ``It was unexpected,'' Walker said. ``I'd prefer not to go any further than that.'' Payton thanked the fans in a missive that seemed to indicate he was going somewhere. He almost did, to the Grizzlies, in a deal for Abdur-Rahim. But the Grizz wanted a higher pick than Seattle's, so they went for the Atlanta offer. Payton's statement noted he had never demanded a trade. However, it did say that he was wondering why he had not been offered a contract extension. He's dreaming if he thinks the Sonics will do that, because he's turns 33 July 23 and has two more years on his contract . . . Who can figure out what Jerry Krause is up to in Chicago? He now has two high schoolers, Tyson Chandler and Eddy Curry, and one traded team MVP (Elton Brand). Krause likes both kids and feels that their transition will be eased because there will be two of them. There's also undeniable potential in both and a feeling that Brand, while solid, was not the kind of player around whom you could build a winner. The Bulls will be an interesting work in progress. But they also may be even worse next season (and that's hard, given that they won 15 games this past year) and for a couple more until (they hope) Chandler and Curry finally arrive. That can't be good news if your name is Tim Floyd . . . We never believed Michael Jordan's story that he broke two ribs on a hard drive to the basket. That only happens about 50 times a game, and in almost 18 years of covering the NBA, I've never come across a player breaking ribs in a game. Well, it did happen in the gym. Sam Smith of the Chicago Tribune wrote that Ron Artest is the culprit. According to the Trib, it seems Artest was tired of listening to Jordan talk trash, so he knocked him down and the two got in a fight. That's how the ribs were broken . . . Tinsley barely made it in the first round, which is a testament to his attitude as much as anything. He canceled a workout with the Hornets, picking 16th, because he told them he knew he wouldn't be around that long. The Warriors, picking 14th, wanted no part of him. Boston and Orlando, both looking for point guard help, didn't bother either. He eventually slid to 27, where the Hawks took him and then dealt him to the Pacers. We only hope Indiana knows what it's getting . . . But as low as Tinsley went, no one slid more than Loren Woods. Here's a legit 7-foot center who was working out for teams picking in the teens, and he went all the way to No. 46. Amazing. Apparently, his reputation as an underachiever at two big-time programs (Wake Forest and Arizona) hurt him. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20010701.0031 type=story > <HEADLINE> DID MAYOR HAVE LAST WORD ON TORONTO'S BID </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> BOSTON (BC-OLY-NOTEBOOK-BOS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200107.gz"

"96620"	"we"	"hope"	" Cover story looks at plans for a revolutionary new generation of warships - a timely piece as America braces for battle in the Middle East. The vessels depicted are trimarans, ships with triple hulls that cut the water far more efficiently than single-hull designs - and are so stable that they operate in wild seas. These combatants range from the 1351/2-foot Blue Knight Patrol Boat to the battleship-size Leviathan. The ships will be packed with missiles and advanced electronic-warfare equipment, and the Leviathan sports ``rail guns,'' which will use electromagnetism to accelerate and hurl a torrent of rounds upon the enemy. Both the United States and Britain are intensively testing the trimaran design now; the ships won't be operational for at least a decade - and maybe, we hope, they won't be needed by then.

Going into winter takes confidence, even in a normal year, even if it's nothing more than confidence in one's own preparations. Somehow that's not good enough this year. Like everyone, I find myself wanting the world to be right with itself again, even if only in the wrong old ways. In the heart of the reluctance I feel and that I hear in the voices of my neighbors, there's a longing for the inconsequential summer we were having not so many weeks ago. Longing is probably too strong a word. Better to say that the memory of what was, for many Americans, an uneventful August exerts a certain attraction right now. But the present is irrefutable. The leaves won't rise again, except on a cold wind. Before long, I hope, that won't seem so regrettable. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20011110.0021 type=story > <HEADLINE> DODGERS DEAL FOR DAAL; SHAW GONE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> LOS ANGELES (BC-BBN-DODGERS-LADN) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200111.gz"

Trollope was a post office administrator; Wells was a draper's apprentice and then a science teacher; Howells a printer. The old dictum ``write about what you know'' should now be amended to ``get out into the world and then write about what you know.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"

Good girls in Baltimore did wear ``angel blouses,'' those mock maternity tops that baited parents' horror of teenage pregnancies.

The governor, we hope, will not face a disaster anything like that. But if he is re-elected, he will be leading a state with a disastrous budget problem and a political culture that has made New York state government a nearly inoperative scandal. That is crisis enough, and Pataki could rewrite his shaky record completely if he decided to make a real commitment to reform, particularly in the way politicians finance their campaigns.

"129452"	"we"	"hope"	" On Oct. 18, MLS commissioner Don Garber was asked during an online chat how developments for soccer-specific stadiums in both the Dallas area and Harrison, N.J., were going.

Now that the industry gossip about it has subsided, let us hope that a more substantial discussion can start.

Our preference is for a memorial that encompasses light and renewal. Being at ground zero will furnish all the sobriety needed. And we hope that the winning design will embrace a way of remembering the dead that does not become trapped in specificity. This should be a memorial for our collective loss and not exclusively the loss suffered by the families of those who died there. Above all, we hope, when the winning design is finally built, to understand something about Sept. 11 that had gone unexpressed until then. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20031120.0007 type=story > <HEADLINE> EDITORIAL: AIMING AT CHINESE IMPORTS, AGAIN </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> 11-20-03 00:23:00EST (BC-EDIT-CHINA-IMPORTS-NY) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200311.gz"

"146253"	"I"	"hope"	" Like Mary Renault's purple-prosy biographical portrait The Nature of Alexander, Stone begins this story with the tyrant's death at 32. But because this is no ordinary death and no ordinary director, Stone opens his version with a self-conscious nod to Citizen Kane. To compare Orson Welles' masterpiece seriously with Alexander would be unkind to Stone, who has made great films before and will, I hope, make them again. Yet it's worth noting that while Citizen Kane is an unflinching portrait of a monstrous man's will to power, Alexander soft-pedals a far more terrible monster. Welles took a merciless view toward his tyrant and was subjected to systematic retaliation by William Randolph Hearst, the real-life model for Kane. Creditors aside, the only one that Stone finally must answer to is himself. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200411.gz"

TERROR-INTEL (Washington) -- Dismissing reports of dissension within the administration, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Tuesday that he supports President Bush's evolving position on overhauling the intelligence bureaucracy, and that suggestions to the contrary are nonsense. Needless to say, I'm a part of this administration, Rumsfeld said at an afternoon Pentagon briefing. I favor reform in the intelligence community, as the president does.

CBS-RATHER (New York) -- Less than two months after acknowledging that he could not authenticate documents central to a broadcast report that raised fresh questions about President Bush's National Guard service, Dan Rather has decided to step down as anchor and managing editor of the CBS Evening News on March 9, on what will be his 24th anniversary behind the anchor desk.

DEPORT-CHILDREN (New York) -- In April of last year, when her mother dropped by immigration headquarters to complete some paperwork, Virginia Feliz became part of a growing tribe of American children who have lost a parent to deportation. Her mother, Berly, 47, migrated here illegally a decade ago. She was quickly clapped into handcuffs, and within hours placed on a plane to her native Honduras, unable to say goodbye to her husband and little girl, both U.S. citizens. I'm not happy, I'm sad, said Virginia, now eight. Because it's not fair that everybody else has their mom except me. No one keeps track of exactly how many American children were left behind by the record 186,000 non-citizens expelled from the U.S. last year, or the 887,000 more required to make a voluntary departure. But immigration experts say there are tens of thousands of children every year who lose a parent to deportation. As the debate over immigration policy heats up, such broken families are troubling people on all sides, and challenging schools and mental health clinics in immigrant neighborhoods. By Nina Bernstein.  With photo, NYT25.  UKRAINE-RUSSIA (Moscow) -- Not since NATO's war in Kosovo, or perhaps the Cold War itself, have the political differences between Russia and the West appeared so starkly as they have in Ukraine's disputed presidential election. It is not just that Russia and President Vladimir V. Putin himself have come out so strongly for the candidate promising closer relations with Moscow, Viktor F. Yanukovich, while Europe and the United States are supporting his opponent, Viktor A. Yushchenko, albeit more subtly. It is that both sides -- rivals in what the United Financial Group in Moscow called on Tuesday a Cold-War-style proxy confrontation -- have staked out diametrically opposed views of what unfolded in Ukraine. A news analysis by Steven Lee Myers.  IRAQ (Baghdad, Iraq) -- Developments. Five-thousand Marines, British troops and Iraqi commandos launched raids and arrested suspected insurgents Tuesday in a new offensive aimed at clearing a swath of rebel hotbeds south of Baghdad, the American military said, calling it the next stage since the retaking of Fallujah to stop the Iraqi insurgency. In other violence, masked gunmen assassinated a Sunni cleric north of Baghdad -- the second such killing in two days -- and insurgents hit a U.S. convoy with a roadside bomb near the central Iraq city of Samarra, prompting the Americans to open fire, killing an Iraqi, hospital officials said.

Times Regional Newspaper Group. For use by member papers only.  We have news from Lakeland and Lexington.  The goal of PHOTO-BUDGET is to be a forum for exchanging advice, equipment reviews and news about your photo department. Take issue if you disagree with an equipment review, but likewise let us -- and your counterparts at other papers -- know if you agree and have more to add. There's a lot of expertise out there and we are trying to help you share it.  Susan Kille and Stephen G.

We certainly want this weekly missive to reach photo editors, but any other shooter who sends his e-mail address to nytrengnytimes.com will be added to the list.  QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS: Call us at (212) 556-1518 or zap an e-mail message.  How many NYTRNG papers ran the photo by AP Photographer John Moore in last Wednesday's papers? I'd really like to know.  The image, which I bet is nominated for a Pulitzer, shows an Army nurse as he tries to save the life of an American soldier by giving him CPR as the soldier is being transported into a military hospital in Baghdad, Iraq on Tuesday, Nov. 9, 2004. The soldier died. The soldier was fatally wounded in a Baghdad firefight with insurgents. He lies on a stretcher and a wedding band is on his left hand that tells you he has a family. If you did run it then you know what I am talking about but the file should still be in your AP Server JBM107. I have archived it.  After being here for 20 years I can't ever remember running an image like this so big on 1A. When I found it in the AP server last Tuesday I made a proof and took it to Editor Skip Perez expecting to have a battle to get any ink on 1A. Skip agreed that the image was extremely powerful and illustrated the effects of war on our troops. We ran it 6 columns above the fold. Lots of other papers -- including the Tampa Tribune -- ran it about the same size.  The calls and the letters started coming in, about 20 calls the best I can figure. We have had multiple Letters to the Editor about the image. At first it was ugly, how dare: The Ledger show troops in this manner? How would you like it if it was your son? Then we started getting some positive letters. Skip Perez responded to some of them and his comments are really help to explain things to the readers.  Ledger Publisher John Fitzwater passed along your e-mail critical of our front-page photo showing the dying soldier in Iraq. I respect your point of view.  I don't profess to always be right or certain about my judgments. I have been doing this job for 28 years and have made my share of mistakes.I do know a powerful, heart-grabbing photo when I see one. This was such a rare photo. That is why we used it and played it as we did.  I have also been around this business long enough to know that it's risky for anyone to make judgments about how someone's family might feel about us publishing a photo of a family member in crisis or death. I have spoken to family members about tragic photos we've published and some have thanked me.  We received about 20 phone calls or letters concerning the photo. Most were critical, but if you've been following our letters column, many praised our decision as well. Attached is a copy of one letter, from a military veteran, whose view differs from yours.  Again, thank you for being a longtime subscriber of The Ledger. We value your loyalty. Most days, I hope, you enjoy and are illuminated by what you see and read.  My name is John Carter.I'm retired U.S. Army.I was a first sergeant. I want to say that picture that I saw was not inappropriate. That picture represents what really happens in war. People must be aware that the cost of freedom is so soldiers and marines that are dying. So thank you. You'll get some flack over this, but I support you one hundred percent.  We are close to making a decision on the new shooter who will be added to the staff in January of 05. I can tell you this, it will be a hire from inside the group and that shooter will be fully equipped with Canon EOS gear. The shooter will have to stay here 3 years to take ownership of the gear but his/her camera allowance for $3400 will also be given in 05.  This was the first hire for me in 14 years. We added stringers David Mills and Rick Runion to the staff then ... I am a little out of date. I did find one or two other people that are well worth hiring, I was real pleased with their abilities and attitude. The last shooter to leave the paper was Chris O'Meara 18 years ago.  Thanks to Doug Finger in Gainesville for nailing a nice image of a bank robber from Lakeland bent over the back of a cop car being arrested. The young man was from Lakeland and Doug got that into the caption so we picked it up.  We used lots of photos from the Florida - Florida State game in Sunday's paper. Photos from Ocala and Gainesville.  From what I can see, the RBGAN Greg Wolf took to Iraq is working fine. Wolf has posted some fine images with interest beyond the fact that N.C. troops are shown. Check out the silhouette and the fire shot he posted Tuesday.  On the photo front  As I write this, we are following up a double shooting her in South Lakeland. A husband shot his wife and took the three children, then shot himself in a van. The children are safe but local cops are keeping us 2 miles from the site. I guess its time for a sit down with our new sheriff. AP is all over us for the pixs so you might see the images there and on Wieck ... More to come.  On Wednesday Photographer Ernst Peters and reporter Tom Palmer are driving Polk County on an environmental lands program tour for a 1A story next week, wetlands ect. Should be a nice package, more info to come, will post.  On Friday Photographer Ernst Peters will be at Toy-R-Us at 5AM with Business reporter Rachel Pleasant as the first day of the shopping starts. Will post.  On Friday Cypress Gardens Park in Winter Haven opens back up with new rides and shows. We posted some advance photos but this will be the first day that the park is open to the public, photographer Rick Runion will post color.  First of all, I want to publicly thank Jamie Moncrief for all the help he has given me over the years; more help/encouragement than he realizes, I am sure.  And there's probably not a better teller of photo war stories than him, which made photo conferences all the more fun for everyone attending. I wish him all the best and look forward to the day he can return.  Photo-wise, we're doing the usual after-Thanksgiving shopping photos and gearing up for the Christmas season of choirs, nativity scenes, Santa, etc.  I'm working on the completion of an easy but interesting photo package about odd mailboxes in the area. I gave the local postal carriers a form to take with them on their routes that they could fill out when they came across mailboxes/posts they thought were clever, or just plain bizarre.  The response was about 15 mailboxes/posts of which about 10 were stand-outs, and along with a couple of others I had seen myself it should be a full page when said and done.  As much as I have grown cold toward Nikon equipment, I do have to say a good thing about the strength of the gear after enduring a massive rain storm during high school football games the week before last. It was the most torrential downpours I have ever had to shoot photos in except for a full-fledged hurricane 19 years ago.  During two games on the same Friday night I used, at different times, a lens rain cover, a courtroom sound-proofing body cover, towels draped over everything and sweatshirts ... anything dry I could find. Still, the gear was eventually soaked (including the front lens element of my 300mm), but the gear worked famously and shows no signs of damage from the moisture.

The goal of PHOTO-BUDGET is to be a forum for exchanging advice, equipment reviews and news about your photo department. Take issue if you disagree with an equipment review, but likewise let us -- and your counterparts at other papers -- know if you agree and have more to add. There's a lot of expertise out there and we are trying to help you share it.  Susan Kille and Stephen G.

We certainly want this weekly missive to reach photo editors, but any other shooter who sends his e-mail address to nytrengnytimes.com will be added to the list.  QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS: Call us at (212) 556-1518 or zap an e-mail message.  How many NYTRNG papers ran the photo by AP Photographer John Moore in last Wednesday's papers? I'd really like to know.  The image, which I bet is nominated for a Pulitzer, shows an Army nurse as he tries to save the life of an American soldier by giving him CPR as the soldier is being transported into a military hospital in Baghdad, Iraq on Tuesday, Nov. 9, 2004. The soldier died. The soldier was fatally wounded in a Baghdad firefight with insurgents. He lies on a stretcher and a wedding band is on his left hand that tells you he has a family. If you did run it then you know what I am talking about but the file should still be in your AP Server JBM107. I have archived it.  After being here for 20 years I can't ever remember running an image like this so big on 1A. When I found it in the AP server last Tuesday I made a proof and took it to Editor Skip Perez expecting to have a battle to get any ink on 1A. Skip agreed that the image was extremely powerful and illustrated the effects of war on our troops. We ran it 6 columns above the fold. Lots of other papers -- including the Tampa Tribune -- ran it about the same size.  The calls and the letters started coming in, about 20 calls the best I can figure. We have had multiple Letters to the Editor about the image. At first it was ugly, how dare: The Ledger show troops in this manner? How would you like it if it was your son? Then we started getting some positive letters. Skip Perez responded to some of them and his comments are really help to explain things to the readers.  Ledger Publisher John Fitzwater passed along your e-mail critical of our front-page photo showing the dying soldier in Iraq. I respect your point of view.  I don't profess to always be right or certain about my judgments. I have been doing this job for 28 years and have made my share of mistakes.I do know a powerful, heart-grabbing photo when I see one. This was such a rare photo. That is why we used it and played it as we did.  I have also been around this business long enough to know that it's risky for anyone to make judgments about how someone's family might feel about us publishing a photo of a family member in crisis or death. I have spoken to family members about tragic photos we've published and some have thanked me.  We received about 20 phone calls or letters concerning the photo. Most were critical, but if you've been following our letters column, many praised our decision as well. Attached is a copy of one letter, from a military veteran, whose view differs from yours.  Again, thank you for being a longtime subscriber of The Ledger. We value your loyalty. Most days, I hope, you enjoy and are illuminated by what you see and read.  My name is John Carter.I'm retired U.S. Army.I was a first sergeant. I want to say that picture that I saw was not inappropriate. That picture represents what really happens in war. People must be aware that the cost of freedom is so soldiers and marines that are dying. So thank you. You'll get some flack over this, but I support you one hundred percent.  We are close to making a decision on the new shooter who will be added to the staff in January of 05. I can tell you this, it will be a hire from inside the group and that shooter will be fully equipped with Canon EOS gear. The shooter will have to stay here 3 years to take ownership of the gear but his/her camera allowance for $3400 will also be given in 05.  This was the first hire for me in 14 years. We added stringers David Mills and Rick Runion to the staff then ... I am a little out of date. I did find one or two other people that are well worth hiring, I was real pleased with their abilities and attitude. The last shooter to leave the paper was Chris O'Meara 18 years ago.  Thanks to Doug Finger in Gainesville for nailing a nice image of a bank robber from Lakeland bent over the back of a cop car being arrested. The young man was from Lakeland and Doug got that into the caption so we picked it up.  We used lots of photos from the Florida - Florida State game in Sunday's paper. Photos from Ocala and Gainesville.  From what I can see, the RBGAN Greg Wolf took to Iraq is working fine. Wolf has posted some fine images with interest beyond the fact that N.C. troops are shown. Check out the silhouette and the fire shot he posted Tuesday.  On the photo front  As I write this, we are following up a double shooting her in South Lakeland.

Lavin just recently wrote a book about his life. Lavin owns Glenn Hill Farm here in Ocala. Bruce shot this for our upcoming March Magazine of Ocala Life.  Cindy Skop did a fantastic job while working with cop reporter Mable Perez on an upcoming story about a neighborhood in south Marion county that has been terrorized by an arsonist. Cindy shot a very emotional picture of a victim of the fire who is also fighting cancer. She was suppose to move into her new home over a year ago and the arsonist set it ablaze before she could get moved in.  Jannett is shooting the biggest day of the Christmas shopping frenzy on Friday at the newest Wal-Mart near On Top of the World, the mall and Big Lots. Should be a mad house!!  I shot the media tour of our new Forest High School. The facility cost taxpayers $38.5 million and is quite collegiate looking. The school opens to students on Jan. 18, 2005 just a couple weeks after the Christmas break.  That's about it on the news front. Pretty quiet this week, just getting stories and art done early for the early deadlines on this holiday week.  If you guys need anything shot up here in Ocala, please just let us know.

The following is one of Skip's responses to a reader:  Dear Mr. Williams,  Ledger Publisher John Fitzwater passed along your e-mail critical of our front-page photo showing the dying soldier in Iraq. I respect your point of view.  I don't profess to always be right or certain about my judgments. I have been doing this job for 28 years and have made my share of mistakes.

People must be aware that the cost of freedom is so soldiers and marines that are dying. So thank you. You'll get some flack over this, but I support you one hundred percent.  Responses from NYTRNG editors re. the photo:  We opted not to run the CPR photo.....being so close three area military bases, we thought it was a smattering too close to home for many family members.  We ran the photo, but on an inside page in color. I tried hard to get it on Page 1 but was resisted. I was asked if the soldier was already dead, which would have killed it's running here. Cheerios test and all. But the caption said he was still alive when the photo was taken. Our desk editors are pretty squeamish and harsh reality, especially when unpleasantly represented, is a tough sell. But at least we ran it. Kudos to Jim Osteen, our exec, who supported running it at all.  After looking at 75 portfolios over the last two months the following web page best explains my feelings. All of the NYTRNG Photo Editors/Chief Photographers have more experience than me with hiring....Because no shooter has left here in 18 years and I guess I am the closest one to the door because I have a foot in the casket and ride motorcycles. You're going to need high speed cable ... it's a quicktime movie.  http//www.sportsshooter.com/special_feature/2004_luau_video/port_rev  iews/ind  ex.html  On the geek side:  I am just starting to use a Sprint Palm Treo650 Cell Phone with Bluetooth. Having all kinds of trouble using the Treo with the Powerbooks simply because Palm and Sprint have not released a real working Mac Desktop Software. So far, I can view Wieck and other Web pages from the phone, it's not real fast or easy but it can be done. I need to spend a little more time with it...  One gig Lexar 80X Compact Flash Cards as cheep as $75? ecost.com  On the photo front:  On Wednesday, Photographer Rick Runion and Business reporter Kevin Boufford are doing a story on the recovery of a local blueberry farmer after being hit by all three hurricanes this year.  On Friday night photographer Michael Wilson will cover Lt. Col. Hiram Mann who is a featured speaker at Sun 'N Fun's Aviation Expression lecture series. Mann is one of the original Tuskeegee airmen.  On Sunday the Tampa Bay Bucs and their worthless place kicker will play the Atlanta Falcons at Raymond James Stadium at 1PM. Photographer David Mills and one TBA will cover for deadline. All images will be posted to Wieck by 5PM.  The Herald-Tribune in Sarasota last month revived and expanded a photo feature called Life Through a Lens.  We have kicked around the idea for a photo column for quite a while and we finally made it happen, said MIKE LANG, director of photography.  A photo column, like a written column, has a point of view. While visual, photo columns usually include a narrative that pairs with images to express an idea. A photo column can have one image or several and a general goal is to convey an impression that readers haven't seen before.  Life Through a Lens is the name of a photo column that had run in one edition of the paper, but the new version runs prominently in all editions. It began its new life on Oct. 25 with a five-column spread of photos and text by CHIP LITHERLAND. Litherland captured the images after he finished an assignment at Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota and decided to play tourist for an hour.  Litherland wrote that Mote's aquariums provided an opportunity for instant nature photography but he did not take a conventional approach. His choice of black and white images added a sense of mystery to photos that include the fin of a tiger shark cutting through water, a moray eel showing his teeth, the silvery face of a lookdown and X-ray-like images of moon jellyfish.  The feature appears on the cover of the Florida West section every other Monday.  Since the relaunch, Life through a Lens has appeared three more times: THOMAS BENDER visited a group of Civil War re-enactors; PHIL DIEDERICH showed why he was sure a long election season was over; and Litherland looked for and found something different at a groundbreaking ceremony.  Space availability can vary greatly, so we will need to be flexible with the design, Lang said. One week, it might be several photos and a copy block written by the photographer. Another week, it might be a single image with a healthy cutline. Either way, it will be a great showcase for our staff photographers to publish photos that might not get in the paper anywhere else.  Doug Engle, senior photographer, (352) 671-6409; cell (352) 425-2476  CINDY's story on the arsonist in Little Lake Weir published last weekend. An interesting look a community plagued by suspicous fires to the point of people leaving.  JANNET shot a great photo of a former Jockey thrown from a horse and almost killed. She's recovered and back to the horse business. The story explores the dangers of the horses in general and the workers that care for and ride them for a living. Something to think about when the kids want a pony for Christmas. JANNET will be shooting both merchandise and a studio illustration for our religion story on Hannukah  Our holiday time charity Community With A Heart kicked off right after Thanksgiving. BRUCE shot Edward Gomez and his premature twin daughters. The family has no transportation. The need is expected to be extra great this year given the devastation of the Hurricane season.  DOUG will be shooting the plethora of cut it down yourself Christmas tree farms that seemed to have sprung up this year. He will also track down the crews from the Weather Channel shooting a story on storms and animals as they visit our local Tiger farmer.  This weekend is a big Holiday weekend with both the Ocala and Belleview Christmas parades and Symphony of Horses (Horses performing to the live Orchestra). The holiday fun just never stops.  Tech-  Not much new as I've been on vacation. I did arrive back to find that our Newsroom Systems editor Sam has worked with Shared Services and is about to roll out the PhotoTracker upgrade. So far, performance across the network seems fine and certainly no worse then the antique NT boxes we have in house. In the interest of sharing I have asked that everyone in the group have read access to our Photo Tracker. You can see what we are working on and how phototracker might benefit you. I'm sure most of the assignments will be of local interst only but you never know. With Shared Services hosting this solution the cost of this tool is significantly reduced. To get phototracker in the workspace of your Lotus Notes client, Go to FILEDATABASEOPEN and navigate to the CORP-APPS-01 server and scroll down to the Ocala folder. PhotoTracker is there.

, you can,	 A: Yes, you can, if you accept the fact the taste may not be the same. Spray a suitable baking pan with vegetable spray, place the formed patties on top and place a pat of butter on each, or spray again with vegetable spray. Bake in a 375(degrees) oven until done, about 30 to 35 minutes. If the top is not browning, place the pan on the upper oven rack for the last 5 minutes or so. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz
, she says,	 Wrong, Joyce will tell you. But few stop to listen. An unintended consequence of the fight against smoking, she says, is that we've demonized the smoker, the smoker has become defensive and the public has grown bored and uninformed about a killer that doesn't care if you smoked or not. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz
, he said,	 Besides, he said, I don't feel I should start, because when I signed here, I signed to be a backup point guard. I knew what I was getting into when I signed, so I'm perfectly comfortable where I am. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz
, he said,	 The feat was not achieved through sweeps stunting, he said, but with a balanced portfolio of comedies, dramas, reality shows, newsmagazines and specials. CSI reached new heights; the Monday comedies Everybody Loves Raymond and Two and a Half Men performed well; 60 Minutes kept ticking. He expects no change in strategy. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz
, he says,	 I feel all three networks 10 years from now may not have any news at all, says former NBC News president Larry Grossman, adding that news divisions have already been gutted. The evening news, he says, is an anachronism in this day and age. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz
, he said,	 New York University talked about offering him a scholarship, he said, but there was one catch: I had to get 1000 on the SAT, he said. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz
, I thought,	 When he said he got a 680, I thought, 'Are you serious?' Paris said. Honestly, he's an inspiration. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz
, he said,	 So far, business is booming, Arbiter said. One advantage over other delivery services, he said, is that because their delivery people are all students, they can bring snacks right to students' dorm doors. In secure student housing like Columbia's, students typically have to go to the building entrance to accept such items. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz
, he said,	 On the first night, CU Snacks received about 25 orders for products like soda, juice and chips. Now they're getting 30 to 50 each night, he said, a step up from his first business venture as a third grader, selling decal tattoos and slap bracelets. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz
, he adds,	 You're trying to produce pork at the lowest cost possible, says John Mabry, director of the Iowa Pork Industry Center at Iowa State University, and still have an acceptable product. It's cheaper to feed leaner pork, he adds, and therefore the price of commercial pork at the supermarket can be lower. John Lawrence, livestock economist at Iowa State, agrees, saying that 50 to 52 pounds of pork per person are consumed annually in American homes, and compared to beef and poultry, the commercial product is affordable. But the system has sacrificed taste. Pork went from being fatty to becoming extremely lean (the other white meat ad campaign was intended to counteract the popularity of chicken). As far back as 1977, James Beard wrote in his book Theory &amp; Practice of Good Cooking that lean pork was less flavorful and that he hoped the streamlined pork would soon fall out of fashion. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz
, he says,	 More than 20 years later, Beard's notion has finally found supporters. John Dewar, who sells fine meats to chefs and in retail shops in Newton and Wellesley, thinks the pendulum has swung. Pork in earlier years was too fatty and greasy, Dewar says. Producers tried to counter by growing a slimmer pig, and, by god, they did. The result was dry and tasteless. The quick fix, he adds, was to inject the lean product with a solution to put some moisture into it. Although that might work at a retail level, he says, restaurant chefs weren't satisfied. </P> 	nyt_eng_200412.gz
, he adds,	 Willis says that one to two farmers a week are joining Niman, which sells 2,500 to 3,000 pigs a week. Many were small farmers squeezed out of the market by large companies such as Smithfield Farms, which owns everything, says Willis -- the processing plants as well as the pigs.

CIA-LEAK-TIME (New York) -- Time magazine said Thursday that it would provide documents concerning the confidential sources of one of its reporters to a grand jury investigating the disclosure of the identity of a covert CIA agent, Valerie Plame. The U.S. Supreme Court turned down appeals in the case on Monday, concluding the gravest legal confrontation between the press and the government in a generation. Two reporters, Judith Miller of The New York Times and Matthew Cooper of Time magazine, face jail for refusing to testify before the grand jury. By Adam Liptak.  With a graphic.  An early lede has moved.  IRAN-HOSTAGES (Tehran, Iran) -- President-elect Mahmoud Ahmadinehad's possible role in the 1980 seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran escalated suddenly into a new complication on Thursday in the estranged relations between the United States and Iran, with the Bush administration saying it took seriously the accounts of several hostages who claimed Ahmadinedad was one of the leaders in the seizure. In Iran, at least two former leaders dismissed those accounts as ridiculous and one even said the president-elect had wanted to participate in the seizure but they refused to let him. By Nazila Fathi.  BOA-MBNA (New York) -- In a move to grab a bigger piece of consumers' wallets by becoming a powerhouse in credit cards, Bank of America announced plans on Thursday to acquire the card giant MBNA in a $35 billion cash and stock deal. The deal signals Bank of America's continued strategic bet on the consumer despite concerns that climbing interest rates are decelerating growth in critical areas, including home loans and even credit cards. Already the nation's biggest bank in deposits, Bank of America would leapfrog Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase to become the country's largest credit-card issuer with 20 percent market share. By Eric Dash.  BOA-MBNA-DEALMAKERS (New York) -- Executives involved in the negotiations help us reconstruct the behind-the-scenes machinations that led to MBNA's $35 billion deal with Bank of America announced on Thursday. Part of the drama was the crash into New York's East River of a helicopter carrying MBNA executives returning to Delaware from negotiations with Wachovia. Despite several harrowing moments trapped underwater in the helicopter, the executives managed to escape. The crash received extensive news coverage. But until Thursday, no one knew exactly why the executives were in Manhattan. By Andrew Ross Sorkin.  NY-ATTACK (New York) -- Two more white men were taken into custody on Thursday in an attack on a black man in Howard Beach, Queens, as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and prosecutors pledged to seek maximum penalties in the Wednesday beating. The two suspects who turned themselves in were accused of being among the three white men who confronted the victim, Glen Moore, in Howard Beach around 3 a.m. Wednesday. A third suspect, Nicholas Minucci, 19, was charged with first-degree assault as a hate crime in the attack. Moore, 20, was in critical but stable condition at Jamaica Hospital and was said to have lost hearing. By Jim Rutenberg.  With photo.  EBBERS-RESTITUTION (New York) -- Bernard J. Ebbers, the founder and former chief executive of WorldCom who was found guilty of fraud by a New York jury in March, has agreed to surrender nearly all of his approximately $40 million personal fortune to investors who lost billions when the telecommunications company spiraled into bankruptcy almost three years ago. MCI, the successor company to WorldCom, which emerged from bankruptcy protection in April 2004, will share in the restitution provided by the sale of Ebbers' assets, although the company stands to receive nowhere near the roughly $400 million it is owed by the former chief executive. By Gretchen Morgenson.  REPUBS-BLACKS (Clarion, Pa.) -- Lynn Swann, the Hall of Fame former wide receiver for the Pittsburgh Steelers, stood before a nearly all-white Republican crowd at the Holiday Inn here and blasted Pennsylvania's Democratic governor, Edward Rendell, for failing to reduce property taxes. Then, without prompting, Swann suddenly turned the subject to race, his own. I'm not here to be the poster child for the Republican Party, to say they're being inclusive by running an African American, said Swann, 53. That's not why I'm here. I'm here to win. But to many prominent Republicans, Swann, a commentator for ABC Sports is much more than a telegenic and potentially potent candidate for governor in 2006. He still has to get through a Republican primary. But he is, they hope, part of a bumper crop of prominent black candidates who will help the Republicans crack, if not break, Democratic domination among black voters in several important states over the coming year.

The rule would affect 81,500 diesel engines used to generate electricity and operate compressors at power plants and manufacturing sites, leading to a reduction of 68,000 tons of pollution by 2015.

But in recent years other small towns on the Outer Cape increasingly have offered theater, art, literary events and food to rival those found there. Wellfleet and Truro have strong arts traditions of their own. But these towns have also benefited from some of Provincetown's modern problems. Skyrocketing real estate prices, dense summer crowds, and traffic -- at times, the roads in town resemble I-95 more than a bucolic byway, and locals talk about refusing to drive anywhere for fear of losing their parking space -- can make solitude, low-rent artists' studios, and funky writers' hovels as tough to find as local shellfish during a red tide.

But this year, Schwarzenegger, bowing to the political realities, says he's willing to exempt the largest -- by far -- category of mandated state spending, Proposition 98 aid to public schools. And even if he had the authority, he added, there is nothing that will solve the problem other than getting rid of those automatic spending formulas. </P> 	nyt_eng_200601.gz

Schwarzenegger insisted that Proposition 49 was done in the most responsible way because it didn't go into effect immediately and thus, he claimed, isn't crowding out other programs, but that doesn't change the simple fact that Proposition 49 is untouchable autopilot spending every bit as rigid as Proposition 98, the school finance law. In fact, Proposition 49 spending will be folded into Proposition 98's annual allocation. </P> 	nyt_eng_200601.gz

ON THE COVER  ENERGY-TRADING (Houston) -- The industry that Enron made infamous -- energy trading -- is springing to life again. Volatile energy markets and record-high commodity prices are prompting renewed interest from investors eager to play in the sector. That has pushed banks and a growing number of hedge funds to hire more energy traders and brainy quantitative minds to back their bets on energy prices. In Houston, New York and London, a scramble for top trading talent has ensued that rivals the cutthroat hiring frenzy of the late 1990s. By Alexei Barrionuevo.

CONTRARY-COLUMN (Undated) -- With hundreds of cable channels on television and a seemingly infinite number of choices on the Internet, it's easy to assume that theaters, concert halls and ballparks must be chronically empty. Instead, the opposite is true. Wherever you look, it seems, people want to see something in person. Technology will never replace live performances. By Daniel Akst.  STRATEGIES-COLUMN (Undated) -- In 2002, Morningstar completed a major overhaul of its mutual fund rating system, significantly narrowing the categories in which individual funds were placed and evaluated. Enough time has elapsed to allow a meaningful test of how well the new system works as a tool for fund investors. The results are in -- and they are quite positive. By Mark Hulbert.  INVESTING  INVEST-SHAREHOLDERS (Undated) -- In the last year, hedge funds and deep-pocketed individual investors have been cajoling management at many large companies to buy back shares, increase dividends or take other steps to bolster shareholder value. For the most part, mutual funds -- the investment vehicle of choice for most investors -- have historically avoided shareholder activism, and most still do. But a handful have joined hedge funds and other investors on the corporate barricades. By Daniel Gross.  FEATURE  VIDEO-IPOD (Undated) -- Partly because of the popularity of Apple's new video iPod, introduced in October, the sight of people staring at Lost or other shows on tiny screens as they ride the bus may become as commonplace as that of people talking on cellphones. By Anne Eisenberg.  AUTO-SHOW (Detroit) -- While luxury automakers introduced titillating high-performance cars last week at the North American International Auto Show, it was mostly a reality show for real people who need real transportation. By Cheryl Jensen.  AUTO-DESIGN (Detroit) -- Big hips are back. The swollen rear fenders that dominated car design in the late 1960s, the shape of oversize muscle and latent sensuality, are bulging from many of the dream machines at the North American International Auto Show.

, they said,	 House Republicans said that's their goal because tourists are such huge contributors to Florida's economy. Another factor, they said, is that people in adjacent states might be attracted to Florida to make big purchases. </P> 	nyt_eng_200601.gz

, he said,	 Weir said he woke up Thursday morning and did not want to get out of bed because the pressure to succeed here was so stifling. He felt a burden to win his third consecutive national championship. But the worst part, he said, was knowing he was so close to reaching the Olympics. The winner of the nationals receives an automatic Olympic bid. The other two Olympic spots for the men will be chosen by a U.S. Figure Skating committee after Saturday's free skate. </P> 	nyt_eng_200601.gz
, I said,	 Hill said she was reluctant about the swan costume when Weir brought the idea to her. When he showed me the pictures, I said, 'Oh, I don't know how people are going to take that,' she said. Then she changed her mind, as Weir showed how he could make the costume work. </P> 	nyt_eng_200601.gz
, she said,	 The building generates less than $150,000 in property taxes but 3,000 people work there, although at average wages that probably are less than those of factory workers. But for Karlen, the shopping mall clearly beats an abandoned factory. Overall, she said, We're thrilled. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20060112.0351 type=story > <HEADLINE> UNITED REDUCES MANAGERS' STAKE </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> CHICAGO </DATELINE> <TEXT> 	nyt_eng_200601.gz

, they think,	 In Rx, author Lynn, familiar with this problem from personal experience, mercilessly shows how teenagers find it easy (and, they think, safe) to get prescription drugs from adults' medicine cabinets or other students. Lynn illustrates this insidious temptation through high-achieving but self-doubting student Thyme Gilcrest, who starts popping Ritalin because it helps her feel razor-sharp and witty, and able to concentrate on her homework. </P> 	nyt_eng_200601.gz
, he notes,	 Washington -- White House strategist Karl Rove has a favorite historical analogy for deciphering contemporary American politics. Our turn of the century, he notes, has parallels to the last one, 100 years ago. </P> 	nyt_eng_200601.gz
, I say,	 In contrast to his colleagues, Holmes had a fearless, expansive view of liberty. Young man, he once told a 61-year-old associate, about 75 years ago I learned that I was not God. When the people ... want to do something that I can't find anything in the Constitution expressly forbidding them to do, I say, whether I like it or not, 'Goddamnit, let 'em do it.'  </P> 	nyt_eng_200601.gz
, you know,	 This fall, Danes was able to revisit her early love of dance when she appeared at Performance Space 122 in a solo piece choreographed by Tamar Rogoff. The performance, titled Christina Olson: American Model, was inspired by Andrew Wyeth's painting Christina's World, in which a young disabled girl, lying on her side in a desolate field, turns toward a house in the distance. Danes laughingly described filming a video segment used in the piece, in which she dragged herself across East 10th Street on one hip, in the famous posture captured in that painting: Nobody looked. It's kind of an incredible piece of footage, because everybody was entirely unfazed at some scrawny white girl, you know, dragging herself across the street. And I thought, OK, I'm playing it way too safe. So I'm getting a lot less squeamish. </P> 	nyt_eng_200601.gz
, she says,	 She professes to find her recent work more watchable than projects from a few years ago, which still have the capacity to make her cringe. But with the passage of a little more time, she says, her older performances become watchable again: I see something I did when I was 15 now, and I go, awww. </P> 	nyt_eng_200601.gz

, he said,	 In an interview Thursday, Yoo said the balancing called for by the Jackson concurrence does not apply to the surveillance program. The Jackson concurrence applies to domestic matters which are outside the theater of combat, Yoo said. The surveillance program, by contrast, is partly international, he said, and the theater of combat after the Sept. 11 attacks encompasses the United States. </P> 	nyt_eng_200601.gz
, he testified,	 Davis said he ran, bleeding, and collapsed onto the hood of a car occupied by men with whom he'd played pool. As they loaded him into the car to go to the hospital, he testified, Waltz yelled, Put the (racial slur) down. Let him die. </P> 	nyt_eng_200601.gz
, they say,	 Prosecutors say they are skeptical that Amundson has learned much in prison; he has continued, they say, to expect special treatment. At one point, he tried to get into a boot camp program that would have halved his sentence; prosecutors blocked the move, saying it was intended for inmates with drug problems or illiteracy, not white-collar criminals. </P> 	nyt_eng_200601.gz
, she said,	 Amundson resigned as a judge and agreed to plead guilty, but he haggled over sentencing, she said, trying to avoid prison time. He sought to mitigate his sentence in 2002 by arguing that he suffered from bipolar disorder, but prosecutors pointed out that he had written an opinion rejecting psychological factors as mitigating circumstances. They sought a sentence 12 months longer than the guidelines recommended; Amundson himself, they noted, had written opinions upholding extended sentences in cases where the victim was particularly vulnerable. </P> 	nyt_eng_200601.gz
, he says,	 He did all this even as he continued to serve as president of the state Senate. That is a troubling consolidation of power allowed by the state's Constitution. But Codey did not abuse it. Next week he will return full time to the Senate, where, he says, he will have new respect for what's facing Corzine. </P> 	nyt_eng_200601.gz

, he said,	 We're moving toward a fairer system. We want to give more power to consumers by giving more importance to how you drive and how much you drive, said Mark Savage, senior attorney for Consumers Union. Insurers, he said, are going to go to rural counties and their leaders and give them these horror stories that all these people are going to get these rate increases. </P> 	nyt_eng_200601.gz

, you feel,	 Best of all are two artistic encounters. Cartier-Bresson has a brief conversation with the celebrated Czech photographer Josef Koudelka; and the complicit, kindly look on his face as the younger man speaks is at once moving and thrilling. Koudelka having visited him, Cartier-Bresson pays a visit of his own, to the Louvre. He gazes rapt at Vermeer's Lacemaker, his face inches from the canvas. What he says in the documentary of using the camera applies at this moment to both him and us: You see, you feel, and the surprised eye responds. </P> 	nyt_eng_200601.gz
, she said,	 HARDROCK-FLA -- HOLLYWOOD, Fla. -- We weren't all housewives, but we were desperate. For fun, for luxury, for the most beautiful sight of all, a royal flush. We had been talking for a year about getting away for a girls' weekend. The idea of the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino came from another friend, who had taken shelter there during one of the 2004 storms and loved it. That, she said, was a hurricane party. Finally, we started saving money, picked a date and drove down to Broward County. That's the beauty of it, really. It's so close. And glamorous. And luxurious. And a whole lot of fun.

Volatile energy markets and record-high commodity prices are prompting renewed interest from investors eager to play in the sector. That has pushed banks and a growing number of hedge funds to hire more energy traders and brainy quantitative minds to back their bets on energy prices. In Houston, New York and London, a scramble for top trading talent has ensued that rivals the cutthroat hiring frenzy of the late 1990s. By Alexei Barrionuevo.  With photos .  WASSERSTEIN (Undated) -- If Bruce Wasserstein is good at anything, it is thinking, overthinking, doubting his own thinking and thinking some more. He is a classic New Yorker in the Woody Allen mold. While he may be a card-carrying Master of the Universe, he is more neurotic geek than banker jock. By Andrew Ross Sorkin.  MARKET-WATCH (Undated) -- Weekly Wall Street commentary. By Gretchen Morgenson.  ECON-COLUMN (Undated) -- Adding up the real cost of the Iraq war. By Louis Uchitelle.  With photo.  EVERYBODYS-BUSINESS (Undated) -- None of us can predict or read the future. But we can read the past, and we can learn from it. By Ben Stein.  CONTRARY-COLUMN (Undated) -- With hundreds of cable channels on television and a seemingly infinite number of choices on the Internet, it's easy to assume that theaters, concert halls and ballparks must be chronically empty. Instead, the opposite is true. Wherever you look, it seems, people want to see something in person. Technology will never replace live performances. By Daniel Akst.  STRATEGIES-COLUMN (Undated) -- In 2002, Morningstar completed a major overhaul of its mutual fund rating system, significantly narrowing the categories in which individual funds were placed and evaluated. Enough time has elapsed to allow a meaningful test of how well the new system works as a tool for fund investors. The results are in -- and they are quite positive. By Mark Hulbert.  INVEST-SHAREHOLDERS (Undated) -- In the last year, hedge funds and deep-pocketed individual investors have been cajoling management at many large companies to buy back shares, increase dividends or take other steps to bolster shareholder value. For the most part, mutual funds -- the investment vehicle of choice for most investors -- have historically avoided shareholder activism, and most still do. But a handful have joined hedge funds and other investors on the corporate barricades. By Daniel Gross.  FEATURE  VIDEO-IPOD (Undated) -- Partly because of the popularity of Apple's new video iPod, introduced in October, the sight of people staring at Lost or other shows on tiny screens as they ride the bus may become as commonplace as that of people talking on cellphones. By Anne Eisenberg.  AUTO-SHOW (Detroit) -- While luxury automakers introduced titillating high-performance cars last week at the North American International Auto Show, it was mostly a reality show for real people who need real transportation. By Cheryl Jensen.  With photo.  AUTO-DESIGN (Detroit) -- Big hips are back. The swollen rear fenders that dominated car design in the late 1960s, the shape of oversize muscle and latent sensuality, are bulging from many of the dream machines at the North American International Auto Show.

"161921"	"I"	"hope"	" The Supreme Court's decision is a victory for patients and their doctors -- including, I hope, some of the ones in prison for violating the federal legal theory that has now been rejected by the court. The doctors should go free, and Republicans in the White House and Congress should restrain the drug warriors who locked them up.

"162496"	"they"	"hope"	" And finally on the eve of the Super Bowl and eerily prophetic of our current era of terror is Black Sunday (1977). Crazed Vietnam vet Bruce Dern is recruited by icy Black September operative Marthe Keller to hijack the Goodyear blimp and blow it up over the Super Bowl, killing, they hope, everyone in the stadium. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"162851"	"they"	"hope"	" Chief among those criteria is the borrower's rating from the credit reporting bureau Experian, but borrowers can also join or create groups with defined interests or characteristics that, they hope, will make them more attractive to some lenders. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
"163873"	"they"	"hope"	" That is vividly shown by the side-by-side presentation of a healthy lung and one darkened and damaged by smoking. Such a display, they hope, will get people to make healthier decisions. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200603.gz"
"165529"	"I"	"hope"	" The relationship these newspapers show to me is destroying the ties that bind us. I'm going to be around a long time, I hope, Stevens said.

"169826"	"they"	"hope"	" Healthy and unburdened by legal problems, Allen should be a key part of the Boston rotation. But for now, he is not even part of the team's long-term plans, as Ainge did not exercise Allen's fourth-year option in July with the other players in his draft class (Sebastian Telfair, Al Jefferson, Delonte West).

"169994"	"I"	"hope"	" The wild game over, we said our goodbyes. Joann invited me to come back anytime, unless the Yankees are in town. Those tickets are understandably priceless.

"169996"	"we"	"hope"	" In addition to playing football, athletes are students and must attend class, be successful and ultimately graduate.

, he writes,	 All the authors are women of course. Mendelson has chosen them, he writes, out of the belief that what is most valuable in literature is not the single individual, but the interweaving of emotions and relationships among a group of people. Because society in the 19th century and much of the 20th tended to treat women impersonally and as a category, it was female writers who were most strongly motivated to explore and develop the personal. </P> 	nyt_eng_200608.gz

, he said,	 In the history of the all-volunteer force, said O'Hanlon, this is the first all-out war the United States has fought for an extended period of time. It's no surprise, he said, that the Pentagon is struggling to fine-tune its force requirements, or that combat forces in particular are being stretched thin. </P> 	nyt_eng_200608.gz
, she whispers,	 Paris, the CD, is evidently a vanity project; the packaging includes nearly as many photographs of the singer (10) as tracks (11). And some of the lightweight love songs, like the sleek disco throwback I Want You, work pretty well. But throughout, you get the welcome feeling that Hilton isn't taking any of this too seriously. Wasting no time in getting to her beloved catchphrase, she whispers, It's hot, six seconds into the first song. And the album, which lasts less than 40 minutes, ends with a perfectly useless version of the Rod Stewart hit Do Ya Think I'm Sexy. </P> 	nyt_eng_200608.gz
, he said,	 At Juilliard, he said, his emphasis would center on the role of the artist in society, or the subject of how do you engage in the society around you in the broadest and most unexpected ways, rather than the narrow definition of success for a young dancer, actor or musician. </P> 	nyt_eng_200608.gz
, he says,	 Edwards was cleared to practice within the first few days of camp, about a month ahead of schedule. A big fuss was made, largely for show. But the knee, he says, has given him no trouble. </P> 	nyt_eng_200608.gz
, he says,	 Now, he says, soldiers are not supposed to fire even at an armed Iraqi, who could be a security guard or a neighborhood resident protecting his street, unless he aims his weapon first. It's all spelled in modified rules of engagement defined by U.S. commanders. </P> 	nyt_eng_200608.gz
, he said,	 She's trying to live her life with someone she loves, Dawson said in an interview. He said he had reluctantly come to the conclusion that passions over conversion were so inflamed that there was no room for her and her fiance in Malaysia. The most promising solution, he said, was for her to emigrate. </P> 	nyt_eng_200608.gz
, he said,	 Church members know us as who we are, and the outside world knows us as we were, he said. He was fearful, he said, that if his conversion became public the religious authorities would come after him, and he could be sentenced to a religious-rehabilitation camp. </P> 	nyt_eng_200608.gz
, he said,	 Sabir Aziz al-Duri, a former intelligence officer and one of the defendants, offered a summary of his own. In the prelude to a question for the witness -- as is allowed under Iraqi law -- he said, The Iranians and the Kurdish were joined.

TOP  Lede story (1-col. hed):  STEM-CELL (Undated) -- Biologists have developed a technique for establishing colonies of human embryonic stem cells from an early human embryo without killing it. This method, if confirmed in other laboratories, would seem to remove the principal objection to the research -- that it involves destruction of a human embryo. There is no rational reason left to oppose this research, said Dr. Robert Lanza, vice president of Advanced Cell Technology and leader of the team that is reporting the new method in the journal Nature. But critics of human embryonic stem cell research raised other objections, such as the possible risk to the embryo and the in vitro fertilization procedure itself, in which embryos are generated from a couple's egg and sperm.

(Scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in i news file.)  Top left (4-col. photo, story at fold):  AFRICA-CHILD-LABOR (Lusaka, Zambia) -- The boulders here are hard enough that the scavengers who have taken over the abandoned quarry south of downtown prefer not to strike them directly with their hammers. They heat the rocks first -- with flaming tires, scrap plastic, even old rubber boots. At dusk, when three or four blazes spew choking black clouds across the huge pit, the quarry looks like a woodcut out of Dante. Alone Banda works in this purgatory six days a week. Nine years old, nearly lost in a hooded sweatshirt, he takes football-size chunks of fractured rock and beats them into powder with a thick steel bolt. In a good week, he says, he can make enough powder to fill half a cement bag. His grandmother sells the bag for about $3. Often, she said, it is the difference between eating and going hungry. Across most of the globe, the number of children forced to work is in sharp decline. But sub-Saharan Africa is the exception, in places like Lusaka and for children like Alone. Here, more than one in four children below age 14 works. By Michael Wines.  MIDEAST-GAZA (Jerusalem) -- An unknown Islamic group issued a sweeping demand on Wednesday for the release of all Muslim prisoners held in the United States in exchange for two Fox News television journalists seized at gunpoint last week in Gaza City. The group, calling itself the Holy Jihad Brigades, had not claimed responsibility or made any demands until Wednesday, when it released a statement along with a video of the two men, Steve Centanni, 60, an American based in Washington, and Olaf Wiig, 36, a cameraman from New Zealand. By Greg Myre.  KATRINA-EVACUEES (Atlanta) -- Kenneth Woodfin, who with his family is running a popular New Orleans-style sno-ball stand in Atlanta, is leading a more stable, prosperous life here than in the city he fled. And among the thousands of Katrina evacuees who went to Atlanta, the Woodfins are not an anomaly. Many went there by choice and have put down roots, embracing what they say is a higher standard of living and melting into thriving neighborhoods almost without a trace. But for those New Orleanians who went west instead of east, especially those borne by fate rather than preference, exile has been a very different experience. In Houston, it can seem as if the storm never ended. Many evacuees remain in restless limbo, unable to return home but alienated from their new city. No matter where they ended up, of course, evacuees are not at peace over the destruction of their homes and communities. But the divergent experiences of those who went to Houston and Atlanta suggest that recovery depends on more than individual resources and demographics. Just as important are less quantifiable factors: a sense of welcome and connection, the presence of friends and family, even how close the victim came to death during the disaster. By Shaila Dewan.  NY-SPITZER (New York) -- Fresh off a decisive victory, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg started his second term this year with huge ambitions for economic development in the city. He wanted to restart the troubled rebuilding effort at ground zero, for example, and reshape the far West Side of Manhattan. In recent weeks, however, the administration has been finding its efforts stymied, at least in part because of a man who has little if any official say in these matters. Eliot Spitzer has not yet won the Democratic primary for governor, but already he has started flexing his political muscle, lobbying to put the brakes on projects that Bloomberg has been trying to accelerate. By Diane Cardwell and Charles V. Bagli.  MIDEAST-LEBANON (Beirut, Lebanon) -- Amnesty International accused Israel on Wednesday of war crimes in its monthlong battle with Hezbollah, saying Israel's bombing campaign amounted to indiscriminate attacks on Lebanon's civilian infrastructure and population. By John Kifner.  (Story has moved in i news file.)  MIDEAST-FORCE (Paris) -- France told Israel on Wednesday that it would increase its commitment of troops to a multinational peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon in the coming days. France had offered to lead the proposed 15,000-strong multinational force authorized by a U.N. resolution earlier this month but then announced that it was sending just 200 troops to join the 200 it already has deployed.

ECON-REPORT (Undated) -- In the latest and strongest indication that the frenzy of buying and selling homes is over, the National Association of Realtors reported on Wednesday that sales of previously owned homes in July fell to the lowest level in over two years.

, he said,	 Dr. Leon Kass, former chairman of the President's Council on Bioethics, said, I do not think that this is the sought-for, morally unproblematic and practically useful approach we need. Kass said the long-term risk of preimplantation genetic diagnosis was unknown and that the present technique was inefficient, requiring blastomeres from many embryos to generate each new cell line. It would be better to derive human stem cell lines from the body's mature cells, he said, a method researchers are still working on. </P> 	nyt_eng_200608.gz
