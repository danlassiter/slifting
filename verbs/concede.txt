"722"	"they"	"concede"	" The hard-pressed managers would like another utility to pay the $3.4 billion it will cost to finish building the plants and get them up and running. But that, they concede, is unlikely. Another possibility would be to convert the plants to coal or natural gas. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199407.gz"
"12514"	"we"	"concede"	" Second, the statute's language permits the ``commerce in fact'' interpretation. That interpretation, we concede, leaves little work for the word ``evidencing'' (in the phrase ``a contract evidencing a transaction'') to perform, for every contract evidences some transaction. But, perhaps Congress did not want that word to perform much work. The Act's history, to the extent informative, indicates that the Act's supporters saw the Act as part of an effort to make arbitration agreements universally enforceable. They wanted to ``get a Federal law'' that would ``cover'' areas where the Constitution authorized Congress to legislate, namely ``interstate and foreign commerce and admiralty.'' Joint Hearings, at 16 (testimony of Julius H. Cohen). They urged Congress to model the Act after a New York statute that made enforceable a written arbitration provision ``in a written contract,'' Act of Apr. 19, 1920, ch. 275, s2, 1920 N. Y. Laws 803, 804. Hearing on S. 4213 and S. 4214 before the Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 67th Cong., 4th Sess., 2 (1923) (testimony of Charles L. Bernheimer). Early drafts made enforceable a written arbitration provision ``in any contract or maritime transaction or transaction involving commerce.'' S. 4214, 67th Cong., 4th Sess. s2 (1922) (emphasis added); S. 1005, 68th Cong., 1st Sess. (1923); H. R. 646, 68th Cong., 1st Sess. (1924). Members of Congress, looking at that phrase, might have thought the words ``any contract'' standing alone went beyond Congress's constitutional authority. And, if so, they might have simply connected those words with the later words ``transaction involving commerce,'' thereby creating the phrase that became law. Nothing in the Act's history suggests any other, more limiting, task for the language. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199501.gz"
"40213"	"they"	"concede"	" Still, the legislation would reduce the EPA's budget by about a sixth from what the agency spent last year, and so the Republicans expect President Clinton to cast a veto that, they concede, will be difficult to override. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"
"41510"	"we"	"concede"	" Think again. Like any hot offering in the current IPO craze, Ma and Pa took what Wall Street considers their proper places as last in line for Pixar.

"72927"	"they"	"concede"	" Officials speculated about an angina attack brought on by the stress of the campaign; they phoned around to outside cardiologists, hoping someone had some insight.

"99338"	"they"	"concede"	" Air power alone, McCain and some colleagues in both parties said, will never force Osama bin Laden into the open. They said they believe that only ground troops, operating from a secure base within Afghanistan, will do that. That might well involve tens of thousands of troops, hundreds of casualties and many months of effort, they concede, but they see no viable option. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200110.gz"

"105855"	"I"	"concede"	" All four of the above picks were also Screen Actors Guild nominees. The one I cannot fathom getting an Oscar nod is the very talented Kevin Kline in the very treacly ``Life As A House.'' They might as well nominate Jim Carrey in ``The Majestic.'' But I predict the fifth nomination will go to Will Smith in the title role of Ali, a crafty take on the all-too-familiar Muhammad Ali that single-handedly carries that picture. OK, I concede, that's a long-shot pick. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"124821"	"they"	"concede"	" But such support for Musharraf's crackdown does not necessarily translate into support for the United States. America has not kept its promises, Pakistanis said. Some of Pakistan's foreign debt has been written off, they concede, but tariffs on the country's textiles imported into the United States remain in place. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
