"9039"	"he"	"concludes"	" What meaning did Frazier finally wrest from his pursuit of the past? In an eloquent summing up of the American experience as a tragic attempt to build a New Jerusalem, he concludes, ``And in suburbs like country towns of a century before but with ever less distance between them, ... in single-family houses built in a colonial style to suggest perhaps the Americanness of the people inside, ... in master bedrooms and living rooms and dens connected to the outside world mainly by technology, in closet top shelves stacked with boxes of old family papers and in bookshelves of mostly forgotten books, the dream of America as the kingdom of God came to rest.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_199411.gz"

(HLW) By LAUREL GRAEBER c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service  AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A FACE  By Lucy Grealy. Harper Perennial, $12.  When the author was a child, physicians removed a rare cancer from her jaw _ and half the bone with it. She explains how she reconstructed her shattered sense of self in the years before plastic surgery could restore her face. ``It's a young woman's first book, the story of her own life, and both book and life are unforgettable,'' A.G. Mojtabai said here last year.  QUICKSAND  By Junichiro Tanizaki. Translated by Howard Hibbett. Vintage International, $11.  First published in serial form in Japan in 1928-30, this novel treats erotic love as a form of worship _ a religion that sometimes demands the ultimate sacrifice. Mitsuko, a beautiful and devious art student, becomes the lover of both a woman and her husband. She finally persuades them to enter into a suicide pact, which has unexpected consequences. In 1994, our reviewer, Ian Buruma, called the book ``a fascinating read'' and a story that ``transcends culture.'' Vintage International has also reissued a volume of two novellas by Tanizaki, THE REED CUTTER and CAPTAIN SHIGEMOTO'S MOTHER, translated by Anthony H. Chambers ($11). They also revolve around all-consuming love. ``In both stories, the author has become the consummate connoisseur of Japanese tradition,'' Buruma said in the same review.  OF LONG MEMORY: Mississippi and the Murder of Medgar Evers  By Adam Nossiter. Addison-Wesley, $12.  The author, a reporter for The New York Times, shows how the first political assassination of the 1960s, intended to squelch the civil rights movement, actually galvanized it. He ``chronicles the long journey from 1964 to 1994 through profiles of black and white figures who eventually forced Mississippi to confront its moral and legal duties,'' William Ferris wrote here last year. Evers's life and death also figure in LOCAL PEOPLE: The Struggle for Civil Rights in Mississippi, by John Dittmer (Illini/University of Illinois, $14.95). The author evokes leaders like Robert Moses, a voting organizer from Harlem, and men and women from diverse communities in Mississippi who helped earn the state its current place in history. He gives ``a gripping portrait of largely forgotten civil rights workers who forged racial change in the face of violence and murder,'' Ferris said in the same review. The environment they had to fight is examined in BEHIND THE MASK OF CHIVALRY: The Making of the Second Ku Klux Klan, by Nancy MacLean (Oxford University, $13.95). The author sees the Klan's revival in the years after World War I as primarily rooted in economics, with lower-middle-class have-nots focusing their resentment on blacks and immigrants. ``This is a big book about a small place,'' Jacquelyn Dowd Hall said in the Book Review in 1994. ``Its dark vision of the American heartland is bound to stir lively debate.'' WHITE TERROR: The Ku Klux Klan Conspiracy and Southern Reconstruction, by Allen W. Trelease (Louisiana State University, $17.95), traces the origins of the Klan, noting that it infiltrated both law enforcement and the judicial system in the Southern states following the Civil War. In 1971, our reviewer, C. Vann Woodward, called ``Mr. Trelease's excellent book'' the ``fullest narrative history of the subject we are likely to have.''  CAL  By Bernard Mac Laverty. Norton, $11.  This haunting novel explores the pain and divided loyalties of contemporary Ireland through a single life: that of Cal, a teen-age boy in Ulster who becomes both an unwilling participant in an IRA murder and the anguished lover of the dead man's wife. ``Its meditation on human suffering and responsibility carries the complexity and amplitude of the very finest novels,'' Michael Gorra said here in 1983.  GUEST OF A SINNER  By James Wilcox. Harper Perennial, $12.  Eric Thorsen, a musician, wages war against his elderly neighbor, whose apartment reeks of 22 cats. Along the way, both his life and his living quarters change. This novel's characters ``would be exactly like everyone else if James Wilcox hadn't made them so much funnier,'' Eric Kraft said in the Book Review in 1993.  ONE OF US: Richard Nixon and the American Dream  By Tom Wicker. Random House, $16.  A former columnist for The New York Times renders a portrait of the former president that is the opposite of the conventional wisdom: Nixon, he concludes, was often an able man in domestic matters but largely a failure in foreign affairs. In 1991, our reviewer, Godfrey Hodgson, wrote: ``Mr. Wicker's knowledge, insight, and fairness have enabled him to transcend the scuffle between the friends and the foes of Richard Nixon.'' A similar argument is advanced in NIXON RECONSIDERED, by Joan Hoff (Basic Books, $16), which states that Nixon, not Henry Kissinger, engineered much of his administration's foreign policy. ``What sets this book apart is its exhaustive research and ... provocative intellectual framework,'' Richard Norton Smith said here last year.  SARATOGA BACKTALK  By Stephen Dobyns. Penguin, $5.95.  In his Saratoga Springs mystery of last year, the author allows Victor Plotz, usually a sidekick, to investigate a horse owner's murder. ``His snappy sense of humor gets this brash sleuth through his first case in high style,'' Marilyn Stasio wrote in these pages in 1994.  DREAMS LIKE THUNDER  By Diane Simmons. Story Line Press, $14.95.  In 1959, a 10-year-old girl discovers that her Oregon pioneer heritage may be less noble than she imagined. The author ``has the measure of her setting as well as her rural characters,'' Karen Mathieson said in the Book Review in 1992. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950813.0056 type=story > <HEADLINE> TWO YEARS FROM CHINESE RULE, JITTERS RISE IN HONG KONG </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> HONG KONG (BC-HONG-KONG-COX) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the non-fiction list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in criticism from publishing houses.)  Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Aug. 6, 1995.  The listings are based on computer-processed sales figures from 3,050 bookstores and from representative wholesalers with more than 38,000 retail outlets, including newsstands, variety stores, supermarkets, and bookstores. These figures are statistically adjusted to represent sales in all such outlets across the United States. The number of titles within the two subdivisions of non-fiction can change from week to week, reflecting changes in book buying.  An `x' following a book's ranking indicates that its sales, weighted to reflect the book-selling industry nationally, are barely distinguishable from those of the book above.

If you have questions about stories, call 888-346-9867 or 212-556-1927.  ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS  PAGE ONE  ARCHITECTURE-VENICE-BIENNALE (Venice) _ The Venice Biennale's Seventh International Architecture Exhibition features the latest strain to emerge in architecture in recent years: ``blob'' design, produced with the aid of animation software. Biomorphic and invertebrate, blobs look like things you would expect to see rising from an electronic version of the primordial ooze. But a small floating park set within the cargo hold of a rusting freight barge is the favorite of Herbert Muschamp, the Times critic.  FILM  FILM-LECONTE (Paris) _ Patrice Leconte has averaged one feature a year since his debut in 1975, and in the time it has taken for ``The Girl on the Bridge'' to reach the United States, he has completed one feature _ the period piece ``The Widow of Saint-Pierre,'' with Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil _ and is filming ``Felix et Lola'' with Charlotte Gainsbourg and Philippe Torreton. In his spare time, he makes commercials. ``The Girl on the Bridge,'' which opens Friday in New York, is a love story. ``All films are love stories,'' he says in an interview in Paris. By Dave Kehr.  MUSIC  MUSIC-JARRE-FILM (Undated) _ Michael Beckerman says he is rooting for Maurice Jarre to win an Oscar for his brilliant score of ``Sunshine.'' Then, Beckerman says, he hopes Jarre gives it to Schubert. To create the main musical theme, Jarre has played the first phrase of the Schubert Fantasy in F Minor without notes 6-15, the added a new expansive phrase. The Schubert fantasy is a particularly compelling choice for ``Sunshine'' because the opening suggests a Hungarian Gypsy origin, appropriate for the film set over three generations of one family in Hungary.  ART  ART-RIJKSMUSEUM (Amsterdam, the Netherlands)_ ``The Glory of the Golden Age'' at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam celebrates the museum's 200th anniversary and offers a reminder that the 17th century was a special moment of creative boom in Dutch history. In other parts of Europe, art was still reflecting the power of kings and popes; in the Netherlands, it mirrored the emergence of a new mercantile society. With still lifes decorating every self-respecting home, it was an enviable time to be an artist. Several million paintings were produced by several thousand artists. By Alan Riding.  TELEVISION  TV-COPS-RUSSIA (St. Petersburg, Russia) _ In the last two years, St. Petersburg has become the hottest location for the hottest trend on Russian television: gritty, tell-it-like-it-is cop shows. The boom began in early 1998 with ``The Street of Broken Streetlights,'' a St. Petersburg version of ``Hill Street Blues.'' Now, in its wake, half a dozen mini-series are being shot or are on the drawing boards in St. Petersburg, starring counter-intelligence agents, mafia dons, tough female investigators and other heroes and villains. The choice of St. Petersburg echoes real life. In recent years, the city has become infamous for a string of contract killings. By Celestine Bohlen.  With photo.  TV-BURNETT-SURVIVOR (Undated) _ Mark Burnett may not be liked by everybody, but he has survived the entertainment world. The 40-year-old British native landed in Los Angeles in 1982, moved from au pair work to telemarketing, insurance and credit card sales before being inspired by a Tony Robbins motivational seminar. He has since developed two winning entertainment vehicles in remarkably little time by Hollywood standards. Over the last five years MTV, ESPN and the Discovery Channel have spent $100 million, by his estimate, on his ``Eco-Challenge Expedition Race.'' Now he is producing ``Survivor,'' the latest in what he promises will be a stream of adventure-related businesses and programming combining a blend of drama and reality he calls ``dramality.''

TRAVEL  (moving in `e' category) The following stories moved Monday, July 23, in the `t' category.  TRAVEL-JERUSALEM-HOTELS (Jerusalem) _ Jerusalem is not an ordinary city and this is not an ordinary guide to hotels there. William Orme Jr. makes discerning recommendations in a 3,000-word piece full of details about decor, history, service and discounts. The hotels visited included: the Olive Tree, a Holy Land theme inn; the American Colony, an 84-room compound developed from a 19th-century pasha's manse; and the King David, which for true self-indulgence, he concludes, is Jerusalem's best luxury hotel. He even recommends the hotel's promotional film in which employees recall everything from the 1946 bombing of its west wing to the pyramid cake they baked for Anwar Sadat in 1977. With photo.  The Travel section also includes this package on Kids: Why Leave Home Without Them.  TRAVEL-BRAZIL-SOCCER (Undated) _ How you play the game of soccer does matter. So Annasue McCleave Wilson accompanied her 14-year-old son, John, to Florianopolis, Brazil, for training sessions and matches planned by his coach, Paulo Barreto. In between games, John and his teammates had time for sandboarding and exchanging e-mail addresses with Brazilian teenagers and parents had time for enjoying lime drinks on the hotel veranda, ecological walks and watching games played on sand as white as baby powder.  TRAVEL-TEENS (Undated) _ Based on first-hand experience from five trips, Jill Abramson has advice for parents traveling with teen-agers. In London, avoid the British Museum and Parliament, but visit the Tower of London and war rooms because teen-agers like gory stuff and they have seen enough World War II movies to make Whitehall interesting. In Paris, she reports that her daughter took in the Louvre in less than two hours, but loved going to a movie without a chaperone. Other advice: rent a ``sweet'' car, don't share rooms with teen-agers because vacation for them means not being neat and finally, don't insist on little adults, be a big kid instead.  PRACTICAL-TRAVELER (Undated) How young is too young for a child to fly? It depends on whom you ask. Continental will not accept an infant younger than 7 days. American Airlines sets a 3-day limit, but in fact, a spokesman says the airline doesn't ``inspect'' babies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta recommends 6 weeks. Another expert asks if a postpartum mother is ready for a long trip and still another says a good criteria might be, Is this trip really necessary? By Betsy Wade.  REGULAR FEATURES  TRAVEL-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Joseph Siano answers questions about the Grand Prix in Monaco; behind-the-scenes tours of English Cathedrals and apartment rentals in Sydney.  TRAVEL-CUBA (Undated) _ Cuba has been off-limits for American tourists for almost 40 years and unless President Clinton changes his mind, the ban on United States tourist travel to Cuba is likely to be tightened this summer. Meanwhile, travel from the United States to Cuba increases. Edwin McDowell reports that there are charters from New York, Miami and Los Angeles for exchange groups and entrepreneurs take American tourists to Cuba without running afoul of U.S. authorities. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20000718.0342 type=story > <HEADLINE> A DUTCH MOMENT OF GENIUS IN ITS FULL GLORY </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> AMSTERDAM, the Netherlands (BC-ART-RIJKSMUSEUM-2TAKES-$ADV23-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200007.gz"

Iris Krasnow, author of the new book ``Surrendering to Marriage,'' discusses the results of her interviews with some 300 spouses. Marriage has its faults, she concludes, but unless there's actual abuse, it's better to be married. In other articles, Kati Marton dissects the marriage of Lyndon and Lady Bird Johnson in her new book, ``Hidden Power''; Anne McElvoy looks at Cherie Blair's role as the wife of British Prime Minister Tony Blair; and Susan Cheever writes about what happens to a marriage when children change its dynamics.

Some of the episodes are musings, such as the  one between Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke, as two characters seen in bed  considering the relationship between reincarnation and collective  memory, and dream time versus waking time, extending a conversation they  began in a previous Linklater film, ``Before Sunrise.''

But according to a study published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, adults who abuse the drug may be at greater risk for depression.  Gregory B. Bovasso of the University of Pennsylvania Treatment Research Center studied a random sample of 1,920 adults who were interviewed first in 1980 and again between 1994 and 1996. Subjects diagnosed with cannabis abuse at the start of the study were four times more likely to experience depressive symptoms, particularly suicidal thoughts and the inability to experience pleasure, than their nonsmoking counterparts.  Participants who were depressed at the outset of the study, however, were no more likely to abuse marijuana later on, the study found.  According to Bavasso, because the findings address new cases of depressive symptoms (instead of the prevalence of depression), they ``underscore the importance of cannabis abuse prevention rather than treatment.'' Further research, he concludes, is needed to identify which characteristics of marijuana abusers account for their higher risk of depression.  SURGEONS WITHOUT BORDERS By MARK ALPERT  Telesurgery passed a significant milestone when doctors in New York City removed the gallbladder of a 68-year-old woman in Strasbourg, France.  Using a system designed by Computer Motion in Goleta, Calif., Jacques Marescaux of France's Research Institute against Cancers of the Digestive Tract and his colleagues manipulated a control console that sent high-speed signals to robotic surgical instruments more than 4,000 miles away.  The key to the success of the work _ dubbed Operation Lindbergh _ was a fiber-optic network that transmitted signals so quickly that doctors could see the movements of the instruments on a video screen 155 milliseconds after making them.  Richard Satava, a professor of surgery at Yale University who helped to develop the system, says telesurgery may be particularly useful where doctors are few and transportation is difficult.  ``We know that it can work,'' he says. ``Now we have to prove its cost-effectiveness.''

FOR THE MOST ANTIOXIDANTS, CHOOSE CRANBERRIES OVER OTHER FRUITS By SARAH GRAHAM  If one of your New Year's resolutions is to eat healthier foods, you might want to add some cranberries to your shopping cart. According to a recent study of 20 common fruits, cranberries have the highest level of phenols, a type of disease-fighting antioxidant. The findings appeared in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry.  Previous studies had demonstrated the link between eating fruits and vegetables and a reduced risk of coronary artery disease.  But Joe Vinson of the University of Scranton and colleagues bought supermarket samples of fresh fruits common in the American diet and tested them specifically for phenol content.  Many phenols and polyphenols are stronger antioxidants than those found in vitamins, the authors note, and thus may be better able to protect the heart from the negative effects of low and very low density lipoproteins. A serving of cranberries in their pure form, the researchers found, has the highest quantity of phenols. Pears, red grapes and apples round out the top four.  According to Vinson, a serving of uncooked berries or pure juice is the best way to reap the health benefits of the fruit because processing, storage and heating reduces the levels of antioxidants. The antioxidant levels in fresh and dried berries are higher than those in cranberry sauce or cranberry cocktails.  ---- (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  EDITOR: Visit The New York Times Syndicate Web site at http://www.nytimes.com/syndicate for more information on SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN NEWS SERVICE and other features.

But according to a study published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, adults who abuse the drug may be at greater risk for depression.  Gregory B. Bovasso of the University of Pennsylvania Treatment Research Center studied a random sample of 1,920 adults who were interviewed first in 1980 and again between 1994 and 1996. Subjects diagnosed with cannabis abuse at the start of the study were four times more likely to experience depressive symptoms, particularly suicidal thoughts and the inability to experience pleasure, than their nonsmoking counterparts.  Participants who were depressed at the outset of the study, however, were no more likely to abuse marijuana later on, the study found.  According to Bavasso, because the findings address new cases of depressive symptoms (instead of the prevalence of depression), they ``underscore the importance of cannabis abuse prevention rather than treatment.'' Further research, he concludes, is needed to identify which characteristics of marijuana abusers account for their higher risk of depression.  SURGEONS WITHOUT BORDERS By MARK ALPERT  Telesurgery passed a significant milestone when doctors in New York City removed the gallbladder of a 68-year-old woman in Strasbourg, France.  Using a system designed by Computer Motion in Goleta, Calif., Jacques Marescaux of France's Research Institute against Cancers of the Digestive Tract and his colleagues manipulated a control console that sent high-speed signals to robotic surgical instruments more than 4,000 miles away.  The key to the success of the work _ dubbed Operation Lindbergh _ was a fiber-optic network that transmitted signals so quickly that doctors could see the movements of the instruments on a video screen 155 milliseconds after making them.  Richard Satava, a professor of surgery at Yale University who helped to develop the system, says telesurgery may be particularly useful where doctors are few and transportation is difficult.  ``We know that it can work,'' he says. ``Now we have to prove its cost-effectiveness.''

ALZHEIMERS-DESIGN (New Canaan, Conn.) _ While medical science remains stymied by a cure for Alzheimer's, care givers are turning to architects and environmental psychologists to alleviate the symptoms. Recognizing that people who can't remember what they were doing moments before nonetheless can unearth memories of life 30 years earlier, senior care centers from Tanzania to Holland to New York are relying on settings laden with nostalgic cues, hoping to get patients talking in what nursing directors call ```reminiscence'' groups.

NY-ON-FILM (New York) _ James Sanders, the author of the recent book ``Celluloid Skyline: New York and the Movies,'' has spent more than a decade studying how film makers bring the city to life (and occasionally topple it) and how even the best Hollywood movies sometimes overstate the city's charms.

"104154"	"she"	"concludes"	" She views ``Rent,'' she said, as a ``distortion'' of the people it depicts _ lesbians and drag queens, Puerto Ricans and African-Americans, the homeless and HIV-infected _ because it makes them seem exactly the same as the ``white heterosexual male-dominant culture.'' It denies them, she writes in the book, their authentic ``specificity of experience'' because they are turned into homogenized products. The result, she concludes, is not art, but marketing. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"104235"	"he"	"concludes"	" The subtitle of the Atlanta chapter asks, ``Does Edge City have a future?'' For the author, the answer is an emphatic no. ``In my view, Atlanta has become such a mess that nothing can be done to redeem it as human habitat,'' Kunstler writes. The road system has ``clogged up like the porkfat-lined vascular system of a baby boom Bubba behind the wheel of his beloved SUV.'' Atlanta, he concludes, should serve as a cautionary tale to every other Sunbelt city that has yet to blunder into such bloat. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200201.gz"
"105024"	"she"	"concludes"	" But you start to love her madly when, still investigating the impending execution of Jesus-spoutin' Rona Leigh Glueck, Poppy is in Laredo. She hits the hotel bar. A Houston Astro, there for the wedding of a teammate, is at the bar. He's on the 15-day disabled list. After he leaves the next morning, she concludes, ``Disabled, my eye.'' FBI agent Rice is no slacker. She's intuitive and curious and tough and relentless. She takes on the state of Texas and its backward governor over the execution of Rona Leigh, on Death Row for 17 years and ready to die in days. Rona Leigh has found Jesus in the joint, her husband being a Bible-thumpin' minister who came along after she was locked up. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200202.gz"
"109469"	"he"	"concludes"	" Eskin ends his book with an ironic twist. In pursuing the fake Wilkomirski, he finds a real lost cousin in Israel. Wilkomirski, he concludes, was attractive as ``a symbol for all sorts of irreversible losses, individual and collective.'' Now, perhaps, the Wilburs will be able to embrace a real relative and forget the false claimant. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200203.gz"
"111626"	"he"	"concludes"	" ``QED.'' Alan Alda's portrayal of Richard Feynman (1918-1988), the plain-spoken, Nobel Prize-winning physicist who developed the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED), is a richly detailed study of a hyperactive and nutty man whose approach to life was as subtle as the pounding of bongo drums. As he balances calls from doctors and students one day at his California office, Feynman meditates on everything from ``South Pacific'' and the faraway land of Tuva to the 14-pound tumor that was removed from his abdomen and the crash of the space shuttle Challenger. The most memorable moments are when Feynman reflects on the aftermath of the nuclear attacks on Japan. If Manhattan were attacked, as many then feared, ``The radiation would spread all the way up from ground zero,'' he says. In the post-Sept. 11 environment, those words seem eerily prescient. The atomic bomb, he concludes, ``was a dumb, stupid idea.'' Lincoln Center Theater at the Vivian Beaumont. 212-239-6200. Through June 3. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"113835"	"she"	"concludes"	" Such a story has all the characteristics of folktale or archetype, White writes, reappearing in the same form, under the same circumstances, with the same disregard for truth. In fact, she concludes, the slut role is itself an archetype. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200204.gz"
"116821"	"he"	"concludes"	" Despite his concerns, Lamb left Hanoi in the spring of 2001 full of optimism about the country's potential. The nation, he concludes, ``is inspiring because a proud, industrious people endured terrible times, both during and after the war, and were strong enough to bury the past, to capitalize on the peace and to reach out to people like me who were once their enemy.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200205.gz"
"117425"	"he"	"concludes"	" No one can completely eradicate human fears about sharks cavalierly snacking on swimmers, but Benchley makes an excellent case here. Ultimately, he concludes, sharks ``don't want to eat you or hurt you,'' vastly preferring ``to be left alone to do what nature has programmed them to do: swim, eat, and make little sharks.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"118939"	"he"	"concludes"	" It may say even more about the author that in a section on decision making, he concludes, ``As the (medical) field grows ever more complex and technological . . . the real task is to preserve kindness.'' It's not hard to imagine that Atul Gawande might help do just that. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_20020619.0101 type=story > <HEADLINE> TWO MISSING GIRLS, BUT ONLY ONE BIG STORY </HEADLINE> <DATELINE>  (BC-MEDIA-KIDNAPS-BOS) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_200206.gz"
"120338"	"he"	"concludes"	" Corn, the laconic Beeghly tells us mysteriously, is both male -- the silk on an ear -- and female -- the kernels. What we're eating when we munch on an ear, he concludes, as we watch the ears twirl and dance, is ``a mouthful of ripe ovaries.'' His experiments were considered bizarre and even grotesque when he began them in the 1930s: He tells us, ``Orthodox agronomists called it plant incest.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200207.gz"
"123230"	"she"	"concludes"	" In the corporate world, she concludes, ``not available'' has become a lazy catch-all phrase. ``I consider it disrespectful of my time,'' she writes. ``It reflects poorly on the organization.'' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200208.gz"
"125873"	"he"	"concludes"	" Researchers were already aware that fMRI didn't reveal everything that was going on, but Logothetis showed just how limited it is. The BOLD signal was an order of magnitude more noisy than the electrode signal. In other words, the fMRI scans showed only a tiny fraction of the activation revealed by electrodes inserted into individual neurons. So the absence of a signal, he concludes, cannot safely be interpreted as an absence of neural activity. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"

"126636"	"he"	"concludes"	" The author ends by saying that school integration was never seriously tried because parents, politicians and judges lacked the political and moral will. Black America, he concludes, is still waiting to hit the Brown jackpot. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200209.gz"
"131100"	"he"	"concludes"	" Singer asks us to imagine a hypothetical society that discriminates against people on the basis of something nontrivial _ say, intelligence. If that scheme offends our sense of equality, then why is the fact that animals lack certain human characteristics any more just as a basis for discrimination? Either we do not owe any justice to the severely retarded, he concludes, or we do owe it to animals with higher capabilities. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200211.gz"

"141977"	"he"	"concludes"	" That may seem like pie in the sky, says Daniel B.

"144626"	"it"	"concludes"	" FactCheck agrees with the middle class paying a bigger share contention, but says that the wealthiest are paying less claim is misleading. The total burden is actually smaller all around, FactCheck says, and the richest still pay the most taxes. Thus, it concludes, the claim is a good example of how facts that are literally true can be used selectively to create a misleading picture. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200410.gz"
"150990"	"he"	"concludes"	" The problem, Rieff asserts, is that in places from Somalia to Rwanda, Cambodia to Haiti and Congo to Bosnia, the failure rate of these interventions spawned by the categorical imperatives of human rights and humanitarianism in altering the situation on the ground in any enduring way approaches 100 percent. Time and time again, he concludes, our moral ambitions have been revealed as being far larger than our political, military or even cognitive means. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200503.gz"
"153378"	"he"	"concludes"	" Haass said Bush's vague proposal, which was largely drafted by Stephen Hadley, now the national security adviser, fell short of what the North would accept but also failed to include any clear penalties for refusing to cooperate. North Korea felt no pressure to negotiate, he concludes, and never came back to the table. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200506.gz"
"154931"	"he"	"concludes"	" Wells' portrait is compelling. We understand the attackers; we might even hesitate to judge them, thinking ourselves as guilty as they. But there the hesitation ends. They are, after all, the enemy. The novel's greatest scorn is for the curate who keeps seeking root causes: What do these things mean? The attacks, he concludes, may be deserved. What sins have we done? At the same time, he is so consumed by self-scorn and fear, he is unable to fight or plan. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200507.gz"
"159058"	"he"	"concludes"	" While a lot of people spend a lot of money on Halloween treats, he says, I wouldn't be buying any of these stocks at these current levels. All of them, he concludes, are just not making enough money to support their high stock price. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200510.gz"

"160594"	"he"	"concludes"	" Henderson could cite the state for contempt for its failure to act, but believes such action has no realistic likelihood of proving effective. He believes it would simply extend the future life span of the current dysfunctional system given the state's self-professed inability to cope with the magnitude and complexity of this crisis. Contempt, he concludes, simply is not an appropriate remedy in the current circumstances. That sounds right. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"
"160884"	"she"	"concludes"	" But this very debate is the point of Munich. Set in the aftermath of those Israeli deaths, the action follows Avner Kauffman (Eric Bana), a Mossad agent sent to track down and systematically assassinate every last Palestinian involved in the Olympic murders. An early scene shows Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) with her advisers, mulling the need to strike back with equal and opposite outrage. Every civilization, she concludes, must compromise its own principles in times of extraordinary conflict. </P> "	"nyt_eng_200512.gz"

"163427"	"he"	"concludes"	" In one of the essays in Regards, John Gregory Dunne recalls attending a screenwriter's funeral in Beverly Hills, Calif. During the service, his friend Gore Vidal leaned over and asked, Are you working? No, Dunne thinks, he had no intention of using the scene in a book, but yes, it was always there waiting to be retrieved. So, he concludes, the answer to Gore Vidal's question should have been, 'Always.' </P> "	"nyt_eng_200602.gz"
