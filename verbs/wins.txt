POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: THE STATES AND THE ISSUES (bl) By MICHAEL WINES c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service  KANSAS: A Senate Primary Mirrors GOP Split  Kansas Republicans are less than a week away from choosing their nominee for the Senate seat that Bob Dole left in June to run for president. And in its waning days, the contest for the Republican nomination has turned both bitter and exceedingly close.  That became clear Monday, when Sen. Sheila Frahm, the Republican former lieutenant governor who was appointed to seat vacated by Dole, aired what is perhaps the contest's harshest television advertisement against her chief opponent, Rep. Sam Brownback.  The commercial charges that Brownback, one of the Republican freshmen who swore in 1994 to slash a bloated federal government, is really a closet big spender who has written but one bill in two years. And it accuses him of scheming to abolish that most sacred tax break of all, the federal deduction for interest on home mortgages.  Brownback, who spent much of July accusing Ms. Frahm of raising state taxes by $500 million, responded with an advertisement accusing the Frahm campaign of spreading untruths in a final effort to avert defeat.  Ms. Frahm may not lose _ experts call the race a tossup _ but Brownback clearly has gained ground in a race whose significance goes beyond a single Senate seat. The two candidates mirror the ideological divide among Republicans: Brownback, the populist, antiabortion conservative from the rising new right, versus Ms. Frahm, the prochoice moderate in the tradition of Kansas' other retiring senator, Nancy Kassebaum.  Ms. Frahm has the backing of party leaders, including Gov. Bill Graves, who appointed her. Dole tacitly signaled his preference by inviting her to the stage at a rally. And Ms. Kassebaum, probably the state's most-adored public figure, endorsed Ms. Frahm on Tuesday, saying that she normally does not choose sides in primaries but ``these are not normal times.''  Brownback has a fervent antiabortion political network on his side. Kansans for Life, the state's largest antiabortion group, began blanketing the state this week with a telephoned, recorded endorsement of Brownback by William Bennett, the party's purveyor-in-chief of conservative values.  The vote is Aug. 6. The weather could decide the outcome. ``If the turnout's low, he wins. If it's high, she wins,'' said Charles Cook, the Washington-based political seer. ``It's that close.''  PENNSYLVANIA: Convention Role For Casey In Doubt  In building his base for re-election, President Clinton has skidded rightward on issue after issue. So will he allow Bob Casey, the former Pennsylvania governor who most observers say was blocked from speaking at the 1992 Democratic convention because he opposes abortion, address his fellow Democrats in 1996 in Chicago?  ``I wouldn't rule it out,'' said a top Clinton administration official.  Or in, for that matter. In an interview from his home in Scranton, Pa., Casey said an intermediary, whom he declined to name, asked him a week ago to meet with Democratic officials in Washington to discuss a speech. He said he declined because ``it was all very fuzzy and iffy.''  Yet White House officials said they have made no specific overtures to Casey. They have always said that had he not declined to endorse Clinton in 1992, he would have been allowed to speak to the convention.  Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, general chairman of the Democratic Party, clearly dislikes the idea of an invitation to Casey this year..  ``I made a number of calls to him, and I've not heard from him in 18 months,'' Dodd said. ``Now all of a sudden he wants to be heard. It's terribly presumptuous on his part.'' He added: ``There are certain thresholds you've got to meet, and returning phone calls isn't a bad way to start.''  Casey, 64, stands ready if summoned. He said his undelivered speech of four years ago remains ready for delivery. He added that his own brush with death in 1994, when he underwent an extremely rare heart-and-liver transplant, has given him insight into what he called the Democratic ethos of protecting the powerless. Now, he said, all he needs is a good time slot.  ``Sure,'' he said, ``if I had a chance, I'd like to do it. But not at 4 in the morning, or under onerous conditions with respect to content.''  THE SPEAKER: Democrats See Votes Hitting at Gingrich  In Congresses past, Republicans voted regularly against approving the journal of the previous day's legislative session to show disdain for Democratic rule. But now that they run things, why would Republicans continue the practice?  Explanations abound. But gleeful Democrats claim there is but one reason: to record a vote against House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the man some Republicans see as a millstone in a tough election year.  Gingrich's leadership prepares the journal, and it usually is approved by acclamation. But this Congress has held 32 roll-call votes, usually as an excuse to summon members for political business.  Increasingly, a band of Republicans _ most, but not all freshmen _ have opposed the journal. They are led by Rep. Gil Gutknecht of Minnesota, with 20 ``no'' votes; Steve Stockman of Texas, with 16 ``no'' votes; Fred Heineman of North Carolina, with 14; Tom Latham of Iowa and Van Hilleary of Tennessee, with 13 each, and Jim Longley of Maine, with a dozen. All but Latham face difficult campaigns.  The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee claims the freshmen hope to pad their records of opposing Gingrich with meaningless votes. Not so, the freshmen reply.  A spokesman for Heineman said he was ``lodging a protest against partisanship'' by Democrats. Ensign told reporters that he is imitating a Democratic friend who never votes for anything that he has not read.  And an aide to Rep. Mike Flanagan of Illinois, another endangered freshman with seven ``nos'' votes says simple math shows the votes are apolitical. With more than 1,200 House votes so far, he said, Flanagan's ``no'' votes amount to barely half a percent of his total votes in Congress. </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19960731.0644 type=story > <HEADLINE> BANK ACCESS TO WALL STREET MAY WIDEN IN FED PROPOSAL </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> WASHINGTON (BC-FED-BANK-RULES-NYT) </DATELINE> <TEXT> "	"nyt_eng_199607.gz"
