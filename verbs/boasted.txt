"26666"	"he"	"boasted"	" Last year, in an Atlanta suburb, Lawernce D. Kenemore Jr. was busy enlisting people to sell what he said was an employee-benefits program for small businesses.

"26710"	"he"	"boasted"	" Had the administration promised no more, the agreement would represent a complete victory. Had it not placed so much emphasis on ``results-oriented'' commitments, the negotiations might not have dragged on so long, or led to the American sanction threat. The administration won a good agreement with the threat. A wiser tactic would have been to honor its treaty responsibilities and take the Japanese before a trade tribunal to win the same concessions. It might have taken more time, but there is value in having the world's most important trader live by the rules it negotiated. </P> </TEXT> </DOC> <DOC id=NYT_ENG_19950629.0056 type=advis > <DATELINE>  (PM-NYT-BUDGET) </DATELINE> <TEXT> HLW c.1995 N.Y.

By Elaine Sciolino.  YUGOSLAVIA-BOSNIA (Bijeljina, Bosnia-Herzegovina) _ It was a day loaded with meaning for Serbs: the anniversary of the battle in which they were subjugated by the Ottoman Turks 606 years ago, an event that forged their identity as a distinct culture. So the Bosnian Serb leadership had history on their minds as they gathered here Wednesday in Bijeljina for a series of patriotic celebrations. By Stephen Kinzer.

RUSSIA-GROZNY (Grozny) _ Machine-gun fire still rattles loudly at night, but by day, the dull pounding sound that echoes through collapsed buildings and rubble-strewn streets is that of hammers and pneumatic drills as refugees return to Grozny and begin to patch their lives back together. A Foreign Journal by Alessandra Stanley.

Wald.  COMMENTARY  SAFIRE-COLUMN (Washington) _ COMMENTARY: STOP HARASSING PACKWOOD. By William Safire. (To make up for the public revulsion at its forgiveness of the Keating Five, the Senate Ethics Committee was determined to curry feminist favor by ruining the moderate Republican Bob Packwood. Three hundred women who had worked for him in the past quarter century were tracked down and asked to contribute recollections of long-ago trespasses.)  RICH-COLUMN (Undated) _ COMMENTARY: GOP'S SMOKING GUN. By FRANK RICH. (The Republican party has owned law and order as a campaign issue since Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew seized it in 1968 _ just a few years before they went on a crime spree of their own.

INSURANCE-FRAUD-BATTLE _ Last year, in an Atlanta suburb, Lawernce D. Kenemore Jr. was busy enlisting people to sell what he said was an employee-benefits program for small businesses. The program, he boasted, would be free from regulation by oppressive and overreaching state officials. And those eager to be salespeople typically needed to pay only $150 for a half-day training session. The point was lost on federal officials. In April, Kenemore (pronounced KEN-uh-more) and several associates were indicted on charges of conspiracy and money laundering in connection with the benefit plans, which authorities say amounted to a big insurance fraud.

By Edward Wyatt.  ADVISERS-ECONSCENE _ When the president wants economic advice, he can always turn to his National Economic Council, the Office of Management and Budget or the staffs of the Cabinet agencies. So why not jettison the Council of Economic Advisers, a symbol of an era when the intellectual heirs of John Maynard Keynes had the hubris to believe they could smooth the way to permanent prosperity? By Peter Passell.  BIZGLANCE (Undated) _ Major financial stories at a glance.  SPORTS  BKN-ARATON-COLUMN (Toronto) _ Column on the NBA draft. By Harvey Araton.

Howard Finster was in his studio finishing up his 36,892d piece of art, glitter on the floor, pondering life, art, God, and Elvis. ``Elvis appeared to me while I was working in the garden,'' said the self-described ``Man of Visions.''

MIAMI-HOTEL (Miami) _ Listen, all you beautiful people, very young and not so old, there's a new fun place for you to go where the sun is shaded only by the television and magazine camera crews.

By Anne Raver.  COMPUTER-KIDS (Undated) _ If you have children, the chances are good they know as much about personal computers and the latest software as you do, or more. Even if you're the one with the computer and a respectable number of software programs. So you're computer-phobic. Why not admit it? For parents who don't know how to use computers, don't have the time to teach their children or don't know which software is worth buying, a variety of services now offer assistance. By Dulcie Leimbach.  ACCIDENT-PRONE-KIDS (Undated) _ ESSAY: I know there is a health care crisis. I caused it.

If any of my children decide to become a doctor it will be a cakewalk because they've already done their residencies. By James Schembari.  TWO-COMPUTER-FAMILIES (Undated) _ The 1960s brought the two-car garage, the 1980's the two-income family. Evidence is now emerging that the two-computer family is becoming commonplace.

"94129"	"they"	"boasted"	" That mattered not to the exile community that has flourished in Miami and which feeds off its hatred of Castro. The Castro swoon was seen as monumental.
