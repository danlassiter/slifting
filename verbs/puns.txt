"110939"	"he"	"puns"	" The film cogently explains the gambler's dilemma -- how ``the house always wins'' -- as well as how games can be subtly thrown. Even requisite scenes -- a date with Callie, in which he's besieged with bettors seeking tips, and another in which Callie earnestly discusses his future, only to be interrupted with a grating call from his mother -- are given a clever spin.
