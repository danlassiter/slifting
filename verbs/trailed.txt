"30762"	"they"	"trailed"	" Donnels smiled again. He was talking about the third inning. The Red Sox went into it with a 3-0 lead. By the time the awful inning was over, they trailed, 5-3. It wasn't Donnels' fault. He just had the misfortune of making one of the ugliest of Boston's three errors. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199508.gz"
"38836"	"they"	"trailed"	" Everything the Warriors had done wrong the whole night seemed to multiply in that 5-minute, 52-second span _ taking bad shots and missing them, slapping the rebound all over the place until it fell into the Rockets' hands, failing to come up with crucial loose balls, giving up easy baskets at the other end. After hanging in the game despite rotten shooting (39.8 percent for the game), they trailed, 81-79, with 9:36 to go _ and didn't hit another basket until 3:13 remained. By then, the Rockets had blown the game open in every way imaginable. With 5:04 to go they led, 100-80; the    c,12p2 lead eventually reached 21 points. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199511.gz"

"85934"	"they"	"trailed"	" The Warriors' performance last week, however, has triggered speculation about Adelman's future. Before the 110-98 loss to the Clippers, the Warriors had suffered humiliating losses at home to Seattle on Wednesday and Chicago on Friday. They had trailed those games after one quarter by a combined 68-23, and against Chicago they tied a franchise record for fewest points in the first quarter, with eight. At one point against the Bulls, they trailed, 56-17. The twin blowouts raised questions about how an NBA team can come out so woefully unprepared to play two championship contenders on its own court. </P> "	"nyt_eng_199702.gz"
