Caught off guard by the economic downturn, companies have had to eliminate jobs, following the age-old principle of last hired, first fired.

Nossiter's new book reveals that outsiders still have something special to bring in the way of insight to the most troubling years of 20th century French history and the way those years are remembered. Nossiter, a former New York Times reporter, has chronicled an unusual personal encounter with France and the French as they continue to think (or to refuse to think) about such matters as the role of the French police and French officials in the deportation to their deaths of more than 70,000 Jews during the war. Reviewed by Richard Bernstein.  FOOD AND DINING (Moving in ``d'' category)  TUNA-NY (Montauk, N.Y.) _ A few years ago, Japanese buyers lined the docks here and bought all the bluefin they could get: more than 90 percent of the highest-grade tuna was exported.

PASTRY-CREAM (Undated) _ In addition to being able to tie a scarf at least 10 different ways and walk with grace in stilt-high heels along treacherous cobblestone streets, my Parisian friends can whip up a patisserie-perfect fruit tart on a moment's notice or sauce a chocolate mousse with a pouring custard so smooth it could make you weep. I can't fathom the hows of their scarf or heel tricks, but their dessert secrets are easy: Ready-made crusts from the supermarche (often the source for mousse, too) and pastry cream and creme anglaise whipped up in minutes a la maison. By Dorie Greenspan.  With recipes.  SIMPLE-COOKING (Undated) _ The column: Seaweed salad. By Mark Bittman.  With recipe.  VERGE-RESTAURANT (New York) _ His luxuriant white hair has thinned a bit, and his step has slowed. But at 71, Roger Verge, the chef and owner of Le Moulin de Mougins near Cannes, still has his matinee idol charm. And now the man who for two decades reigned as one of France's top chefs is in New York to embark on a new chapter in his career. He has postponed retirement for so long that he finally has a role in a Manhattan restaurant. Next week, Medi, a 300-seat restaurant in Rockefeller Plaza owned by Roberto Ruggeri, president of the Bice chain, will open with a number of Roger Verge dishes on the menu. By Florence Fabricant.  MASTER-CHEF (Undated) _ The column: A summer minestrone that can be used many ways. By Tom Colicchio.  With recipe.  KITCHEN-WARES (Undated) _ In the United States, pepper is the only spice we are accustomed to serving freshly ground. In Europe, it is common to find whole spices, salt and spice blends sold in bottles topped with grinding mechanisms. These products, some imported, some American, are now showing up in stores here. By Denise Landis.  WINE-TALK (Undated) _ The column: About the nearest thing to new that I've come across in recent years is a grape _ and the wine made from it _ called carmenere. There are probably a dozen carmeneres available in the United States at the moment. As a stand-alone varietal, or single-grape wine, it doesn't have the richness and balance of good merlot or the power of cabernet sauvignon. But, grown in warm locations and picked when ripe, it can offer softness and lots of fruit. It can be a robust, uncomplicated wine, tailor-made for what Europeans call le gout Americain, the American palate. By Frank J. Prial.

To perform a Wagner work in Israel was his ``very personal and private'' wish, he said, though the orchestra players were in support. Because he knew that some listeners might object, he informally polled the audience about whether to proceed. There were shouts of protest, but most people, according to press reports, applauded vigorously. After giving those who chose to leave time to do so (reports differ as to how many left, from a few to about 50), he conducted the work without incident and received a warm ovation. </P> 	nyt_eng_200108.gz

In other words, Jews are rootless aliens to Western culture, and even those who master its ways, like Mendelssohn, are predisposed to superficiality. </P> 	nyt_eng_200108.gz

MIDEAST (Jerusalem) _ Rejecting protests from the United States and other countries that it had gone too far, Israel on Wednesday firmly defended its missile strike that killed eight West Bank Palestinians on Tuesday and said it would carry out more such assaults if it felt Israeli lives were at risk. While expressing regret that two small boys were among those who died in a raid on militant Islamic leaders in Nablus, Israel's minister for internal security said that ``under no circumstances is an apology for the attack necessary.'' By Clyde Haberman.  NIRELAND-TALKS (London) _ Britain and Ireland on Wednesday proposed a final, non-negotiable set of measures aimed at obtaining a start to Irish Republican Army disarmament and thereby preventing a breakdown of the power-sharing Northern Ireland Assembly by the middle of August.

HUDSON-DREDGE (Undated) _ The decision by the Environmental Protection Agency's administrator, Christie Whitman, to proceed with an ambitious, expensive and complicated pollution cleanup plan for the Hudson River appears to have settled the great overarching question about the river _ whether to dredge it or not to remove the PCB chemicals on its bottom. But legal experts, environmentalists and politicians all agreed that the devil is now in the details. While the war might be over, they said, the almost inevitable skirmishes ahead, in evaluating how the cleanup might proceed along the way, could be just as fierce. By Kirk Johnson.  SCIENCE  (Will move in ``a'' news file.)  SCI-ARTIFICIAL-HEART (Louisville, Ky.) _ The first recipient of a fully self-contained artificial heart celebrated nearly a month of survival on the pump by eating ice cream and cheesecake, his surgeon said Wednesday. ``We've had tremendous success,'' Dr. Robert Dowling told reporters. ``He's doing remarkably well.'' The patient, described only as a diabetic in his 50s, has a history of heart and liver problems. He was deemed terminally ill before the procedure and had been given only 30 days to live.

Lawmakers in both parties predict Mary Sheila Gall, the president's choice to head the government's Consumer Product Safety Commission, will be rejected when the Senate Commerce Committee votes Thursday.

CIRCUITS (``a'' code)  CIR-DISPOSABLE-PHONES (Undated) _ Most consumers don't think twice about using a disposable pen and throwing it away when it has expired. Soon people may be able to take that carefree approach toward mobile phones. Technological hurdles, high production costs and environmental concerns have long hindered the development of phones that would join disposable pens, razors and cameras in the wastebasket after use. But several companies now say they can overcome the barriers, thanks to new flexible circuit board technology and evolving wireless systems that pair ``smart'' network servers with simple hand-held devices. Those companies are developing disposable wireless phones that they hope to begin selling nationwide early next year. By Sarah Milstein. (1600 words)  With photo.

Wein is in the center of the picture, and everyone is poised in a mixture of bonhomie and anticipation. In a home built by jazz, the photograph is one of the few mementos hinting at the pivotal role Wein has played in jazz during his half-century as a pianist, club owner and festival promoter.

SIQUEIROS-FRESCO (Buenos Aires, Argentina) _ An important piece of Latin America's artistic history lies anonymously in five metal containers exposed to moisture, rust stains and changes of temperature in a storage lot a few miles outside this city. Inside the containers are the pieces of a large fresco study of a nude woman and two children painted by David Alfaro Siqueiros, the Mexican muralist, during an exile of several months in Argentina in 1933. Some art historians have suggested that it represents a gateway to both modern Argentine and Mexican painting. Experts from these countries are afraid that the mural will suffer irreparable damage if it is not removed from the lot and restored soon. But a complicated, nearly decade-long legal battle between a bankrupt company and its creditors, as well as a slow-moving Argentine government, have delayed the work's salvation. By Clifford Krauss.

CONGRESS-ENERGY (Washington) _ The full House is expected to vote on Alaska drilling and fuel efficiency standards, on the way to a final vote on a complete energy package. By Lizette Alvarez.  With a graphic.  MEXICO-U.S.-TRUCKS (Nuevo Laredo, Mexico) _ About 1,500 miles from this border city, on Capitol Hill _ where the Senate is likely to vote Thursday to block the entry of Mexican trucks as laid out in Nafta _ the prevailing wisdom is that millions of unsafe, badly-maintained Mexican trucks are about to invade the United States unless Congress votes to maintain a ban that has kept Mexican truckers from traveling more than a few miles across the border. In fact, American opponents of Mexican trucking have marshaled safety statistics that on close examination seem as threadbare as a bad tire. There appears to be little or no data proving that Mexican long-haul trucks and truckers are far more dangerous than their American counterparts. By Tim Weiner.  With map.  Reefer to CONGRESS-SPEND.  ETHIOPIA-CHURCHES (Lalibela, Ethiopia) _ Awakened to the chill of a wintry dawn in this mist-covered town in the mountains, peasants and priests groped through dark stone-pitted dirt roads on their way to prayer. After climbing to the town's highest hills, they descended into pits carved out of rock, inside which rose stately, 800-year-old churches that were hewn, it is said, by a king laboring during the day and by angels at night. The scene has changed little here through the centuries, unfolding daily as a lasting reminder that this nation in the Horn of Africa was one of the first lands to adopt Christianity, in the 4th century. Hermits sat in tombs carved in reddish walls blanketed with moss glistening from the rains. The faithful, in white robes, moved from church to church, walking through labyrinthine tunnels to reach a house of worship in a cave, clambering up slippery steps into a monolithic one, halting along the way to press their lips against the moist sacred walls. By Norimitsu Onishi. 1,500 words.  With a series of photos, NYT16-24.  SCI-BIOETHICS (Washington) _ As controversies like stem cell research raise questions once reserved for theology, researchers, companies and politicians, including President Bush, are increasingly turning to bioethicists for advice. But now the ethicists themselves are coming under scrutiny. Critics charge that by accepting payment from biotechnology companies, some bioethicists are putting their opinions up for sale. And some leaders in the field say a kind of bioethical cherrypicking is going on, in which scientists and companies are purposely consulting thinkers whose views conform to their own, in order to justify their work rather than give it serious scrutiny.

SAN-FRANCISCO-BLACKS (San Francisco) _ Over the last 10 years, as public housing and low-income projects in the neighborhood have been torn down and rents and house prices climbed to record levels, African Americans have left San Francisco in droves. There are other notable declines among black populations in major cities _ Washington D.C., for example. But African Americans are leaving this city like no other. Census figures show a decline in San Francisco of 15 percent from 1990 to 2000, leaving the city with a black population of 8.6 percent. By Evelyn Nieves.  With a photo and a graphic.

The reading was arranged after Nichols had called George C. Wolfe, the producer of the Public Theater, to ask if he would produce the play. ``Absolutely,'' Wolfe remembers saying. Among the actors at the reading were Kline and Portman. The younger actress had met Nichols at a dinner party given for him by the clothing designer Diane Von Furstenberg, during the Broadway run of ``The Diary of Anne Frank,'' in which Portman played Anne. Von Furstenberg, she said, ``invited me to her house, in Mike's honor, and seated me next to him.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200108.gz

Instead, he said he would, if elected, convene a housing summit right away, ``and have around it all the best, smartest, for-profit and not-for-profit builders, labor and management people, contracting people, churches that put up housing, poverty advocates to figure out where the revenue will come from and what the right mix of low- and middle-income housing is.'' </P> 	nyt_eng_200108.gz

HOME-PRICES (New York) -- In the hottest housing markets, owners whose homes have skyrocketed in value find themselves in a frustrating paradox. They were supposed to be the lucky ones: They bought in frenzied real estate markets like New York and Los Angeles three or more years ago and have amassed hundreds of thousands of dollars on paper. But as they try to roll that considerable equity into a bigger home, many are unpleasantly surprised to find that the cost of real estate at the higher end has outpaced their ability to buy. By Mokoto Rich.  LIPPMAN-NOVEL (Baltimore,. Md.) -- The story of writer Laura Lippman and the friendship she shared, lost and then redeemed with Nancy Goldman, which was the inspiration for her 10th novel, To the Power of Three, a murder mystery. By Jane Gross.  FUTURO-HOMES (Undated) -- Richard Pisani caught his first glimpse of a Futuro house in Illinois in the early 1980s, outlined against the setting sun. I was just out cruising and there it was in some subdivision, Pisani said, like a prop from a sci fi movie. For the next 15 years, he saw the house often, and could not get it out of his mind. Finally, in 1997, he bought it, paying a tenth of the $20,000 asking price and moving it, with a flatbed truck, to the yard behind his house in nearby Danvers, where he turned it into a media room. In the process, he became part of a growing network of Futuro owners and fans who are dedicated to preserving a utopian model of housing that looks like it came not just from an earlier decade, from another planet. By Phil Patton.  GOTHIC-HOUSE (Undated) -- Grant Wood's American Gothic is the most recognizable painting in the history of American art, which should make the modest Carpenter Gothic structure in the background the art world's most famous house. But in the mind's eye the house fades, dwarfed by the stern faces of the pitchfork-wielding farmer and his inscrutable daughter (who is often mistaken for his wife). Now, just in time for the painting's 75th birthday, two new biographies of the painting reveal that it was the house, not the people, that inspired a visual triangle so compelling that it brought a previously unknown artist instant fame and then went on to serve the purposes of art, commerce and parody over and over again. By Kate Bolick.  GARDENING-LIFE (Glen Echo, Md.) -- Holly Shimizu, the executive director of the U.S. Botanic Garden in Washington, loves the 6-foot bronze fennel that lounges like a shaggy dog against the white picket fence bordering her front yard here. It's one of those plants that her husband, Osamu, a garden designer who first learned to wield a pair of pruners in his native Japan, maintains is too messy. I'm going to chop it down! he told his wife. No, you can't, she replied. It's blooming. It's beautiful. It will make delicious seeds. Holly Shimizu was excited to see papaw seedlings coming up around the mother tree in their shady backyard. I must destroy them, Osamu Shimizu said in early July, glaring at the baby plants. No, no, you can't! his wife said. So it has gone for more than 25 years, ever since these two gardeners first met in Paris. By Anne Raver.  GARDEN-Q&amp;A (Undagted) -- Garden questions answered.
